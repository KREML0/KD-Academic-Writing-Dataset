1	2978	2	2	Certain materials, including books, music, and magazines, should not be removed from libraries. These materials offer people an opportunity to understand the real world. Most books and music can show readers and listeners the negative aspects described in them, enabling them to avoid similar situations. People should at least give every type of music a try instead of always doubting based on others' opinions. For instance, many people think the band @PERSON1 A.M. is bad because its lyrics mention drugs and contain cursing. However, the band is actually sharing a man's journey from being a drug - addict to living an excellent life, yet people never gave its music a chance. Another example is @PERSON1's book, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', which depicts drug addicts, homeless people, and those with physical disabilities, highlighting their beauty. This book has broadened my perspective on people, showing that appearance and speech do not define a person's worth. Movies and magazines in libraries should also not be removed for the same reasons as books and music. We often see movie previews and assume they are not good, but libraries should not exclude them. Movies are a great way to learn how to interact with others, and magazines can help people understand what not to do and the consequences of certain actions. Knowing this information from a magazine could potentially save lives. I fail to understand why some libraries would ban certain materials that can help people understand others' lives and avoid making the same mistakes.
2	2979	2	2	"I firmly believe that libraries should not engage in censorship. People have diverse views on what is appropriate and what is not. For example, I've heard many people say, ""Don't read that book; it's bad."" But I always wonder, how can we label a book as bad without even giving it a chance? There are indeed some offensive books, music, movies, and magazines out there. However, if we try to remove all offensive materials from libraries, there will be nothing left on the shelves. As Katherine Paterson said, ""If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" This statement makes a valid point. Just because some people find a book offensive doesn't mean it should be removed. We should ask ourselves, ""How do we know it's a bad book when we haven't even given it a chance?"" We shouldn't judge a book based on hearsay. Instead, we should form our own opinions. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a wide range of materials to allow people to explore and form their own perspectives."
3	2980	2	2	In today's world, many things are considered offensive, and everyone has their own criteria for what is offensive. Some parents are worried that their children are exposed to inappropriate content in libraries, while others feel that library materials offend their culture or way of life. Some people even advocate for library censorship, but this is a wrong approach. People are entitled to their opinions, but when it comes to offensive content, there's not much that can be done. The world is a public place, and we may encounter offensive things everywhere. The library is a place for study, not to offend anyone. It is simply a source of information. If someone is offended by what they see in the library, they should choose not to visit. I have visited the library numerous times and have never witnessed anything offensive. Everything there is for learning and research. Libraries have different sections. If parents are concerned about their children, they can keep them in the children's section, which is carefully curated and does not contain offensive materials. Library owners know what will upset people and take precautions accordingly. Moreover, removing materials based on complaints can limit others' access to the information they need. One person's offensive material may be another person's valuable resource. The library is like a vast computer where one can find a wide range of information. Censoring library materials is as difficult as censoring the internet. Everyone will be offended at some point in their lives. If libraries removed all potentially offensive materials, they would have no content left. People should be less sensitive and understand that libraries are not meant to harm. There is no need for censorship in libraries as they are simply a means to educate and allow people to enjoy various forms of media.
4	2981	2	2	In life, we encounter offensive things that can be really annoying. However, these experiences can make us stronger. Sometimes books, magazines, music, and movies may offend us, but it's often because the content reflects our personality or life. It's not the authors' fault; they write based on their feelings and the truth. Libraries are filled with a variety of materials. We can't just remove books from the shelves because they offend us. Other people may like the books we dislike, and there are plenty of other options to choose from. Removing offensive materials from libraries can harm the writers and publishers. They invest a lot of money in producing books, magazines, and movies, and libraries are important sales channels. If libraries stop stocking these materials, they will lose a significant amount of money. Most offensive materials can open our eyes to the real world. Books and newspapers tell the truth about different subjects. Writers aim to help us, not hurt us. The world should be more open - minded. I've had the experience of reading books that initially offended me. I would get angry and put the book down. But later, I realized that the offensive parts actually helped me gain a new understanding and change my views. Some people may find this essay offensive, but we need to be open to different ideas. Being offended is often over - used as a term. We should stop being so self - centered and get over it. Life is too short to be constantly worried about being offended. All books, magazines, movies, and music in libraries should be left alone. These materials reflect different people's lives and can help others. If a particular item offends you, just choose another one. Removing materials from libraries will only cause more damage.
5	2982	2	2	"There is a debate on whether libraries should remove certain materials. People hold different views on what is good and bad. I've read many books in my life, and I often hear people warning me against reading certain ones, claiming they are bad. But I question how we can know a book is bad without even reading it. There are indeed some offensive books, music, movies, and magazines. However, if we were to remove all offensive materials from libraries, there would be hardly anything left. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if everyone has the right to remove the materials they dislike, then there will be no materials left for anyone. Just because some people find a book offensive doesn't mean it should be removed from the library. We should ask ourselves, ""How can we judge a book without giving it a chance?"" We shouldn't rely on others' opinions but form our own. In conclusion, libraries should provide a wide range of materials to allow people to explore and make their own judgments."
6	2983	2	2	In today's libraries, a significant number of @CAPS3 are subject to censorship due to the content in books, music, movies, and magazines. I firmly believe that this issue can be resolved by implementing specific sections, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and considering my views on the censorship of @CAPS3.  I understand that certain materials, such as books, may offend some individuals while leaving others unaffected. Therefore, I propose that libraries create a dedicated room for content that might be considered offensive. Clear signage should indicate the nature of the content, allowing individuals to avoid the room if they choose. Additionally, separate rooms for children should be established, stocked exclusively with children's books, movies, music, and magazines. This approach ensures that children are not exposed to inappropriate content.  Regarding access to the 'bad content' room, I suggest that a minimum @CAPS1 requirement be set. It is unreasonable to expect library staff or parents to allow a five - year - old to check out a book dealing with sex, drugs, and alcohol, as this could lead to significant trouble for the library. A @CAPS1 of @NUM1 years seems like a fair threshold, as individuals at this age are more likely to handle the content appropriately.  Personally, I am not easily offended and enjoy reading a wide range of materials. As previously mentioned, moving potentially offensive content to a separate room prevents accidental exposure. While I am comfortable with such content, I recognize that others may not be.  In conclusion, the implementation of separate rooms, @CAPS1 limits, and consideration of my views are all practical solutions. I sincerely hope that libraries will take my suggestions into account, as I believe they will effectively address the issue of censorship.
7	2984	2	2	I can't help but wonder how you'd feel if your favorite book was removed from the shelves of your school or public library. Alongside numerous other students, I find this prospect deeply discouraging and disastrous. In my opinion, censorship should not impact the books available on library shelves. Allowing censorship could lead to a decline in the love of reading, a suppression of individuality, and a divided society.  Take the beloved @PERSON2 @PERSON2 series by @PERSON1 as an example. Many books and series are being removed from library collections because some people in society find them offensive. In this case, the world of witchcraft in the series goes against certain religious beliefs, prompting some religious individuals to campaign for a ban. Fortunately, the libraries I visit have not banned this series, and it has kindled my passion for literature. Books have the power to draw students into the world of reading, and removing those that are likely to spark interest or creativity will not only affect the current generation but also future ones.  If censorship were permitted, it's unclear where it would end. Who would decide which books should be banned? It could all come down to power and who is willing to seize it. This struggle for control has the potential to divide people, much like political parties. Disagreements could escalate into debates and then into fights. People are often stubborn about their beliefs, and it's wrong for someone to dictate what everyone can believe. For instance, it would be like an @CAPS1 forcing a @CAPS2 not to believe in @CAPS3, a vegetarian banning meat consumption, or a woman taking away men's voting rights. Censorship leads to disrespect for others' opinions, and disrespect is never beneficial.  In conclusion, censorship is a disservice to individuality, personal beliefs, and the joy of reading. Just because one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean it should be forbidden. Everyone has the right to choose what they read, and censorship should not be allowed to infringe on that right. So, how would you feel if your favorite book disappeared from libraries? I'd feel disrespected, and I'm sure many others would too.
8	2985	2	2	Have you ever thought about whether materials should be removed from library shelves just because someone finds them offensive? Let's take a moment to explore this topic.  You might be wondering what I think about removing materials from the shelves of local or school libraries. Well, my answer is a bit of both yes and no. For example, there are probably old and outdated books in my school library that haven't been touched in ages.  However, just because some people find a book offensive doesn't mean it won't become the most popular one in the library. The person who likes the book might feel offended by those who want to remove it. You know, there are always people who like to complain no matter where you go.  Let me share an incident I witnessed at a library. There were two guys. One was complaining that the farm books were never touched. Then the other guy walked up with two farm books. The librarian was listening to their discussion. I was standing about five feet away from the counter. Then the guy who wanted to remove the farm books asked about spaceship books, and the other guy said the farm books should be removed because no one had been in that section for years.  This shows that materials in the library should generally stay where they are. Libraries acquire books and other resources for a reason. You never know when someone might come in looking for that particular book, magazine, movie, or need to use the computer.  Now, I know you might be tired of hearing why I think materials shouldn't be removed. So, let me tell you why they should. The main reason is if the item is severely damaged. I once visited a library where a book had its back cover completely torn off. It's not good to have such damaged items on the shelves as it makes the library look unkempt. Another reason is if the book promotes something harmful, like drugs.  In conclusion, while there are some valid reasons to remove materials from library shelves, most of the time, they should remain. You'll always have people complaining, but we should consider the potential value these items can have for someone.
9	2986	2	2	The idea of removing 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable to some extent. Some people believe that such material is inappropriate for anyone to view. However, I firmly believe that books deemed offensive should not be removed from library shelves because our definitions of 'offensive' vary widely.  If libraries implemented a policy of removing offensive materials, there would be very few books left. 'Offensive' is a relative term. What one person finds offensive, another may not. Everyone forms opinions based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books contain content that people disagree with, but this is an expression of freedom of speech. As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone complained about offensive books and movies, there would hardly be anything left in libraries.  The purpose of a library is to serve as a resource for its visitors. Censoring sources would make it difficult for people to access information. Sometimes, reading opposing views can be beneficial as it broadens our knowledge and allows us to see things from different perspectives.  That being said, some materials may not be suitable for certain individuals, such as young children. In such cases, rather than removing these materials from the shelves, they should be placed in an area that children cannot access.  In my opinion, the idea of removing books, music, movies, or magazines from library shelves because they are considered offensive is ridiculous. It restricts free expression. People have diverse opinions on what is offensive, and it would be a dull world if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something offensive, they should simply choose not to view it.
10	2987	2	2	Every author writes with a purpose, whether it's to educate, entertain, or persuade an audience. No author hopes that their work will gather dust on the library shelf. Since authors aim to express themselves through their writing, I firmly believe that we should respect their right to be heard. Libraries should not remove books, music, movies, or magazines from the shelves just because they are deemed offensive.  It's normal for everyone to come across a book they don't like. But just because you don't like a book doesn't mean no one else will. Authors write for a specific audience, and you may not be part of that group. So, a book might not appeal to you and could even seem offensive. People have different beliefs and perspectives on issues.  Let's say you're reading a book about a young girl facing numerous problems in her life. The situations she encounters are so terrible that you wouldn't want anyone else to read about them. But have you considered that there might be another girl who has gone through similar experiences? This girl might visit the library, find the book, and discover guidance and support in it. She might feel like she has a friend in the book who can help her through difficult times. Would you really want to take that book off the shelf and deny her this opportunity?  These kinds of situations happen all the time. People often find something special in what they read that others may not appreciate. When a librarian removes a book from the shelf, a valuable opportunity is lost forever. We all have the right to learn, explore new ideas, and expand our minds, and no one should be able to take that away.
11	2988	2	2	Have you ever encountered magazines, books, or movies that you found offensive? What were your experiences? Here is my take on whether such books should be removed. I've noticed that some movies can be offensive to certain individuals. For instance, the @CAPS1 movies and books are about @CAPS2, and some people either don't believe in such concepts or simply dislike the movie. I somewhat see no point in creating a movie about something that isn't real. However, some movies are suitable for certain age groups. Movies rated '@CAPS3' are not appropriate for young viewers, like kids under a certain age. Magazines also contain content that I find offensive. I can't recall the specific names, but they have sections that speak negatively about others, such as a child talking about the president. So, I think some magazines should be taken off the shelves. As for books, I don't see a strong reason to remove them. They don't seem as offensive as they are graphical. There might be some books that could be offensive to people, like those that discuss a poor family or speak ill of them. For example, you might pick up a book and discover it's talking about things you'd rather not know. As you can see, I've formed an opinion on whether to keep books, magazines, or movies on the shelves. But I also understand the other side. Some of us enjoy such movies, books, or magazines and find them cool or interesting.
12	2989	2	2	In my view, libraries, movie stores, and similar establishments should not sell items that are offensive to the public. I believe such materials offend a large number of people. Vulnerable citizens, including senior citizens and children, should not be exposed to inappropriate content. I think there should be an age restriction of at least eighteen years for purchasing or renting certain books, music, movies, or magazines. The economy is already in a poor state. The current generation of children should not have to look back on their childhoods with memories of offensive movies, books, or magazines. I believe music has the greatest influence on a person. Constant exposure to foul language in music can have a lasting impact on one's mind. I speak from personal experience. Movies also have a significant influence. For example, a child who watches a violent movie might think it's okay to kill because the characters in the movie got away with it. This is just one example of how a person's mindset can change. In conclusion, I believe humans have the right to consume the media they choose. However, I think there should be age restrictions for certain materials. Additionally, any items that citizens find offensive should be placed in a separate area in stores or libraries so that only those who want them can access them without others being exposed to offensive content.
13	2990	2	2	A library is a place for reading, writing, and relaxation. Nowadays, many people overlook the vast knowledge available there. Unfortunately, censorship is reducing the variety of reading materials. Censorship can eliminate many types of books that people can learn from and enjoy. First, removing classic books from library shelves because they @MONTH1 offend some people is unjustified. If a book offends you, simply don't read it. It's that simple. Many books are controversial because they go against people's morals or beliefs. The @PERSON2 series is a prime example. It's a bestselling series with over a million copies sold worldwide, but it doesn't align with many people's beliefs, so they boycott it. I remember several years ago, I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the release of the next book in the series. While I was there, a huge storm was brewing. Most people would think it was just a storm, but the locals who disliked the @PERSON2 books blamed the party. They claimed we were worshipping the devil and that @CAPS4 sent the storm to punish us. I understand that many people dislike the @PERSON2 series because of its witchcraft and wizardry themes, but blaming natural phenomena on a book is absurd. Even great novels like @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 should not be banned due to their content. For a time, it was used as school reading material, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it features a crazy person. Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards. As Katherine Paterson said, if we ban books we don't agree with, eventually there won't be any left in the library. However, there could be a compromise. If books with questionable content had a warning sticker, it could satisfy both sides. In conclusion, removing books is a bad idea because they are so beneficial, especially for children. When I was young, I loved being read to and continued to read as I grew older. In middle school, I always had a book with me. Books allow readers to explore new worlds and understand different perspectives. Why take this magic away from children?
14	2991	2	2	Whether materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves is a complex issue. I believe it should be a decision made by a vote of the citizens. Some materials that I find offensive should be removed, but it can be difficult if others like them. I don't approve of violent music that can have a negative influence on teenagers, leading some to engage in criminal activities like drug - selling. However, I can't do much because this type of music is popular among teenagers and some adults. If more people recognize the harm it can cause, there's a chance it can be stopped. Stopping such harmful materials can save a community from problems and create better opportunities for those in need. Take the music artist @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as an example. She has released some great songs in the past year and a half. I've been told she's part of a group called @CAPS3, which aims to're - birth' themselves. My friends wanted me to stop listening to her music. I told them that while I don't like her joining the group, I won't stop listening unless she releases an offensive song. In short, if someone finds something highly offensive but others don't, it's very difficult to make a case for its removal without the support of others.
15	2992	2	2	When it comes to library censorship, I don't think library staff should be the sole decision - makers on what goes on the shelves. The community members should have a say since they are the ones who use the library. I believe everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think certain materials should be removed. For example, some music can be offensive. I'm not suggesting that all music be removed from libraries, but offensive music should be taken out. In conclusion, a more inclusive approach that involves the community in deciding on library materials can ensure that the collection meets the diverse needs and sensibilities of the users while also maintaining a standard of appropriate content.
16	2993	2	2	Dear Newspaper, consider how you would feel if someone penned a book highlighting how bad newspapers are, tearing them down to the point that no one would touch another one. Reflect on whether offensive materials should be accessible to thousands of readers. I firmly believe that offensive materials like books, music, and movies should not only be removed from library shelves but should never have been placed there in the first place.  Imagine a sexist book falling into the hands of an innocent child who can just read it. That child might end up adopting the kind of life portrayed in the book. As a parent, I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they can distinguish right from wrong and make clear judgments.  From another perspective, suppose a book depicting black people as bad and nasty falls into the hands of a drunken, old - fashioned man who believes in continuing slavery. This book could stimulate his thoughts, leading him to act on them. He might confront a young black woman with the book's content, then rape and beat her, and force her into a life of servitude. Only the victim knows the extent of her pain and how long she will endure it before giving up the fight for her life.  All these scenarios stemmed from that single offensive book, targeting sexists and black people. These are compelling reasons to ban such books from libraries or at least keep them firmly on the shelves.
17	2994	2	2	Many students in school have likely encountered books or magazines containing profanity or offensive content. Some find this kind of thing amusing, but it genuinely bothers others. Racial slurs and profanity can disappoint and offend people. Parents often don't want their children exposed to such language. I firmly believe that offensive materials should be removed from library shelves, and others should share this view.  Regarding movies and music, if they offend someone, the creators should either change the lyrics or discard the work. A good song or great movie should not rely on offending others. One should not create content that mocks a race or depicts violence against them.  In school libraries, the appropriateness of materials depends on the age group. Elementary and middle - school students are not mature enough to encounter offensive or profane content in books or magazines. If a parent disapproves of the content in a book their child is reading at school, they should have the right to object and, if necessary, have the book removed from the school.  Even high - school students can be offended by the books they read. For example, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', while a well - regarded book, contains racial slurs that can make black students uncomfortable when fellow students or teachers use them. Schools and libraries should not force students to read books that make them uncomfortable.  Personally, I'll have to read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' next year, and I'm not looking forward to it. Being half - black, I find such language offensive, and it will be an awkward experience. I also have friends who felt uncomfortable reading the book.  There are also children's books that parents want removed from school libraries. 'Harry Potter' is the most challenged book in school libraries. Some parents don't want their kids exposed to witchcraft and wizards. If parents object, these books should be removed.  In conclusion, if a significant number of people complain about a movie, song, book, or magazine, there should be no debate. The offensive material should simply be removed. In schools, if enough students or parents complain, the librarian or school should take action and get rid of the offensive item.
18	2995	2	2	The question of whether certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves due to being offensive is a complex one. In my view, there are two strong reasons why they should not be removed.  Firstly, people choose these items themselves. No one would intentionally pick up a book, magazine, or choose to watch a movie or listen to music that appears offensive. Most individuals do not take being offended lightly. For instance, why would someone purchase an item that does not appeal to them?  Secondly, when people visit the library, they are seeking interesting books, music, movies, or magazines that match their taste. If an item seems offensive, it is usually obvious from its appearance, theme, or sound. In such cases, people can simply avoid it.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves. When people select items at the library or go there with the intention of finding something enjoyable, they are capable of recognizing offensive content and making their own choices.
19	2996	2	2	If those who publish and write articles in magazines or books find the content offensive, they have a valid point. There are individuals, often referred to as 'troublemakers', who can easily start a commotion over certain issues. That's why, before purchasing a magazine or book, I always take a look inside. If I'm not interested in the content, I won't buy it. It's as simple as that.  If the content is offensive, it should be immediately removed from newsstands in locations such as [LOCATION1], [LOCATION6], [LOCATION12], [LOCATION4], [LOCATION2], [LOCATION5], [LOCATION8], [LOCATION9], [LOCATION3], [LOCATION10], [ORGANIZATION1], [ORGANIZATION2], or even in [LOCATION11] and [LOCATION7]. In short, offensive materials have no place on public newsstands.
20	2997	2	2	I firmly believe that all offensive books, music, magazines, and movies should be removed from libraries. These materials are generally unwanted, and if a child accesses them, the inappropriate content can have a negative impact. If a young child picks up a book with bad content and the library allows it, the library is at fault. Parents may be left wondering where their children learned bad phrases from if they are unaware that their kids have read such books.  There are many aspects in books that parents don't want their children to read. For example, books discussing sex and using inappropriate language are unacceptable. As a parent, I will ensure my children do not encounter such content as they grow up.  Similarly, there is music that parents don't want their kids to listen to. Sex - themed songs, whether explicit or implied, are not suitable for children. I want my children to be responsible and avoid listening to such terrible music.  Movies can also be a concern. Many recent movies contain inappropriate content related to sex. I don't want my children exposed to such movies.  Magazines are another area of concern. They can contain pornographic content, which is extremely harmful to children. I strongly oppose children being tempted or forced to view such content. In general, we should eliminate porn and disgusting pictures from magazines.  In conclusion, to protect children from harmful and inappropriate content, offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries.
21	2998	2	2	Dear members of the news media, I am writing to express my view on what people should do regarding books. In my opinion, it is acceptable for individuals to write whatever they wish, as we live in a free country where one can engage in any activity they deem appropriate. People have the freedom to write books with various themes, including drugs, sex, abuse, and inappropriate language. I believe it is fine for them to write as they please and place their works on the shelves. It is the responsibility of the person selecting a book to decide whether to read it. If they do not like the content of a book, they should not make a fuss and cause problems. Instead, they can simply put the book down and choose another one. I do not think it is fair for people to overreact to a book they are not obliged to read. I am certain that many others would agree with this perspective. If I were opposed to content such as sex and drugs and encountered it in a book, I would simply set the book aside and look for one that aligns with my values, rather than creating a disturbance like some others do. In my view, it is a waste of time to complain about something so trivial. To sum up, I believe that those who dislike the way a book is written should put it down and not worry about it. They can purchase a book that they find more suitable for reading. There is no point in wasting time and causing unnecessary problems. This is my opinion on the matter, and I hope others share it.
22	2999	2	2	I believe that books, magazines, papers, and other materials should not be removed from libraries simply because some individuals enjoy engaging with them. Some people find that reading books about their problems can help them overcome the challenges they face. These individuals often express feelings of stress and depression. They can access relevant books and engage with the content to find solutions to their issues. If certain materials are considered offensive, those who hold this view should refrain from obtaining them. They do not have the authority to dictate what books are available in the library. Many people have problems, and some of the books in the library can offer assistance. A large number of people I know do not consider most books to be offensive. It is a matter of personal preference whether they want to engage with the materials or not. If someone believes that a book or other material is offensive, they will have to accept it. People have diverse reading preferences, with some enjoying a wide range of books and others having little interest in reading. Those who like to read can choose any book they feel comfortable with. If they find a book offensive, they can move on and select a different one. I suppose that if someone comes across an offensive book, they could consult a teacher or another appropriate person, but I am confident that nothing will be done about it. The books and other materials are in the library for a purpose: to allow people to engage with them and gain an understanding of life and how to address their problems. One cannot control the selection of books in the library. It is not possible to determine which books should or should not be on the shelves. In conclusion, I believe that people should accept the situation as they have no control over it.
23	3000	2	2	Hello, my name is @CAPS1. I firmly believe that libraries should offer a wide range of media genres. If a place is called a “media center,” then there should be no censorship of media. People are aware of the importance of reading the back of a book to determine if it suits their interests. If they come across something they do not like, they can easily put the book back on the shelf. There is a claim that The @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 inspired @CAPS4 @PERSON2 to kill @PERSON1, but this is purely speculative and based on hearsay. I think there should be sections in the library dedicated to different age groups. However, censoring literature is unjust. Parents should supervise children aged @NUM1 and younger to ensure they are not exposed to content they are not ready for. There are certain magazines and movies that I believe do not belong in libraries, such as pornography, non - educational movies, @CAPS6 @CAPS7, and social networks. I am not advocating for allowing children to listen to violent music or engage in dangerous behavior. However, there should be some flexibility when it comes to books. This is an approved message. Thank you for your time. Goodbye.
24	3001	2	2	The idea of removing books from library shelves raises important questions. As @PERSON1 said, “All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.” We must consider whether it is appropriate for young children to view inappropriate images or read about sexual content. I do not think these materials should be removed from the library altogether. Instead, they should be placed in a private area accessible only to adults. I advocate for segregating such materials from children because children can form ideas from what they see and may think it is acceptable to behave in certain ways. For example, some books and movies about serial killers can give children the wrong impression. They may think it is okay to bring guns to school, which is clearly unacceptable. Children often imitate their favorite characters in books or movies. Some movies feature characters engaging in foolish behavior, and children and teenagers may think it is “cool” because they admire the actors. This can lead to children getting hurt. When children see sexual content, they may think it is acceptable to engage in such behavior because the characters in the movies are their age. Movie producers should be more aware of the content they create for children. Take the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It is generally regarded as a great book, but would anyone expect it to be removed from the shelves because of a single word? I believe it should remain on the shelves. If parents do not want their children to read it, they can simply inform the teacher or the child. In conclusion, books should generally stay on the shelves, and any material with inappropriate content should be placed in a private section for adults. We need to protect children from getting bad ideas from books, movies, magazines, and music.
25	3002	2	2	I think that almost every movie has the potential to offend someone. If one wishes to remove every potentially offensive movie from the shelves, they are welcome to do so. However, people have diverse tastes in movies, music, books, and other forms of media. If a piece of music is offensive, one should simply avoid listening to it. Similarly, if a book is offensive, one should not read it. It is that straightforward. Therefore, I do not believe that books, music, movies, and other media should be removed just because they might offend someone. Here are my reasons. If all materials that might interest people today were removed, there would be little to entertain children and keep them from getting into trouble. I believe that every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever they desire. If they find something offensive, they can simply avoid it. Everyone is offended in different ways, so we cannot prevent every potential offense. Giving a child the opportunity to read a book can have a positive impact. If they find the content offensive, it might actually deter them from engaging in certain behaviors. For example, by watching the movies they want, children can learn that not everyone is a “good person.” Children have a wide range of reading preferences, from Dr. Seuss books to works like @PERSON1 '@CAPS2'. They should be able to choose what they read, listen to, or watch. The only drawback I see with some magazines is that they often feature half - naked men or women. Children from @ORGANIZATION1 years through the first year of @ORGANIZATION2 should not be exposed to such content. Another reason is that people have different tastes in media. As long as the material does not offend them, they should be able to read what they want. What one person reads should not affect others unless they are also reading the same thing. There are many people who get offended by the smallest things, but they need to realize that this is part of life. In conclusion, I believe that people should have the freedom to read what they want, even if others find the books offensive. Offensive materials should not be removed from the shelves. I also think that if children are exposed to potentially offensive content, they can learn that life is not always easy and that they will encounter offensive things. People should not have to give up reading, listening to, or watching things that interest them.
26	3003	2	2	The world is filled with offensive material, and there is little we can do about it. The books we leave behind shape the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from library shelves because they are part of a vast body of knowledge, and the library is not the only place people will seek such content. Logically, the more knowledge a person has, the more power they possess. However, this does not mean that certain types of music or movies are appropriate for all ages. Some parents are highly offended when they encounter slightly inappropriate content, but it's important to remember that children will inevitably come across such things; it's a part of growing up. The previous paragraph suggested that people should have access to a large amount of information because no one is perfect, and everyone has curiosity. For instance, subjects like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and can be considered dangerous. In @ORGANIZATION1, students learn about atoms and predict their chemical reactions. In the lab, they must wear safety equipment due to the hazardous environment. Similarly, in @CAPS1, students learn about healthy living, which includes studying the human body, such as the reproductive systems. Through these subjects, we learn how the world works, including potentially dangerous information. Every action has positive and negative consequences. I propose that we need to find a healthy balance between what is truly necessary and what is purely for entertainment, and remove the latter. If a material has a purpose, it has a place, but if it's a magazine about drama, it seems rather useless. In this vast world, there will always be people or materials that have a negative influence. However, this is a matter of perception, as everyone has different tolerances and values. When dealing with this ongoing issue, we should make judgments based on our values to the best of our ability.
27	3004	2	2	People are entitled to their own opinions. What one person finds offensive, another may not. Libraries should be able to stock any material that might interest or educate someone, regardless of whether it offends some people. If we were to follow everyone's objections, library shelves would be empty. People tend to find fault with everything, which is just human nature. I've read non - fiction books and watched movies based on true stories that use language some might find offensive. But how can people express their feelings and educate others without causing offense? How can we teach history without telling the whole story? Slavery and the events related to @PERSON1 were terrible, and it's crucial to teach about them to prevent similar atrocities from happening again. However, it's difficult to teach about these events without offending someone. I believe these materials should be placed on library shelves. If people don't like them, they can simply choose not to borrow or view them. That's my opinion. What's yours?
28	3005	2	2	In my view, if people find a book offensive, they shouldn't read it in the first place. If all offensive books were removed from shelves, the shelves would be empty, leaving nothing for people to read. Some of the greatest authors use offensive language in their works. Removing these books would mean getting rid of some of the best literary materials. For example, @PERSON1's @CAPS1 in the book '@CAPS2' contains content that is offensive to the gay community, and a character gets killed. In conclusion, removing books based on offensiveness is not a good idea as it would deprive readers of valuable literature.
29	3006	2	2	"I find it truly amazing that a book is not just a collection of words or a series of events; it's an adventure and a story that can travel from one person to another across countries. A writer from one nation can pen a book, and a reader from another can enjoy it. Inspiring stories in books, music, and movies can reach from one person to another, and I firmly believe that such things help shape us into who we are today. In my opinion, there are several problems with today's entertainment. It often includes a lot of violence and intimacy, which may not be suitable for some people. I don't think these forms of entertainment should be removed from the shelves. Instead, they should be rated so that everyone knows what to expect. Movies are rated because some people don't want to see certain content. While some of it is inappropriate, other parts can guide us. It's like they prepare us for the worst while hoping for the best. By seeing what happens to characters in these forms of entertainment, we can avoid making the same mistakes. Moreover, many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and pursue our dreams. When we see someone achieving their goals, we think, ""Why can't I?"" Without the encouragement and push from entertainment, where would we be in the world? Entertainment presents the concept of reaching for our dreams while also showing the reality. Even if these things contain offensive or harsh content, they still help us prepare for and deal with everyday life."
30	3007	2	2	I don't think certain books, music, magazines, or movies should be removed from the shelves. If they are found offensive, that's not my problem. If they offend me, it's my issue to handle. Sooner or later, society will rediscover these items, and they will return to the shelves, no matter how offensive they are. Curiosity will bring them back. Just because one person or a group of people finds a book offensive doesn't mean it should be removed. It's a problem those individuals or the group will have to accept. Everything can be educational in its own way. Even offensive material can teach us the difference between right and wrong. So, is it right or wrong to want offensive items removed from the shelves? It depends on a person's personal views and beliefs. The fact is, there will always be something offensive to someone, and there's nothing we can do to change that. It's sad but true. It's easier to live with it. Maybe what you find offensive wasn't meant to be that way. It depends on what you're sensitive to. The writer, director, or composer may or may not have intended for something to be offensive. It all comes down to how you interpret their work. In conclusion, nothing should be removed from the shelves. If one thing is removed, then we might as well remove everything.
31	3008	2	2	I firmly believe that no book, movie, magazine, music, or other such medium should be removed from circulation simply because someone finds it offensive. If we start removing works based on offense, there would be nothing left on the shelves. Often, the most impactful works are those that push boundaries and express genuine beliefs.  I recall when I was twelve, the news reported that a school was removing a book from its library because it offended one student. Shockingly, nearly the entire school, including teachers, was reading the book. The school board seemed unconcerned about the majority's interest. I think this was a completely wrong - handed situation. They should have talked to the girl and explained that it's unfair to demand the removal when so many others are enjoying it. If it offended her, she could have simply chosen not to read it.  Music is a vital outlet for people to express their emotions in remarkable ways. Without music, the world would be a much duller place. People listen to music in all emotional states, whether sad, angry, or confused. If someone finds a particular type of music offensive, they can just switch to something else.  Movies almost always contain elements that might offend someone. That's part of what makes a movie engaging, with heroes and villains. We root for the good guys and the movie often mocks the bad guys, which can upset some.  When I consume media, I focus on the artist's perspective and why they created it in that way. For example, when listening to music, I first pay attention to the beat and lyrics. If I like it, I'll sing along; if not, I'll change the song.  I hope that people won't remove works from circulation just because someone is offended. We need diverse opinions in life. If we all had the same views, we'd lose our individuality. I cherish my unique personality and being a bit of an outcast. I'm true to myself and respect others' opinions. I wish everyone would do the same or at least make an effort. Thank you for listening to my thoughts.
32	3009	2	2	Books, music, movies, magazines, and other media should not be removed from library shelves. People are capable of discerning their own interests and disinterests. There will always be individuals who find certain ideas offensive, regardless of the subject matter. Thus, censorship is largely ineffective for the individual.  Censorship is unnecessary because people will inevitably come across things that don't align with their interests. People's interests are personal and should not be subject to the censorship of the community. For instance, I've read books with profanity, yet the quality of the book remains unaffected. People have preferences despite the flaws in media such as books, music, and movies. These forms of media attract a wide audience, and each person can make independent decisions based on their interests. An individual doesn't need censored versions to avoid being offended. Every published work contains something that might offend someone, and buyers are aware of this before making a purchase.  Since individuals know what they're interested in without external guidance, censorship is redundant. People are likely to be offended by what they watch or listen to, so why is censorship such a significant issue? In today's society, censorship is not required as each person can decide what is best for themselves. Therefore, books, music, movies, and magazines should remain on library shelves, as there will always be elements that some individuals find offensive.
33	3010	2	2	Many people are concerned about certain materials in libraries, such as magazines, books, movies, and posters. There are books that discuss people of different ethnicities, and some of these books may contain content that some consider inappropriate for young readers. These materials are often found in libraries.  However, individuals should approach these books with an open mind. If one doesn't like the content of a book, they simply shouldn't choose to read it. After all, it's impossible to change how the author wrote the story, music, or movie. In fact, many people of different ethnicities have a good - natured sense of humor about such topics.  It's true that some books may contain controversial statements. But we should recognize that every form of media has its flaws. People have different preferences, and they should be able to make their own choices about what to consume. In conclusion, while there may be offensive elements in some library materials, we should respect the diversity of content and allow individuals to decide for themselves.
34	3011	2	2	Should children be exposed to certain types of reading materials? When we visit a library, we expect to learn about various subjects and expand our knowledge, which will be beneficial in the future. A library is a place for learning about the world. When we enter a library, we typically see people checking out educational books or ones with eye - catching titles.  If we find a book that is offensive or won't contribute to our children's development, we should take a stand for their mental growth. However, we also need to consider what children want to read. They have the right to choose their reading materials as long as they are entertained and learning something new. Some books teach children about the real world.  There are books that I wouldn't personally let my child read, but I understand that they may contain knowledge that I can't provide. I call these types of books '@CAPS7's'. They may seem offensive at first glance, but in reality, they are '@CAPS8', preparing children for what lies ahead. Not all books are full of pleasant and colorful content. Children need to learn to be mindful of different people and understand the difference between right and wrong.  I remember the first book I read on my own, 'Of @CAPS10 and @CAPS11', when I was @NUM1. My mother tried to stop me because of the 'dangerous wording'. But that book taught me a lot about the world at that time, and the knowledge I gained has been useful in my @CAPS9.  In conclusion, some books are meant to be read, while others aren't. If you think your child shouldn't read a particular book, read it yourself first and then explain to your child why.
35	3012	2	2	Libraries offer a wide range of materials, from children's books to adult literature, catering to different age groups. A common question is whether certain materials should be removed from the shelves because they are considered offensive. The answer is a resounding no.  When people visit the library, they either want to learn or be entertained. If you go to the library to research for a project and the required book or movie is missing because it was removed due to being offensive, what will you do? Do you want your children to fail in school because the library lacks necessary materials?  People shouldn't remove materials from the shelves just because they don't like them. If they find something offensive, they should simply put it back and find something else. Everyone has different beliefs, and we can't let personal opinions lead to the removal of valuable resources.  Libraries have various sections for different types of materials, including kids', fiction, and non - fiction. The choice to look at a particular item is up to the individual. No one should remove an offensive item from the shelf as it was their decision to view it in the first place. A library patron has the freedom to choose what to look at. If they don't like what they see, they can just put it down. And if they can't find what they're looking for, libraries also provide computers for online searches. In conclusion, offensive materials should remain on the shelves to ensure that the library can meet the diverse needs of its users.
36	3013	2	2	A book serves as a medium through which an individual can convey their beliefs and emotions regarding a particular topic. Thus, censoring books is unjust as it violates the principle of freedom of speech. In my view, books and other forms of media should not be removed. Even if a book may be offensive, if it presents the truth, we need to read it to avoid repeating past tragedies. Those who find a topic offensive are not compelled to read about it. If we refuse to accept others' beliefs, we are as prejudiced as the books we seek to censor. Many books at risk of censorship are those dealing with historical facts, such as the Holocaust. I believe we have the right to know about significant events. One reason is that if we forget such events, they are more likely to recur. Do we truly want the mass murder of millions to happen again? Just because we are ashamed of something does not mean we should ignore it, as it may resurface like a lurking alligator. Instead, books about such events should be available to show us how not to behave. Some books are censored due to shame, while others are censored because a particular group finds them offensive. There is a simpler solution than censoring these books: the offended groups should simply ignore them. If a book is offensive, no one should be forced to read it. It should not be promoted through posters or television broadcasts. Instead, it can be placed in a specific section of the library so that those who wish to avoid it can do so. The primary reason for book censorship is that someone finds the content offensive. However, isn't preventing someone from expressing themselves equally offensive? For instance, a certain book about treating everyone fairly is often a target for censorship. Censoring such a book would imply that some people are superior to others. In some countries, another book is also a common target for censorship. Censoring it would essentially tell a particular population that they are wrong. Censoring books is wrong. It can lead to the repetition of tragic events, and offended parties can simply avoid the books. While some books may offend people, censoring them can be equally offensive to others. The best approach is to let readers decide whether to read a book or not.
37	3014	2	2	Libraries offer a wide range of materials for entertainment, including books, magazines, movies, and music. Each person has their own preferences for information and genres. For example, many teenage girls enjoy young romance stories and books about the lives of young people, while some individuals prefer informational books. Everyone is unique, and the choice of reading material is theirs. Imagine how you would feel if one of your favorite books or magazines were removed from all library shelves. You would likely wonder why. Some people argue that certain materials contain offensive or inappropriate information and should be removed. But is it their place to decide what offends others? Everyone has the right to form their own opinions and choose what they want to read. In my opinion, these materials should remain on the shelves. It's simple: if you don't like a particular genre of books or magazines, don't read them. If you don't like someone's music, just walk away or listen to your own. If there's a movie about the end of the world that you don't believe in, don't watch it. Some parents don't want their children to know about certain aspects of the world, which is understandable. However, everyone has the right to decide what they want to know. If everyone could remove books they consider inappropriate, would there be any books left? In today's society, people have their own desires and opinions. Some may not agree with certain things, but they have to accept that not everyone will be satisfied. In conclusion, we should respect individual choices and allow a diverse range of materials to be available in libraries.
38	3015	2	2	The question of whether certain offensive materials should be removed from library shelves is a complex one. As @PERSON1 points out, if everyone removes a book they don't approve of, there will be few books left to read. What one person considers an innocent book may offend another, as different people have different sensitivities. Although some books or magazines may contain offensive subjects, removing them would limit our learning. For example, a historical fiction book about racism could offer different perspectives on how people lived during that time. Readers could learn about the impact of racism and why it is wrong. Understanding different viewpoints can make us more knowledgeable about why people think the way they do and help us learn from past mistakes. Books and movies can also show us how life was in the past, when moral values were different. If many people agree that a particular material is offensive or inappropriate for adolescents or young children, one option is to restrict access to adults only. Libraries could also add a warning label if the content is too harsh. Another idea is to provide online reviews of each book in the library, allowing readers to make an informed decision before checking it out. People have different opinions and views on materials. We should learn to be tolerant of others' preferences, as what one person finds offensive, another may enjoy. Some may find this article offensive because they believe in more censorship. However, if someone doesn't like a material, they are not forced to check it out, so there's no need to make a fuss. Since each person has different morals, it's difficult to determine what should and should not be in a library. In conclusion, while we need to be sensitive to the feelings of others, we should also value the freedom to access a wide range of materials in libraries.
39	3016	2	2	Freedom of speech is a fundamental right for every man, woman, and child. Without it, people would be unable to express their views. When libraries remove books, magazines, movies, and music from their shelves, they are infringing on this right. Even if a subject matter is offensive to some, these items should remain on the shelves. What one person finds offensive, another may find amazing. If someone doesn't like the content of a book, they can simply choose not to read it. Libraries should not censor materials just because someone dislikes them. However, I do think that books should be placed in the appropriate sections. Libraries typically have sections for children's books, young adult books, adult books, and more. For example, a book about human anatomy does not belong in the children's section. Beyond that, the library should leave the decision to the reader. If someone wants to read a book about @LOCATION1, they should be able to borrow it from the library. The problem with censorship is that a @CAPS1 may find the book offensive and demand its removal, preventing others from accessing it. The choice of what to read should be up to the individual, not restricted by what others find offensive. Libraries should not remove items just because someone's beliefs are offended. People who don't like a book can simply avoid it. Since everyone has different opinions, there should be no censorship in libraries. In conclusion, we should uphold the freedom of choice in reading and oppose unnecessary censorship in libraries.
40	3017	2	2	Writing is a powerful means of expressing one's thoughts and ideas. In this country, authors have the freedom to write about whatever they want without fear of punishment. While some works may be enjoyable, others can be disturbing. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean it lacks value. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should remain on the shelves, even if they are disturbing or offensive. @PERSON2's book, @CAPS1, exposed the terrible practices in the meat - packing industry. It offended many and sparked an uproar among @CAPS2. However, this is the very reason the book is still discussed today. If laws had prohibited @PERSON2 from writing about the factory horrors, the industry might not have been reformed for a long time. Fortunately, he exposed the problems, and the government intervened to solve them. There are those who dislike this book, but they do not have the right to remove it and prevent others from reading it. Students are often required to read fictional works that, while beneficial, may not fully inform them about the world. It is important for students to read works from @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON4, and @LOCATION1. However, they also need to understand the current world, past eras, and future circumstances. They should learn how to be successful in life. For example, they can read @PERSON1's works, such as @CAPS3, which tells the story of success and what sets the great apart from the average. There are people who dislike these works, but they should not be allowed to deny others the opportunity to learn from them. Reading is the best way to learn. In a world dominated by social networking and screens, the importance of reading has declined. Students need to develop a love for reading. As Paterson said, if everyone removes the books they dislike, there will be no books left for anyone. No book should ever be removed from the shelves. In conclusion, we should protect the freedom of literature and ensure that a wide variety of books are available for people to read and learn from.
41	3018	2	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that no book should be removed from the shelves for any reason. Some individuals may not be mature enough for certain books, music, magazines, etc. If libraries encounter issues with specific materials, they should impose age limits on borrowing such items. Libraries house a wide variety of books and magazines, so there is no valid reason to remove materials from the shelves.  In the world, there are diverse people with different reading preferences. If libraries remove materials that some people dislike, the materials favored by others will disappear. For example, if the '@CAPS1' series were removed from the shelves, all the '@CAPS1' fans would be extremely angry and disappointed. Given that many people like this series, my library would not take such an action.  There are numerous books that parents do not want their children to read, but libraries should not remove them from the shelves. Some parents may object to their children and teenagers reading romantic or racy books, while other adults enjoy such reading. These books will remain in libraries. If parents have concerns, they can suggest that the library set age limits and also monitor what their children are reading. However, these books will always be available in libraries, and one cannot make them disappear simply because they do not want their children to read them.  From my experience, as an immature audience, I find some racy books disturbing. Nevertheless, I will not request that these books be removed from the shelves. Some books contain vulgar and explicit descriptions of fights, wars, or abuse, but some people enjoy such literature, so libraries will keep them. If people have issues with certain books, they should simply avoid reading them. It is that straightforward.  In conclusion, I believe all books should remain on the shelves because people have different interests and opinions. If anyone has a problem with a book being racy or vulgar, they should refrain from reading it. If they do not want their children and teenagers to read such books, they should take parental responsibility and prevent them from doing so. They cannot blame the library for books they do not want their kids to read, as this is unfair to those who enjoy these books.  Sincerely, @PERSON1.
42	3019	2	2	There are many differing views regarding school libraries. The main point of contention is the content in books, magazines, articles, and on the internet, which can be highly disturbing for children. This content often includes violence, drugs, and nudity. In this debate, some parents are opposed to their children having access to uncensored material, while others may not be concerned about what their children access.  Currently, libraries do not seem to focus adequately on the materials on their shelves. This can lead children to develop the idea of being a 'bad kid' at school. They may perceive actions such as drug - use, violence, or nudity as cool when they see them in the materials. However, if libraries provide only censored content, children who are used to uncensored materials may not be satisfied. Parents generally believe that uncensored content should be kept away from children.  Libraries need to be more responsible for the content on their shelves. They may or may not be aware that they have offensive and uncensored content in the library. It is necessary for them to remove all such content for the well - being of children. It is inappropriate for children to be exposed to offensive or uncensored material.  There are parents with children in school who do not pay attention to what their children learn or do. Parents should be more concerned about their children's daily learning. They can then educate their children about uncensored content.  Both parents and libraries should take greater responsibility for the offensive content that children may access. Children should not be exposed to such content as it is not suitable for them. The blame lies with both parents and libraries, and they should be aware of the materials that children are exposed to. In conclusion, by working together, parents and libraries can better protect children from inappropriate content.
43	3020	2	2	Do you want your nine - year - old @CAPS2 talking about and reading inappropriate subjects like sexual relationships or using inappropriate language? I certainly wouldn't want that for my @CAPS2. I firmly believe that offensive and inappropriate books should not be in @LOCATION1 school, elementary schools with young children, or even among @NUM1 - year - olds. Parents should have control over what their kids watch and listen to.  We can't control how movies are made or what singers say in songs, but we can control who watches and listens to them. Parents are the only ones who can control their children.  In libraries, I believe librarians are partly responsible for allowing children to read offensive books. I mean, librarians are in charge of the library's book collection. They should ensure that the books young teens borrow are appropriate for their age, without involving sex or violence that @NUM1 - year - olds shouldn't be exposed to.  Here's a suggestion: libraries could have @DATE1 - year - olds sign a paper or carry a special card to borrow certain books or @CAPS4. This should have parental permission, indicating that the parents approve. However, I think this should only be applicable to high - schoolers as they are more mature. They are less likely to start fights or use bad language in school.  I agree that parents are often the reason why their kids are immature and rude. They sometimes let their children get away with bad attitudes and rudeness. So, parents and others do have the right to censor movies, books, etc.  What about @CAPS4 theaters? Don't take your @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6! It's that simple. High - school students often go to the @CAPS5 after school with friends and manage to see rated @CAPS7 movies without their parents. Some may even use fake @CAPS8 to avoid needing a parent. Teens may try to re - enact what they see in the @CAPS4, whether it's sex, fights, or inappropriate language. It's really sad that some parents allow this to happen, and they should discipline their children.  I've seen many parents letting their children get away with bad behavior. One of my friends can get whatever she wants just by crying. I, on the other hand, have to earn things like a new phone or laptop. I don't let books or movies control my life or change who I am. Teens should focus on educational books, movies, etc., that teach us about life, society, and the future, preparing us for the real world.  In conclusion, I hope that by highlighting these issues, people will realize the importance of censorship and parental responsibility. Parents and relevant authorities should take action to ensure that children are protected from inappropriate content.
44	3021	2	2	In this millennium, we should not be overly concerned about censorship in most cases. People often say and do worse things in public. However, parents should monitor their children and prevent them from accessing inappropriate materials. If a child gets hold of a book or other media with adult content, it is the parents' fault for not being responsible. So, in general, there is no strong need for strict censorship.  If a child underage listens to a CD with adult content after grabbing it off the shelf, it is the parents' responsibility for not watching their child. The same applies to books and other media. If a child is old enough to understand what they are taking, they should be allowed to listen or read it and ask questions. Parents should explain adult - related topics to their children when necessary.  However, if a book, music, movie, magazine, etc., contains racism, it should be censored, except when it is about history. Young children and teenagers often repeat what they hear or read. Books with inappropriate language should be kept secure or have an age restriction. The world already has too much bad language, and libraries should not contribute to this by allowing children to access such books.  I recall an incident in a library. I saw a little boy, no older than @NUM1, pick up an adult book and start looking through it. The parent was nowhere to be found. Who would leave their child unattended in a book section? This young boy then put the book on the floor and started taking off his clothes. This was clearly a result of lack of parental supervision.  There are also people who need certain books for research and projects. We should not implement strict censorship and remove all books that may be inappropriate for children. Some of us rely on these books for our academic work.  In conclusion, we should not have strict censorship in our libraries. I don't want to miss out on a project or a good movie just because some parents can't control their kids. Instead of removing books, we could consider having a separate section with age limits or special passes. But implementing such a system would be time - consuming. So, we should keep our libraries filled with diverse and interesting materials without excessive censorship.
45	3022	2	2	To me, libraries are a portal to different worlds. I can be whoever I want and let my imagination run wild. Libraries should not remove books from the shelves based on their content. People are diverse, and we all have different reading preferences. Additionally, some books may be essential for research. Censorship in libraries should not be permitted.  Firstly, the world is full of different people. Some individuals learn about others through books. Imagine a white, @NUM1 - year - old boy growing up in an all - white town, never having seen an @CAPS1 @CAPS2. When he goes to the library and picks up 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1,' he is exposed to a form of racism he has never encountered before. Books are a part of history and a means of learning. They cannot be removed from the shelves simply because of their content, as this content may open up a whole new world for a young child.  Secondly, college students frequently use libraries to write academic papers. Books are crucial for research. For instance, a college student writing a research paper on abuse (sexual, physical, and mental) may need a non - fiction novel written by a young author about her childhood, which includes being raped by her father at six and being bullied in school. If local libraries remove this book due to its explicit content, it will hinder the student's research. College students need access to books regardless of their subject matter.  Libraries are accessible to people of all ages. It is understandable that a twelve - year - old may access a book inappropriate for their age. However, libraries are divided into sections for this reason. Instead of removing a book considered inappropriate, it should be moved to a more secure and age - appropriate area.  In conclusion, libraries should not censor books. People have different interests and research needs, and books are an important part of learning and history. By keeping books on the shelves and using proper sectioning, libraries can better serve the diverse needs of their patrons.
46	3023	2	2	I firmly believe that the decision to remove certain materials like books, music, movies, or magazines should be an individual's choice. It seems to me that this is part of our constitutional rights. I have a penchant for urban books as they resonate with my life experiences or where I might be headed. While I wouldn't read these books to my grandchildren, they might develop an interest in urban books and movies later in life. Just because you might not enjoy the materials I like doesn't mean they should be banned. There are numerous books and movies I don't care for, but I would never advocate for their removal. If everyone started removing what they didn't like, there would be no need for movies, libraries, or bookstores. Kids would be deprived of a sense of their origins, which is crucial for their future. What might seem bad to you may not be the same for me or others. When visiting a library or bookstore, you usually have an idea of what you're looking for. For books inappropriate for kids, there should be a dedicated section marked 'For Adults'. As adults and parents, we should have control over what our kids read and watch. However, I don't think removing materials will solve the problem because today's kids, if determined enough, will find a way to access them. In conclusion, we should respect individual choices and the diversity of materials available, rather than imposing restrictions based on personal preferences.
47	3024	2	2	Libraries serve as a gateway to our past, whether through factual accounts or fictional tales. Every book, regardless of its genre, offers a glimpse into different places and times. Censoring libraries is unjust. Removing a single book due to one seemingly vulgar or inappropriate sentence for young readers is a mistake. I understand that books with adult content such as drug abuse and sexuality might lead to experimentation, but isn't that part of life? At some point, we all experience curiosity and try new things to learn. History is often the most sensitive subject in libraries. We are ashamed of our past actions, like discrimination in [LOCATION1], the [CAPS1], and the ongoing wars in the Middle East. Some countries avoid teaching their own history to students out of embarrassment or fear of repetition. However, learning about our ancestors' deeds will help us build a better future, not destroy it. Today's media is inundated with adult - oriented material unsuitable for children under [NUM1]. Instead of censoring libraries, we should focus on regulating television broadcasts and online content. Most library books have been there for decades, and removing them after they've educated young minds for so long is pointless. I truly don't understand the motivation behind removing or censoring books. It only limits readers' access to knowledge. In [LOCATION2], elementary educators aren't required to teach spelling. I witnessed a third - grader misspelling [CAPS2] as '[CAPS3]'. The [ORGANIZATION1] claims that kids should learn spelling from reading, but with the prevalence of the [CAPS4], gaming systems, and iPods, children are less inclined to read. We can't afford to take away books when they are a vital source of learning. In conclusion, libraries should remain uncensored, and we should find other ways to protect children from inappropriate content.
48	3025	2	2	In my view, certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should never be removed from libraries. This stance is based on the principles of freedom of speech and equality that our country was founded upon. If we start removing offensive materials from libraries, it will be difficult to draw the line between what is offensive and what is not. Removing a single book that offends a particular race or culture could trigger a wave of book removals by those who disagree with the content about themselves or their culture. Let's first consider what it means for something to be offensive. People encounter offensive things daily, and library books and movies are likely to be less offensive compared to the internet or the news. Moreover, library materials are meant for learning and teaching, not to be offensive. As a library user for over [NUM1] years, I've never found anything offensive. There are countless books on various subjects, and it's impossible to determine which ones are offensive and to whom. Libraries are places of learning, and the information they contain should be helpful and constructive, not offensive. Removing materials now would ultimately lead to the decline of libraries. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of library materials and uphold the freedom of access to information.
49	3026	2	2	Have you ever been offended? Did you react impulsively or try to understand the situation with an open mind? In daily life, people are offended by many things. We should broaden our perspectives and accept these 'offenses' as normal. Imagine you're at a party with a bowl of candy near the front door. You take a piece but don't like it. Do you throw away all the pieces of the same kind from the bowl, or do you simply put it back and choose another? If you throw the candy away, you're limiting the choices of other guests based on your own preference. That candy might be someone else's favorite. Similarly, if you come across an uninteresting or offensive book in a library, put it back and look for another. If you're having trouble finding a suitable book, ask the librarian for suggestions or visit a different library. Don't meddle with something that isn't yours, especially a book. The key point is, if you don't like something, ignore it. Intervention should only occur when a book actually causes problems, but it's hard to believe a book could cause real - world issues. If your child is having problems, focus on your child rather than blaming a book. Opinions can cause conflicts, and sometimes people should keep their opinions to themselves. In conclusion, we should respect the choices and preferences of others and not let our personal dislikes interfere with the availability of resources for everyone.
50	3027	2	2	Libraries can house books that are offensive to humans and animals. Some offensive books contain negative comments just to amuse readers. I firmly believe that all books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from library shelves if they contain offensive and negative content about any human. For example, in political cartoons in newspapers, [PERSON1] is sometimes compared to a [CAPS1]. As [CAPS2] [CAPS3], we find this extremely offensive, as during the past, blacks were often derogatorily referred to as monkeys by whites. Being offended is not a good thing, and libraries should be the last place to have offensive material. Libraries are meant to provide positive knowledge, not negative depictions of human life. Children should be able to pick up a book without feeling offended. One night, my little brother brought home a library book about a white dog and a dark - colored dog. The dark - colored dog was left out in the cold while the white dog was taken in by a loving family. My brother was so uncomfortable that he returned the book the same night. Libraries can contain offensive content that can make people sick to their stomachs. Offensive material can hurt people's feelings, and libraries should be a place where people feel comfortable reading. Despite this incident, my brother still enjoys going to the library to find good books. In conclusion, libraries should strive to provide a positive and non - offensive reading environment by removing inappropriate materials.
51	3028	2	2	"Censorship exists on television, in libraries, schools, and even homes. The question of whether censorship should be employed arises. Censorship can be used to suppress personal thoughts and opinions, promoting conformism. I firmly oppose the concept of censorship. While not everyone believes individuals should have their own unique perspectives, it is precisely this individuality that enriches our world.  Censorship in libraries is on the rise. The government aims to prevent the society, especially the youth in @LOCATION1, from accessing materials deemed inappropriate. However, shouldn't the decision rest with one's guardians or, if old enough, with the individuals themselves? When reading books, one often notices that certain language is blocked out, and parts are removed to make the book seem more refined. Topics such as drugs and alcohol are also censored. Many believe that books are detrimental to society. In my view, reading materials could be more educational if editors left in some of the censored content. This is because parents have the right to decide whether their children read a particular story, but children could learn about various situations and how to handle difficult circumstances.  The issue of censorship in books is highly debatable. For example, in the book @ORGANIZATION1, the government is removing certain words considered offensive. While this is understandable, I do not believe this remarkable novel should be viewed in such a way. The language used was not intended to be offensive but rather to depict how people spoke and the social context during @PERSON1's time. Without books like this, how can our society learn about @LOCATION1's history and the history of other cultures? In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 is an educational novel that provides insights into the era of @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1.  Censorship in movies is also increasing. Television blocks out elements such as language, nudity, alcohol, and drugs. While I would not want to see these things everywhere on TV, they can educate people on what to avoid. I believe that without censorship, people's imaginations would be more stimulated. Imagination can be intimidating to some, as they think it may lead to abnormal behavior. However, what is considered ""normal"" is often defined by the community, where conformity is valued, and this can be a source of fear.  In conclusion, censorship essentially promotes conformism. Conformism implies that everyone becomes the same. If this is the case, we will never see new books, music, movies, magazines, or ideas. We will simply be trapped within our own cultural boundaries, unable to explore new perspectives and creativity."
52	3029	2	2	"When I saw the movie ""White Men Can't Jump,"" I thought it was funny. Yes, it could have offended me, but personally, I found it amusing because it reflects the statistical fact that, on average, black people can jump higher than white people. It all depends on one's perspective; one needs to have a sense of humor when dealing with such things.  Everyone has experienced someone saying something offensive to them at some point. However, it's up to us whether to take it to heart or just laugh it off. Life is much easier when we don't get upset over every little thing people say. I have a good sense of humor. When I watched that movie, I laughed so hard that I almost wet myself. I didn't care that it singled out white people; it was just funny.  ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is another work that many people find offensive. I can understand why, as it contains the @CAPS1 word frequently. But it was a different time back then. The characters in the book weren't directing those words at the readers, so there's no reason to be offended. The author wasn't trying to offend anyone.  If we take such minor things to heart, we'll have a difficult time getting through life. Sometimes, we just need to let things go and not let them affect us.  In conclusion, we've all encountered offensive remarks, but we can't let them bring us down. We need to move on, and in the long run, it will make us better people."
53	3030	2	2	Books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media are excellent sources of learning. However, not all of this material is good; some may be inappropriate. People have different preferences, and the same goes for various forms of media.  Books, newspapers, and magazines can be both beneficial and harmful. Some focus on non - fiction, while others are fictional. Some cover the actions of famous people, often highlighting their negative aspects, which some of us may be interested in but perhaps shouldn't read or even have written about. There are also children's stories and articles about heroic deeds, such as someone saving many people on @DATE1. The range of reading materials is vast, and when it comes to public libraries, readers need to use their judgment.  Music is a great way to express oneself. There is classic @CAPS1 music like @ORGANIZATION1. On the other hand, there is some music, like most @CAPS2 music, that no one should listen to or sing about. There are also children's songs, which, although often annoying, are suitable for everyone. One can also choose @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or other Christian artists or gospel music. The music world is incredibly diverse.  Most movies today are not very good, but there are some educational ones about animals that almost everyone can watch. There are also bad movies, such as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6, a horror movie that made it difficult to sleep for a few days. These movies should not even be produced. There are also video copies of television shows, which can be acceptable. Many of the movies made today are of poor quality, but some are good and educational.  In conclusion, I believe that readers and viewers should exercise their own judgment when it comes to the content of these media. Libraries should have a wide range of materials. Next time you visit a library, just use your discretion.
54	3031	2	2	Every library is a treasure trove of information, with an abundance of books, music, movies, magazines, and more. Some of this information may be offensive to certain individuals, while others may not be bothered by it at all. In my opinion, libraries should keep all their books on the shelves, regardless of the content. This is because not everyone is offended by the same things, and vice versa.  The topic of race often appears in library books. These books may describe how people were treated differently based on their race. Some people want these books removed from libraries due to their content. However, this information is an important part of history that people need to learn about. Some books contain words that are offensive to people based on their skin color, religion, or ethnicity. But this is how people were treated in the past, and unfortunately, some of these issues still exist today.  Libraries house a wide variety of information. I firmly believe that all library books should remain on the shelves, no matter what they contain. Even if some content is offensive to some people, it can still be a crucial part of history that we need to be aware of. By keeping these books, we can learn from the past and work towards a more inclusive and understanding future.
55	3032	2	2	"In my view, books, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves just because they are offensive to some people. Firstly, everyone has different viewpoints on everything. What one person finds offensive may not bother another. Secondly, these materials are essential for educational purposes in schools and other settings. Additionally, if books are constantly being removed, authors and producers will be discouraged from creating new works.  Since people have diverse opinions, if we were to remove every offensive book or magazine, there would be nothing left on the shelves. Different people have different thresholds for what they consider offensive. If someone's favorite book is taken off the shelf because it's deemed offensive by others, it will surely upset them.  Removing ""offensive"" books from the shelves would also hinder people's education. In school, we often encounter topics such as wars, slavery, and politics, which some may find offensive. If all related books were removed, we would not learn about these important historical events, why they happened, and why they were wrong. As a result, people would not change their behavior, and conflicts would continue because they were not properly educated.  On the other hand, if books keep getting rejected, authors and producers will stop creating new works. It's almost impossible for them to create something that is completely inoffensive to everyone. They won't waste their time and effort on projects that are likely to be rejected due to perceived offensiveness.  In conclusion, I've read many books in class that have offended at least one person. However, those who find them offensive can choose not to finish reading or watching. There are numerous reasons why books should stay on the shelves, even if they are offensive to some. It is crucial for people's education on historical events and for the continuation of the creative process. Otherwise, we will face a lack of educational materials in schools, and the literary and entertainment industries will stagnate."
56	3033	2	2	"In today's society, the question of library content management has become a pressing issue. Many wonder why we should exercise greater caution regarding the materials we access from libraries. Libraries offer a vast array of books, encompassing knowledge, entertainment, romance, and adventure. However, some of these materials can be disturbing and gruesome. Children often select books containing pornographic or violent content, which can lead to behavioral changes. They may become hyperactive, mean to others, and engage in sneaky behavior behind their parents' backs. This is because they believe such behavior is ""cool,"" failing to recognize its negative impact on their image. Some parents advocate for removing these inappropriate books. Yet, if we were to eliminate all materials deemed harmful to children, few books would remain. Nowadays, most books contain elements that could potentially be considered detrimental to our minds. So, why is it crucial to be more discerning about the books we add to and remove from libraries? The answer lies in the far - reaching consequences it has on society. Libraries are invaluable learning spaces for children. Books can expand their knowledge and introduce them to new concepts. Many students visit libraries to research for reports or essays on important figures, while others simply seek a good read. Personally, I consider libraries one of my favorite places. The presence of books stimulates our imagination and takes us on adventures we may never experience in real life. However, certain books can also cause problems within families. They may induce nightmares or lead to bad behavior. Removing some of these books could help strengthen family bonds, but if we don't, the situation may spiral out of control. People and children often believe they need these books to navigate the world, but in reality, it is the content that makes us think we rely on them. It's not just books; other forms of media, such as magazines and movies, also pose challenges. Magazines may feature scantily - clad models, which can distract boys. Movies can be even more explicit, as the images are right in front of the viewers. Nevertheless, not all magazines and movies are bad. Magazines can aid in research and keep us informed about current events, covering topics like cooking, home decoration, and wedding planning. Movies can also be educational, especially documentaries that provide insights into the past. We don't need to eliminate all magazines and movies, but we should be selective. In conclusion, being more cautious about library content is essential. By removing materials that are truly harmful to our minds, we can ensure that our children grow up well - behaved and mature. At the same time, we should recognize that books, magazines, and movies can be beneficial when used appropriately. We can choose the right materials by following our instincts and hearts."
57	3034	2	2	Author Katherine Paterson once astutely remarked, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote reflects the current sentiment of some individuals who wish to remove certain literature, books, magazines, music, and movies from libraries, deeming them inappropriate. If we were to eliminate all such materials from the world, we would lose our primary sources of knowledge and entertainment. I firmly believe that certain materials should remain on library shelves. The youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should gain an understanding of different cultures, authors and directors should have the freedom to express themselves, and parents should have the ability to control what their children read. Without the books and novels of the past, the current generation would have a limited understanding of history. Children should be exposed to works like [specific books] to appreciate how much society has evolved. While stories from grandparents can only take us back a few decades, historical books can transport us thousands of years into the past. Some families may be offended by derogatory language in books, but these are part of our history. It is important for children to learn about the harsh realities of the past to avoid repeating the mistakes of previous generations. Learning about different cultures would also be severely hampered if books and movies were removed from libraries. In today's economic climate, not everyone has the means to travel and experience different cultures firsthand. For example, a young girl from a small town in [location] may have no idea how people in [another location] live. Books and movies can bridge this gap, teaching us about different countries and religions. Without them, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten. Authors and directors need the freedom to express themselves. From a young age, we are encouraged to be unique and express our individuality. Not all writers will focus on positive and idyllic themes; some may choose to write about violence, gore, and segregation, which are part of the real world. Removing these books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it will only make us ill - prepared for the realities of life. Parents may face challenges when their children bring home offensive books. However, they should take personal responsibility for controlling their children's reading materials. They should not try to influence others by advocating for the removal of these materials from public libraries. In conclusion, the idea of removing history and learning materials from libraries is unfounded. It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn from it to avoid repeating mistakes and to be more accepting of different cultures. Books, magazines, movies, and music are important forms of self - expression and freedom of speech. They should be preserved as valuable sources of entertainment and learning.
58	3035	2	2	Many people believe that offensive materials should be removed from libraries to prevent children from accessing them. However, I strongly oppose this view. Libraries typically have a children's section. If a child accesses an inappropriate book outside of this section, it is their own responsibility. Removing these materials would inconvenience those who are looking for specific CDs, games, books, or movies. Moreover, it is quite difficult to come across inappropriate books without deliberately seeking them out. Some books that may seem inappropriate could actually be used for educational purposes, such as in health or nursing classes. When considering this debate, there are several factors to keep in mind. We may even have to vote on this issue in the future. In conclusion, we should not rush to remove potentially offensive materials from libraries. Instead, we should trust that individuals can make appropriate choices and that the benefits of having a diverse collection of materials outweigh the potential risks.
59	3036	2	2	Honestly, I don't understand why people are so worked up about unsensored materials in libraries. Offensive things have been around in libraries for as long as I can remember, probably since the very first library opened. Now, everyone is expected to share their opinions on removing these so - called offensive books from the shelves? What's the difference between someone saying something offensive and writing it? Sure, you might not want your child to read something unsensored, but the reality is that they're likely to hear offensive language from other kids anyway. If a book is so bad that you wouldn't want your kids to read it, then why was it published in the first place? Publishers carefully review the books they publish and won't just put out any random thing. I think we should just leave the unsensored materials alone. If you can't be mature enough to take an article, book, or magazine seriously, then you shouldn't be reading it. In the news and on the radio, we often hear about kids getting bullied at school. People tend to blame everything but the parents. When a kid comes home having learned a cuss word, it's never the parents' fault. In my opinion, removing unsensored materials from libraries serves no purpose. I know I don't have a say in this matter, but I firmly believe I'm right. We should accept that there is a wide range of content in the world and learn to deal with it in a mature way. Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts.
60	3037	2	2	As a child, you likely learned a great deal from books. Books are filled with captivating stories of distant lands, accounts of real - life events, and profound poems. Each book is written by an author with a specific message to convey. These books should not be censored from libraries due to words or ideas that some may find offensive. Children need to learn about the real world, and I believe that the earlier they are exposed to these concepts, the less trouble they will face later in life. In [location], we have freedoms that guarantee freedom of speech. Shouldn't there also be a freedom to read? Authors are incredibly talented individuals. Without them, there would be no books for us to enjoy. We should respect their creativity and the effort they put into their works. When an author believes that a particular word or action is appropriate for a book, we should respect their choice and leave the book as it is. I remember my childhood days spent in the public library. I was a curious child, constantly exploring the rows of books and reading the titles. There were books on various adult - themed topics such as politics, religion, sex, and violence. On the other hand, there were also books about children embarking on magical adventures in a tree house and stories about talking mice. The library was a treasure trove of knowledge, with an unrestricted collection of books. As I grew older, I delved into more complex adult books, which helped me form my own opinions on different subjects. Without these books, I would have had limited access to information and would not have been able to conduct in - depth research. The [country] has an amendment in its [constitution] that promotes freedom of speech. This allows individuals to express themselves as long as they do not violate the rights of others. A library is defined as a place where people can freely read, borrow, and return books. Therefore, libraries should include every book in their collection, as each book has its own value. Removing books from libraries because of offensive material is unjust. Books are important regardless of their content. Some books may contain material that is not suitable for children, but children need to learn about these things eventually. Why not expose them at an early age? Books have been our teachers, and we should let them continue to educate us. In conclusion, we should protect the freedom to access a wide range of books in libraries and allow them to fulfill their educational role.
61	3038	2	2	Offensive books should not be completely removed from the shelves. Instead, they should be placed in a section designated for adult readers only, ensuring that children do not come across them. However, if an offensive book is located in a school or any other place where the majority of readers are children, it is acceptable to remove it from the shelf. In conclusion, removing an offensive book is justifiable only when it is inappropriate for the intended audience.
62	3039	2	2	I have mixed feelings about whether certain books should be removed from the library. Some books are valuable for students' classes and research, so in that sense, I'm against removal. Also, if a book offends someone, they can simply choose not to read it. On the other hand, if a book contains hurtful words towards people, shows racial slurs, or promotes harmful behavior, it should be removed. Such content can lead to people using these hurtful words against others, causing fights and conflicts. These are my reasons for having a dual stance on removing books with hurtful content.
63	3040	2	2	Should library books be censored? Adults generally don't want students to be exposed to inappropriate words. However, students have mixed views. Some dislike encountering such words, while others see no issue as they are common in daily life. Personally, I don't think a few inappropriate words in a book are a major problem, but they shouldn't be on the shelves of middle - school libraries or below. In high school and above, it's acceptable in magazines, books, music, and movies. As a child, I was told not to cuss, but in a cussing environment, it becomes normal. Cuss words can also add to a story's impact. Still, foul - language in media does affect youth, with many children cussing at an early age. But censorship can make a book less interesting. Therefore, censorship shouldn't be the deciding factor when choosing media; instead, choose based on interest.
64	3041	2	2	There is a lot of offensive material, such as books and movies, that can have a bad influence on children. Children learn from what they observe, and it's our responsibility to protect them by removing these negative influences. First, some movies show sexual content, which can lead to an increase in teen pregnancies. By restricting children's access to such movies, we can prevent them from being tempted. Second, books, movies, and video games with violence can make children think killing is acceptable. There have been tragic cases where children have committed serious crimes after being influenced by such media. Finally, children's sedentary habits of watching TV and playing video games lead to obesity, which causes depression and low self - esteem. Parents need to be aware of these issues before it's too late. In conclusion, we must make changes to prevent these problems and create a better future for children.
65	3042	2	2	I firmly believe that books should not be censored. Almost every book, except perhaps math books, can offend someone or a group. Books are crucial for learning. If a book offends you, you should simply move on. There's no need to overreact to words on paper, especially when there are more pressing issues. Many people are going through much worse situations, like dealing with drug - using family members, the loss of a child, or the grief of a loved one who died in service. Censorship is a slippery slope. If we censor one offensive book, we'd have to censor all offensive books, which is impractical. Also, censoring history books can prevent us from learning from past mistakes. Since people can endure difficult life situations, we can surely tolerate offensive words in books.
66	3043	2	2	Today's society has a significant flaw: we are overly cautious. We're constantly preoccupied with how others might react to our words and actions. I'm someone who, to a certain extent, doesn't concern myself with others' feelings. However, this doesn't apply to my friends, family, and girlfriend; I show them great respect daily. But when it comes to strangers, I couldn't care less about their beliefs, opinions, and outlooks on life. Perhaps we should stop fretting about others and focus on the growth and prosperity of our race. Has anyone ever considered this? If I had my way, @ORGANIZATION1 would cease to exist. @CAPS1, radio, books, movies, and magazines should all be uncensored. Life itself isn't filtered or censored, so why should these forms of media be? I'm fed up with people constantly shielding their children from life's realities. Children need to learn that life isn't all fun and games; it's tough, unforgiving, and can knock you down. They must learn to adapt. Censorship in libraries, on @CAPS1, etc., does nothing to improve the situation. I truly don't understand why we have to be so concerned. If everyone relaxed a bit and concentrated on themselves, we'd be better off. Every time I hear the word 'offensive,' it makes me nauseous because, in my view, it's a fabricated term that implies we value others' feelings more than our own. In conclusion, we should embrace the freedom of expression and let life unfold naturally without excessive censorship.
67	3044	2	2	I firmly oppose the censorship of libraries. We live in a free country, @CAPS1, where we have the right to access the materials we desire from libraries. Whether the material is age - appropriate or not is beside the point. If parents don't want their children listening to a particular rap artist or watching an @CAPS2 - rated movie, it is their responsibility to prevent it. One of the aspects that makes @LOCATION1 a great place is the freedom that comes with living here. Allowing anyone to censor a library would mean having no books to read, movies to watch, or music to listen to. Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote clearly shows that if everyone had the right to remove books, there would be none left. Censorship of libraries is just the beginning. It could lead to the government censoring information from the public, which would undermine the very essence of @LOCATION1's greatness and take away our freedom. In conclusion, censorship of libraries violates our rights, which is why I strongly oppose it.
68	3045	2	2	Should books, magazines, music, movies, etc., be censored for certain age levels? Absolutely not. Books are highly educational. Sometimes, it's difficult to find a book without controversial content. However, such content can be a valuable way to learn about our country's rich history. Books should not be censored from children because the purpose of reading is to learn about love, math, history, and more. These books are written by adults for everyone to read. I've read many books and always learn something new from them. In the 19th and 20th centuries, cursing was common in books. It wasn't just for the sake of cursing; it was to portray the characters' full dialogue, set the mood of the era, and the story's setting. For example, in war books, characters curse a lot. If a man gets shot in the leg and only says '@CAPS1!!', it doesn't reflect how a real - life person would act. When an author writes what a character would truly say, the reader can better understand the characters. As the saying goes, everyone has the right to read, and this is true because everyone has the right to be interested in and learn about what they like. I firmly believe that everyone should have the freedom to choose what they want to learn. In conclusion, books in libraries should not be censored as they are the best way for people to learn about real life. Reading books with curse words, sex, or violence won't create bad people; instead, it shows them how not to act and can help them become better individuals.
69	3046	2	2	I believe that offensive and inappropriate books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed, mainly for the sake of younger children. Younger children should not be exposed to such content. Given that there are offensive materials in these forms of media, I suggest setting up a separate area where only adults can access them. Movies and magazines concern me the most as they often contain more inappropriate content than books or music. While books and music may have bad language, they rarely have bad images. If anyone finds a book, music, movie, or magazine inappropriate or offensive, they should have the right to take it to the main desk and voice their concerns. I think libraries should implement censorship by separating materials to protect children. Adults can handle such content, but younger children cannot. By keeping things separate, there should be no issues. In conclusion, proper censorship and separation in libraries are necessary to ensure the well - being of children while still allowing adults access to a wider range of materials.
70	3047	2	2	Many people hold firm beliefs when they are strongly convinced of something. In the eyes of others, you may find both those who agree and disagree with you, often based on similar life experiences. People's opinions are shaped by their life experiences and the tragedies they've endured. Eventually, you'll realize that some people have it much worse than you, and you should cherish every moment. Opinions on various topics change frequently. One of the most debated topics is homosexuality. In my opinion, it doesn't matter whether someone is homosexual or not; everyone is unique in their own way. Acceptance is the key to getting along, but many people struggle with homophobia. Another common debate is between male and female opinions. It seems they often disagree, yet they are interdependent. It's almost impossible to find a male or female who agrees with you @PERCENT1, unless they're being insincere. From observing parents arguing, friends fighting, and relatives interacting, we see that people can forgive and forget easily because the world is meant to be cherished every day. In conclusion, I believe most books are based on reality and people's views of the world. I also find it interesting when people are dramatic to make their point, as it helps others understand their experiences better.
71	3048	2	2	I firmly believe that all books have their place in the library. If people were to share my perspective, they would not wish to see any books removed. It is logical that we require a diverse range of books for learning purposes. Some books may initially seem unappealing, yet upon reflection, there is always a valuable lesson to be gleaned. There are numerous reasons why all books should remain on the library shelves, and I will share a couple of my own.  Two years ago, there was a boy named @PERSON1. On multiple occasions, he found himself in difficult situations without knowing how to handle them. Many parents do not discuss certain topics, such as drugs, with their children. This leaves kids uninformed and curious to discover the truth. @PERSON1 had no other means of learning how to deal with fights, drugs, and alcohol except through reading about them in books.  When @PERSON1 was nearly sixteen years old, he started hanging out with a group of delinquent teenagers. They invited him to a party, and out of curiosity, he secretly left his house to attend. Upon arriving at the party, everyone began to drink. @PERSON1 had always been curious about trying alcohol, but he knew he had to be home before his parents woke up at five the next morning, so he initially resisted.  After spending several hours on the couch watching others drink, he was eventually persuaded to join in. He thought that having just one drink would not cause any harm. However, before long, one drink turned into two, two into four, and the number continued to increase. @PERSON1 was having so much fun that he lost track of time. When he looked at the clock and saw that it was three a.m., he became extremely worried.  He was at a loss as to what to do until he recalled a book he had read. The book was about a man who was out drinking and had no other way home than to drive. The man decided to drive because he did not think he was very drunk. On his way home, he pulled onto the highway at the wrong time and was hit by a semi - truck on the left side of his car.  After thinking about that book, @PERSON1 decided to be brave and call his parents. He knew he would be punished, but he believed that being grounded was a better alternative than getting injured or even losing his life. @PERSON1's dad came to pick him up from the party, and he was grounded for two months. His grounding would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end. @PERSON1 was also satisfied with his choice.  Events like this are precisely why I believe that almost any book deserves a place on the library shelf. The stories in books help everyone understand how to respond in real - life situations. I know that books have assisted me in figuring out many things, including what to do and what to avoid. If you give every book a chance, you will find a valid reason for it to be read.
72	3049	2	2	Do I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Yes, I believe they should be removed when they are offensive to some or the majority of people. Some of these materials can have a negative influence on younger children. They can also be offensive to someone's race, religion, or based on an individual's identity or occupation.  Some materials should be removed due to their influence on younger kids. Some books contain violent language and actions. Most magazines feature inappropriate articles that children should not be reading or even looking at. The music today is often very explicit and should not be accessible to children. Some parents may not be concerned about the music, but it is one of the most influential factors. This is one reason why certain books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves.  There is a significant amount of music and movies that are highly offensive to certain races and religions. Hip @CAPS1 is one of the most explicit music genres and is offensive to various religions and some racial groups. Movies are similar to music in this regard. Magazines also have certain articles that are racist and offensive to specific religions.  Many magazines publish stories about celebrities that are negative, sad, and private. In the past, some celebrities have sued magazines and newspapers for publishing false or overly private stories.  These are just some of the reasons why certain books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. We cannot know how people feel about themselves or the things around them, so it is important to be cautious about the materials available.
73	3050	2	2	No, I don't think music, movies, magazines, and other media should be removed from libraries. After all, what's a library if it only has books? Even though libraries are places where you need to read quietly and be seated, there's more to do than just read. You can listen to music while using the computer, watch movies in the library, and check some out to take home. Magazines in the library can keep you updated on the latest fashion, new looks, or community events.  Music is great in the library. It sets a relaxing mood. If you're in a bad mood, the music you like can calm you down and put you in a better state. You can listen to music while on the computer or while reading a good book.  Movies are a valuable resource in the library. You can watch them right there or check them out to watch at home. You can watch all kinds of movies, the ones you like, the ones you need for a project, or educational movies. If you want to learn about nature, animals, or a @CAPS1 person from the @DATE1, there's always a good movie in the library.  Magazines in the library are very helpful. When you're waiting for something or using the computer, you can sit down and pick up a magazine. There's a wide variety of magazines to choose from, like sports, fashion, nature, cartoons, animals, and more.  That's why I say no. These things shouldn't be removed from libraries because you can do so many great things there besides just reading a book or using the computer. Movies, magazines, and music are all useful in the library. Who wants to just use the computer and read a book? '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'.
74	3051	2	2	The library serves as a gateway to knowledge, leading to diverse cultural paths. It has evolved from being merely a repository of books to a building that also houses music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media. This evolution raises the question of whether certain materials should be excluded if they are deemed offensive. There are multiple perspectives to consider when addressing this question.  Is censorship a solution for offensive materials or a means to enforce what is considered 'politically correct'? Often, people claim that certain works are unjust without fully understanding the viewpoint of the supposed victims. Ironically, those in power who advocate for the offended parties often understand them less than the creators of the works.  Another reason for censorship is to protect children from inappropriate material, which is a reasonable concern. However, at what point do parents have control over what their children can access? I believe it is the responsibility of parents to determine such restrictions. If a parent allows a child unlimited access to library materials, the child should be free to explore according to their curiosity. If parents choose to limit access, they should be actively involved in the selection process. It is the right of parents, who give birth to and raise their children, to guide them.  I am a musician myself, and in terms of artistry, my creations are no different from those of other creators, such as authors. My works are expressions that I offer to the world for enjoyment and contemplation. Removing an author's work from the library undermines their ability to spread their ideas. Although there are other ways to obtain books, the library is one of the most significant platforms.  There are several complications associated with library censorship. What criteria should be used to determine which offensive materials to exclude? If a material offends one person, is that enough to remove it, or is a larger group's offense required? It is unrealistic to always achieve a complete consensus on what is offensive, so how can we determine the boundaries?  In conclusion, I believe that everyone should have the freedom to access any material they desire from the library. The library is an institution that allows people to experience places and lives they may never encounter in reality. Its ability to provide such experiences should not be compromised.
75	3052	2	2	In third grade, I picked a book with an interesting cover from the shelf of my local library. It was quite large, but since I had developed a love for reading at that time, I decided to give it a try. The book was a fantasy, which I really enjoyed. However, there were parts of the book that confused me. There were scenes involving women that I couldn't understand, and there were many new words. Eventually, I asked my dad about a certain part of the book. He read the passage, and his eyes widened in shock. I never finished reading that book.  There's no doubt that reading that book was a learning experience for me. But, as my dad clearly thought, it might have been a bit too much for me at that age. If it weren't for my mom not wanting to make a big deal out of it, my dad would have had a serious talk with the library. Now that I'm old enough to understand what was going on in that book, I realize that I lost some of my innocence because of it. There's simply some material that's not suitable for children, and it shouldn't be in our public libraries.  Considering my experience, it seems absurd not to censor the materials on the library shelves. If I have a son someday, I want to be the one to talk to him about sensitive topics like women and swearing, not some fiction book. I also don't like the other materials in our libraries. The music has artists who don't write with children in mind, movies have up to @NUM1 ratings, and magazines promote gossip and have sexual references.  Overall, I'm disappointed that our libraries have allowed such things on their shelves. When I think about my experience in third grade, I wish I'd never seen that book. Maybe I could have kept a bit more innocence for longer and had more respect for women during my youth. I really hope there will be more censorship in libraries to protect today's children until their parents decide it's time for them to face the real world.
76	3053	2	2	Have you ever noticed the abundance of inappropriate materials accessible to children, such as movies, books, magazines, music, or content on certain platforms? While it might seem ideal to eliminate all such bad materials, not everyone may share the same view about a particular song, movie, or show. I firmly believe that removing all offensive materials would be a terrible idea. It could lead to conflicts among those with differing opinions and violates the fundamental right of freedom of speech.  In today's world, taking away something like a person's favorite book is likely to incite some form of aggression. Throughout history, our country has been filled with individuals who resist restrictions. This is how many of our freedoms, including the one we are discussing, came to be. When something is taken away from people, they will stand up and fight for it. Moreover, there will always be those who attempt to smuggle and hide such materials, making it impossible to completely eradicate them.  Removing all so - called bad materials would also mean infringing on the right to freedom of speech. Some materials may be offensive to certain individuals, but we do not have the right to simply get rid of them. There is hardly any book, magazine, or song that doesn't offend someone. If we were to remove all offensive materials, we would essentially have to remove everything. Since we can never reach a unanimous agreement on what is offensive, it is futile to try to please everyone.  In conclusion, trying to remove all offensive materials will only lead to violence and exacerbate the situation. As a parent, it is impossible to shield children from everything, as they will eventually learn about such content. We must accept that this is a part of our world and learn to co - exist with it.
77	3054	2	2	"The question of whether libraries should remove items that some people find offensive is a significant issue that often goes unconsidered before action is taken. There are two common scenarios to consider.  First, if only one person finds a particular item offensive while others do not, the decision of whether to remove it becomes complex. Many libraries grapple with this question because they are aware that different people have different preferences. When people ask library staff to remove an offensive item, they may only be catering to those who want it removed but remain silent. If the library decides to remove the item, it risks losing customers who like it. Conversely, if it doesn't remove the item, it may lose customers who find it offensive.  Libraries are thus faced with a difficult dilemma: to remove or not to remove? This decision is especially challenging as either choice may result in the loss of several customers. To address this, libraries may poll their customers, do nothing, or remove the item to satisfy the complainant. However, there is another aspect to consider. What if the item is loved by a friend, and removing it would hurt their feelings? The item may have been in the library for a long time, and the friend may not be able to afford to buy it elsewhere.  People often fail to consider others' feelings and the potential consequences of their decisions regarding an ""offensive"" item. They may say things they wouldn't normally say just to get the item removed from their sight. In essence, they are not willing to acknowledge others' choices, feelings, and opinions.  In the end, the decision of what to do when finding an offensive item at the library is up to each individual. However, it's important to remember that not everyone has the same taste in books, music, movies, or magazines. Therefore, one should take others' possible feelings, thoughts, and opinions into account before making a decision."
78	3055	2	2	If you were offended by a book in the library, would you want it removed from the shelf? I wouldn't, as there's no point in doing so. There are numerous books, movies, and music that can offend people, and these forms of media are not tailored to any single individual.  Books should be written about any topic that interests people. Different people have different sensitivities, and what one person finds offensive, another may not. If books were created based on emotions or public perception, there would be far fewer books in the world today. In a free country, we have the right to express our thoughts and ideas through writing.  Movies are another means of emotional expression. Many people find movies offensive, but movies are not made to please everyone. They allow us to express a wide range of ideas and emotions. No particular group or race is the sole focus of movies, although some individuals may feel that way. This is a personal perception that some people may have.  Music can be produced, rapped, or sung in various ways to reach people. Nowadays, a lot of music is considered offensive, but it is also a medium for expressing emotions and exercising freedom of speech. I've never been offended by a song because people have the right to say what they feel.  Freedom of speech is a fundamental right in the world. People either need to accept it or remain offended. Books, music, movies, and magazines will not be removed based on emotions alone. I view these forms of media as a means of artistic expression that reveals how people think and respond to the world. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and expressions in these media forms.
79	3056	2	2	"Many books and materials in libraries can be offensive to certain individuals, but this does not necessarily mean they should be removed from the shelves. What may be offensive to one person could be of great value to another. For example, if someone who dislikes history had the power to remove history - related materials, someone else might come along and remove materials related to a subject they like, such as science.  If a material is offensive to the general public, it should be placed in a special section, made available behind the counter, or only accessible at specific libraries.  In libraries around the world, there are generally adult, children, and entertainment sections. These sections cover a wide range of topics and viewpoints. Sometimes, offensive materials are almost ""hidden"" and require a long search to find. Controversial topics should be kept in a closed - off area of the library, accessible only through the staff. This way, the public doesn't have to worry about being exposed to such materials.  Similar to how cigarettes are kept behind the counter in a store, certain materials, including those related to sex, racism, porn, politics, and other sensitive topics, should be placed in a location where they can be closely monitored. By keeping these items behind the counter, they are hidden from plain view but still accessible upon special order or request. This approach benefits the public.  Some materials can cause an uproar in a small town when introduced. Such materials should be restricted from entering small towns and only be available at large libraries or specific bookstores. By keeping these materials at a distance, the people in small towns can be assured that their community will not be disrupted.  In conclusion, while we cannot simply remove offensive materials from libraries, we can implement appropriate measures to manage their access and ensure the comfort and well - being of the public."
80	3057	2	2	I firmly believe that just because some people find certain materials offensive, they should not be removed from the shelves. Everyone has their own beliefs, rights, and opinions, and it is unrealistic to expect everyone to think alike.  For instance, there are people who are against certain ethnic groups, while others are not. This shows that different people have different perspectives, and they should have the freedom to access the materials they like. Not everyone will share the same preferences in terms of what they read, listen to, or believe.  If something offends you, you have the option not to engage with it. However, the fact that it offends you does not mean that others do not believe in or like it. We live in a diverse society where people have the right to express and access a wide range of ideas.  In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and the right to freedom of access to information. Removing materials based on individual sensitivities would limit this freedom and prevent people from exploring different perspectives. Therefore, we should allow these materials to remain on the shelves while also being mindful of the diverse nature of our society.
81	3058	2	2	"Libraries exist all over the world, filled with various types of materials on their shelves. While most of this material is both useful and enjoyable, some may not be. In my view, libraries should have the freedom to stock whatever they choose. I understand that certain materials might be inappropriate for some individuals, but there is a solution to this issue.  Even if libraries have inappropriate books, movies, music, etc., they should be allowed to keep them. Just because some people don't like a particular item doesn't mean that everyone will feel the same way. Everyone has their own preferences, likes, and opinions, which is what makes the world diverse.  Adults may be concerned about offensive materials in libraries because their children use these facilities. I empathize with their concerns, but there is a way to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content. If libraries have such materials, they could set up a restricted area that kids cannot enter. This way, those who are interested in such content can still access it, while children are protected.  We attend school for multiple reasons, including learning, preparing for college, and becoming independent. At school, we not only learn academic subjects like math and evolution but also gain an understanding of the world around us. Nowadays, we are constantly exposed to bullying, explicit songs, and disturbing movies. Since children and teenagers are already aware of these so - called ""offensive"" things, there is no harm in having relevant materials in libraries for those who wish to study them.  In conclusion, libraries contain a wide range of materials, some suitable for kids and teenagers and some not. I understand parents' concerns about censorship in public libraries, but by segregating inappropriate materials into a separate area, everyone can be satisfied without causing any harm."
82	3059	2	2	Censorship refers to the act of blocking or removing content that is offensive to people's beliefs, religions, races, and ways of life. In my opinion, books in libraries should not be censored. I recognize that some written content can be offensive to oneself or others, but consider a situation where you come across a book that discriminates against someone else's beliefs but not yours. Would it still be justifiable to remove such a book from the library shelves?  Moreover, removing books from libraries will not prevent children from learning about age - inappropriate content. If parents do not want their children to be exposed to certain materials, they should take responsibility for controlling what their children read. There is no need to penalize other library users who may need those books.  If people start removing offensive books from library shelves, libraries as we know them may cease to exist. Some individuals may take the issue of offense too far and be offended by almost everything. The content in books, magazines, and movies is mild compared to what people encounter in the real world. Offensive books simply remind us that we won't like everything that others write or say.  Regarding movies, they are already rated on a reasonable scale. If a movie is not age - appropriate, people should avoid watching it or prevent their children from doing so. The same principle applies to video games and music. Parents should censor these for their own children, rather than seeking to censor them for the entire world.  In conclusion, just because you don't agree with every piece of content someone writes doesn't mean that others feel the same way. Among all the things that could potentially be censored, libraries should not be a target. Removing items from library shelves won't address the real issues that need to be tackled.
83	3060	2	2	Certain materials should not be removed from library shelves if they are considered offensive, and there are three main reasons for this. Firstly, what may be offensive to one person might not be offensive to another. In our society, we should not base decisions on the opinion of a single individual because everyone has the right to freedom of speech. History shows that different people have different sensitivities. For example, some people believe that books featuring gay characters should not be in libraries, while many others have a different view. This clearly demonstrates the diversity of opinions.  Secondly, materials labeled as offensive can actually serve as educational tools. Libraries are places for study and learning, and they should offer a wide variety of resources, even if some people find them offensive. In fact, some books teach us not to be overly sensitive, as everyone has their own feelings. As long as we have the support of loved ones, the opinions of others should not matter.  Finally, if we removed everything we disliked, the world would be a very different place. Books are a means for people to express their viewpoints. If you don't like a particular book, you should not take offense and try to remove it from the shelves. In a democratic society, like the one in [LOCATION1], the government takes everyone's opinions into account. A prime example is state - funded schools. Just because some people don't like a particular school doesn't mean it should be shut down.  In conclusion, certain materials should remain on library shelves when they are deemed offensive. The first reason is the diversity of opinions, where what is offensive to one may not be to another. The second is the educational value of so - called offensive materials. And the third is that removing everything we dislike would change the world as we know it.
84	3061	2	2	Dear Katherine Paterson,  I would like to share my thoughts on whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from library shelves if they are considered offensive. In my opinion, this is generally unnecessary because not everyone will find these materials offensive. If a few people think a particular item is offensive, they can simply choose not to read or engage with it. There is no need to take away something that others enjoy.  I believe that materials should be kept on the shelves unless everyone agrees that they are offensive. It is unfair to deny others the opportunity to access a topic they like just because one person finds it offensive. However, if a public magazine is blatantly racist or engages in similar unacceptable behavior, then its removal can be considered. But in most other cases, there is no valid reason to remove materials that some people may enjoy.  For instance, if I enjoy movies, books, or magazines about hunting, and some people find it offensive to kill animals for sport or food, their personal opinion should not result in the removal of these materials for everyone. Everyone is entitled to their own views, and we can't always get what we want. We should learn to accept the diversity of opinions.  In summary, my view is that if you don't like a material and it offends you, you should avoid it. Materials should not be removed from libraries unless there is a consensus that they are offensive.  Sincerely, @PERSON2
85	3062	2	2	People have diverse opinions about what is appropriate and what is not, which is largely influenced by their beliefs and morals. Personally, I am against any form of censorship in libraries.  I firmly believe that individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read, watch, or listen to. Each person should be able to make decisions based on their own beliefs, age, and maturity level. For example, some parents allow their children to watch certain movies that others might consider inappropriate. This shows that the situation varies from person to person.  It is extremely difficult to judge certain materials because what one person finds acceptable, another may not. There would be controversy over almost everything in libraries because everyone has different standards of acceptability, and these standards often conflict. It is impossible to ensure that nothing in libraries will be offensive to anyone. If someone finds a particular item offensive, they simply don't have to borrow it.  However, there are steps that can be taken to address the concerns. For example, materials can be categorized according to maturity levels, similar to movie ratings. By organizing materials in this way, people can easily determine whether a particular item might be offensive. For instance, all children's movies and books can be grouped together, so parents don't have to worry about their kids accessing inappropriate content.  In conclusion, individuals should have the freedom to make their own decisions. Libraries are public spaces where people can access any materials they want. Just because one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean that others should be denied the opportunity to read it. By categorizing materials based on maturity levels, people can have a better understanding of what they are likely to encounter, and this can help resolve the issue of offensive materials in libraries.
86	3063	2	2	Consider this scenario: you write a personal life story, and someone deems it offensive, leading to the book being removed from library shelves. In my view, library censorship is becoming a controversial issue for several reasons. Firstly, it undermines our freedom of speech. In [LOCATION1], we possess the right to express our thoughts. If all reading materials were censored, there would be little left to read. The liberties of [CAPS1] citizens should not be curtailed due to perceived inappropriateness. Secondly, people hold diverse opinions. One person might find a book about a sexual - assault victim offensive, while another might see it as informative and helpful. Censorship cannot be based on a single belief, as it will never gain universal approval. Thirdly, excessive censorship eliminates awareness of real - life dangers. Stories about kidnappings or drug - influenced car crashes, despite having inappropriate elements, can be influential and guide people to make the right choices. If we censor such stories, people lose the opportunity to learn from others' mistakes. Although some stories or magazine articles may seem vulgar, they play a crucial role in raising awareness, safeguarding free speech, and allowing individuals to form their own opinions. Therefore, library and media censorship should be abolished.
87	3064	2	2	"I firmly believe that certain materials can be removed from library shelves, but I am against having any racist content in libraries. Today's teens seek books, movies, music, and magazines they can relate to. We can't control people's preferences. For instance, I personally dislike robot movies, but that doesn't mean they should be removed from the library just because of my aversion. Similarly, a show like [CAPS1] in [LOCATION1] shouldn't be removed based on its title alone. Family [CAPS2] is a popular show with a lot of bad language, yet it shouldn't be removed as it caters to what many people enjoy. Teens need materials they can relate to, even if some content might be offensive. Without such materials, few would read. Music preferences also vary. A [NUM1] - year - old isn't interested in listening to Barney; they want music they find cool, though others may not share this taste. Restricting access to library materials on the grounds of being ""bad"" is like limiting food choices due to health concerns. People would be extremely disappointed if they couldn't access the things they like. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, even if some opinions seem foolish. Since not everyone likes the same things, we shouldn't impose restrictions on library access."
88	3065	2	2	Based on my observations, I firmly believe that no materials should be removed from libraries. All students have the right to learn about diverse subjects, even those that might be offensive. Take the Holocaust as an example. It is a highly sensitive and potentially offensive topic. However, if we don't study what happened during that tragic period, history might repeat itself without our knowledge. Students have the choice to engage with such subjects or avoid them if they find them offensive. In conclusion, library materials should not be censored or removed from shelves. To become better - informed and well - rounded individuals, people need to learn about all aspects of the world.
89	3066	2	2	In my opinion, censorship should exist not only in libraries but everywhere. I believe that the current organization of books in libraries is appropriate. Parents should take responsibility if they don't want their children exposed to certain materials. They should keep a close eye on their children's activities in the library. Parents are aware of their children's interests. They should guide their children to the relevant sections of the library. In this way, a proper balance can be maintained between access to information and protection from inappropriate content. Censorship helps create a safe and suitable environment for everyone.
90	3067	2	2	Imagine visiting your local library and stumbling upon something offensive. Many people would oppose having offensive materials in libraries, as libraries are public spaces accessible to all. Libraries should thoroughly review materials for offensive content before placing them on the shelves. Everyone in the district can access the library and view its materials. A significant amount of library content might be offensive, but it's difficult to define what exactly is offensive. Libraries should limit access to such materials. If offensive materials are still in the library, they should be clearly labeled or placed out of easy reach. Children also have access to public libraries. Usually, they are accompanied by adults, but they may pick up offensive items before an adult can intervene. Most libraries have a children's section free of offensive content, but not all children stay there. So, offensive materials should either be eliminated from libraries or kept out of children's reach. Libraries select what goes on their shelves without knowing who will view it. Offensive materials can be seen by anyone, potentially leaving a negative impression. Some people are mature enough to handle such content, while others are not. For those who aren't, it may have a negative impact and cause problems. In [CAPS1], libraries should not provide offensive materials. If people want to access such content, there are other ways. Libraries should not offer unrestricted access as it's impossible to predict the impact on different individuals. If offensive materials are present, there should be an adult - only area for those over [NUM1]. Hopefully, libraries will eventually eliminate offensive materials accessible to all.
91	3068	2	2	I firmly believe that if offensive books, music, movies, and magazines are present in libraries, they should be removed from the general shelves. People do not want their children to read or view inappropriate content. Today, I am opposing the current stance on library censorship. We should advocate for what libraries should offer for our children to read. Offensive materials in libraries should be placed in a separate area for adults, not accessible to the children who visit the library. I am requesting the newspaper to assist us in determining what should be on the library shelves for our youth and children. We have the right to remove books from the children's section and place offensive materials in a section for adults who appreciate such media but which is not suitable for young readers. The key point is that we must consider what our children should learn and what they should know at a young age. They should not grow up too quickly. We need to create a better environment for our young children so that they can, in turn, do the same for themselves and their future children.
92	3069	2	2	If you enter a store and see a book or magazine you dislike, should you be able to remove it? My answer is no. You do not own the library's books, nor do you have a say in what is displayed in any store. You are the consumers. If you don't like something, simply don't buy or look at it. When I was in eighth grade, I went on a church missions trip to @LOCATION2. It was one of the most popular places in @LOCATION1. When we weren't working or serving, we would go shopping. The city was crowded, and there were many different stores. Some, in my opinion at the time, were inappropriate for my age. One day, our group walked into a store without realizing its nature. We simply nodded goodbye to the cashier and left to continue our shopping. We didn't remove any items because it was their store, and we had no right. After we left, other people entered and liked what they saw. If we had removed the items, they wouldn't have had that opportunity. It's like someone removing something from a store I like; I wouldn't want that. If you enter a store and see something you don't like, you shouldn't try to get rid of it, regardless of whether you want your kids to see it. You take a risk when you enter a store. You're there to browse or buy. Every store has its own offerings, and what you find offensive, others might like, and vice versa. It's a complex situation. If you remove an item because you find it offensive, and then someone else does the same, there will be less for others to see. This could lead to conflicts. If you don't like what you see in a store, either don't enter or ignore the offensive items. These are my opinions. I believe you shouldn't remove items from stores. Be aware of your actions and the consequences. It could cause job losses and conflicts among shoppers. I hope you understand my reasoning.
93	3070	2	2	Libraries are highly educational. They provide a wide range of resources, including books, movies, magazines, music, and computers, to help you find what you need. In my view, libraries generally do not contain offensive materials. However, if someone finds something offensive in a library, they should communicate with the staff to seek a solution. The item should not be removed because not everyone will find it offensive. I have visited many libraries throughout my life, and I have always been amazed by the wealth of knowledge available. I have gained a great deal from the books I've read there. I have never encountered anything offensive, but everyone has different perspectives. If an item is offensive to everyone, it may be appropriate to remove it. Otherwise, it should remain. I understand that if something is offensive to people, they may want it removed. For example, if someone tells me a certain piece of music is inappropriate for children, I would say that while that may be true for some, not all children are affected, and it wouldn't be fair to remove it just because one person dislikes it. In my experience, most offensive things are found outside of libraries.
94	3071	2	2	Certainly not. Some materials may be offensive to some people, but not to all. Everyone will be exposed to offensive material at some point in their lives, so there is no valid reason to censor it. These materials are created for entertainment, and some people enjoy offensive content. I genuinely believe that nothing in the library is so offensive that it needs to be removed. If a material offends you, you can simply ignore it and choose something else. Censoring materials goes against the First Amendment, specifically the freedom of speech. If everyone were to find something offensive in a material and demand its removal or censorship, eventually, there would be no books left. Books are the result of an author's ideas and creativity. Some people may find the author's ideas offensive, but others still enjoy the books. Everyone has the right to create and share their ideas, even if they are offensive, because of the freedom of speech. Banning any type of material is a form of suppressing the creator's voice and goes against the First Amendment. It is also wrong to censor music and movies. When you censor them, you are also suppressing the creators' ideas. Music is an expression of life, and censoring it would be like censoring emotions. Censoring movies, music, and books hinders the expansion of culture. In conclusion, censorship is detrimental to America and our cultural progress.
95	3072	2	2	Have you ever visited a library and found no books or magazines on the shelves? If libraries try to remove all offensive books and magazines, there will be nothing left to read. If you pick up a book or magazine that offends you, simply put it back and choose another one. In this article, I'll discuss how movies can be offensive, why libraries shouldn't empty their shelves because of it, and share my views on this topic. Movies, books, magazines, and music can all be offensive. If you're offended, don't read, listen, or watch. Just grab a new item. But what if it's the best book or movie? In that case, it's your choice to consume it. If you want to get offensive items off the shelves, take one to the manager, read a part to them, and ask them to consider it from your perspective. Then, pile up all the offensive items in front of them. On the other hand, if libraries are constantly bombarded with people complaining about offensive books and movies, what should managers do? In my opinion, they should read or watch the first few, but after that, they can just agree to get the complainers out of their office. However, if many people are complaining, managers need to take action. Removing books from libraries can lead to loss of sales. I've visited a library where everything was categorized, which I think all libraries should do so that people know what they're looking at before they start reading. My belief is that when you enter a library, you know it contains books. If there's a book or movie that many people have complained about, the library may make an effort to remove it. But if you're the only one complaining, it's unlikely they'll take special action. The author didn't write the book to offend you specifically. If it's too offensive for you, return it and choose another. If it's a best - seller, the library won't remove it because of one person. If you check out a book or movie without knowing its content, it's your choice, not the library's fault. This article presents different perspectives, which is good. If you keep nagging the manager and they don't remove the item, go to a different library. Maybe it will have fewer offensive items, and they'll be more willing to solve the problem. If you're offended by this article, I'm sorry. I'm just sharing my opinions and hoping to help you solve your problems. Thanks for reading.
96	3073	2	2	When the topic of library censorship comes up, questions like “What are we hiding from?” and “Is personal expression really that bad?” spring to mind. In my view, forbidding artworks from libraries is tantamount to destroying the people who created them. Censorship, in general, is a means to conceal reality and sugar - coat life's struggles.  One cannot learn without the opportunity to face societal and global problems. By banning certain pieces, we squander an opportunity to expand everyone's knowledge. When libraries remove materials like books and music, they undermine the time and effort the creators have invested. While most people use these for entertainment, writers and musicians create for self - expression, to show their pain and struggles, and it can be therapeutic for them.  Imagine if your art form was deemed unsuitable for a public audience. You'd likely feel hurt and isolated. Artists probably feel secluded and hated. Art always has a deeper meaning. The big question is, who decides that a material is unsuitable for libraries? What could be so wrong with specific material that we must deprive everyone of it?  At the current pace, there will be no individualism left in fifty years. If people can't listen to certain music, soon they won't be able to wear specific clothes or dye their hair. Our greatest gift is the ability to be different. If society can't handle freedom of expression through art, how can it handle other forms?  Libraries are meant to expand knowledge. Censoring materials hinders learning. Everyone thinks and interprets subjects differently. A book that one person reads for entertainment might inspire a world - changing idea in another. Our greatest ideas come from accumulated knowledge and interests. Censoring art prevents individuals from finding interests in certain subjects, forcing everyone to learn the same things and restricting the world from great ideas.  In a class discussion, we read about an organization's decision to ban information about a loss and the bad things their society did. This not only takes knowledge but implants lies in the next generation. It creates a false sense and hatred in children's eyes. How can we influence a child's beliefs based on our selfish views? Censorship destroys the truth and knowledge individuals deserve.  The essence of censorship is covering up reality. Do libraries think hiding controversial topics will keep people in the dark? Knowledge is everywhere. A censored book could have saved millions of lives. I can't understand hiding materials from the public. Soon, all forms of expression might be censored. If we censor art, should we censor people too?  I once had a teacher tell me I'd never achieve my career because of my piercings. Such opinions can kill dreams. There will always be things we don't like in the world. If libraries censor different types of art, there will be no art left. Most people have endured worse than what's being covered up. Art helps us through struggles. Censorship in libraries won't hide anything; it will just destroy growth opportunities.  Censorship in libraries will destroy our world. No one can say a material isn't suitable for the public as they aren't the public. Banning art bans individuality. If this continues, the planet will be full of mindless zombies. Let people express through art and share it with the world. The struggles in art can save others and help the world grow.
97	3074	2	2	Several years ago, a parent at my school complained to the administration about a book, “The @PERSON2,” that her child was about to read for an English class. She thought it was inappropriate for a ninth - grader. Her concern was somewhat understandable as there had been earlier concerns within the school when the book was added to the curriculum. However, the administration decided to keep it because, despite the possible inappropriateness of one scene, the rest of the book taught important lessons like cultural tolerance, the difference between right and wrong, and taking responsibility for one's actions.  I understand parents' desire to protect their children, but I firmly believe it's crucial to be exposed to a wide range of materials. It helps us learn about different cultures and ways of life. I once read a quote suggesting that understanding leads to tolerance. We can't ban books and media just because we think they're inappropriate. Understanding others' cultures and viewpoints could solve global problems, like the crisis in the @LOCATION1 involving the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2.  Katherine Paterson's quote about removing disliked books and media resonates with me. Take the popular video - sharing site @CAPS3. There are thousands of videos with millions of viewers. Each video has a feedback section, and with so many different opinions, it's hard to find a video without dislikes. If we could remove disliked videos, there'd be none left to watch.  Another reason we can't remove offensive materials is that without authors being a bit rebellious and introducing new ideas, our reading material would become boring. During the women's suffrage movement, men found the idea of women voting offensive. Now, it's a legal right and a common occurrence. This shows how a once - radical idea can improve lives. Removing such books makes us ignorant.  All books and media have value, whether they express one person's ideas or thousands'. Removing them risks harming ourselves as individuals and as a society. I believe the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they included freedom of speech in the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. If we remove books and media, we're denying the freedom of speech of their creators.
98	3075	2	2	The saying “never judge a book by its cover” has literal meaning in this context. Every mind is as unique as every book. One person might find a subject offensive, while others may not share that view. In my opinion, books with “suggestive” references or language should be placed in a “mature” section and clearly labeled. With billions of different viewpoints worldwide, why remove books that only a few find inappropriate?  Everyone has a life story and rough experiences. Reading a book might trigger painful memories for some. Victims of abuse shouldn't have to encounter such topics in leisure reading. However, these books shouldn't be removed from shelves as those who haven't faced such struggles can gain a better understanding of others.  Books for a more mature audience should be monitored and kept out of reach of children. When I was in sixth grade, I picked a book I thought was a ghost story but turned out to be about a young girl being raped. I was horrified and not mature enough to handle it. For weeks, I was scared. Mature - topic books should be separated from children's books as descriptions can emotionally scar kids.  Clearly labeling books with “suggestive” content would greatly help. If books are labeled for offensive words, comments, or situations, readers are less likely to be caught off - guard. This also helps children understand what they're about to read.  If we start removing books due to offensive topics, there won't be many left. Everyone interprets stories differently. By monitoring and labeling books, readers can decide if a book is right for them. So, don't take away the joy of reading from those who love it. Let people know what to expect when they open a new book.
99	3076	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should remove certain materials if they are offensive to someone. First, people don't go to the library to be offended. They go to read, study, and have a quiet time. Those who use the library as a resource shouldn't encounter offensive books, movies, or magazines because of what the author writes. Offended people might stop going to the library.  The librarian is in charge of what's displayed in the library. If a librarian thinks a book is okay to display, they can. But if the book offends someone, it should be removed. If the book is useful for study, it can be kept in a place where people can request it.  Offensive materials shouldn't even be published in public areas. I think there should be a law against offensive literature, music, movies, etc., in libraries. Nowadays, people can donate items to libraries, but they should ensure the items are suitable for display.  In conclusion, offensive materials should be removed from libraries. Libraries are for quiet reading, not for causing offense. The librarian should control what's displayed, and offensive materials have no place in a public area.
100	3077	2	2	It's impossible to make everyone happy. No matter what, someone will be offended by something, especially in the media. Whether it's a book, movie, or song, there will always be someone unhappy with it. But that doesn't mean we should take it away from those who enjoy it. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 guarantees freedom of speech and press. Removing “offensive” material violates this right.  Moreover, sheltering the public and pretending the world is perfect doesn't help. Future generations will be devastated when they face the real world with its biases and prejudices.  In ninth grade, I read “To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5” by @PERSON1. This book shows the harsh prejudice in the @LOCATION4 in the past. It could be considered offensive to some in the southern @LOCATION1 due to stereotypes and language. African - @CAPS6 might be offended by the racist comments. However, it's a classic, praised and taught worldwide. Reading it taught me about the @LOCATION1's past and progress in racial acceptance. We can learn from media's mistakes and grow as people when exposed to offensive material, preventing history from repeating.  Theology is a controversial topic across cultures. In bookstores, you can find religious and atheistic books. Music stores have bands that bash religion and theistic worship bands. Movie theaters offer movies with different religious themes. Banning such works because they might offend someone limits people's exploration of theology, interests, and personal growth.  It's unfair to take something away from one person just because it might offend another. Banning certain works harms society. It limits awareness of the world and history, intellectual expansion, and the exploration of interests. We should keep things free.
101	3078	2	2	"I firmly believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media should remain available in stores and libraries. We need to ask ourselves some crucial questions. Why would we remove them from libraries? What would people read when these materials offer insights into historical events like slavery and the development of automobiles? Who would prefer to read about unimportant and boring topics?  We should not take books off the library shelves. While we have the right to do so, it would deprive our children of valuable knowledge. By removing these materials, we would be denying them information about significant historical events and famous figures.  If we were to remove most of the books from the library, we would have little of substance to read. There would be nothing left but trivial content. It's important to note that if we removed all ""inappropriate"" books, there would be few books remaining, as nearly every book contains some element that could be considered controversial. This would leave only children's books in the library.  Who would want to visit a library knowing they would only find uninteresting and boring materials? Clearly, no one wants to do that, except perhaps some older individuals. Reading is enjoyable for many children, who want to explore different topics. If we remove these books, we are taking away their opportunity to learn and have fun.  In conclusion, there is no reason to remove books from libraries. Doing so would eliminate a vital source of knowledge and entertainment. Our children need access to these materials to understand history and the world around them. We should not take away something that is so important to us."
102	3079	2	2	"I recently read a letter by Katherine Paterson regarding library censorship. Here, I'll share my thoughts on this matter.  I've been an avid reader since first grade. However, I can't recall the names of many books I've read, mainly because they were unappealing and forgettable. Reading those books felt like a waste of time. I realize now that I should read because I want to, not just because I have nothing else to do. Around seventh grade, I stopped reading because every book I picked up seemed incredibly dull, and it took ages for something interesting to happen.  Thankfully, there are exceptional books that can have a profound impact on our lives. These ""life - changing"" books contain elements that are engaging for anyone who reads them. Unfortunately, some of these elements may be considered inappropriate by certain audiences. For example, a book about murder might be offensive to someone who has lost a loved one to murder, but it could be seen as a work of art by someone who has overcome the fear of death.  It's disheartening that some people advocate for censoring or removing these books from libraries. Books go through a long and arduous process before they reach the shelves. They are written, reviewed, and selected for publication, which can take years. Removing them is unfair to the time and effort invested in their creation.  If you don't like a book, simply don't read it. Moreover, these books can serve important purposes. A book about a child overcoming rape can inspire victims, and a book about a child dealing with the death of parents can help others in similar situations cope with grief.  In conclusion, all books have a purpose and should remain on the shelves of local bookstores. Even if a book doesn't appeal to you, it could have a significant impact on someone else. We should let these books fulfill their intended roles."
103	3080	2	2	As a parent, you might wonder what you want your child to be exposed to. In my opinion, inappropriate materials should not be removed from library shelves. Kids generally know what is appropriate and inappropriate for them. That's why libraries separate the children's section from the adult section. Librarians also ensure that children don't check out inappropriate materials.  Libraries are public spaces that should offer a wide variety of books, movies, and other media. Moreover, inappropriate content is not limited to libraries. It can be found in schools, on the radio, TV, and in video games. As parents, it's our responsibility to shield our children from things we don't want them to see or hear as much as possible.  A child is only likely to be exposed to inappropriate content if their parents are neglectful and irresponsible. Someday, your children will ask questions about the inappropriate things they hear or see at school. At that time, you should be open and honest with them in a mature and clean way.  I'm deeply troubled by the fact that many young children today are exposed to violent video games, music about drugs, alcohol, and sex. When I was their age, I had no idea what these things were. It's wrong for parents to let their children be around such content, especially when it comes with warning labels.  It's concerning to see that children are getting younger and younger when they are exposed to this kind of inappropriate material. I can't understand why parents allow it. In conclusion, while we can't completely eliminate inappropriate content from our children's lives, parents should take more responsibility to protect their children and guide them appropriately.
104	3081	2	2	Today, I'll share my views on offensive materials in libraries. Some people find offensive materials like books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries unacceptable, while others believe it's fine to have them in a public place. The perception of what is offensive is subjective, and everyone has a different perspective.  First of all, these items should not be simply removed from the shelves and discarded. Some people may find these materials highly educational and relatable, even if others consider them offensive. If offensive materials are causing a lot of complaints in libraries, a separate section could be created for them. This way, people who are bothered by such content won't have to encounter it.  Libraries are public institutions that should offer a diverse range of materials. People have different interests and views, so it's important to accommodate a wide variety of content. We should accept that not everyone will like the same things. Instead of being self - centered, we should consider the bigger picture and respect the fact that different people have different preferences.  In conclusion, these are my thoughts on offensive materials in libraries. I hope that others can understand my point of view and recognize the importance of maintaining a diverse collection in libraries.
105	3082	2	2	"The question of whether certain materials, such as books, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are considered offensive is a complex one. Many of these so - called ""offensive"" works are based on real - life experiences of the authors. However, some people lack a realistic view and fail to recognize that these materials can represent the lives of others and potentially shape the future of many.  Some individuals strive to be the best at the expense of others, and this behavior is not only sad but can also lead to serious consequences, such as criminal behavior. These experiences are sometimes depicted in these materials, but unfortunately, some people misinterpret them.  I firmly believe that these materials should not be removed. They help us have a better understanding of life and enable us to defend ourselves. They are valuable resources that can contribute to our growth and knowledge. If people find them offensive, they can simply choose to ignore them. Many others, including myself, find these materials helpful.  It's unlikely that these materials contain truly inappropriate or nasty information, especially in places like libraries and stores where both adults and children visit. People are generally aware of what is going on in these materials.  I recall reading a book that was rather sad but very insightful. It had a lot of strong language, but it helped me understand life better. It was about two boys, and the raw language actually enhanced the story and our understanding of it.  In conclusion, these materials, whether they are books, magazines, music, or movies, are an important part of our cultural and educational landscape. They are like a record of our lives, including the difficult times. We should be grateful to those who share their experiences through these mediums, as they contribute to our collective knowledge and growth."
106	3083	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, music, and magazines, should be subject to censorship in libraries. Libraries are public spaces accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds. Children may encounter inappropriate content, individuals of different religions may be exposed to offensive language, and this can tarnish the library's reputation.  I recall hearing offensive language in the library, which unfortunately influenced my behavior. I started using such language around positive people in my life. This experience taught me how easily one can be affected by negative content. For children, the impact can be even more detrimental. They are taught to be positive, but exposure to inappropriate material may lead them to imitate it. My mother's physical discipline was a harsh reminder of the consequences of such behavior.  People of different religions may also find offensive content in libraries distressing. For instance, a Muslim entering a library and hearing music filled with profanity has the right to report the incident and claim that the library lacks proper restrictions. While it may be acceptable for a book to contain a few offensive words, libraries must set limits.  Moreover, a library with a bad image faces a significant problem. As negative incidents accumulate, patrons will stop visiting and discourage others from going. This can ultimately lead to the library's closure.  If offensive materials are not removed, children may imitate what they see or hear, and complaints will be filed against the library. If I had issues with a library's restriction levels, I would simply stop going. At the very least, libraries should mark sections with potentially offensive content so that patrons are aware of what they are about to encounter. In conclusion, censorship is necessary in libraries to protect the well - being of patrons and maintain a positive image.
107	3084	2	2	I think that certain items like books, movies, music, and magazines present a dilemma regarding their placement on library shelves. On one hand, they should stay because they might pique the interest of some readers. If people find the content offensive, they can choose not to visit that library.  Personally, I'm not easily offended. But I've witnessed others in the library getting upset about the content on the shelves. The reaction of those who take offense to what they read should be considered when deciding whether to keep such items on the shelves.  On the other hand, some of these materials may be inappropriate and not suitable for people's eyes. I believe all libraries should standardize their content. This way, there won't be so much controversy about what's on the shelves. In conclusion, a balanced approach is needed, taking into account both the interests of readers and the appropriateness of the content.
108	3085	2	2	In my opinion, some books should be removed from all libraries. Young children should not be exposed to the content in these books, and some of the material can unknowingly offend people.  Parents have a crucial role in monitoring what their children read and watch. They need to teach kids why certain shows and books are inappropriate. When parents are vigilant, children are more likely to behave well.  The potential for books to offend people is a serious concern. No child should be looking at or reading such material. Therefore, it's clear that these offensive books should be taken out of libraries. In conclusion, removing inappropriate books from libraries is essential for the well - being of children and to avoid offending patrons.
109	3086	2	2	As we all know, a local library is a place where a vast amount of information can be found. However, the question arises: is some of this information too inappropriate to be in a public space?  Many libraries have books, magazines, and music with explicit content on their shelves. In today's world, there is language and content that can be offensive to older people and viewers of public broadcasting. While I agree that some material can be separated from mainstream content, overall, I don't think it's a big deal.  Most ordinary people, including myself, don't really care about strict censorship. Censorship is ineffective because, regardless of what steps library officials take, people will eventually come across the content. In conclusion, while some separation of inappropriate content can be done, strict censorship in libraries is unnecessary.
110	3087	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials, such as uncensored books, magazines, movies, and music, should not be freely accessible to children in libraries. Libraries are public spaces, and it is the responsibility of the staff to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content.  There should be a designated area for such materials, and children should not be allowed in without a parent or guardian. It is concerning that some children are reading books that are not suitable for them without adult permission. This not only affects the children negatively but also offends parents.  Parents wonder how their children are learning inappropriate things, and it is the staff's fault for not preventing such access. The library should post clear guidelines about what children should not see or read.  I have every right to voice my concerns to the staff when my child is exposed to inappropriate content. They are aware that such materials are not suitable for children, yet they allow access.  In conclusion, it is essential that libraries take steps to censor and restrict access to inappropriate materials for children. This will protect the well - being of children and address the concerns of parents.
111	3088	2	2	In my view, libraries ought to offer a comprehensive collection encompassing all types of books, music, movies, and magazines. Limiting the library's offerings would likely deter many patrons. For instance, if I needed a specific book for school and the library didn't have it, I'd be at a loss as to where else to look. The essence of a library lies in its diverse book collection; otherwise, its purpose becomes questionable. That said, some books may contain content too explicit for children. Regarding music, I believe libraries should impose restrictions. A significant portion of music contains profanity, which not everyone wishes to hear in a library setting. Moreover, the library is meant to be a quiet place, so allowing music listening might not be appropriate. However, this might disappoint music enthusiasts. Also, certain music could be unsuitable for children's ears. When it comes to movies, an age - limit system should be in place. Children should only be permitted to watch kid - friendly movies. Teenagers can watch both kid and teen movies, while adults should have access to all movies. As for magazines, libraries should stock a wide range, from those for children to those for adults, but segregate them into different sections. For example, children's magazines should be placed with children's books, and adult magazines with adult reading materials. Although some magazines may be explicit, the library should ensure they are kept in the adult section. Some books may be offensive, but a library's role is to provide a wide variety of books. In my opinion, all books, regardless of their content, should have a place in the library. I've never encountered an extremely explicit or offensive book. If there are such books, they should be kept in the adults - only section. Every book deserves a spot in the library.
112	3089	2	2	We've all encountered radio songs censored by continuous beeps due to profanity, and witnessed @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies treated the same way. Similarly, books and magazines are censored by either obscuring offensive language or replacing letters with asterisks. Many people see no harm in this and support it, while others believe it's not a significant issue as people will eventually be exposed to such content. If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you desire your work to be published exactly as you originally created it? Most professionals in these fields would, and they often become frustrated when their work is edited. They want their message to be heard in its entirety. Sometimes, removing offensive elements can lead to the message being less clear than it would be with the original wording. This might cause the original meaning to be completely lost, and the work could end up conveying a different message from what was intended. On the other hand, a crucial question emerges: If you were a parent, would you want your children to be exposed to inappropriate movie scenes or harsh language in music? Most parents would strongly oppose this and advocate for editing out content that is too mature for their children. However, it's inevitable that children will eventually encounter such things. In conclusion, censorship should be disregarded. Children will inevitably come across bad language, inappropriate content, and offensive passages. Censoring can distort the original message and anger creators. Given the abundance of unpalatable content in the world, it's impossible to censor everything.
113	3090	2	2	There has been a discussion about which books should remain on the shelf. If an author has the right to remove a book they abhor, then everyone else should have the same right. However, if this were the case, there would soon be no books left to read. People seem to think that they should have access to non - offensive books. When it comes to offensive books, they have no place in our reading choices. If kids are reading offensive books, they should stop immediately. Offensive books are detrimental and should be avoided at all costs. One should always opt for non - offensive books. Non - offensive books, like @CAPS1, are generally well - received. If more books were non - offensive, people would read more often. However, if people were to read non - offensive books constantly, there might not be enough @CAPS1 for other activities. We don't deserve books filled with bad content; instead, we deserve better, non - offensive reading materials. Every day, we read books without always knowing if they are offensive. If we unknowingly read offensive books, we might end up repeating inappropriate content, which could lead to serious trouble. Getting in trouble can result in severe punishment, such as losing something for a certain period of @CAPS1. In conclusion, it's essential to understand what we can and cannot read. We should know how to handle offensive books, recognize that non - offensive books can be educational, and be aware of the consequences of repeating offensive content from books. We may end up losing something valuable for a while if we're not careful.

If a particular book contains profanity that some find offensive, rather than starting a controversy over it, individuals should simply choose a more suitable alternative. Some media products are labeled with parental guidance warnings, indicating that they are intended for a specific age range. Based on my experience, this system is generally acceptable. However, if the situation gets out of hand, it's best to move on to something else. Removing books from the library might not be the best solution, as some people may be looking for a particular book that they can't find elsewhere. Librarians can help resolve this issue by placing age - appropriate materials in different sections. For example, books and other media suitable for older audiences can be placed in the older age section, while those for younger people can be in the younger section. This way, people of all ages can enjoy the library's offerings without being exposed to inappropriate content. In conclusion, by implementing a proper age - based segregation system, libraries can address the issue of offensive content and ensure that everyone can access media that is suitable for them.
115	3092	2	2	Do you think books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves? If so, you should read my newspaper article. I don't believe there are any books or other media that should be taken off the shelves. There are many books that kids can read, but as parents, we can guide our children not to read inappropriate ones. If they start reading an unsuitable book, we can take it away from them. Some books are clearly not suitable for kids, but it's our responsibility as adults to prevent them from reading such materials. Children will always try to get what they want, so removing books from the shelves won't solve the problem, as they may still find a way to access them. The only effective approach is to closely monitor our children and ensure they don't engage with content we don't approve of. In conclusion, removing books from the shelves won't benefit anyone. Instead, we should focus on keeping our children away from the content we deem inappropriate.
116	3093	2	2	If I were the owner or an employee of a library, I would stock books, music, movies, and magazines that many people find offensive. However, these offensive materials would not be placed in the children's area of the library; instead, they would be available in the adult section. One might wonder why I would keep such items. It is because adults and older teenagers should be capable of handling and behaving maturely when reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to music. If a particular book, movie, or piece of music causes violent behavior in the community, I will immediately remove it from the shelves. It's as straightforward as that. If parents are angry about these offensive materials, they should prevent their children from accessing them. They can choose children's books like [@CAPS1] or those from [@ORGANIZATION1] rather than books by [@PERSON1]. Let children read books filled with pictures and colors, and watch [@CAPS1] or content from [@ORGANIZATION1] instead of [@CAPS3] on a [@CAPS4]. My question is, why shouldn't people be allowed to read and watch what they want, even if it is offensive? Some people enjoy watching scary and offensive movies or listening to rap music. We all live in the same world, but we have different preferences. In my opinion, offensive books, music, and movies should remain in libraries. It is only young children who should be restricted from accessing them.
117	3094	2	2	The removal of books, music, movies, and other materials from the shelves simply because some people dislike them or find them offensive is not a justifiable reason to discard them. Many individuals enjoy these items and can utilize them for school research or class - related topics. I know for certain that some of the music my friends and I listen to would bother others, but it was our choice to purchase the music, books, or movies. We all have diverse opinions on what constitutes 'good' music or movies. I can understand why some people would want us to get rid of certain materials due to foul language or racial slurs, but it is our money and our decision to buy them. Some teens take the volume of music to an extreme, making the lyrics audible in [@LOCATION1]. With the explicit words and comments in the music, it's understandable why adults oppose our purchases. Out of respect for others, we can lower the volume of the radio, refrain from making inappropriate comments about movies, and handle books in a mature manner. Secondly, given the extensive research and studying required in school, it would be pointless if we were unable to access books or magazines for our research. Nowadays, students can choose their own research topics, and if they are passionate about a particular topic, they should have the necessary materials to gather information. I recognize that the use of music, movies, magazines, and books can sometimes get out of hand, but we are capable of being responsible. Teens who behave immaturely do not deserve to have access to these materials. We need to learn to use them with respect. Removing these items from the shelves is not a good idea because some students actually use them for educational purposes.
118	3095	2	2	I believe that offensive books should be removed from the shelves of public libraries. Consider a scenario where a [@NUM1] - year - old stumbles upon a book that speaks ill of their race. Or, a man enters the library and discovers an offensive book about his race; he might escalate the situation, perhaps demanding that the book be removed from the shelf. Similarly, if a woman enters the library with her child and finds a book that contains explicit content about sex, drugs, guns, and knives, it can be extremely inappropriate. Public libraries are places where many children and their parents come to read, conduct research, and do homework. Therefore, to ensure a suitable environment for all users, offensive books should be taken off the shelves. In conclusion, for the well - being and appropriate experience of library patrons, especially children, it is necessary for public libraries to remove offensive books.
119	3096	2	2	In my opinion, we should keep all existing materials and acquire more. There is a vast amount of knowledge to be gained, and the more information we have, the better. I think libraries should add more magazines to the stands so that people can access a wider range of information. Although not everything in a magazine can be trusted, one can still find numerous facts about the topics they want to learn. However, children should not have unrestricted access to all materials. Some content may teach children things they are not ready to learn. Therefore, there should be supervision to prevent children from accessing inappropriate materials while still allowing adults to learn and discover new things. Not all information should be hidden. After all, knowledge can potentially save the world.
120	3097	2	2	I [@CAPS1] truly wish that nothing was censored, but my opinion seems to carry no weight. I'm just a kid with no say in the matter. Shouldn't I care about what I'm forced not to see? I'm certain that many parents don't adhere to censorship rules. For example, they might buy a rated [@CAPS2] movie or game for their [@NUM1] - year - old child instead of waiting until the child is [@NUM2]. But the fact that parents follow the law regarding censorship is often overlooked. I say 'to hell with the law' because when it comes down to it, it's the parents' right to introduce things to their children, not the government's. I think [@CAPS5] have never really had a choice in matters that directly affect them, and we should. [@CAPS5] have to follow rules until they are [@NUM2] years old. Why is that? I wish I knew the answer, but I don't. There is no logical reason for [@CAPS5] not to have a vote on issues that impact them. For all I know, there could be a law right now that will make my generation less powerful than the previous one. I'm not saying this is definitely true, but it's a possibility. Video games are my weakness, and I don't see a reason for them to be censored. When people claim that '[@CAPS5] who play violent video games will become murderers,' it frustrates me. There is no evidence to support this claim. I know [@CAPS5] who have been censored their entire lives, and when they are finally exposed to certain things, they can't handle it. It's sad that they can't even watch the news and learn about the world because they've been shielded for so long. I don't know where the idea of censorship originated. Did their parents tell them certain things were bad and they should never watch or read them? I believe it might come from the media itself. I can imagine headlines like '[@CAPS5] watching [@CAPS6] movies turn into murderers' along with some made - up statistics. What I'm trying to say is that I try not to let others' beliefs influence my own. I hope that by writing this, I haven't caused anyone to change their beliefs against their will.
121	3098	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should not remove books, movies, magazines, etc., just because some people find them offensive. Everyone should have the opportunity to access these materials, rather than restricting them to only those who don't find them offensive. There could be individuals or groups who genuinely like such items. Moreover, even if some people are offended by an object, others might need it for educational purposes, like schoolwork.  For instance, if libraries remove a book on human trafficking due to its offensive nature to some, and a local school assigns a project on this topic, students won't be able to use those books for their research. It's unfair to deprive everyone of access to these materials just because a few find them offensive. Libraries are public spaces where everyone has the right to borrow items. So, in conclusion, I oppose the removal of these materials from libraries based on the offense taken by some.
122	3099	2	2	"My personal stance on library censorship is one of low tolerance, and there are several reasons for this. Many guardians prevent their children from reading books like ""Twilight"", ""@PERSON1"", or the ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" series because of their beliefs about what is real. However, what some consider non - real, like magic, spells, and vampires, is not a reason to censor these works.  Firstly, different people have different preferences. An athlete may not find a cooking and cleaning book appealing, and a cook may not be interested in an athletics book. Just because one person's beliefs or standards for offensiveness differ doesn't mean we should censor certain materials. We shouldn't ruin the experience for those who enjoy stories like a male ""@CAPS1"" falling in love with a normal ""@CAPS3"" girl.  Secondly, having a low level of censorship in libraries provides more variety. With a wide range of books on the shelves, such as twenty different ""@PERSON1"" books, patrons can freely browse and check out what they like. The ability to choose from mystery, drama, comedy, or horror books keeps people coming back to the library. I know I would return to my library after finishing an interesting series.  Thirdly, having diverse reading and viewing materials is crucial. Many books are now being adapted into films, which makes people eager to finish the book quickly to watch the movie. Forming an opinion on a story is better when one reads the book first and then watches the movie.  In conclusion, just as children oppose school uniforms because clothing shows individuality, the books we read also reflect our uniqueness. Therefore, due to the diversity of people, the need for variety, and the importance of different reading and viewing materials, my personal view on library censorship is a low - tolerance standard. We shouldn't let our disbelief in magic or wizardry ruin the experience for others."
123	3100	2	2	I strongly disagree with the removal of materials from the library. All materials, including books, music, movies, magazines, and CDs, are an integral part of the library, serving the school and its users. However, I also believe that offensive materials should be removed.  Sometimes, when I have nothing interesting to do, I go to my home library or the public library to find a book. But if there are offensive materials in the library, it can cause problems. For example, children looking for cartoon or animal books may get frustrated if they encounter offensive content. Similarly, parents may be angry if they come across offensive materials while searching for information or just browsing. Some parents may even stop visiting the library.  I've been fortunate that the school and library I frequent don't have any offensive or inappropriate materials, which is why I respect the people who manage them. If I were to take my parents and little brother to an unknown library with offensive materials, my parents would be mad at me for bringing them to an inappropriate place.  In conclusion, while I support the preservation of library materials in general, offensive materials should be removed to ensure a positive experience for all users.
124	3101	2	2	I don't think books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed from libraries. However, I do believe that access to these materials should be monitored based on age. Younger children should not be exposed to adult or teenage - oriented content.  One way to implement this monitoring is through the child's library card. The card could include the child's name, age, grade, and date of birth. If a child wants to borrow certain restricted materials, a parent must be present and show identification to prove their age.  Teenagers also need to be monitored. Even though they are almost adults, some parents may not agree with the materials their teens are accessing. In such cases, there could be stickers on their library cards to indicate the restrictions.  In conclusion, despite the many opinions on what children should read, watch, or listen to, it's important to have measures in place to monitor their access to different materials. This way, we can ensure that children are exposed to appropriate content.
125	3102	2	2	Imagine taking your child to the library. You've worked hard to teach your child respect and good manners. All those values could be undermined if they read a bad magazine or listen to an explicit song.  I support library censorship. Many people wonder where their children learn curse words or inappropriate sexual behavior and don't consider the media as the culprit. Libraries have been diligent in keeping children's areas free of explicit materials and ensuring that magazines like '@CAPS1' don't make it onto their shelves.  Explicit and offensive materials should be removed. I've seen offensive content fall into the hands of kids. When they are exposed to songs about money, sex, and abuse, their childish innocence fades. Some books can give them the wrong ideas and encourage unlawful decisions. For example, a teen - pregnancy book might present options like keeping the baby and facing the consequences or aborting the baby and moving on. Some media may advocate for abortion as the easier option, which could lead children to react before thinking.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is essential. It relieves parents from worrying about their children being exposed to inappropriate content and getting the wrong ideas. We should all support library censorship to create a more respectful environment.
126	3103	2	2	In today's society, we seem to be allowing children to do as they please, giving them the impression that we don't care about their actions. However, this is not the case. We need to establish clear boundaries for what kids can and cannot do, and show them that we are aware of their activities. I believe there should be an age - policy in libraries. Any books with adult content should be placed in the adult section. To check out materials from this section, one should be at least eighteen years old. If this requirement is too strict, then parents should sign a consent form. Books, movies, and magazines with adult content can be harmful to children, affecting their actions and behaviors. The impact on their lives depends on the age at which they are exposed to such content. We must demonstrate that we care about their well - being. From personal experience, I know that exposure to such content can rapidly change a person. Nowadays, the media portrays money, alcohol, fame, and drugs as positive things, which are then presented to children through movies, books, and magazines. This is clearly wrong. For all these reasons, we should implement censorship and restrictions in libraries. We are allowing children to grow up too quickly and introducing them to inappropriate things too early. In a sense, we are brainwashing them into leading a destructive life through adult - oriented materials. By taking appropriate measures, we can better protect the healthy development of children.
127	3104	2	2	We often hear the claim that the media is ruining our youth. Teachers, parents, and grandparents all tell us how different their world was. They point out that the media in their time was less explicit about sex and violence, and there were no violent video games teaching children that killing is acceptable. Due to their accounts, we tend to blame the media for the problems in the world of @DATE1. However, the truth is that it is the parents' responsibility, not the media's. Parents should teach children the difference between right and wrong. If parents fulfill their duties properly, the youth of @DATE1 won't need everything to be censored. I firmly believe that there should be no censorship. Censorship allows people to control what we learn, destroy information that goes against their beliefs, and violate our God - given right to freedom of speech. Censorship will limit the knowledge available in @DATE1. History has shown us the negative effects of censorship. For example, the @ORGANIZATION1 censored and destroyed anything that went against them, including books, customs, art, and music. We condemned their actions then, and we would be no different if we engage in censorship now. It could potentially destroy someone's way of life and future masterpieces, as well as history and the process of learning. If we allow censorship, anything that contradicts our personal beliefs will be destroyed. For instance, a Christian might not allow their child to read the @LOCATION1, and a Muslim might not let their child read the @CAPS1. Censorship would mean destroying other people's beliefs, and no one has the right to govern what others believe. Moreover, censorship would eliminate our freedom of speech and the ability to express ourselves. If we prevent people from reading certain materials because we think they are wrong, we are taking away their opportunity to learn new ideas. Newspapers would become homogeneous and eventually shut down. Once we start sacrificing our freedom of speech, it will be difficult to stop those who are restricting it from taking more rights. In conclusion, while there may be offensive content in the media, books, and music, it is a part of life. We should not impose censorship, as it would undermine our learning, beliefs, and freedom of speech. Allowing censorship could lead us down a dangerous path towards a dictatorship - like situation.
128	3105	2	2	Censorship in libraries is not a necessary solution. Just because some materials may be offensive to certain individuals, it doesn't mean that everything should be censored. Those who find something offensive should simply choose not to engage with it. It should be an individual's choice whether to read a particular item or not. If a person is offended by a book, they can put it down. The book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' has offended many people, but I found it interesting and educational. If it were censored, the story would change significantly, and I would have missed the opportunity to learn about @LOCATION1's history. If we were to remove all the books and magazines that are offensive to someone, there would be very little left on the library shelves, perhaps only children's books about kittens. This is clearly not a desirable outcome. I am strongly against censorship. If a material is offensive to you, you have the right not to read or listen to it, but you should not deprive others of the opportunity to access it. Censorship would limit the diversity of knowledge and ideas available in libraries, and we should respect the individual's right to make their own choices.
129	3106	2	2	The library is a valuable place for learning, discovery, and the acquisition of knowledge, open to anyone willing to explore its vast collections. It offers a wide range of materials, including children's books, young - adult novels, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, music, and movies. However, there are also some inappropriate materials in libraries, such as books with racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments. Parents should not have to worry about their children accidentally encountering such materials. I have a serious concern about books containing racial slurs. Imagine an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 woman taking her @NUM1 - year - old daughter to the library for a school project. Instead of finding useful information, the child comes across a book making fun of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and using inappropriate names. Such an experience can cause significant emotional and mental harm to a child. These types of books should be removed from library shelves immediately. Sexual content in libraries is also a major issue. While some books may have a certain amount of sexual content, I am referring to novels with detailed sex scenes or covers with almost - naked women. If someone wants to read such books, they can go to a sex store. These books have no place in libraries, as they make our society look bad and taint our places of knowledge. Offensive religious comments in libraries are unacceptable. Everyone in the @LOCATION1 has the right to choose their own religion and practice it freely. We should not have books in libraries that contain rude comments about different religions. For example, a @CAPS5 woman should not have to encounter a book that insults her religion. Such books should not be part of our library collections. Although I advocate for the removal of inappropriate materials, I understand that there must be limits to censorship. If we start removing books without proper boundaries, we may end up with empty libraries. The goal is to protect children from harmful content while still maintaining the diversity of knowledge in libraries. Parents should take the responsibility to ensure that books, movies, magazines, and music with racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments are removed from libraries. By doing so, we can create a healthier learning environment for everyone.
130	3107	2	2	As @CAPS1, we have the privileges of freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Even though some works may be perceived as offensive or inappropriate, I believe they should remain accessible to the public. People may or may not agree with the ideas expressed in these works, but the right to hold an opinion is fundamental. These offensive or harsh pieces of literature can serve as learning tools. They can show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate. Everyone has the right to their beliefs, and others may or may not concur, but this does not negate the right to express them. Katherine Paterson once said that we can all think of a book we don't want children to take off the shelf. I have read offensive literature myself, but despite its disturbing nature, I'm glad I was exposed to it. It educated me about what was once considered acceptable behavior, and I can now teach others that such behavior is wrong. Removing these materials from public view would be a serious mistake. Many people are unaware of the historical beliefs of others that have influenced our nation and the world. These books, though sometimes harsh, are educational and can help us distinguish between right and wrong. If they are removed from library shelves, people, especially children, may start to think that certain incorrect or offensive ideas are appropriate. As the saying goes, '@CAPS2 who do not know their history are bound to repeat it'. Banning offensive literature would create new problems. For example, many historical books convey hatred and discrimination. If these works were not available, people would not learn that it is wrong to hate others because of their differences. These books provide valuable information about how people used to think and show us the correct way to live. In conclusion, we should not remove these materials from libraries. By keeping them accessible, we can ensure that people, especially the younger generation, are educated about different ideas, both right and wrong, and can make informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of history and society.
131	3108	2	2	Libraries are well - known as places where individuals can access materials on virtually any topic of interest, whether it's a book, movie, or magazine. They are a valuable resource available to everyone. However, it's puzzling why some libraries choose to remove certain valuable materials from their shelves.  In recent years, library censorship has been the focus of numerous news reports. In most cases, library patrons have been outraged that specific materials were deemed unsuitable for the library. I wholeheartedly agree with them. People have the right to choose what they read, watch, and listen to. Opinions vary; what one person loves, another may hate. But the fact that one person dislikes or is offended by a library item doesn't mean all other patrons should be denied access to it. I believe that if a single person checks out a resource and gains knowledge or enjoyment from it, the library has fulfilled its purpose and benefited the community by offering that material.  In conclusion, library censorship is restrictive and unjust. It creates obstacles for those seeking knowledge and takes away people's freedom of choice. Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library item, and censorship makes this impossible.
132	3109	2	2	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I couldn't agree more. I believe that some of the books, music, movies, and magazines in our libraries today are inappropriate. Offensive materials can have a negative impact on students and young children, influencing their view of life and their environment.  In today's world, children often imitate what they see. If these media give them the impression that certain behaviors are 'cool,' they are likely to follow suit. In my community, I've noticed that kids tend to copy one another during games like tag and hide - and - seek. So, books, music, movies, and magazines play a significant role in shaping their behavior.  I've had personal experiences with offensive books. There are books by @PERSON3 that use cruel language, use women's body parts as symbols, and contain other rude content. My little sister came across one of these books, and it was difficult for me to explain to her that it was not suitable for her age. I simply told her it was an adult book to dispel any inappropriate images from her mind.  Another incident involved my little cousin @PERSON2. He was looking at a Playboy Bunny magazine from the @ORGANIZATION1 library. I find it wrong that such magazines use women's bodies for men's viewing. I believe these types of magazines should not be in the library as they can give young men the wrong ideas about women.  I understand that not everyone will share my views on library censorship. Some parents allow their children to consume whatever media they want. However, I believe this approach can lead children to engage in inappropriate behavior. I hope my personal experiences can help parents ensure that their children read, listen to, and watch age - appropriate materials.
133	3110	2	2	I don't think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. People may need specific information, and these sources offer countless lessons.  For instance, if you need information on religion, you might find a relevant book or movie in the library. Similarly, if you want to learn about sex, a magazine or movie could provide new knowledge.  Different sources teach different lessons. Some people learn through examples presented in movies, music, or magazines. If I were looking for a source on music theory, I might need one of these materials to get the information I need.  These materials are valuable resources. We may not realize it, but we rely on them daily, just like we use search engines.  In conclusion, we need these sources because people may require specific information, different materials teach different lessons, and all sources are valuable assets.
134	3111	2	2	I believe that the right to remove books from library shelves is a bad idea. If this practice starts, libraries across the country will end up with empty shelves. Once the process of removing books begins, very few will remain.  We use books every day. Students rely on them for learning and entertainment in some classes. Books help us learn new words and important historical facts. Even adults enjoy reading in their free time.  It's wrong to remove a book just because some people think it's inappropriate. If so, libraries should have a special section for such books, restricting access to young children. However, a problem arises: which books should go into this section? One solution would be to establish a nationwide library service to set up the system and have people vote on which books to remove or place in the special section across all libraries. This approach can be applied to all library materials.  Another solution is for libraries to adopt a new labeling system in addition to the Dewey Decimal System. This new system could include critic reviews and summaries of the books. This would give readers more information about what they're about to read.  Books, music, and magazines in libraries exist for a reason. Someone wrote or composed them so that people like us can enjoy good stories, read informative magazines, and listen to great music.
135	3112	2	2	Libraries should never remove any material simply because it might be considered offensive. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. If the material violated the law, it probably wouldn't have been published in the first place.  People often get offended when they encounter something that goes against their personal views, ethics, or religion. However, they need to understand that others have different thoughts and values. Each person's opinion is equally important to them.  In today's world, many media sources are censored. It's crucial to have a place where people can freely access materials and express their opinions. As a student, I often struggle to find meaningful literature in the school library due to censorship. I understand that schools need to be cautious about what they expose students to. But it's great to have a public library where I can find more religious, derogatory, or less - accepted materials.  In conclusion, if people are offended by something on a library shelf, they can choose not to read, watch, or listen to it. But we shouldn't censor everything and deprive those who enjoy these materials of easy access.
136	3113	2	2	I firmly believe that books should not be removed from shelves due to being considered offensive. What one person finds offensive may not bother another. While individuals have the right to voice their opinion that a book is offensive, they do not have the right to prevent others from reading it. I understand that parents want to protect their children. Instead of simply banning a book, parents should communicate with their children, explaining why they object to a particular book. They could also allow their children to read it and then discuss their concerns.  I hold the same view regarding the censorship of music and movies. When I was twelve, I started listening to the music I liked, rather than what my mother played. My mother was worried about the lyrical content of the songs I listened to. She refused to buy me the music and prohibited me from listening to it. However, I would go to my friends' houses to listen to explicit music and watch rated movies. She couldn't really stop me because explicit language was everywhere.  I think parents should explain their concerns to teenagers instead of trying to restrict their access to certain music, and then let the teenagers make their own decisions. Censorship should be the responsibility of parents. Sometimes, when parents try to control their children too much, they actually push them away. That's why it's crucial for parents and children to have open and comfortable communication.
137	3114	2	2	Many individuals, including children, parents, and grandparents, visit libraries. I've realized that people go to these community - loved places to find peace and quiet. Some don't even go for the books; they may engage with music, read magazines, enjoy a cup of coffee, or use the internet. Some argue that certain books, music, and movies in libraries are inappropriate or offensive, but does this mean libraries should discard them?  There's no valid reason to ban these offensive materials. Firstly, libraries will lose customers. A large number of people enjoy listening to rap or other similar genres. It's difficult to find such music without swear words or sexual innuendos. Even I occasionally listen to this type of music for its catchy beats. Moreover, when listening to music in a library, people use headphones, so it doesn't disrupt others.  Secondly, customers who dislike the content of these materials don't have to choose them. If a book contains a sex scene or discusses drugs, one can simply avoid it. There are plenty of other books to choose from, including children's books. Those interested in these topics still have the right to select relevant materials. I've visited my public library many times, and I've never seen a book, music, or movie that was unappealing. If someone wants an offensive book, they need to search thoroughly, not just glance around.  Finally, freedom is a fundamental aspect. Isn't that what this country is all about? We have the freedom of speech, religion, and the right to choose the movies we watch. There are labels on movie backs indicating their ratings and content. We have the freedom to borrow or purchase these rated movies. As I've said, no one is forced to watch inappropriate movies, so we can simply choose what we like.  In conclusion, there's absolutely no reason to remove offensive books, music, or movies from libraries. These materials come in various types and styles and don't disturb anyone. Removing them would lead to a loss of customers, people can avoid inappropriate materials, and we have the freedom to choose what we consume. So, it's best to keep these so - called 'offensive' materials.
138	3115	2	2	There are many who believe that certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and should be removed from library shelves. Consider this: if you had to do a project on a subject that some find offensive and there was no information available, wouldn't you be frustrated? If you're interested in offensive topics, you should be able to visit your local library and access relevant books. Similarly, if you like offensive music, you should be able to listen to it on the radio without worrying about it being removed.  Some people are assigned projects for work or school. If the project's subject is offensive to some, they'll need access to books and other information at the library to complete their work. If all offensive books are removed, people won't be able to finish their tasks.  Some individuals are interested in offensive subjects. For example, if someone is interested in a particular topic like @PERSON1, they'd want to do research. If books and magazines on this subject disappear from library shelves, they won't be able to learn more.  Many think that much of today's radio music is offensive. If all such music is removed, there won't be much left to listen to, and many people will be angry. Additionally, songwriters will lose their source of income and jobs.  I believe that those who find these things offensive should avoid them and stop complaining. People who don't take offense will be glad that books, magazines, music, etc., aren't being removed. I hope that the removal of these materials from libraries and other places is carefully considered.
139	3116	2	2	In my view, if there are offensive books, music, movies, or magazines, we have the right to remove them from library shelves. I have a baby girl, and I don't want her to be exposed to offensive or vulgar content, whether through listening, watching, or reading.  I'm aware that this is a free country, and everyone has the right to their own opinions. Libraries are funded by taxpayers' money. If there are movies, books, music, and magazines that are offensive or vulgar, they should be removed. Children who are exposed to vulgar content may think it's acceptable or cool to say or do such things.  They may see inappropriate pictures, nudity, drugs, and violence. For instance, books may contain pictures of drugs like weed, cocaine, or pills. They may also see images of men hitting women or kids killing kids, which sets a bad example.  We live in a world where people are influenced by what they read, watch, and listen to. It's essential for parents to be aware of what their children are exposed to. The library is a place for learning, and only appropriate materials should be accessible. In conclusion, offensive and vulgar materials should be removed from library shelves to protect the well - being of children.
140	3117	2	2	When entering a library, people have different opinions about what should be on the shelves, especially considering that libraries are accessible to children of all ages. Some believe that only age - appropriate materials should be available, while others disagree.  In my opinion, libraries should have books for all age groups, but there should also be a dedicated children's section. If parents are concerned about the books their children might encounter, they can direct them to the children's section. There's no reason not to have a wide variety of books available.  Regarding magazines, movies, and music, my opinion is somewhat consistent. All types of music should be on the shelves because one can't listen to it just by looking at the cover. However, my stance on magazines and movies is a bit more nuanced. I think all types should be allowed, except for pornography.  The reason for my view is that children shouldn't overly influence what's placed on library shelves. Parents need to be responsible and monitor what their children are looking at. But in a public place like a library, there's a line to be drawn, and that line is clearly at the exclusion of pornography. In conclusion, libraries should offer a diverse range of materials while ensuring that inappropriate content like pornography is not available.
141	3118	2	2	Not all libraries are ideal. Some individuals visit libraries to use the computers and access websites discovered by children. Meanwhile, others need the computers for job applications, and library owners often require patrons to obtain a card. In some respects, this situation is unjustifiable. All kids can learn at the library and complete their work if necessary; there are so many things they can do that they could even stay there all week. From young children to adults, people can still learn in the @NUM1 century. You can learn about your ancestry, car crashes, or current global events. Whether it's Japanese or Chinese culture, you can gain a wealth of knowledge from the library and its books. It's up to families to use the library to learn more about themselves.
142	3119	2	2	With over six billion people in the world, there are six billion distinct personalities and opinions. Removing all offensive media is virtually impossible since almost everyone is offended by something. Some media is more offensive than others, but it might be a subject the author is passionate about, and they could be offended if their opinion is dismissed. With the global accessibility of the internet, media that was once only available in libraries is now online and can't be permanently removed from public view. It's illogical to think that removing materials from libraries will prevent people from being offended. There's a clear difference between raising awareness and being offensive. Some books and magazines aim to explain a culture and increase awareness, but authors worldwide can easily cross the line into offensiveness. Thus, authors should consider the people they're writing about, avoid stereotypes as they can be hurtful. There's already a large amount of offensive literature, and trying to find and restrict it all is irrational. If someone is offended by a written work, they should avoid reading it. However, this doesn't give authors the right to specifically target and offend a group. This is a two - sided issue. It can't be solely controlled by censoring libraries; it also depends on authors and readers. Authors and media producers should consider others and focus on raising awareness rather than offending. Readers should understand why an author might target them and avoid conflict by avoiding the material. Targeting and offending a group in literature is wrong, and simply removing materials from library shelves won't stop this practice. Libraries are becoming less relevant due to new technology, and it's unlikely they'll regain their former prominence. So, censoring libraries may not significantly help offended groups. Everyone has the right to express an opinion, but they should also consider others' feelings. With the abundance of accessible media, writers and producers need to think beyond themselves before publishing.
143	3120	2	2	What one person finds offensive can be very different from another's view. There's a vast amount of offensive material in the world, but removing it all wouldn't change much. Everyone has their own opinions and interpretations of what's offensive, so if we tried to remove all offensive materials, there'd be little left. For every piece of content, there's usually someone with a negative view. They might misunderstand it or simply think it's wrong. When asked what's offensive, people have diverse answers. For example, my grandpa loves all kinds of music and his life is centered around it. My grandma, on the other hand, dislikes some of his music because she says it goes against her beliefs. She pays close attention to the lyrics, while my grandpa focuses on the rhythm and beat. They often disagree about what music to listen to because of this difference in perception. If you ask people what they find offensive, you'll get countless different answers. If we removed content based on the sensitivities of a few, it would almost mean removing everything. So, I firmly believe that offensive materials shouldn't be pulled off the shelves.
144	3121	2	2	Personally, I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves just because they're considered offensive. However, I do think we need to protect young, developing children from reading books that might offend them or introduce concepts that could hinder their educational development. Kids who haven't been properly educated on controversial topics like drugs or alcohol might make bad decisions based on what they read. To address this issue, I propose a book - rating system. Similar to movie and video - game ratings, this system would indicate the appropriate age level for a book and explain the factors used for the rating. As a newspaper company, you're well - aware of our rights as citizens, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press. I don't think removing 'inappropriate' books from the shelves is a reasonable solution. I know from personal experience that when my rights are taken away, I get very angry. Authors, editors, photographers, and publishers work hard to put books on the shelves. Removing them would be a suppression of their rights as citizens. If I were an author and my book was removed, I'd be extremely upset. This could even lead to an author's strike until their books are available to readers again. However, as I mentioned, a book - rating system is a good idea. It allows authors to express themselves fully while informing readers about controversial content. I strongly recommend that you consider this proposal as it could prevent future conflicts between authors and the public.
145	3122	2	2	Why censor content? Are there movies, music, magazines, books, and other media in libraries that some people find offensive? Many believe so, while others aren't concerned. Should this content be removed from public library shelves or allowed to stay? Katherine Paterson stated that if one person has the right to remove a book they dislike, then everyone has that right, and eventually, there'll be no books left. Personally, I think some literature and magazines should be removed from libraries. Many books are filled with foul language, violence, and sexual content. For instance, I once went to a local library with my little sister. She was looking for a Disney magazine, but there were provocative magazines with half - naked women on the covers right next to the kids' magazines. This is an inappropriate image, and no parent wants their child exposed to such content at a young age. The music in libraries is also not clean. A lot of today's music promotes sex, violence, and drugs. My father always says that music in the past was suitable for all ages. Hip - hop and rap are the main culprits for inappropriate content, but rappers and producers are just creating what people want and what sells. Movies rented from libraries are also offensive. They contain similar inappropriate material as books, magazines, and music, all presenting an image that seems to appeal to a large part of society. Can't we find better content to attract the audience? In conclusion, I believe this offensive material should be removed from public library shelves. However, removing it might not be effective as people will find other sources. As Katherine said, if we remove everything, there won't be any books left.
146	3123	2	2	"I firmly believe that censorship should be implemented to a certain degree in libraries. Currently, numerous children can access inappropriate materials in libraries, yet some of these materials might also have utility. For instance, I once borrowed a movie from the public library. When I watched it with my mother at home, we found it extremely inappropriate, offensive, and it made the situation quite awkward and embarrassing. We were shocked that people of any age could access a movie as inappropriate as ""@CAPS1"".  Although there are materials that don't belong in libraries, some materials that some people find offensive are actually in the library for educational purposes. Subjects like gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity may be offensive to some, but there could be individuals who want to learn more about these topics for school projects or personal life issues. Someone might have a family member who identifies as homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman considering an abortion. What is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another.  In my opinion, censorship should be applied to some offensive materials. If the materials are educational, they can be beneficial to certain people. There will never be a perfect solution to this problem in the world. As the world evolves, so do human morals, and there is no content that is offensive to everyone in the world."
147	3124	2	2	"Have you ever been offended by a movie, book, song, or magazine? And did you have the option to choose whether to watch or read it? The question that interests many is whether offensive items should be removed from the shelves. In my view, they shouldn't.  I'm certain that if you ask anyone if they've ever been offended by a movie, book, or magazine, they can all provide an example. I doubt they would watch the offensive movie again, and if they did, it probably wasn't that bad. If something offends you, simply don't read or watch it. If you don't want your kids to watch something, just don't let them. You have the right to make that decision; no one is forcing you to engage with such content.  I admit that I've watched a few movies and read some books that perhaps weren't the best choices, but I made those choices voluntarily. No one compelled me.  Some of you might ask, ""What about at school?"" If a teacher assigns a book and your child is uncomfortable with it, discuss it with the teacher. Teachers are usually understanding and may provide an alternative book. They might also explain the reasons for having the class read the book and why children need exposure to such literature.  There will always be offensive books and movies. If we remove all the books in a library that have offended someone at some point, there won't be much left on the shelves. Everyone has different views on books and movies. What is offensive to you might be a great show to someone else. Therefore, I don't think offensive books, magazines, music, or movies should be removed from the shelves."
148	3125	2	2	Libraries house a wide range of books, from comedies to those depicting violence. Some people enjoy reading about war and violence, while others find such content offensive. Since people have the freedom to choose what to read, there's no need for libraries to remove books that some may find offensive.  Most of the time, books in libraries are labeled according to their content. People typically go to the sections they like and pick books from there. There's no reason for them to go to sections they dislike because they won't read books from those areas and may only cause disruptions to those who enjoy such books. Whether to read a book is a personal choice, so there's no need to worry about what others are reading as long as they're satisfied. If a parent doesn't want their child to read a certain type of book, that's their decision. However, other parents may want their children to explore different materials to develop their views on various subjects.  Everyone has different views and ideas. If everyone were the same, the world would be boring and there would be nothing to talk about. Reading different books and listening to different music enriches conversations because not everyone is familiar with the same subjects. Reading new types of books can even open people's eyes to the world's diversity. Children are often more open - minded than adults. If there aren't diverse books for children to try, they'll never know what they like or dislike. A book that one child likes may not be appealing to another child or an adult, which is normal as people are different.  If everyone removed the books or music they found offensive, there would be very little left on the shelves. Styles are often opposite, like comedies and sad books. People who like comedies may not like sad books and vice - versa. If they removed the books they disliked, there would be nothing left for either group to read. Even with best - selling books, some people wonder how they became so popular, but that's just the way it is. Some people like these books, and if one person's dislike led to the removal of the book, many others might never have the chance to read it and potentially have their lives changed. Books can have a significant impact on people's lives.  In conclusion, libraries shouldn't remove books just because someone found them offensive. People have the choice to read or not, and different views and ideas make the world more interesting.
149	3126	2	2	Real life contains explicit and violent elements, so there's no point in pretending otherwise. Libraries have the right to decide whether to remove books, movies, or music that they consider too graphic, violent, or aggressive. It's futile to try to censor the lives of kids and teenagers because explicit content is everywhere, not just in the media and literature. The attempt to shield this generation's children and teenagers from such content has already failed.  Currently, a large portion of movies, music, and books focus on violent, aggressive, inappropriate, or explicit themes. Removing these items from library shelves is pointless. There will always be violence, crime, and offensive language in the real world. It's understandable that some parents don't want their children exposed to such content, but in the real world, parents can't always be there to protect them.  Libraries are public places, and a certain percentage of the audience would be upset, frustrated, or angry if the books, music, or movies they liked were removed due to censorship. It might seem that exposure to violent or explicit content could have a negative impact on the listener, but children and teens are already exposed to such language on the streets, at school, and in parks. So, trying to censor their reading and viewing materials is a waste of time.  In my experience, I've grown up around people who have been exposed to violent music, graphic movies, and other explicit materials without being negatively affected. I saw my first rated @CAPS1 movie when I was nine. Parents can set an age limit to some extent, but at a certain point, censorship becomes a waste of time. With schools teaching students about the benefits of abstinence and sexual diseases, students are more likely to make the right choices regardless of what they see in movies, read, or listen to. Any child with internet access can be exposed to all kinds of inappropriate content.  In conclusion, real life is explicit, and trying to block it is an endless battle. Some content may cross the line, but others are just reflections of the real world. Movies have ratings and music has explicit content labels, so people should be able to choose what's appropriate for themselves. We shouldn't try to hide the real world from children and teenagers.
150	3127	2	2	There are certain books in libraries that are inappropriate. Books about racism, violence, or pornography should not be accessible to young children.  School libraries are great resources for students to work on projects and essays or for leisure reading. If my child were in elementary or middle school, I wouldn't want them to check out books on inappropriate topics. However, for high - school teenagers, it's different. They are old enough to understand the real world. For example, if they are doing a project on the wrongs of pornography, the library is a safer place to find relevant books than the internet, which could lead them to many bad websites. As a student at my local high school, I appreciate being able to find everything I need in the school library for my projects.  Libraries also offer a lot of music, movies, and magazines. Educational music should be kept in libraries. For non - educational music like rap, pop, or country, people can get it from @CAPS1 instead of the library. Magazines can be educational; for instance, a fashion magazine can be very helpful for a project on fashion. However, magazines may also contain inappropriate content, especially since the media often focuses on sex. When I look at magazines, I skip the inappropriate parts and read about clothes, food, and people. Exposing young children to such content is not advisable, but teenagers can understand it. Movies should only be in the library if they are educational. There are plenty of @CAPS4 available, so there's no need for scary movies in the library.  In conclusion, the content in libraries should be adjusted according to the age of the users. For young children, it should be limited to educational and cartoon - related materials. For teenagers, a more relaxed approach can be taken while still maintaining an educational focus. If something offends you, talk to the librarian, and they may remove it from the shelf.
151	3128	2	2	Books can be beneficial as they educate, entertain, and sometimes even serve as good pillows. However, they are not always positive. When a book is inappropriate for its readers, it should not be on library shelves. The same goes for music. If someone finds a book offensive, the library should definitely remove it. Some books may be offensive from a religious perspective. A person might hold strong religious beliefs, and a book could mock or degrade those beliefs. Some might argue that the offended person simply shouldn't read the book, but personally, I'd prefer the book be removed so I wouldn't be reminded of its offensive content every time I passed by it.  Books can also be inappropriate for young children. They may contain language that parents dislike. Some suggest creating a separate section for such books where kids can't access them, but we can't assume all parents have the same standards. What one parent considers acceptable, another might find offensive. Moreover, a book might have images that are unsuitable for children. We can't just create a section and think the problem is solved. Libraries could even consider censoring some of their books.  Some religions view certain types of music as the devil's music. I know from experience that my mother thinks scream - o music is the devil's music. She believes it's wrong for singers to perform in that way and that it wouldn't be approved. Other parents may share the same view.  Magazines can also have words or images that someone might misinterpret. While I don't think libraries should remove them, they should monitor who reads them. They could put a label on the magazine's cover indicating that it may not be suitable for everyone.  In conclusion, although books are generally good, they can be very bad. Libraries should consider censoring their books. If a book is offensive enough and receives numerous complaints, it should be completely removed from the shelves.
152	3129	2	2	Just because I agree with something, does it mean you have to as well? If your cousin believes in something, does that force you to hold the same belief? In my opinion, the answer is no, and I hope you feel the same. When you come across something offensive, does it mean everyone around you will be offended too? The world is full of things that children like but parents don't, and vice versa. However, this doesn't make those things worthless or inappropriate.  Objects with so - called offensive material are ubiquitous. They are in stores, schools, indoors, and outdoors. There's no reason for them to be a problem. They won't disappear, and we shouldn't worry about them becoming a criminal offense. So, why fight against them? I say we don't.  Do you think seeing an offensive item makes an area less appealing or well - intended? What if something you like offends someone else? Does that make it wrong for you to like it? Most things in the world are liked or disliked based on personal opinions. Nothing exists without opinions; even life itself can be a matter of opinion.  I firmly believe that if something in a library is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean it's offensive to everyone. Nothing should be removed from a shelf just because someone disagrees with it. If we substitute other objects or ideas, would we remove a person from the human race just because someone is offended by them? I hope not, but some might see it as a solution. I strongly oppose this view.  Anything published is a form of self - expression and a way of life for the creator. They have the right to express themselves. We may not agree with their lifestyle, choice of clothes, but we can't judge their inner self. No characteristic defines all the others, so why should an item be removed based on one person's opinion?  What's good for you might be bad for someone else. If something you like disappears, it won't really vanish from the world. Removing a CD from a shelf won't make it non - existent. It's like cutting off your hand because your fingers look different from mine. There's no justification for removing things from stores or the world just because some people don't understand or agree with them. Anything can be deemed inappropriate, but what if your idea of appropriateness differs from others? Maybe there's no clear - cut definition of inappropriate, especially in today's world.  If we start eliminating everything we don't like, we'll end up with nothing. Removing a CD from a shelf won't make it disappear from the world, but it's an unjust act. We can't let one group's lack of understanding lead to the removal of things. We should accept the world as it is, with all its differences. Everyone has the right to express themselves, and we should respect that.
153	3130	2	2	Libraries should not remove offensive materials from their shelves based on content. Writing is an art form, and censoring an author's work can obscure their message. People encounter offensive content daily on the streets and in public places, so censoring library materials won't protect anyone. Additionally, removing books from libraries can interfere with students' research and school projects.  Writing as an art form can use offensive language to convey a message. For example, in Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird*, offensive terms are used to depict the racial tension in the South at that time. If we censor such works, we miss the true context. Similarly, if a reader studying the Holocaust can't view pictures of death camps due to their graphic nature, they won't fully understand the horror of the event.  People are exposed to offensive content in their daily lives. On the streets, they may hear profanities from strangers or friends. Parents may accidentally or intentionally use profanity in front of their children. At school, children are also exposed to offensive language and behavior from their peers. Censoring library books won't protect them from this exposure.  Censorship in libraries can also hinder school and work - related projects. If a student can't access a book on a major war or event because of its graphic nature, it will be difficult for them to complete their assignment effectively. A teacher may also face problems if she can't borrow a book with mild profanity, which could prevent her from teaching the intended theme and lesson.  In conclusion, libraries should not censor books based on content. Censorship can obscure the message of a work, is ineffective as people are already exposed to offensive content in their daily lives, and can interfere with educational and research activities. If all libraries censor their materials, it will cause complications for students, workers, and readers.
154	3131	2	2	Libraries are often thought of as boring places. You walk up and down the aisles, looking at books, wishing they were more interesting. After spending what seems like hours searching one shelf, you might spot an interesting - titled book. But inside, it could be full of inappropriate pictures and profanity. Who's to blame if you open and read it?  Profanity, nudity, and crude humor are widespread in the media, including books. Some parents try to protect their children by simply telling them they can't watch, listen to, or read certain things, without explaining why. If parents were more specific about why certain things are off - limits, children might be less likely to be interested in them.  Parents should not only teach their children why they shouldn't be exposed to inappropriate content but also be present when their children have the opportunity to encounter such things. If a child is too young to handle certain content, they're too young to be browsing a library without proper parental guidance.  In my opinion, censorship should be the responsibility of parents, not libraries, movie producers, television programs, or record companies. Parents know their children best and can make the most appropriate decisions regarding what their children are exposed to. By taking an active role in their children's media consumption, parents can better protect their children's well - being and development.
155	3132	2	2	Brian @PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 @NUM2  The question of whether there should be censorship in libraries depends on the type of library. In a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 library, there should be no censorship, but in a @ORGANIZATION1 library, censorship is necessary. I'll share my thoughts on books, movies, and magazines in these libraries.  Regarding books, in a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 library, they should not be censored. Parts of history can be unpleasant and graphic, and sex - ed books should be available so that people can get accurate information rather than relying on hearsay. It doesn't matter if it's a racy love book or a @CAPS2 @PERSON2 book; the important thing is that people are reading. War books should also remain uncensored as they need to show the true nature of war. However, in a @ORGANIZATION1 library, censorship is needed. No parent would want their eight - year - old daughter reading about drug - making. These libraries could include basic information about drugs or alcohol but keep it to a minimum.  When it comes to movies available in libraries, in a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 library, nothing above @NUM3 should be allowed, except for sex - ed tapes and history movies. At the @ORGANIZATION1 level, movies should be @CAPS3 - @CAPS4. At that age, children mainly watch movies for entertainment, so there's no need for anything more extreme.  For magazines, in a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 library, they're not a major issue as long as there's no @CAPS7 content. At the @ORGANIZATION1 level, magazines should be censored. Children at that age should be reading educational and fun magazines, not @ORGANIZATION2 - type magazines.  In conclusion, there should be no censorship at the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 library level, but censorship is required at the @ORGANIZATION1 level. This approach ensures that people in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 libraries have access to a wide range of materials for learning and exploration, while children in @ORGANIZATION1 libraries are protected from inappropriate content.
156	3133	2	2	In my view, everyone ought to hold libraries in high regard. This is because there was a time when we didn't even have books, let alone libraries from which to obtain them. A library is a place characterized by a peaceful and tranquil environment. People visit libraries to collect good books, surf the internet, explore new music, and simply relax.   To address the question, 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the library shelves if found offensive?' I firmly believe that if there are items on the shelves that come across as offensive to people, they should definitely be removed. One should not have to be in an environment where they are offended. Offensive materials will deter individuals from visiting the library, which will result in a significant loss of business for the library due to a lack of patronage.   A library should be a place filled with love, peace, and harmony. It should be a space where people feel free and relieved from stress. Encountering or hearing something highly offensive will bring confusion to the library and make the librarians' jobs much more difficult. They will have to work harder to address the issues caused by the offensive materials.   For me, some of the music in libraries is offensive. Certain types of music, such as the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' music with profanity, music that degrades women disrespectfully, and music that glorifies violence, have no place in a library. This kind of music will offend many men and women. Who wants to listen to music that makes women feel worthless or that constantly talks about killing, fighting, and gangs? People prefer soothing and relaxing music that can make them happy regardless of their mood. Libraries should choose their music carefully to ensure the satisfaction of all patrons.   In conclusion, as mentioned, the library is an excellent place to hang out and unwind. It should never be a place with offensive items, and such items should be removed. This will reduce confusion and encourage more people to visit the library, as they will recognize it as a wonderful place.
157	3134	2	2	Some individuals may consider it a good idea to censor materials in libraries. They might think that some of the content could be offensive or harmful to the youth or other library - goers. They may believe it would be better to remove the offensive and inappropriate items from the shelves. However, I hold a different opinion on this matter. I do not think that anything in the library should be censored, whether it pertains to books, movies, music, magazines, etc.  The real question is why these materials should be censored or removed. The answer is that they should not be. A library is a place where one can obtain information on almost any topic. If these items are censored or taken off the shelves, the available resources will be limited and may not be helpful to those seeking information.   Another significant issue with censoring or removing these materials is that people may miss out on a great deal of knowledge, even if it is considered bad or offensive. This includes topics like slavery, the @CAPS1 taking over the @CAPS2, and much of our world history. I am strongly in favor of people being aware of the world's past.   If the items are removed from library shelves, what should be done with the thousands of books that can no longer be read because they are deemed offensive? We cannot simply discard them. A lot of the so - called offensive content is based on true stories, such as @ORGANIZATION1 park being arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white person. Removing these books would be pointless because people will find other ways to access the information they desire.   The most important aspect is to understand who wants these books censored or removed and why. While some books may be offensive, people have the right to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. Just because some people dislike certain library materials does not mean that everyone else does. It is up to the individuals, not the opinions of a few.   In conclusion, I believe that books and other items in libraries should not be censored or removed from the shelves. People have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they wish. It seems to me that this is a matter of conflicting opinions regarding the removal of books. If people do not like the books in the library, they are not obliged to visit, and their opinions should not dictate what others can access.
158	3135	2	2	In my opinion, people in the modern world are overly concerned with morality. I was taught that if you have a problem, you should keep it to yourself. Most people are aware that censorship is a significant issue, but it doesn't have to be. I understand that some content is a bit risqué, but if we make this content available more quickly and subtly, children won't feel the need to discover it later on. If they do seek it out later, the consequences could be severe, including fines, misdemeanors, loss of respect and reputation, and even imprisonment.   By introducing children to topics like murder, drugs, sex, and crimes at an early age, we can take advantage of their malleability. They are more receptive to learning at a young age than when they are older. Removing such content from public access may create a seemingly nicer community, but when a real threat emerges, who will come to the rescue? The @CAPS1? It takes time for a squad car to respond, especially in a city. During this time, someone could be harmed, robbed, or even killed, and the criminal could escape.   If we keep this content accessible, people will gain the knowledge to understand that using this information to help others can be beneficial. In essence, if we remove this content, people will become weaker. On the other hand, if we allow it to remain available, people can learn from it and use it for good.
159	3136	2	2	Have you ever come across a book, movie, or music that you think kids shouldn't be exposed to? I have heard of many such books, and there is also music that is suitable only for adults. Some parents are very strict about what their children watch, hear, read, or sing. I know for sure that my parents wouldn't want me to let my children access that kind of content.  When considering the movies, books, and music that should be kept away from children, I believe that those containing bad language, violence, and bullying should be hidden. Bad language is inappropriate for kids, especially those under ten years old, but even for older children. When a song with bad language comes on while there are little kids around, you should change the station. If children hear such language at a young age, they are likely to start using it.  Books, songs, or movies with violence should also be removed from children's reach. If kids are exposed to violence through reading, hearing, or watching, they are more likely to become violent themselves. People should not have to be afraid to walk alone without the fear of being attacked. If you see someone reading or watching something inappropriate, you should tell them not to. Violence is harmful to young children.  Books, movies, or music about bullying should also be taken out of circulation. Bullying is not the solution to any problem. If you think it is okay for little kids to learn about bullying, you are wrong. Bullying is a bad behavior for children, and it can get them in trouble if they are caught doing it.  In my opinion, the books that should be removed from the shelves are those with bad language, violence, and bullying. Children should not be exposed to bad language, violence, or bullying through reading, watching, or listening. It is important to protect them from such negative influences.
160	3137	2	2	Some books in libraries can be offensive to certain people. The question of whether they should be removed is what I will discuss here. Maintaining public self - control is a top priority. So, one might wonder why offensive books are still being published.   Graphic and gory books, which usually disgust people, should have a warning symbol for those with weak stomachs or those who cannot handle such content. I am okay with these books as long as the warning is present. People need to accept that the world is not all pleasant, and there is gruesome stuff out there. If one cannot tolerate it, they should avoid it.  However, materials that are offensive to races, religions, and other personal aspects are a different concern. Such content can inflame groups, leading to protests or boycotts. Authors need to review their work to ensure that it will not cause any disruption. Young authors should avoid inflaming the public, as it can not only upset people but also result in their dismissal.  False or inaccurate statements in books can arouse public curiosity and even lead to conspiracy theories. This will not only cause a stir in the press but can also get the author fired, which is not what an author wants. Therefore, it is crucial for authors to ensure that their work is based on truth and not on hypotheticals. These steps are essential for achieving a positive public influence.  In conclusion, authors have a lot to consider, including race issues, religion, and false statements. They should avoid these potential pitfalls. The best outcome for an author is to have the public recommend their book and for it to receive positive press coverage.
161	3138	2	2	In libraries, censorship of materials should not be implemented as reading preferences are an individual choice. There is no proper standard to determine what makes a book offensive to a group. In public libraries, many children, for whom books are often censored, are accompanied by their parents. Parents should independently decide what their children can read. Banning a book simply due to inappropriate content is absurd. If an author has spent time creating a story, it should be appreciated and not put on a prohibited list. If someone dislikes a book's reputation, they can simply choose not to read it. Even in school systems, librarians are there to guide children towards good books. If a child wants to read an inappropriate book, the librarian will likely discourage them. For instance, I once wanted to read a book my mother suggested, but it was censored in the school library. Some parents believe children should be shielded from offensive content in books, but similar ideas are exposed to them daily on television and the internet. Trying to protect children from such content may seem good, but it often fails. Moreover, some people cannot afford to buy the books they want, and libraries are their main source of reading materials. In conclusion, there is little reason to ban books from library shelves. Many banned books contain important lessons. If someone dislikes a book, the simplest solution is not to pick it up.
162	3139	2	2	There are numerous books and magazines that should be removed from library shelves. I recall in sixth grade, going to the school library and picking up a book that not only explained what weed was but also how to grow it. Nowadays, many books refer to drugs and sex, and I absolutely detest it. The last book I checked out, though it's been a while, had so many sexual references that I felt like I was reading a porn magazine. Schools need to be more vigilant about the materials they offer. Sixth - graders shouldn't even know what weed is, let alone read about it in school. This might be why kids get interested in drugs and alcohol at such an early age. The book I read had no negative statements about weed. How can one expect such a book to deter kids from using drugs? Many books in schools and public libraries have excessive references to drugs and sex. There are even books in our library that describe drugs, the high they produce, and where to obtain the ingredients to make them. I'm in high school, and there should not be books that resemble porn magazines. The book I read had detailed pictures and even provided websites on the back. This is unacceptable and sad. It scares me to think about what my younger siblings might be reading. It should scare others too. I don't want my siblings to read about drugs and sex in detail, or at all. These books should be removed from school and public library shelves. Hardly anyone will read them anyway, and if they do, it's usually by accident, like my experience.
163	3140	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should not censor their materials. Firstly, people have diverse tastes in books. Some prefer scary books, while others like romantic ones. Everyone has different preferences, and just because someone might be offended by something doesn't mean it should be removed. Secondly, the books in libraries are generally educational. There are learning books for young children to help them learn to read, magazines for those interested in global drama, and war books for history enthusiasts. So, people should not be overly offended by the books others read. Thirdly, if you don't want your child to read certain books that seem offensive to you, simply don't let them. Everyone has different likes, and taking away materials that some people enjoy will only offend them. People who love going to the library should not be so easily offended. In conclusion, libraries should not be censored because people have different reading tastes, library books are educational, and parents can control what their children read. Some books may not be intended to offend; they may just be stating an opinion.
164	3141	2	2	When I enter a library, I expect it to be a peaceful place where I can find useful books that are not harmful to anyone. Everywhere I go, I want to feel free and not have to worry about things that could hurt others or myself. People should be treated equally, regardless of their skin color, appearance, or way of speaking. In my opinion, any offensive content in movies, magazines, books, or anywhere else should be permanently removed. The past has no bearing on the present, and everyone deserves equal treatment. I believe that no one should be ashamed of who they are. If someone is [specific identity], they should be proud and not fear negative remarks that could hurt their feelings. Most people would agree that everyone in the world should be treated equally. Negative content in books, magazines, or anywhere should be removed as it causes people to engage in harmful behaviors like joining gangs or using drugs. Our world should not consist of things that harm others. Anything negative towards an individual or a group should not be allowed and should be discarded. Innocent people do not deserve the treatment some received in the past. People should be proud of themselves and not be afraid of such negativity. I treat others as I want to be treated, and this should be the norm for everyone. Harmful things must be removed from all aspects of life. In conclusion, offensive materials should be removed to allow people to live freely and be proud of who they are.
165	3142	2	2	There are various types of books in libraries, such as comics, romance, adventure, and mystery books, along with magazines and music. Libraries offer a wide range of materials to suit different interests. However, not all the patrons are adults; there are also young children, either checking out books on their own or accompanied by parents or guardians. I believe that even though there are books, magazines, and music not suitable for children, they shouldn't be removed just because they are considered offensive. Everyone experiences unpleasant things in life. Adults can walk away from offensive content, but children may not have the same ability. Sometimes, children also need to go through such experiences as part of growing up and learning. If you know which parts of the library have inappropriate content for children, avoid taking them there. Instead, take them to an area where they can sit and read their favorite books while you supervise. This way, you don't have to explain things you're not ready to or that your child isn't ready to hear. It's impossible to shield children from everything you don't want them to see or hear. When they're young, if they ask about something inappropriate, you can distract them. As they grow older, they should learn to distinguish right from wrong and know what they can and can't read. Some people may be unaware that certain things can cause more harm than good, even in a library. If you don't want your child to be exposed to offensive content, either avoid taking them to the library or be prepared for the unexpected. In conclusion, offensive materials in libraries should not be removed, and parents should take appropriate measures to protect their children.
166	3143	2	2	In my view, offensive materials such as books, music, movies, or magazines in the library should remain on the shelves. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and people have the freedom to choose what they read, listen to, or watch. For instance, I once read a book about a particular historical period when certain groups were enslaved and punished severely. While this might offend some, it is part of history, and others may find it interesting to learn more. Libraries cannot satisfy everyone's preferences. If a person selects content that might offend others, it should be their decision, and the content should not be removed. In conclusion, offensive items in the library should stay accessible as it is up to individuals to decide what they engage with, and it is for their own benefit, not for the sake of others.
167	3144	2	2	Censorship in the media is employed to prevent people from being offended by what they encounter. Although it is not inherently bad, it is sometimes over - used. Since not everyone shares the same views and morals, what is considered appropriate in one culture or religion may be viewed differently in others. In my opinion, if one finds something offensive, they should simply avoid it instead of demanding its removal. Clearly, if content is published, it appeals to some audience. For example, the censorship of using the word '@CAPS1' in vain on television seems excessive to me as it doesn't align with my beliefs. Also, the program 'The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6' is offensive and stereotypical to me, but I choose not to watch it rather than demand its removal. While I'm not completely against all forms of censorship, like that of nudity on TV, censoring based solely on beliefs, morals, or concerns for children is over - the - top. In conclusion, if something is offensive, individuals should keep themselves and their children away from it, rather than over - relying on censorship.
168	3145	2	2	Censorship in libraries is unnecessary. No reading material should be removed from the shelves. Every book offers a unique experience that can aid a child's learning. If a guardian believes a certain book is inappropriate, they can prevent their child from reading it. When libraries censor books, they limit options, and some kids may stop reading altogether. Each book has a distinct plot and moral, and removing books means taking away the chance for students to learn specific morals. For example, a book with a controversial plot might teach a valuable lesson about real - world issues. It is up to guardians, not libraries, to decide if a book is offensive. In conclusion, libraries should not censor books as every book provides a learning opportunity, and it is the guardian's responsibility to guide their child's reading choices.
169	3146	2	2	In my opinion, no books should be banned from a public library. Authors have the freedom of speech, so some books may offend people, but those who are offended should avoid them. If books are banned from libraries, they may also be unavailable in stores. One cannot judge a book by its cover; one won't know if a book is offensive until they read it. If a book offends during the reading process, the reader can return it and choose another. Moreover, many books that offend actually teach us about history. In conclusion, books should remain accessible in public libraries as they offer diverse knowledge and experiences, and it is up to readers to decide what they want to read.
170	3147	2	2	In my opinion, some offensive books, movies, and music should be removed from the shelves. Some of the offensive books and movies can contain vulgar and unpleasant content. Similarly, some music can be offensive as it may include nasty language. However, not all music is bad; it depends on the genre. Different types of music have different characteristics, and while some may be offensive, others are not. In conclusion, offensive media in libraries and other sources should be evaluated, and the offensive ones should be removed to ensure a more appropriate environment.
171	3148	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should have no form of censorship. This stance is rooted in the First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom of speech. This fundamental right allows us to include any content in books, magazines, music, movies, and other media. Moreover, individuals should be capable of determining whether a particular piece of media is suitable for their age and personal views.  The First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech is the cornerstone of this argument. We should be able to express our feelings in any way within the pages of a book. If we start censoring books, this practice may expand, ultimately undermining the very essence of the First Amendment.  In conclusion, due to the First Amendment, there should be no censorship in any form of media. It serves as a crucial avenue for self - expression and sharing diverse viewpoints.
172	3149	2	2	"You've probably had the experience of finding a book on the shelf with content inappropriate for children. Or perhaps you've gone to make a copy and noticed a magazine on the table with a cover image unsuitable for young minds. Similarly, some movies and music can have content that shocks you and makes you wish offensive words were bleeped out.  I think it's better to remove offensive items like books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelves. The words and pictures in these can poison children's minds. Since children learn from their surroundings, such content can make them think that's how they should act and talk. Let me give you two examples: music and magazines.  When it comes to music, children tend to imitate what they see and hear. Take rap music, for instance. Their songs are full of cuss words. At my school, I constantly hear kids using words like the n - word and f - word. I've also seen boys sagging their pants, showing their underwear, thinking they're being ""thugs."" It makes me wonder why parents allow this behavior.  As for magazines, some of the images on their covers and pages aren't meant for children. One time, I went to the copying room in my school library to copy an article from a magazine. I found a magazine on the table showing three cast members from @LOCATION1 in the nude. I couldn't believe it was in a school environment. If I were a parent and found out my child was exposed to something like that at school, I'd be furious.  In conclusion, offensive items should be removed from the shelves to protect children from seeing inappropriate content."
173	3150	2	2	"Freedom of the press is a right that many countries lack. America, known as the land of the free, offers this privilege. For some, this freedom leads to great outcomes. Without it, many classic modern literary works would never have seen the light of day, and their messages would have remained unknown. Censoring the right to freely write about one's views on the world, government, or any topic means suppressing imagination and, in some cases, hiding historical statistics and events.  Before the advent of modern technology, books were one of the primary sources of knowledge. Producing and publishing a book was a long - drawn - out process, and owning one of the few copies was an honor. People have an innate desire for information and a thirst for learning and progress. If all ""offensive"" books are removed from the shelves, information will gradually disappear, and the joy of reading will be lost.  In the novel @CAPS1 @NUM1, set in a dystopian society, any books found in homes are immediately confiscated and burned in the streets for everyone to see. Children find it amusing, and adults do nothing to stop it. The protagonist in the novel has a secret stash of books. Once discovered, he is forced to flee to protect his precious knowledge, which the government tries desperately to keep from the public. Censorship, as depicted in the novel, would only lead to chaos and destruction.  In schools and colleges, it is crucial for students to have the right to know about their country's history and current government affairs. Parents often object to the authors chosen by schools for students to read, claiming their ideas are narrow - minded and wrong. However, students need books to grow and learn. If everyone were to permanently remove one book from the shelves, eventually, there would be no books left. All information would then rely on what people knew before the book bans, and in time, that knowledge would also fade away.  Books are a form of history. Some people may not want to face the raw truth about certain topics, such as slavery or the possibility of a complete government takeover. To avoid such topics, one can simply choose a fiction novel to escape into a fantasy world. No one can change history, but without the original books, people could distort historical events and public perception. If someone takes offense to a particular book, they have the freedom to write a negative review.  Writing is a rare gift, and being able to showcase one's talent is a privilege. Books can help people escape the harsh realities of life or gain more knowledge. Censorship is irrelevant. Stripping music, movies, and magazines of the truth leaves us with little. While people may stretch the truth or tell white lies, most information is factual. The freedom to create books, music, and movies is not just about entertainment; the messages behind ""offensive"" materials can be powerful and long - lasting."
174	3151	2	2	"Entertainment for both children and adults includes movies, music, sports, video games, and reading. Books, music, movies, and magazines should never be removed from the shelves. Libraries sometimes censor materials due to violence or inappropriate content. However, children should have the right to read, listen to, or watch whatever they want as it is their life. These forms of media can teach young people about life, and the writers, artists, directors, and actors have put in a great deal of effort to entertain the public.  Materials considered ""offensive"" should not be removed. They can be helpful to others. Reading materials can assist young people in dealing with life. If a reader is facing problems, the book they're reading might help them think through their situation. Since these books, movies, and music are the result of hard work, it's unfair to remove them just because a few people find them offensive.  One time at the library, I went looking for a book I had read before, but I couldn't find it. It had been removed because someone found it inappropriate. This really disappointed me as it was one of my favorite books. A book that some consider ""offensive"" or ""inappropriate"" could be another person's favorite. People are being too self - centered when they have such books removed.  The materials that have been taken off the shelves should be put back for those who find them entertaining. If a parent doesn't want their child to read a certain book, they have the right to take it away from the child, not have it removed from the shelves. The freedom of the @CAPS1 gives anyone the right to write whatever they want. If we keep removing books, magazines, music, or movies from the shelves, eventually, there won't be any left."
175	3152	2	2	I don't think books should be removed from the shelves because of offensive content. Libraries are extremely important in most people's lives today. In my area, the city is planning to close a nearby library. For me and my friends, the library is crucial since we don't have a computer with internet access at home. The library provides internet connectivity and old books with information about the city.  In today's society, not every household can afford a computer with internet. I'm one of those people. The library is a quiet place to get work done. It also offers the internet that many people need for daily life, as job applications and school assignments are now mostly online.  As a @NUM1 grade student, I have many projects that require old books on the city and its history. If certain books are removed from the shelves, I won't be able to find the important information I need. Everyone has their own opinion about what is offensive. But if everyone found something offensive in a book, movie, or magazine and had it removed, there would be very few books left.  I have a friend of Mexican heritage who sometimes finds the topic of slavery offensive. But for me, it's important to learn about my history. This shows that what might be offensive to one person may not be offensive and could be very important to another.  In conclusion, I strongly disagree with removing books from the shelves due to offensive content. People are different and have different sensitivities, but we shouldn't take away something that others may need.
176	3153	2	2	Everyone possesses the right to read, listen to, or watch whatever they desire. However, this right is not always fully realized. For instance, in the case of rated - @CAPS1 movies, most children under @NUM1 are prohibited from watching them, either due to legal regulations or parental rules.  Music presents a different situation. Some songs, which involve violence or cussing, can have a negative influence on children, sending them the wrong message. Libraries should not stock such books, music, movies, magazines, etc. If people wish to access these so - called 'offensive' materials, they should do so on their own time.  Not everyone shares the same sense of humor. What some people find funny can offend others. Even if libraries have materials that might offend someone, it is ultimately the reader's choice to select a book. Sometimes, it might be better for children to read certain articles independently, as it can save parents the trouble of later explanations. Children may ask numerous questions that parents may not be able to answer.  Take my brother as an example. When he was young, he was very curious and always asked a lot of questions. Once, he watched a rated - @CAPS1 movie and started asking about where babies come from. My mother didn't know how to respond and often changed the subject. One day, he took one of my mother's movies without permission and found the answer. He was shocked and disgusted but also glad to finally get an answer.  In this matter, I hold a somewhat neutral stance. I don't oppose the removal of potentially offensive materials from library shelves. However, it may not be wise to place 'offensive' items in libraries where children can access them. These materials can add an element of interest to the reading experience, and everyone has different opinions. It is beneficial to have such books, whether they state facts or present opinions, as everyone has the right to express themselves.  It may not be a good idea to have 'offensive' materials in libraries, especially if most children borrow books from there. Parents should have a say in what their children read and watch. Some parents prefer to give their children materials that can explain things better, while others want their children to be mature enough before being exposed to 'offensive' content. So, it can be inappropriate to have materials meant for adults on library shelves accessible to children.  Katherine Paterson's quotation, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' implies that if a parent reads something 'offensive,' their children may also have the right to know. Once children learn about such things, they may stop asking questions. In conclusion, finding a balance in library censorship is crucial to respect different rights and concerns.
177	3154	2	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that it is incorrect to remove both offensive and non - offensive books from library shelves simply because one or two students dislike them or do not want others to read them.  Some materials, although offensive, can be suitable for reading and learning if they serve a good purpose, such as educational ones, rather than just for entertainment. It is essential for readers to be exposed to a wide range of reading materials, including foreign literature. If we were to remove every slightly offensive or less - suitable item from the shelves, there would be few books left to attract people's attention.  In conclusion, I strongly advocate that these materials should remain on the library shelves. They are valuable for learning in certain cases and can hold readers' interest. Therefore, these items should be kept on the shelves.
178	3155	2	2	Library censorship should be appropriate for each age group. Children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 should be capable of reading books containing profanity. They should be mature enough to read through books with name - calling and profanity without laughing or taking offense.  However, children of age @NUM3 should not have access to books with a large amount of such profound language in their libraries. They are too young to expect that some people use such words to express feelings or for name - calling. They should be exposed to very little of this kind of language, and as they grow older, they will gradually get used to it. There should be a certain level of censorship in the libraries they use.  For children younger than @NUM4 years old, they should not read or view materials with profanity or inappropriate scenes unless their parents allow it. While we cannot control what parents let their children do, we can regulate the content in schools and public libraries. In conclusion, appropriate censorship based on age is necessary to ensure that children are exposed to suitable reading materials.
179	3156	2	2	As a citizen of @LOCATION1, I believe that the current censorship of library materials is not ideal and could be improved. There should be an age limit for certain books, magazines, etc. in libraries. Due to differences in maturity levels, some content is not suitable for younger children.  I recall taking my little sister to the public library. She picked up a book and started asking me about words that she shouldn't be exposed to at her age.  On the other hand, some of these so - called 'offensive' books may be necessary. Some people need them for research papers and other academic purposes. As a young adult, I believe that children of my age can read various materials and distinguish right from wrong. It is also the responsibility of parents or guardians. If they don't want their children to read inappropriate materials, they should accompany them to the library. However, some children may not have mature parents or guardians to guide them, so libraries should take action regarding book censorship.  In conclusion, the current library censorship on books, movies, music, magazines, etc., is acceptable but can be enhanced. There should be a specific age for children to read or view certain content. We cannot simply remove all inappropriate materials from libraries because some people actually need them. Implementing an age limit or designating materials for mature audiences only would be beneficial.
180	3157	2	2	If something is considered offensive, it should definitely be removed from library shelves. When parents send or take their children to a library, they do not anticipate their children being able to access inappropriate materials. Some items may offend people's beliefs and be disrespectful. Public libraries are accessible to the general public, and all the materials there will be seen by a large number of people. No one should have to worry about being offended when entering a place of learning and knowledge.  Parents do not want their children to pick up rude materials at the library. Even if a child does not borrow a book or magazine, there is no way to prevent their impressionable minds from flipping through the pages. They may read something that their parents do not intend to teach them at that stage. Many books today contain crude text and humor. If a younger person is not mature enough to understand a topic, they may form the wrong impressions or ideas.  If a child rummages through the adult section of the library, they may be exposed to information they are not ready for. Offensive language in books can lead young people to imitate the words and phrases. If a child reads about sex, they may become curious or confused and ask their parents about it. Parents may not want their children to know about such topics at a young age, and once the child knows, there is no going back. Parents will then have to explain things that are too mature for young minds.  Parents have the right to restrict their children's access to certain materials. However, if the books are freely available, it is difficult to control who reads what. Libraries need to carefully consider what is on their shelves, regardless of the form of the information. People may think that just because something is in a book, it may not be real. But some reckless scenarios in movies, watched by people of all ages, can influence impressionable teenagers to act out what they see.  Since public libraries are indeed public, the materials they offer should not be offensive. People of all kinds visit libraries, and no one should leave feeling offended. Parents should not have to worry about what their children might pick up. Libraries should ensure that they do not cause any worry or harm. In conclusion, libraries need to take strict measures to censor offensive materials to create a safe and respectful environment for all users.
181	3158	2	2	I firmly believe that materials in libraries should not be removed just because some people may not like them. There are individuals who appreciate a particular movie, book, music, or magazine. Just because we might not have an affinity for something doesn't mean there isn't someone out there who does. Libraries are meant to house a wide range of materials to cater to the diverse interests of different people. If we start removing items from the library shelves based on the preferences of a few, it is not only unjust but also defeats the purpose of a library. I recall a time when I visited the library searching for a specific movie or book, only to find it was not available. It was quite frustrating. Everyone should have the right to access the materials they wish to read or watch. Even though there are certain books or movies that may not be suitable for children, it is not advisable to remove them from the shelves. In conclusion, libraries should remain a place where all materials are accessible, respecting the diverse tastes and interests of the public.
182	3159	2	2	Hi, my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1, and I'm here to discuss why certain materials should be kept in libraries. Consider a scenario where you've been searching for a particular movie, song, book, or any item for a long time. You've looked everywhere but couldn't find it in other stores. Then, out of curiosity, you visit the library, even though you don't expect to find it there. But lo and behold, you end up discovering exactly what you've been looking for. Imagine wanting to find a mystery book, and the library is the only place that has it. There are numerous reasons why we need these specific materials in libraries. In conclusion, I encourage you to put yourself in this situation, or even in my shoes. Would you allow the removal of these materials, or would you fight to keep them? It's important to recognize the value these materials bring to library - goers.
183	3160	2	2	"When it comes to reading materials, a crucial question arises: should people have the freedom to read whatever they want, or should we impose restrictions? Libraries have different policies; some require adult supervision for certain materials, while others allow unrestricted borrowing. In my life so far, I've read a variety of books. I've read those that some people deemed inappropriate, yet I found nothing offensive in them. Often, a book with just one or two strong words gets labeled as an ""adult book."" I firmly believe that it should be up to the reader to decide whether they can handle a particular book. Everyone reacts differently to various content. Take my age - group as an example. Some boys are still immature and might find it amusing to act out. They may not be able to handle so - called ""adult"" material. On the other hand, most girls are in the process of maturing. They are still not fully grown - up but are making progress and could handle such materials. Readers are intelligent enough to know their own limits. If we take away people's choice of reading materials, it's like treating them like children. They would have to rely on their parents to pick books for them at the library, which would make them feel patronized. As an avid reader, I know my family is busy and wouldn't have time to accompany me to choose a book. This would significantly reduce my reading opportunities. It's all about personal opinion. It depends on what readers are comfortable with. Do they want the freedom to choose for themselves, or do they want someone to guide them at every step? Some people are too busy to fit library visits into their schedules, while others value the freedom to read what they want. Preventing people from reading what they choose hinders their intellectual growth. Children learn more by challenging themselves with good books of their own selection. In conclusion, we should respect readers' choices and let them challenge themselves through reading. What's your stance on this issue?"
184	3161	2	2	I am of the opinion that libraries should not be subject to censorship just because some people may take offense to certain materials. Everyone should have the freedom to read, research, or watch whatever they desire at a library. This is because everyone has different sensitivities, and if people can't find what they're looking for, the purpose of the library is defeated. Have you ever come across something that offended you or others? Usually, when people are offended, they try to get rid of the offensive item. If we removed all the materials that offended someone from library shelves, there would be hardly anything left. Since everyone has different sensibilities, a large number of items could potentially be considered offensive. This is a major reason why I oppose library censorship. Moreover, people have diverse interests. What I like, you might dislike. Should an item be banned from the library just because you don't like it? No, because the same logic could lead to the removal of things you like. If everyone tried to remove what they disliked, there would be nothing left in the library. In fact, if we combined all the things that people dislike, it would likely cover most materials. Another important point is that if people can't find what they want in a library because it has been removed, they will stop coming. They'll just stay home and read on the internet. This would make the construction of the library, the purchase of books, and the hiring of librarians a waste of taxpayers' money. In conclusion, I hope you can agree that libraries should not be censored. Everyone is offended by something, everyone has different interests, and a library without popular materials will lose its users. Some may disagree because they are easily offended or have strong dislikes, but we should say no to censorship and let libraries fulfill their purpose of providing free access to a wide range of materials.
185	3162	2	2	Censorship is a prevalent violation of the law in @LOCATION1. It is illegal to censor any form of publication, including books, magazines, music, or movies. Censorship frequently occurs in school settings, specifically with books. This practice should no longer be tolerated as it has a negative impact on writers, the school system, and readers. In the @ORGANIZATION1, every individual has the right to express their feelings and opinions on any topic. However, school systems are undermining this right by restricting the availability of certain books. Schools should either offer access to all books or none at all. School faculty do not have the authority to decide which books are allowed based on their personal ideals. It is unfair to discriminate against writers, and they should have the right to have their books read in any environment. Censorship within the school system also affects the school itself. If a school can remove one right from a group of people without consequences, it may start taking away other rights. Generally, school systems and teachers can be power - hungry leaders. They create rules to assert their authority over students and deprive them of many rights. Allowing schools to continue censoring books could lead to a situation where everything is censored. As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone has the right to remove a book they dislike, there will be no books left on the shelves. The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to take action against school censorship as it is unconstitutional. The most affected group by school - based censorship is the students and potential readers. Censoring a book deprives them of the opportunity to learn about and understand a particular topic. Students should have the right to read what they want, regardless of the school's beliefs. In conclusion, censorship, especially in schools, must be stopped. It violates the constitutional rights of writers, school systems, and readers. The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 should crack down on these unlawful practices that occur daily in schools across the country.
186	3163	2	2	In today's society, the state of our world is deeply concerning. We have reached a point where offensive materials are being placed in libraries, accessible to anyone. As a teenage girl, I have personally encountered some of these offensive books and magazines. The use of sex, drugs, and violence in these materials to construct stories is having a detrimental impact on the minds of our youth. I firmly believe that such disturbing and destructive content should be removed from library shelves.  My concern is not about whether children and teens should read, but rather what they read. While I acknowledge that reading is beneficial for our youth's learning and academic success, offensive books and magazines introduce unpleasant ideas and distort their thinking patterns. The more the younger generation is exposed to these negative elements, the more curious they become, and I fear that curiosity may ultimately lead them astray.  Some may argue that experiences such as sex and drugs are part of growing up, but I strongly disagree. Engaging in the harmful activities depicted in certain library materials can pose serious risks to one's health and well - being. It only takes a single instance to face the consequences, such as pregnancy or drug addiction.  To illustrate my point, think about your favorite book. Did you look up to the main character? Did you aspire to be like them? Unfortunately, much of this malicious material presents the main characters as poor role models. These characters may seem heroic during the day but are shown to engage in inappropriate behavior at night. This sends the wrong message to our children, suggesting that such actions are acceptable when they clearly are not.  In conclusion, I stand by my opinion that offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from library shelves. This type of material plants a negative seed in the minds of our youth, leading them to believe that these behaviors are normal. Sex, violence, and drugs have no place in the world we strive to create.
187	3164	2	2	People often think that graphic images or explicit words in media can change how younger kids view various topics. But let's face it, kids won't even remember half of what they read or see. So, does it really matter? Some people think it does, and I get that. But I'm on the side that says it doesn't. After all, kids are going to find out about bad language and sex eventually. So, I think there shouldn't be any restrictions on books, music, movies, magazines, TV shows, and so on.  The thing is, parents often get offended or complain when their little ones say a curse word or when the material in a show or magazine is considered offensive to people with disabilities or different races. But most of the time, it's just for humor; the networks or authors aren't being serious. Authors' works should be read and enjoyed, and we can even learn from them.  I don't think books should be taken off the shelves just because parents are ashamed of what their kids read. As I've said, kids will discover these things sooner or later. There's no point in getting mad about it. And if we got rid of all the more mature books, what would older kids and adults have to read? I'm pretty sure I don't want to read about a friendly magical dragon finding its way home.  In conclusion, we should let people read what they want. There's no need to censor media just because some might find it inappropriate. Everyone has different tastes and levels of maturity, and we should respect that.
188	3165	2	2	Dear @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1. I'm a student at @LOCATION1, and I've learned that the @ORGANIZATION1 is considering removing offensive books from the library. I believe this is a wrong decision. If everyone at @LOCATION1 removed the books they found offensive, there would be no books left to read.  I also think that no single person should have the right to decide what books are too offensive for me. I'm sixteen years old and capable of making my own decisions about what I read. If I choose to read books that others might find offensive, that's my choice. Just because I want to read a certain book doesn't mean others have to.  Moreover, I find that books with a bit of offensive content are often more interesting. If you remove every offensive word from a book, it can become quite boring. Removing all offensive books from the library will only discourage kids from reading, and I'm sure that's not what @LOCATION1 wants.  If you think books are offensive, take a walk down the hallways. This is a @ORGANIZATION1, and kids often use bad language and talk about inappropriate things. If you want to make children more innocent, removing books from the library is not the solution.  In conclusion, I urge the @ORGANIZATION1 to reconsider its decision. Censoring books in the library is not the way to go. We should respect individual choices and the freedom to read.
189	3166	2	2	Every author has a specific intended audience in mind when writing a book and decides what content is appropriate for that audience. Unfortunately, sometimes people outside the intended audience end up reading these books, even though the content may not be suitable for them. For example, a children's book is meant for children, not adults, and a romance novel is for those who can understand and handle the content maturely.  However, censorship in libraries is not the solution to this problem; it is a significant error. As human beings, we are granted certain freedoms, including the freedom of the press. Authors should have the right to write about whatever they choose. Even if their chosen subjects are not suitable for all age groups, they still have the right to have their books in libraries because there are specific audiences for these works. Removing these books out of fear that a child might access them means taking away the reading enjoyment of certain people.  Libraries recognize that different books are for different age groups and have created separate sections. There is a children's section for kids, an adult section for adults, and a teen section for those in between. By organizing books in this way, libraries aim to guide people towards reading the appropriate materials without resorting to censorship. This approach is a reasonable compromise between allowing unrestricted access to all books, regardless of appropriateness, and completely removing certain books.  Adults should be able to access any type of book, magazine, music, or movie they desire from the library. If a child's parent approves of their child checking out certain materials, it should not concern others. Instead of censoring library materials, a better solution would be to set an age limit for independent borrowing. For those under the age limit, a parent should be present to approve the borrowed items.  In conclusion, library censorship is ultimately pointless and should not be considered. No matter how offensive some people may find certain materials, there are always other ways to obtain them. Therefore, there is no valid reason to censor library resources.
190	3167	2	2	I believe that all offensive materials in libraries should be removed so that everyone can read books, listen to music, watch movies, and look at magazines without being offended. These offensive materials should have their own separate section.  Movies with inappropriate content should be taken off the regular shelves and placed in a dedicated section. This section should be locked to prevent children from accessing these movies. I think this is a fair solution for everyone.  Similarly, bad music should be removed from the general collection and put in a locked section. This way, children won't be able to get their hands on it. It's a fair arrangement for all.  Magazines with offensive content should also be taken off the shelves and placed in a special, locked section. This ensures that only appropriate people can access them.  Books that are considered bad should be removed from the main library area and given their own locked section to keep them out of reach of children. I'm certain that this would be a fair approach for everyone.  In conclusion, if we implement this system for offensive materials, everyone will have access to appropriate books, magazines, music, and movies. It's a simple and fair way to manage the library's collection and protect the interests of all patrons.
191	3168	2	2	As I see it, we shouldn't remove books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelves just because we find them offensive. If something offends me, I simply won't choose it. For instance, I absolutely loathe @CAPS1 books. I can't stand them at all. Another type of books I find offensive are @CAPS2 books. There are so many unreadable stories in them, and I think it's a waste of paper. Also, @CAPS3 books are a pain to read in @CAPS3, so I consider them offensive too.  There's a lot of music I don't like. I have no idea why, but I really dislike @CAPS5. The singers in today's @CAPS6 - @CAPS7 just don't cut it for me. And some of today's rap uses far too many bad words.  When it comes to movies, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 made no sense to me. I couldn't follow the plot at all. I also couldn't figure out why the @CAPS12 was killing people over @NUM1 in @CAPS12 of the corn. And I just didn't enjoy any of the @CAPS13 movies.  Even though I find these things offensive, I know that other people like them. Everyone has different tastes. In life, we're bound to come across things we don't like, but we can't just get rid of them. We should respect the fact that others have different preferences.
192	3169	2	2	Our founding fathers established amendments for the people, and one of the most significant is the freedom of speech. Censoring offensive materials is unnecessary. Books, music, movies, and magazines may contain bad messages or nudity, but that doesn't give anyone the right to eliminate them. Book - burning has occurred due to people's dislike of certain writings. People have the right to express their feelings through any medium. Moreover, censorship can make children more immature.  Book - burning is a terrible act. In the past, people burned books because of sex, drugs, and violence. In the novel @CAPS1 @NUM1, firemen burned every book they found in homes. Almost all books in the world, except non - fiction ones, are not entirely factual. The firemen in the story destroyed written materials because they were considered false and against the government. The root cause of this tragedy was that citizens became overly attached to their televisions and video games. Without books, there would be no real form of entertainment. Reading shapes who we are, so there should be more books, not fewer.  Libraries have no right to censor books. Freedom of speech has been a part of our nation since its early days. Stopping people from accessing obscene literature means preventing writers from expressing themselves. Writers have already put their ideas on paper, but if no one reads their work, they can't be heard. Libraries are meant to provide knowledge, not to shield children from certain content.  Parents often restrict their children from watching certain shows and movies. I knew a woman who wouldn't let her son watch the @PERSON1 series because of sorcery. She thought he might learn witchcraft, which I found ridiculous. When kids watch murder mysteries, fantasy shows, or dramas with nudity, they're curious. After watching such scenes, parents should talk to their children. Kids need to understand that killing is wrong, justice is good, and magic and dragons aren't real. Nudity is a part of the human body, and kids can become more mature about it if they're exposed to it in a proper context, but that doesn't mean they should watch porn.  Censorship is often misinterpreted. People think that offensive material will lead to bad thoughts, but we should understand the bad things in life instead of getting rid of them. Burning books destroys the foundation of the human mind. Freedom of speech is a law that should be followed, and censorship isn't always beneficial for children or anyone.
193	3170	2	2	The question of whether books, magazines, movies, and music should be kept out of children's reach or left accessible is a complex one. Is it fair that someone can't watch a movie, read a magazine, or a book just because others in the area find it offensive? If an adult believes that a particular item is only for their eyes, they should keep it in a private place, not restrict others' access.  Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because they're considered offensive. It's unfair to those who want to read them but can't due to the removal based on others' opinions. If these items weren't suitable for children, companies wouldn't print and sell them. Similarly, if certain music was inappropriate, music producers wouldn't allow artists to release it.  Students often face difficulties in school projects because adults think some websites are inappropriate. For example, in a history class, a student was assigned an assignment about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on @DATE2. When @DATE3 arrived, the student got a @CAPS4 because they couldn't access the necessary information. The student explained that websites were blocked, and books and magazines were either thrown out or unavailable. This was all because neighbors found the pictures and words offensive, and librarians stopped putting these items on the shelves.  The teacher offered to sign out a book for the student. The student was relieved as it was better than getting an @CAPS4. When @DATE1 @TIME1 came, the student managed to get some information from the book and submitted the assignment. The grade was a @CAPS8. The student was happy about the improved grade but still unhappy about the initial lack of access to resources.  This shows that movies, books, magazines, and music should not be removed from shelves. Kids shouldn't get in trouble for assignments they can't complete due to censorship. If a few citizens find certain items offensive, they should keep them out of their own sight, not restrict others' access. We should respect the diverse needs and interests of different people.
194	3171	2	2	Imagine coming home from work one day. Before even entering the house, you can hear loud music blaring from your child's room. As you get closer, you start to make out the lyrics along with the pounding bass, and you realize it's unedited, explicit versions of vulgar songs. Who would want their child listening to music that makes drinking, doing drugs, and other risky activities seem okay? I certainly wouldn't.  Music isn't the only source of offensive material in society. It can be found in books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, and on the @CAPS2. All these are easily accessible to children of all ages. That's why there should be a certain degree of censorship. For example, if there's a dirty book in a public library, it should only be rentable by people of a certain age. Just because something is bad doesn't mean it should disappear completely; there should just be a limit on who can view it. This applies to all materials that could contain offensive content.  Kids are kids, and there are things that should be off - limits to them, like explicit movies, books, and music. They don't need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at a young age. Censorship should definitely be in place in public libraries where young children are likely to be. However, it should only be to a certain degree. Keeping children's minds clean for as long as possible is beneficial for both them and society as a whole.
195	3172	2	2	"And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" This powerful statement by Katherine Paterson about library censorship holds true today. We often hear about books, magazines, and other library resources being banned because of unpopular views. The classic novel, The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4, has been removed from many public and school library shelves due to crude language like the word 'nigger'. Libraries should not remove resources because of offensiveness as it goes against the library's purpose and because people have different views.  A library is a place that provides resources for information, interest, and enlightenment. When a book or magazine is removed because of its origin, background, or seemingly obscene or unpopular views, the library fails to serve its purpose. For instance, if someone wants to find a book on @CAPS5 but the library bans it because another religion finds its teachings offensive, then should the other religion's books also be banned? As Katherine Paterson said, what's offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another.  Children are a special case. In my opinion, children probably shouldn't read about adult topics like sex. But it's the parents' or guardians' right to restrict access to materials they consider inappropriate. In most public libraries, young children aren't allowed to roam without an adult. This rule is important as it sets boundaries for children so they don't read or listen to inappropriate content. Libraries should also divide resources into sections for children, young adults, and adults.  Banning books from libraries takes away a part of history and creates a gap for the future. It's wrong to restrict what our parents once read. Materials shouldn't be censored in libraries just because they're offensive, as it's a form of censorship that violates our rights."
196	3173	2	2	"In my view, movies, books, and music should not be removed from the shelves. It's our right to choose whether to take a movie or not. Music, like country or sad music, is different from movies and books. You can't remove music from the radio. No matter what you do with the radio - shut it off, turn it down, or change the channel - in today's world, there will always be things on the radio that you don't want to hear, and also things that you do want to hear. That's my opinion on movies and music. However, if there were a way to keep certain movies away, I probably would. There are good movies and bad ones. For example, the movie ""Shylo"" is offensive. It shows an old man hitting a dog, which is very disturbing for someone who grew up around beatings. In conclusion, while we should have the freedom to access media, some content can be so offensive that there should be considerations about its availability."
197	3174	2	2	I firmly believe that some stores have magazines, books, movies, and music that need to be removed from the shelves. Just imagine, if you have children, would you want them to get hold of a magazine with nude men or women? People claim they can control their kids in stores, but we've all seen kids wandering off to do what they want and going to places they shouldn't, like the magazine section. Would you want to find your little one looking at a magazine with nude women? That's not appropriate for kids. The same goes for movies. If you rent a movie and it has nudity or cursing, do you want that around your kids? I wouldn't. Kids tend to imitate what they see, and you don't want your child cussing at you. I have little cousins, and I've seen them cuss back at their parents. When asked where they heard it, it's usually from TV or movies. So, is it really necessary to have all this inappropriate content accessible to people of all ages? No, it's not. All such content should be removed from the shelves and destroyed. It's gross, and it's inappropriate for children. We should get rid of it to do everyone a favor.
198	3175	2	2	Libraries offer a wide range of materials, including books, music, and magazines. However, the question arises: are all these materials suitable for all visitors? In this essay, I will explain why I believe offensive, distracting, and inappropriate materials should be either moved to a separate section of the library or removed altogether. Consider a young child walking into a library and picking up a book about abortions. While a young child may not understand it, a fifth - grader could. Should a fifth - grader have access to such a book? I think not. Children should read age - appropriate materials. This is one reason why offensive materials should be re - located. Libraries are typically seen as quiet places for reading and studying. Although some libraries allow visitors to listen to music, there should be a sound limit. Most people assume libraries enforce such limits, but in reality, many patrons don't follow the rules. It's extremely distracting to be trying to study in a library while the person next to you has their iPod blasting heavy metal. This is another reason for separating offensive and distracting elements. Libraries are community spaces where people, especially children, are expected to be safe. Many libraries offer magazines for entertainment. However, not all magazines are appropriate. Some contain inappropriate content that is not suitable for children or even teenagers. I believe inappropriate magazines should be removed completely, as anyone can look at the pictures they contain. I hope my perspective is clear. It's not that I'm against libraries; it's about the materials they offer. If I owned a library, I would create separate rooms for different age - appropriate books, such as a room for those 13+ and another for 18+. I would also have a dedicated music room. The rest of the library would be for quiet study and reading. I believe all libraries should adopt this model to create a better environment.
199	3176	2	2	"My name is @CAPS1, and I have a mixed view on the censorship of books, newspapers, and magazines. Some adventure or romance books may have parts that seem to need censorship, but that's how the author crafted the story to grab the reader's attention from the start. I think magazines often need to be censored. They promote bad habits globally. Some magazines have become less inappropriate, which is a step in the right direction. However, others seem to prioritize increasing sales by including certain content, regardless of its appropriateness. In my opinion, books should remain on the shelves. For some readers, the so - called ""censored"" parts are what make the story interesting. I'm not an avid reader myself, but based on what I know about other readers, I suggest censoring some content, but not all. Authors write books based on their life experiences or imagination. We can't control what they think and write. Some readers find the stories fascinating, while others want the books removed from libraries or their homes. It all depends on the reader. If I had the power, I would censor some things, but not in books. The author's ideas are part of the story, but some things could be left unsaid. Readers have the choice to read a book or not. If it's not appealing, they can put it back. However, I strongly believe that some magazines should be censored. Every day, in grocery stores or libraries, we see magazines with swimsuit models and sexual content. It's not right for kids to be exposed to this when they're looking for a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 book or an animal book. Another reason to censor magazines is related to religious views. People with certain religious beliefs may be offended by what they see in magazines. As a @CAPS6, I'm offended by some magazines that promote an idealized and often inappropriate lifestyle. In conclusion, while books should generally remain uncensored, magazines need more careful consideration and potential censorship."
200	3177	2	2	In @DATE1's @CAPS2, there are issues with the content available in libraries. Libraries are excellent places for learning about various topics, from Earth's history to future prospects. However, I believe some items on library shelves are inappropriate. Books, movies, and music can all be offensive to certain people. For example, the music of @DATE1 often has offensive lyrics, mainly focusing on drugs, sex, and girls. Rap artists' albums and some country singers' songs, which are full of themes like getting drunk and having sex, are, in my view, pointless and a waste of time. Movies can also be offensive. A poorly - made and inaccurate @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movie can be offensive to real - life veterans. I've seen my grandpa, a veteran, get extremely upset after watching a bad @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movie; he even cursed at the TV and almost threw the remote. Books can also cause offense, depending on the writer. Books with excessive cursing can be offensive to religious groups. I once read a book about someone killing cats, and as a cat - lover, I was so offended that I threw the book down, took it back to the library, and complained. The root cause of these issues is often money. Libraries seem to prioritize profit over the appropriateness of the materials they offer. They should be more careful about what they put on the shelves. If they continue to offer offensive materials, they may face lawsuits. By ensuring that only appropriate materials are available, libraries can avoid such problems and provide a better service to their patrons.
201	3178	2	2	We all cherish the freedom to consume the media we prefer, whether it's reading a book, listening to music, or watching a movie. Imagine if this freedom were suddenly taken away. Some individuals advocate for removing censored materials like books, music, movies, and magazines from libraries. However, I firmly believe that everyone should have the right to choose what they read, listen to, and watch. Nevertheless, when it comes to censored content, children should consult their parents first.  It's common knowledge that certain age - groups shouldn't be exposed to all types of media. But this doesn't mean these materials should be completely removed from libraries. Instead, children should discuss censored items with their parents, who can then decide if their child is mature enough to handle them. Moreover, removing these materials would deprive those who are mature enough to engage with them.  I recall my middle - school days when I was eager to read @PERSON1's novels at the library. My mother thought I was too young for them. We reached a compromise where I could read the novels she approved of, and she promised I could read any of @PERSON1's works when I got older. I found this arrangement fair as I knew the books would be waiting for me when I was ready.  In conclusion, we should have the freedom to enjoy the media we like, but younger age - groups need supervision. Removing materials from libraries is not the answer. When children grow old enough, they should be able to find these materials on library shelves.
202	3179	2	2	I firmly oppose the idea of removing certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, from shelves just because they are considered offensive. Censoring a work is one thing, but complete removal is another. I believe that authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to express their thoughts and ideas, regardless of the audience.  Censorship, in my opinion, is unjust. Authors should be able to freely convey their thoughts and feelings about a subject. Sometimes, a story can't be fully told without using certain words, whether they are considered good or bad. Without these words, a book loses its full potential. Censorship takes away the original values and qualities that a book could have had. This is unfair to both the author and the reader.  From my personal reading experiences, I've read books with inappropriate language. But the presence of one or two bad words doesn't mean a book should be removed from the shelves. For example, the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an outstanding read, and it would have lost its charm if it had been censored or removed.  In summary, good books with offensive language shouldn't be censored. Doing so ignores the overall message of the work. It's unfair to both the creative minds behind these works and the readers. So, no, I don't believe offensive materials should be removed from shelves, and neither should you.
203	3180	2	2	In my school and community, sexual conduct, crude language, and criminal behavior are prevalent themes in certain books, music, movies, and magazines. I think the censorship of these materials, especially music, should be more strictly discussed.  Our school library doesn't have many movies, but the town library does. Parents don't want children growing up too fast, yet they allow sexually - explicit and crudely - worded movies on library shelves. If this is a concern, these movies should be removed. While it's true that some things will happen regardless of precautions, we can still take steps to protect children under @NUM1 from inappropriate content.  @ORGANIZATION1 is a magazine that focuses on sex - related topics. I've read it, but it doesn't interest me. However, many kids are overly attentive to these subjects, which contributes to the problem of children growing up too quickly. If magazines like this were removed from library shelves, kids might not be as exposed to these ideas at an early age, and they wouldn't be tempted to engage in such behavior behind their parents' backs.  Music is a global phenomenon. A child around @NUM2 can be exposed to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in just @NUM3 minutes while listening to a single song. This type of music is easily accessible on public library computers. Since we aren't allowed to act in such a way at school, and we spend a significant part of our childhood and teenage years there, we shouldn't be allowed to listen to this kind of music.  In conclusion, materials like @ORGANIZATION1 magazines and explicit music should be removed from library shelves as soon as possible. Stricter censorship can prevent children from being exposed to inappropriate content too early and help address the problem of kids growing up too fast.
204	3181	2	2	The world's diversity means that what one person enjoys in terms of media consumption may offend another. However, it's not right to remove media that some people like just because it offends others.  Consider a child using inappropriate language in a grocery store. More often than not, they've heard it from their parents or the media. But the media shouldn't be hidden just in case a child is exposed to it. Parents and guardians have the responsibility to control what enters their homes. If they don't want their children to hear offensive language, they should regulate their media access.  Removing certain materials from the library is like trying to shield a child from ever seeing a naked body or hearing a curse word. It's an impossible task as people don't always watch their language in public.  That said, not all types of movies and books belong in a public library. There should be a limit to how inappropriate or vulgar a work can be and still be available in a public library. Extremely graphic novels and movies should have a separate space, away from the public library.  However, removing these books would be unfair. Denying access to those who find these works acceptable is wrong. As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone has the right to remove the books they dislike, there will be no books left on the library shelves.  In conclusion, while there should be some restrictions on what is available in a public library, complete removal of materials based on personal offense is unjust. There are better ways to manage access to different types of media, such as creating separate sections.
205	3182	2	2	The world is full of diverse people with different opinions about books, music, movies, and magazines. Just because one person doesn't like horror movies doesn't mean movie stores should remove them from the shelves. There are many horror - movie enthusiasts in the world who live for scary movies.  Personally, I have a wide - ranging taste and am open to trying all kinds of media. I believe everyone should explore new things as it broadens their horizons. For example, suppose you grew up loving the @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 books and want to share these childhood stories with your children. But if bookstores remove them because some think a tiger and a pig can't be friends, it's nonsense.  Businesses should understand that people have different preferences. If they only sell what they like, their business will likely fail. In conclusion, it's important to respect the diversity of consumer preferences and not remove products just because they don't appeal to a particular individual.
206	3183	2	2	What is considered offensive? If we were to remove books, music, movies, and magazines that some people find offensive, there would be nothing left. People vary, and thus they get offended in different ways. Removing such content would limit the educational resources available to students globally.  In school, we learn about slavery, wars, and certain political issues. These topics may offend many, but if we were to take related materials off the school and library shelves, children would be ignorant of history and current affairs. Regarding drugs and alcohol, many parents do not discuss the use of controlled substances with their children. Without relevant sources, children may never understand the harm these substances can cause to the body.  Everyone has different sensitivities, so who can determine what is offensive and what is not? If we were to act on individual sensitivities, should we remove all books, movies, music, and magazines from children's schools and libraries? Adults can also be offended; should we then take away all their resources, including newspapers? Removing content based on individual offense would lead us back to a time with no books, no local news, no movies - a cultural void, as no single person can define what the entire world deems offensive.  Everyone has the right to read and write what they choose. No one can claim to know what offends everyone. One person may be offended by discussions of race, another by a particular topic, and yet another by something as seemingly innocuous as talk about a cute cat. People perceive things differently, so there is no point in trying to control everyone uniformly. People know what they want to read, hear, and watch and do not need others to dictate. In conclusion, respecting individual differences in what is considered offensive and allowing freedom of access to diverse content is essential for a well - informed and open society.
207	3184	2	2	Censorship should be restricted to areas where young children are exposed, such as children's schools and TV shows intended for them. Materials not intended for young children should not be censored. If we censor everything because some people find it offensive, we will stifle the discovery of new ideas for community improvement.  Censoring books, movies, magazines, and music not meant for young people is a waste of time. For example, if a book explaining a scientific concept is removed from the shelf because someone finds it offensive, we may miss out on technological advancements. Censoring educational materials is not only unwise but also shows a lack of understanding. Studying relevant materials is crucial for scientific progress, and if offensive - labeled books are removed, we may never achieve technological breakthroughs.  Parents who advocate for censorship may not be fulfilling their parenting duties effectively. If they are concerned about certain topics, they should refrain from buying offensive movies or books for their children instead of pushing for censorship. Not all parents share the same view; some are open with their children about such topics and believe their children are mature enough to handle them.  As a child, I was not shielded from uncensored content. I watched movies and read books without censorship and was able to understand their meanings. I understand why parents want to censor their children, but they often fail to communicate with their children to assess their maturity level.  Censorship is appropriate for children's TV shows. However, censoring someone's ideas because they are considered offensive is a sign of ignorance. People have the right to freedom of speech and should not have their work censored just because a small group finds it offensive. Censorship can be a useful tool when applied correctly, respecting the rights of individuals and the need for open - mindedness in society.
208	3185	2	2	The issue of book censorship is a national concern. Different parents have different views on what is offensive in books. One parent may find a particular content highly offensive, while another may see it as a necessary life lesson for their children.  In my opinion, books should be censored, but on a national scale rather than a community - based one. By this, I mean that books with explicit content like nudity or vulgarity should be subject to censorship, not just because they contain a single inappropriate word that a parent deems unsuitable for their child. There should be a national rating system for books, similar to that in the movie industry.  Parents should be responsible for regulating what their children read. If they believe a book is inappropriate despite the rating system, they should prevent their children from reading it without removing the book from the shelf. It is the parents' duty to guide their children's reading, not to control the contents of the bookshelf.  Katherine Paterson once said, “All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf. But if I had the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.” This implies that if every parent removed a book they found offensive for their children, there would be no books left, as what is not offensive to one parent may be very offensive to another. Parents should leave the books on the shelf and manage their own children's reading choices.  In conclusion, while I support a government - led censorship program to a certain extent, it is primarily the parents' responsibility to oversee their children's reading. They should not interfere with the availability of books on the shelves, allowing for a diverse range of reading materials for all.
209	3186	2	2	I firmly believe it is wrong to remove a book from the library shelf just because one or a few people find it offensive. The decision should not be left to an individual. Instead, a vote or a meeting should be held to discuss such matters.  Just because one person dislikes a book does not mean they have the right to discard it. There may be many others who enjoy that book, and removing it would deprive them of the pleasure of reading. There are indeed books that many people do not like, but this does not justify one person's unilateral action to get rid of them.  For example, there could be a bright young boy or girl who loves a particular book. If an individual removes it because they don't like it, that child will lose the opportunity to read their favorite book. That's why I oppose the removal of books considered offensive from the library. There is always someone out there who appreciates the book that others might want to discard.  If a person finds a book offensive, they should simply avoid that section of the library and not worry about it. In conclusion, we should respect the diverse reading preferences of all and not let the sensitivities of a few limit the access of others to valuable reading materials.
210	3187	2	2	The media serves as a means for people to reach others. Whether it's a magazine, movie, or other forms of media, it will be seen by a wide audience. If a piece of media is considered unacceptable by many, it should not be made available to the public.  Personally, I believe that vulgar and offensive content should not be displayed. With millions of people viewing the media, I would not want my child exposed to such negativity. It's reasonable to assume that other parents feel the same way. Children are very observant, and negative content can have a detrimental impact on their mindset. We all want to raise our children well, and allowing them access to negative material is unacceptable.  It's not just children who are affected by the media; adults can also be influenced. I remember a time at my school when librarians removed books and magazines from the shelves for this very reason. I think they made the right decision. Some students may not have matured enough to handle inappropriate content and may interpret it differently from others.  I support the removal of inappropriate content from the media. No innocent child should be exposed to anything with a negative impact. We should always strive to have a positive influence on children so that they can grow up to their fullest potential. In conclusion, proper censorship of the media is necessary to protect both children and adults from the harmful effects of negative content.
211	3188	2	2	In my view, there is a pressing need to take measures regarding the content accessible to children. Nowadays, children seem to be exposed to increasingly inappropriate and harmful information, and their behavior and knowledge acquisition are taking a turn for the worse day by day. One suggestion is to adjust the age - appropriate access level from @NUM1 to @NUM2. This way, children will be old enough to make their own decisions about what to read, hear, or watch. However, before products are put on the market in stores, a self - check should be carried out.  Libraries should also be organized more carefully. There should be distinct sections to prevent young children from accessing the adult section, which may contain books about sex, drugs, or other inappropriate topics. I have @NUM3 little brothers aged @NUM4, @NUM5, and @NUM6. They know more than my parents did at their age because children today pick up information more easily. As citizens of @LOCATION1, we need to be more vigilant about the content that children can access.  When I was growing up, I didn't have the same level of knowledge as my little brothers do now. Every day, new things are emerging that can have a negative impact on our children, brothers, or other young ones. I believe schools should introduce a class in elementary school to educate children about the real - life issues they may face, such as drugs and sex. Since children have a better memory during their growth, teaching them at a young age will help them remember. Although this may not completely stop children from engaging in inappropriate behavior, it will at least reduce the proportion of those involved, and parents will be more at ease.  Parents also need to stop lying to their children about sex. Making up stories won't prevent children from finding out the truth eventually. Instead, they should make their children more aware of real - life situations. In conclusion, these steps are necessary to safeguard the well - being of our children and ensure a more appropriate environment for their growth.
212	3189	2	2	Books have always been an integral part of people's lives. From the time parents read bedtime stories to us as children, to the books teachers use for education, and later the assigned readings in classes, reading is ubiquitous. Even in the workplace, there is reading involved, whether it's receipts, orders, or recipes. Given the pervasiveness of reading, authors write books with a specific audience in mind, striving to attract their attention.  I firmly believe that books should not be removed from library shelves just because some individuals find them offensive. Everyone has their own opinions, and the fact that one person dislikes a book should not deprive others of the opportunity to read it. If a reader finds a book offensive, they can simply stop reading it. After all, different people have different tastes.  Children's books, however, are a different matter. Parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children. For young children, parents should read the books first to determine whether they are suitable for their children. For young adults, parents can use the internet to look up reviews and ratings of the books. Thus, the censorship of children's books is a parental responsibility.  Books are also open to different interpretations. When I read a book, I form my own opinion based on my understanding of the plot, imagination of the characters, and reaction to the events. My friend reading the same book may have a completely different view. Nevertheless, both of us gain something from the reading experience.  In conclusion, I think that parents should be in charge of censoring books for their children, and no one else should have the right to dictate what others can or cannot read. Books are a source of discussion, and everyone can form their own opinions. Every book deserves a place on the shelf.
213	3190	2	2	I firmly believe that offensive books, magazines, music, and movies should not be removed from library shelves. People have diverse tastes in reading, writing, and other activities, so there should be a wide variety of materials available for them to enjoy.  Books and magazines that some may consider offensive can also be enticing to readers. Personally, I love books about drugs, sex, and other inappropriate topics. My favorite book is even banned from my school library. If all inappropriate books were removed from libraries, I would have little to read. Real life is not always perfect, so why should we limit ourselves to reading about a fictional, ideal world?  Just as with books and magazines, people have different musical preferences, such as country, classical, metal, or rock. Removing offensive songs from the shelves would anger many people. Many songs played on the radio are degrading to women, yet they are still broadcast. If they can be played on the radio, why can't they be in a library? People will listen to those songs on the radio anyway.  Most modern movies are gory or offensive in many aspects, and many people are interested in them. If a movie can be watched in a theater, there is no reason why it can't be checked out from a library. Some people even check out movies shown in school when they were absent. What would they do if those movies were removed from the library? It would be unfair to them.  In conclusion, offensive materials should remain on library shelves. People will encounter them sooner or later, whether in the library or elsewhere. Removing them won't prevent people from accessing such content.
214	3191	2	2	"Have you ever entered a library and found a book so offensive that you complained or tried to get it removed from the shelf? Have you ever read a book halfway and wondered why you were reading it? Why would anyone read a book they know they won't like?  If someone has the right to remove books that bother them from the shelf, then I have the same right. I thought everyone was supposed to have equal rights. When I consider reading a book, I always read the back summary to decide if I'll like it. If I know a book, magazine, or movie will offend me, I won't waste my time on it.  It's clear that the author dislikes censorship, as she is arguing against it. Censorship is obviously something that bothers her, and everyone is entitled to their beliefs. I respect those who stand up for themselves in difficult situations. I'm not much of a library - goer, but if I ever find an offensive book on the shelf, I'm sure it will offend others too. So, why do some people try to get away with being offensive? Everyone has their own opinions, and if a book offends one person, it's likely to bother others as well.  I agree with @PERSON1. You'd be surprised at the wide range of things that can offend people. I've had numerous experiences with offensive movies, books, music, and magazines. When I encounter something offensive, I simply stop watching or reading it. We should stand up for our rights but not let our emotions get the better of us. If something offends you, don't let it bother you; just move on.  I remember watching a movie a while back where a black man was wrongly accused, imprisoned, and killed because of the era and his race. This kind of thing really upsets me because we are all the same, despite our different appearances and perspectives. We all have the same bodily functions and breathe the same air. I've always lived by the saying, ""Don't judge a book by its cover until you read it.""  In conclusion, I believe people should be allowed to believe in what they want. We should never tell others how to think, act, or feel. I wholeheartedly agree with Katherine Paterson."
215	3192	2	2	"When I visit a library, I sometimes come across materials that I find offensive. However, what I find offensive may not be offensive to the person standing next to me. Defining what is offensive is a complex task because people have diverse opinions based on their personal histories.  What I consider offensive might be seen as the best thing ever printed, published, or recorded by others. The major issue is that there is no set definition of ""offensive."" It's impossible to find a definition that everyone can agree on.  That being said, there should be limitations to protect certain age groups. For example, a kindergartener should not be able to check out a @CAPS1 movie. Some level of censoring is necessary to safeguard people, but it ultimately boils down to common sense.  We may never reach a consensus on what is offensive, but if we use our common sense, we can address this problem. By being reasonable and considering the well - being of different age groups, we can strike a balance between freedom of access and protection. In conclusion, while the concept of offensive content is subjective, we can use common sense to manage it effectively."
216	3193	2	2	In my view, censorship in public libraries is unjust. Whether to censor hinges on the content of materials and the age - groups of the readers. People vary greatly, and their interpretations of content differ as well. Removing offensive books, music, movies, and magazines from library shelves is a poor decision. If these materials are taken away, those who wish to access and read them will be deprived of the opportunity. There are individuals who genuinely enjoy such content, and different cultures within countries have a penchant for reading diverse materials. People have a natural curiosity to learn about various things. If these items are removed, the library's reading resources will be severely limited. Both children's and adult books contain a wide range of content. Often, these so - called offensive materials carry more information than others. In conclusion, censorship in public libraries is detrimental as it eliminates essential resources and restricts people's reading choices.
217	3194	2	2	I firmly believe that offensive books, music, and other media should not be removed from library shelves. Everyone has the right to access offensive content if they choose. It is unjust for one person to decide what others can or cannot view. If offensive items like music and books are removed from libraries, people's knowledge will be confined to what the library or the government deems appropriate, and this is unacceptable. Whether to engage with offensive content is a personal decision. People should not be shielded by society and only exposed to pre - approved information. For instance, knowledge about the Holocaust in the @DATE1, though deeply offensive to many, is crucial to prevent history from repeating itself. The government and society do not have the authority to control people's intake of information. If a particular type of music is removed from libraries, the internet, and TV, it may gradually disappear. Similarly, reading about the era before racial equality and slavery, though offensive, is essential to preserve historical knowledge. In conclusion, libraries should not deprive people of the knowledge of offensive things. While offensive content should not be glorified, people need to be aware of it. The world is not just about the good; people must also know about the bad and offensive aspects of history and society.
218	3195	2	2	Katherine Paterson's quote, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else,' highlights the complexity of book censorship. Different people have distinct viewpoints on the same book. One person may find a book offensive, while another may not. These varying perspectives significantly impact the process of book censorship. I don't think books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials should be removed just because one or two people find them offensive. If a large number of people are offended, then removal may be justified. However, if only a few are bothered while others find the content non - offensive, a vote should be taken. This approach is fairer and more satisfactory as it allows more people to have a say. It is unfair to remove a book that holds memories and experiences for some, just because others are offended. Therefore, instead of removing books based on the opinions of a few, a vote should be conducted. Different people may have diverse views on a single book, and it is important to consider these multiple perspectives. In conclusion, let more than a few people decide the fate of a book. A democratic vote can ensure that the decision to keep or remove a book is more representative and just.
219	3196	2	2	Library censorship is a complex issue. Everyone has a favorite book, but should it be removed if it offends someone? In my opinion, offensive materials should generally remain on library shelves. If we remove books that offend even one person, there will be no books left. As Americans, we have the right to freedom of speech. Authors and musicians exercise this right in their creations. Denying them the right to present their work is a violation of their basic rights as citizens. Personally, I dislike rap music. I don't even consider it music as no one sings in the traditional sense. However, a large portion of the population enjoys it. Removing rap music from shelves would deny teenagers their music, infringe on artists' freedom of speech, and potentially lead to unemployment for musicians. One of my favorite book series, the @PERSON2 series by @PERSON1, has helped me deal with the struggles of growing up. Just because it is a @CAPS2 series, it should not be removed from shelves. Other young girls should not be denied the opportunity to read this life - changing series due to the potential offense of a few. While some may want to eliminate offensive materials, it is unfair to the creators and fans. However, those who find the content offensive should be able to avoid it. Libraries should clearly separate different topics so that people can easily identify what they want to avoid. Libraries are a resource for everyone, and they should provide materials for all, even if some may seem offensive. In conclusion, library censorship should be approached with caution to balance the rights of different individuals and ensure that libraries remain a diverse and inclusive resource.
220	3197	2	2	Censorship in books is a significant concern in @LOCATION1. In my view, I would not remove a book from the shelf just because it offends someone. For example, 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' was removed due to the use of the word 'nigger.' However, many people who over - react to this word were not even around to understand its real meaning at that time. Censorship in music is another major issue. The lyrics in many songs, especially in rap, are often disturbing and may encourage young kids to engage in criminal and illegal acts. While I wouldn't completely remove rap music from the shelves, I would suggest that sellers place it in a section for those over @NUM1. Many people blame today's crime on music. In my observations, some people can read books with profound language without over - reacting, so these books should not be removed. Regarding rap music, although it may seem that it should be removed, there are people who listen to it without engaging in harmful behaviors. I myself have listened to gore - obsessed bands and read books with strong language and have not been negatively affected. When it comes to movies and magazines, there are many that should be removed. Some movies show excessive nudity, which is inappropriate for younger children. Magazines that promote the idea that skinny is better are also a problem. Many girls and women starve themselves to look like the models on magazine covers, which is ridiculous. In conclusion, while there are some materials that should be removed from shelves, a balanced approach is needed. We should not over - censor based on the reactions of a few, but also ensure that inappropriate content is not easily accessible to those who may be negatively affected.
221	3198	2	2	In a high - school setting, students are old enough to have encountered offensive content. Even if they haven't, shielding kids from offensive material is counterproductive in the long run. For instance, in a workplace, a boss might use vulgar terms like the '@CAPS2' word when an important assignment goes wrong. If a person hears such language for the first time in a work - related outburst, they could have a breakdown or become ineffective at work. It's not advocated that people should use vulgar language daily. However, the real world doesn't present a 'clean' version of language, and there won't be parents around to correct unacceptable speech. A survey of teens and young adults would likely show that nearly @PERCENT1 use some form of vulgar or inappropriate language. It's essential for kids and teens to understand what is unacceptable in society. But removing offensive material from the library and then exposing them to daily inappropriate language and situations in the real world is unjust. In conclusion, a balanced approach that educates rather than shields is needed.
222	3199	2	2	The question of whether one has the right to remove books is a significant one. Author Katherine Paterson makes a valid point: if one person has the right to remove a book from the shelf, then everyone does, and libraries would be left empty. This implies that if people remove books based on personal objections, libraries will have very few resources. Everyone holds different opinions, which are shaped by various factors such as beliefs, lifestyles, ways of thinking, and culture. There are likely books, movies, music, and magazines that one dislikes, but it would be selfish to completely eliminate them from the world. Even offensive and inappropriate materials are a form of information. They may not belong in children's sections, but they shouldn't be removed entirely. Music, for example, has a wide range of genres. Some people dislike country music and prefer alternative or classical, while others love country. Rap music is often offensive, yet many enjoy it. In conclusion, no one should have the right to remove materials just because they find them personally offensive. People should be open - minded and understand that not everyone has the same preferences. Just as we have freedom of speech, we should have the freedom to access the materials we enjoy.
223	3200	2	2	I believe that while censorship may be appropriate in certain cases, it has no place in public libraries. Books are meant to stimulate the human imagination. If people are restricted from reading books that are slightly offensive, they won't experience some of the greatest literary works until adulthood. Multiple studies indicate that books are beneficial for the mind, and removing them would be detrimental to educational and cognitive development. For example, a student assigned a report on classical literature might go to the public library only to find that all relevant books have been removed due to perceived offensiveness. This leaves the student in a difficult situation. Almost every great book contains parts that may be offensive to some readers. I can attest to this from my own school experiences. In the @NUM1 grade, I was assigned a book report on @PERSON1. The book was unavailable in both the school and public libraries because it was considered offensive to the black population due to the use of the word 'negro'. Eventually, the teacher had to change the report topic. Another instance was when my friend @PERSON2 wanted to learn about his cultural heritage. He couldn't find any books on the Arabic world in the library because they had been removed after @NUM2 @CAPS1 deemed Arabs offensive. In conclusion, the government should allow all books to remain on library shelves. People should have the freedom to choose which books to read. Censorship in libraries restricts access to knowledge and can cause unnecessary problems.
224	3201	2	2	There are many concerning aspects of the materials on library shelves, including books, music, movies, and magazines. These concerns involve the pictures, language, and advertising they contain. I've noticed that some of these materials contain offensive language, such as curse words. There are also instances of racism in some books, magazines, music, and movies. Additionally, there is bad persuasion, where one might be tempted to try things after seeing or hearing about them. Advertisements in libraries can also be a problem. Magazines may contain ads for tobacco, suggesting it's okay to try. Alcohol ads, like pictures of people with drinks, can make it seem cool to consume alcohol. The worst are drug advertisements, which can be extremely harmful, especially for students as drugs can ruin their academic careers. Pictures and scenes in movies and magazines can also be inappropriate. There may be scenes in movies and pictures in magazines that one doesn't approve of. In conclusion, the presence of offensive language, inappropriate advertising, and unacceptable pictures and scenes on library shelves is a significant issue. There should be some form of regulation to ensure that library materials are suitable for all users.
225	3202	2	2	Books that are considered offensive should not be removed from library shelves. Books, whether fiction or non - fiction, tell stories. Many offensive books have historical value, covering topics like wars, eras, and people. Everyone has the right to read any book they choose, or not to read a particular book at all. When books are removed from library shelves because someone or a group is offended, it restricts the rights of those who want to read them. For example, if someone wants to read about @CAPS1, they should be able to access relevant books. The topics of @CAPS1 and the @ORGANIZATION1 may be offensive to some, but when viewed as historical references rather than for entertainment, there should be no cause for offense. These stories play a crucial role in history, and learning from past mistakes can prevent history from repeating itself. Political correctness can't always be maintained in storytelling. For example, 'To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4' has many politically incorrect elements, such as the killing of an innocent man, the use of the word 'nigger', and racial inequality. However, it is an award - winning book that uses history as a guide, and the situations in it are real - life lessons. '@CAPS5 @NUM1' is a novel about a world where all books are burned. It shows the extreme consequence of removing offensive books. If we remove every book that someone finds offensive, libraries will be empty. If we start removing books from library shelves, we won't be able to stop. Eventually, we'll end up in a world like the one in '@CAPS5 @NUM1', with no access to written history or stories. In conclusion, removing offensive books takes away the freedom to read and learn. Political correctness should not override our freedom, and libraries should keep all books on their shelves.
226	3203	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should implement more censorship measures. Certain books, magazines, and movies should either be removed or categorized according to age. Based on my personal reading experiences and observations of others, I am convinced that materials influencing violence, sexual activity, and drug use should be removed from library collections. Young children should not be exposed to such content at their stage of development.  First, books containing violence should be eliminated from libraries. Children are highly impressionable, and violence is one of the most harmful influences. Depictions of violence in books can lead to ideas of killing and fighting, which are clearly unacceptable. Young children should not have access to books filled with shooting and combat scenes, as these may give them the wrong impression that such behavior is appropriate. Being influenced by violence can potentially lead to criminal behavior, and the act of reading a book is not worth the risk of ending up in jail.  Second, all materials related to sexual activity should be removed from libraries. Sexual topics should be introduced to children only at an appropriate age. For example, if a young girl reads a book suggesting that teen pregnancy is not a problem, she may develop incorrect attitudes towards the issue. Books and magazines with sexually explicit content should not be accessible to young children, as they can encourage kids to engage in inappropriate behavior that they should not even be considering. At the very least, these materials should be placed in an adult - only section.  Finally, books promoting drug use should not be available to children. Unless a book is about saying no to drugs, children should not read or view content that presents drugs in a positive light. Drugs can make people act against their better judgment, and children should be taught to reject both drugs and books that advocate the opposite.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is essential. It is necessary to protect young minds from the negative influences of violence, drug use, sexual activity, and other harmful content. By implementing appropriate censorship, we can ensure that libraries remain a safe and educational environment for all.
227	3204	2	2	I have become aware that there is a consideration in the community to remove or censor some books in most libraries. In my opinion, this is an unacceptable attempt to mislead or hide evidence of offensive reading material from future generations. For instance, one of my favorite books, 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS1', describes a child's hardships and the daily abuse he endures. Such books are not only informative but also broaden the reader's perspective on the past. Some of the topics covered in these materials include slavery, abuse, war, and discrimination.  These topics are still relevant in today's society. At least three of the four are current issues, so censoring and removing these books is pointless. It is crucial for our generations to be aware of the hardships, problems, and lessons associated with these topics. Failing to inform our generations about these issues could lead to a repetition of history, which our country is striving to prevent.  My view on movies is somewhat different. I believe some movies are acceptable, but they must not contain obvious and intentional acts of discrimination or offensive material. Most modern movies that are offensive in a way related to the plot are rated at least @CAPS5 @NUM1 or @CAPS5 @NUM2. This rating system allows specific age groups to watch potentially offensive or discriminatory material, but it also requires adult supervision for previewing the movie.  In closing, I hope you will consider my opinion as a reasonable approach to offensive and discriminatory issues. I firmly believe that access to certain content should be age - appropriate, depending on the nature of the material. Parents or guardians should make necessary observations when needed. Thank you for your time and understanding of my letter.
228	3205	2	2	Nowadays, people are offended on a daily basis. So, encountering offensive material in a library is no different from the rest of the day. However, there are individuals whose minds have not been corrupted by such offensive content, and they should have the right to keep their minds pure.  One solution to this problem is to rate books and magazines in the same way as movies. Adult - rated materials can be placed in a separate area of the library, while lower - rated materials can be on public display. The higher - rated materials can be kept in a less - visible area to protect the innocent minds, and those who want access to such materials can still obtain them.  Another option is to get rid of the censored material. In my experience, such content corrupts both the mind and soul and makes people act against their natural instincts. People who spend their time reading or looking at inappropriate materials often achieve little of value in their lives and can be a hindrance to society. If they cannot access this material, they will need to find other activities, such as reading a classic book or picking up a dusty @CAPS1.  Libraries now have a choice. They can keep their libraries as they are, place offensive material in a secluded room, or remove clearly offensive material to help society progress and achieve great things for future generations. By doing so, the likelihood of offending someone can be reduced, and library attendance may even increase.
229	3206	2	2	Have you ever come across offensive books, music, movies, or magazines in a library? If so, would you want to remove them from the shelves to prevent others, especially children, from seeing them? I've been to the library and seen offensive things myself, and I've also heard my family members talk about similar experiences. I'll share what I've heard from my family about their encounters with offensive library materials, how I felt when I saw such things, and my views on library censorship.  My sisters, mother, and step - mother have told me that they've found some books, music, movies, and magazines in the library offensive. I don't know exactly what these materials are, but I know how they felt and what they wanted to do. One day, they were discussing a couple of offensive books. They didn't mention the titles but kept talking about their feelings and what they'd like to do with the books. They were deeply offended by the names and content of these materials and wanted to take them off the shelves so that others who might be offended wouldn't see them. However, they also agreed that they don't have the right to remove them because there are people who may not find them offensive and might want to read them. So, they decided to ignore the offensive materials for the sake of others.  From my own perspective, I've walked into libraries and found a few books offensive. I didn't like the content or the titles and was tempted to take them off the shelves and throw them away. But then I thought about the people who might actually want to read these books. So, I decided not to remove them, respecting the fact that different people have different preferences. I knew that while some people might be offended, others would want to read these books, and I hoped that those who were offended would just ignore them.  Now, regarding censorship in libraries, I believe that offensive materials should be removed to avoid offending anyone. But if everyone had the right to remove books they found offensive, there would be few books left in libraries, and there would be no point in having libraries or in people writing books. So, I don't think anyone should have the right to remove offensive books. Instead, if someone finds a book offensive, they should ignore it and respect the fact that others may want to read it. In conclusion, I don't believe there should be any censorship in libraries. It's not anyone's fault that people find certain materials offensive, and we should respect different viewpoints.  So, what do you think? Do you believe people should have the right to remove a book from a shelf just because they find it offensive? And what are your views on library censorship?
230	3207	2	2	The question of whether certain books, movies, magazines, and music should be removed from shelves if they are considered offensive is an important one. These forms of media are created to convey messages, express viewpoints, and share opinions, and everyone has different perspectives.  I firmly believe that books, movies, magazines, and music should not be simply removed from shelves or stores. All of these media have rating systems in place. Movies are rated from @CAPS1 to @CAPS2, books are classified as for children or adults, and explicit music has a parental advisory sticker. We should simply follow these ratings. For example, if a four - year - old tries to buy tickets for a rated @CAPS2 movie, the theater won't sell them because the child is underage.  There is a concern that a child might pick up an adult book or magazine in a store. The solution to this problem is straightforward. Stores can create a separate room labeled as the adult section. Install cameras nearby so that if a young person tries to access the area, they can be caught. Alternatively, a desk can be placed in front of the adult section, and customers can be required to show an ID for entry. These materials are expressions of a person's dreams, hopes, desires, fantasies, and emotions, and they should not be suppressed just because someone deems them unfit. If a particular item offends you, the simple solution is not to read or view it.  In conclusion, we should follow the rating rules and take necessary precautions. If all these rules are adhered to, businesses and libraries can ensure the safety and satisfaction of everyone.
231	3208	2	2	I firmly believe that nothing should be removed from library shelves. The question of whether one prefers their kids to learn from facts or from friends is a thought - provoking one. Censoring books, magazines, movies, etc., which are mainly for entertainment or information, is not a good idea. Of course, we wouldn't want a five - year - old reading an adult book, but as kids grow, they need to learn various things. It's impossible to constantly control what children read throughout their lives, including college and adulthood. Books offer facts and more reliable information than what one can get from people. If all books related to drugs or alcohol were removed, it would be difficult for someone to write a report on these topics. These books are created to provide people, especially kids, with unique facts, and they can also help expand vocabulary and knowledge. If someone finds a book offensive, they can simply avoid it. Libraries can't cater to everyone's tastes, and what one person finds offensive may not be so for another. Removing one book could lead to a chain reaction, leaving no books on the shelves. Controlling what everyone reads would make people unhappy and limit their mental development as it takes away one of their rights. What kids read shapes their future. If their favorite series or genre is removed, they may lose interest in reading and other forms of entertainment. Kids get into reading when they enjoy what they read. Therefore, I wouldn't remove anything from the shelves because everything has an appeal to someone, and controlling reading materials leads nowhere and can't stop the knowledge that books can offer.
232	3209	2	2	Hi, my name is @PERSON1. I'd like to discuss a few topics. I've heard many people talking about libraries removing a lot of their materials from the shelves. I think libraries around the world contain a vast amount of information. If we start removing information from them, then what's the point of having libraries? I believe that everything in libraries is very important, and it's hard to say that everyone wants these materials to be removed. One thing I think libraries don't really need is movies because most movies have a corresponding book or are very similar to one. Regarding the issue of offensive content, I think everyone should be mature about negative remarks, even if they're hurtful. The more people read such comments, the less they'll care because they'll get used to it. If I could tell the world one thing, it would be not to be offended by what others say. In conclusion, libraries should retain their diverse collection of materials, and people should be more tolerant of different content.
233	3210	2	2	You have to admit that although you want your kids to have freedom, not all of them are responsible enough to handle @CAPS1. You can lecture them all day about being responsible with @CAPS1, but they'll do it anyway. As a teenager, I know this from experience. So, there are certain things that need to be restricted to prevent them from getting distracted from what truly matters in their teenage years, which is schoolwork. If school systems allowed offensive or inappropriate materials on their shelves, kids would surely get distracted. When I say inappropriate, I'm referring not only to sexual content but also to materials that are not suitable for school. You might hope that kids would save @CAPS1 for after they've done their schoolwork at home, but as I've said, kids will do what they want. And most of the time, what they want is not schoolwork. They'd rather sit down, read a magazine, and get lost in the world of celebrities and scandals. Schoolwork is extremely important in teenagers' lives. When they're at school, they should focus on schoolwork and activities. If they want to read magazines in their free time, they should do it at home. Offensive books in school are only a distraction from schoolwork and are unnecessary. However, public libraries are a different story. I believe that nothing should be censored in public libraries because people go there of their own free will. I go there for research and the joy of reading, and so do many others. It's up to each individual to be responsible and stay focused on their work or get distracted. Since not only teenagers but also adults use public libraries, it's unacceptable to censor materials. Everyone has different reasons for going to the library, whether it's for school or just for fun. Not everyone is responsible, especially teenagers. That's why I think offensive or inappropriate materials should not be allowed in school libraries but should be available in public libraries. While equal rights and freedom are necessary, schoolwork is too important to let kids get distracted. Schoolwork is the key to their future.
234	3211	2	2	In my opinion, all people have the right to read, listen to, and watch different materials. Censorship should be an individual choice, not imposed by others. It's wrong for someone to tell others what they can or cannot read. If we censor everything, our society will stagnate. Any word can be offensive to someone. Those who are easily offended are often the ones who hold back our society's full self - expression. Colorful words that are offensive to one person may be perfectly fine for another. It depends on the individual's preferences. In my experience, those who dislike reading due to harsh or colorful words are often less self - expressive and more sensitive. Censorship also goes against the freedom of speech. We were given this right, so we should use it. I can't understand why anyone would want to take away books, music, movies, and magazines from us. If everything were regulated by one person's idea of what to read, our country would regress. Therefore, I strongly advise against removing any books from the shelves. The majority of people agree that we should not be censored. Only the sensitive people who are offended can choose not to pick up the books, listen to the music, or read the magazines. The right to choose is ours, and it should remain so.
235	3212	2	2	Censorship is a term that everyone has heard, but do people really understand its meaning and impact? In the past, rulers and leaders censored books they considered harmful. But how could they claim to know what was best for their people? What gave them the right to decide what their people could read? In today's society, we still face censorship issues. There are those who believe libraries should censor their books. However, censorship is wrong. Books, magazines, movies, music, etc., should not be removed from the shelves just because some people find them offensive. Everyone has different tastes, not only in food but in all aspects of life. No one has the right to claim that one genre is superior to another. Censorship is wrong because it restricts what people can read. Some people like mysteries, while others prefer romantic books. If we allow censorship, then the idea that there is a book for everyone becomes false. If libraries removed every book that might offend someone, there would be no books left. For instance, religious books of one religion may offend people of other religions, but that doesn't mean we should remove them. If we did, we'd have to remove all religious books, and no one would benefit. Similarly, censorship limits what people can watch. If we removed every movie with even a small offensive part, there would be no movies left. Every movie has elements that some people love and others hate. If we focus only on the haters and remove movies accordingly, the lovers of those movies will suffer. People who love horror movies may dislike comedies, but that doesn't mean we should get rid of comedies. Those who don't like a particular type of movie simply don't have to watch it. In the same way, censorship prevents people from enjoying their favorite music. We can't censor music because everyone has different preferences. If we remove one genre, we'd have to remove all. It's unfair to censor a genre just because some people dislike it when there are others who enjoy it. Doing so would be unfair to those music lovers and could lead to more offense. There will always be unhappy people in the world. We shouldn't resort to censoring books, movies, and music in libraries and other places just to make people happy. Censorship in libraries restricts what people can enjoy and makes those who like the censored items angry. We should let people choose what they like. If someone wants to read, watch, or listen to something, they should be allowed to. Those who dislike it can simply avoid it. We can't take away something from those who love it just because someone is unhappy.
236	3213	2	2	Rewrite of the first item (using subjective style) I firmly believe that while some materials may be offensive to certain individuals, this does not grant them the right to demand these materials be removed from the shelves. I strongly oppose the idea of removing such materials because people can easily ignore what they find offensive and choose not to read them. Some individuals might think certain materials are offensive, but they should understand that these materials may not be directed at them. Magazines are a different case as they often feature people's faces on the front cover, which can be inappropriate. Some of these individuals have families who may not want to see their loved ones on magazine covers.  Katherine Paterson's quote implies removing books from shelves to prevent children from being tempted to read them. In my view, this is not the right approach. Some of the books being removed could be valuable for someone to relate to or learn from. Whether parents want their children to read these books or not, children might still find them and question why they've never seen them before, leaving parents at a loss for words.  Libraries are essential resources for those seeking to read and learn new things. Removing a book from the shelf could deprive someone who truly needs it. We shouldn't be the ones to hinder a child's learning. We never know who might be looking for the item we've removed, and once it's gone, they may never find it.  Some people claim that reading certain materials can influence behavior, but I find this argument baseless. It's like saying you like lime - green because someone else does. It's neither true nor reasonable. If our parents hid a book from us, we'd be angry and curious. We'd be more eager to read it. However, if it wasn't hidden, we might not even be interested.  Parents have the right to decide what their children read, watch, and listen to. But they shouldn't restrict access to materials just because they're offended. The music, movies, or books they're hiding could hold the answers to many things. It could help children determine the path they want or don't want to take, leading them to success in life. So, why not take the risk? It might even benefit us as well.
237	3214	2	2	In the contemporary world, censorship is a highly significant concept. With the rise of social media, there has emerged vibrant communities of individuals eager to express their voices, and others are willing to listen. The internet has enabled us to access a vast reservoir of knowledge from across the globe, allowing us to gain insights into countries like @LOCATION2, where media censorship is equated with treason. As governments begin to censor the internet, it is prudent to examine an age - old argument: library censorship.  In modern times, the presence of public libraries has become almost a prerequisite for a city to be regarded as a fully - fledged urban entity. Although public libraries and their associated funding are not part of the @ORGANIZATION1, they have established themselves as indispensable sources of knowledge and culture in our neighborhoods. A single public library can house a diverse range of materials, including historical town records, children's books, novels, research papers, non - fiction and fiction books, magazines, and various other forms of entertainment and knowledge. Despite the widespread use of the internet, public libraries remain crucial spaces for city residents to socialize and learn.  Today, libraries may carry books that were once on the 'banned books' list. However, this does not imply that book - banning has ceased. Libraries are typically family - oriented institutions funded by the public, and thus, they are required to adhere to the moral and ethical standards of the local community. Consequently, there is no unified 'national banned books list', and there are significant discrepancies in book - banning practices throughout @LOCATION1. As cultural content becomes increasingly controversial, libraries face a difficult choice: either keep up with the times and offer more controversial reading materials or risk becoming obsolete by catering only to the senior generation.  Introducing new and relevant literary materials into libraries can attract more patrons, whether they are young adults or older individuals seeking to stay informed. One of the major controversies in public libraries is the inclusion of sexual intimacy in books. As a new generation is exposed to explicit music lyrics from artists like '@ORGANIZATION2' or '@ORGANIZATION3', younger children are becoming more aware of sexual matters. Contemporary authors have recognized this trend and have started to include references to sexual intimacy, albeit in a non - detailed manner. This is a positive development as, in the long run, education about sex, including safe sex, birth control, @CAPS1 prevention and testing, is more important than keeping children in ignorance. Encouraging young adults to engage with books and continue learning outside of school is a far more pressing issue than debating the inclusion of new reading materials in libraries.  Public libraries are central to out - of - school learning in many communities, regardless of their size. Given this, it is illogical to oppose the inclusion of new books that could attract more patrons. Even from a commercial perspective, this approach makes no sense, as it would turn away potential users. We, as a nation, should demonstrate that we are forward - looking and not trapped in the past. Our young adults should have access to the best education, not only in schools but also through active reading in libraries, which will contribute to their overall development.
238	3215	2	2	The question of whether certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they're offensive is a complex one. In my opinion, they generally shouldn't be removed, except when the content is so inappropriate that children should not be exposed to it.  My reasoning is that what one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. When someone goes to the library and checks out a book, they are aware of what they're getting into. So, just because a book is offensive to some, it doesn't mean it should be removed from the shelves. However, my opinion is a bit nuanced. If movies and library materials are inappropriate, then they should be restricted to adults.  I know many others may have different views on this subject, but I firmly believe that most things should stay on the shelves. Movies, especially those with inappropriate content, should be sold to adults only. This way, we can balance the rights of individuals to access information and the need to protect the sensibilities of others, especially children.
239	3216	2	2	One sunny afternoon, Sarah, a regular visitor to the local library, walked in with a sense of excitement. Libraries are wonderful places where people of all ages can freely access books, movies, and music for a certain period. As Sarah grew older, she discovered a different set of books, movies, and music that she would never let her young son, Tommy, near.  Books have always been Sarah's escape. She would lose herself in the pages, entering a world of her own. One day, she found 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' in the adult section of the library. The book had some content that was inappropriate for a child, but it wasn't overly offensive. Sarah read it in her own private time, far from Tommy's reach. This is how it should be. However, she noticed that some adult books were placed too close to the children's section. The library needed to redesign to prevent kids from accidentally stumbling upon adult materials.  One evening, after a long day at work, Sarah wanted to relax by watching a movie. But Tommy was around. Keeping him out of the room while watching a movie with some inappropriate content was nearly impossible. Even if she tried to watch it quietly, Tommy could hear the sounds through the wall. And music was no different. One time, she left a @CAPS3 in the car. When she sent Tommy to wait in the car while she fetched something, he started the car at her request, and the music began to play. The library was supposed to be a place where Tommy had only good thoughts, but this incident made him question the kind of materials available there.  Libraries, which are usually a haven for kids to pick out books they love, are at risk of becoming places where parents can access items that might harm a child's innocent mind. To address this, libraries need to either remove all inappropriate movies and music or store them as far away as possible from the children's area. It's essential to protect the young minds while still providing a rich source of knowledge and entertainment for adults.
240	3217	2	2	As I walked into the library one day, I was greeted by the hushed whispers and the sound of people criticizing the books and materials on the shelves. Some individuals were quick to label certain items as offensive and demanded their removal. But in my view, there is no valid reason to engage in such arguments about what should or should not be in libraries.  My own views, which align with the spirit of libraries, emphasize the importance of diverse materials for people around the world. Katherine Paterson's passage rings true when she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Everyone has a unique perspective, and what one person finds offensive, another may not. This difference in opinion often leads to the misinterpretation of materials and the call for their removal.  To illustrate my point, I recall a time when I visited the library and saw books and magazines that dealt with the topic of slavery and equality. For some colored people, these materials might be a reminder of their freedom and a source of interest. However, others might find it uncomfortable to revisit a painful past. This shows that the argument can go both ways, and removing or keeping these materials is a complex decision.  Materials in libraries often symbolize events, time periods, or ideas. Some people may want to engage with these symbols, while others may oppose their presence. When someone removes a material they find offensive, it can disappoint those who were interested in it.  Another common argument is that libraries are public places, and thus, there should be restrictions on the content. But I believe that instead of picking and choosing what to remove, people should simply focus on the sections that interest them and ignore the rest.  Based on my experiences and observations, I believe we should approach library censorship with an open mind. While it won't solve all the problems, it will prevent the unnecessary removal of materials that could be valuable for future generations, whether it's for children, teachers, or anyone seeking knowledge.
241	3218	2	2	I firmly hold the view that certain books, music, movies, magazines, and the like should not be removed from the shelves. This is because what may be offensive to one individual might not even come close to being offensive to another. There are numerous types of books, movies, and even some music that carry historical significance. Although they might be offensive, they are part of the history of a particular race or culture. What could be historical or informational to one person may be offensive to another, and vice versa. If everyone were given the opportunity to enter the largest library and remove materials that offended them, I believe the library would end up with few, if any, books left. Katherine stated, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' meaning that if parents or teenagers removed 'offensive' material, there would be nothing remaining. A great deal of content is considered offensive due to religious beliefs, but not everyone shares the same religion, or any religion at all. Just as religion should not be taught in public schools, censorship should not be permitted in public libraries. If censorship were to occur in public libraries, I am certain there would be protests and potentially riots. People have said that @PERSON2 was a bad man. However, if we remove books and movies that depict what he did, I believe history is more likely to repeat itself. There have been many negative aspects in history that we read about today, such as gangs. If we do not read about the wrongs they commit or watch movies that show what it would be like to be a gang member, will there be an increase in gang activity and membership? This is precisely why I believe we should not remove books, magazines, movies, etc., from the shelves.
242	3219	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should make all kinds of books, magazines, music, and movies available to the public, regardless of whether they are deemed offensive. First, it's essential to recognize that every individual is unique, with different reading preferences for books and magazines, as well as distinct tastes in movies and music. Second, the term 'offensive' is highly ambiguous here, as what might seem offensive to one person could be perfectly acceptable to another. There's no need for public outrage or strikes. Finally, people should have the freedom to choose the materials they read, watch, and listen to, as it's for their own entertainment, learning, and personal benefit. Therefore, libraries should not remove any materials from their shelves based on the perception of offensiveness.  Each person has their own preferences when it comes to library materials. For instance, one person might enjoy philosophical books, while another prefers romance - comedy ones. If library officials were to remove philosophical books, the person who loves philosophy would be left without suitable reading material. Although there are magazines and movies about philosophy, the experience of learning from them is different from reading @ORGANIZATION2's book or @ORGANIZATION3's @CAPS1. I once had a similar experience with my friend. She liked horror movies, and I preferred historical ones. The library didn't have the horror movie she was looking for because they weren't popular in that city. She was disappointed, and I ended up watching a historical movie alone.  The term 'offensive' is ambiguous. What seems offensive to one person may not bother another. For example, a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine cover might be offensive to a child but interesting to a young adult interested in surfing or @CAPS2. Instead of removing the magazine, the library could provide a section for age - appropriate materials.  In conclusion, people should be free to choose what they consume from library materials. Libraries should not remove potentially offensive items as it goes against the principle of individual choice and the diverse needs of the public.
243	3220	2	2	Katherine Paterson believes that if one person has the right to remove a book they dislike from the library shelf, then everyone else has the same right, which would ultimately leave the shelves empty. While this might seem logical, I disagree. I don't think people should be able to remove a book just because they find it offensive. They simply don't have to take the book.  I am firmly against censorship in libraries. If someone finds a book offensive, they can choose not to look at it or check it out. Other people might enjoy that book. Liking a book is a matter of personal opinion. For example, if someone doesn't like your outfit, you wouldn't burn or throw it away just because of their opinion. The same goes for movies, books, music, and magazines. Everyone has different tastes, so there should be a variety of materials in libraries.  The only time it would be appropriate to remove a book from the shelf is if it's in your own house. You can do whatever you want with it then. Even if you were to have the whole town vote to get rid of a book, and 95% of the people voted in favor, it might be okay. But when it comes to public resources like libraries, you need to consider the whole community, not just yourself.  I read an article about banning '@PERSON2' from schools, and I thought it was a bad idea. '@PERSON2' was one of the top - picked books by high - school students. If parents didn't want their kids to read it, they should have just told them not to. It's unfair to other readers who enjoy '@PERSON2 @PERSON2' for parents to go into the school and remove the book.  Choosing what to read is a personal choice. People shouldn't be deprived of reading the books they like just because others don't approve. If someone disliked a book you loved, would you want them to take it off the shelf? In conclusion, libraries should respect the diverse reading preferences of the public and refrain from removing books based on individual offense.
244	3221	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should not remove materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines from their shelves, even if they are considered offensive. What may be offensive to one person might be perfectly acceptable to another. There's no need for public outcry or strikes. People should have the freedom to choose what they read, watch, and listen to.  I remember when I was around @NUM1, I went to a hotel in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 family and a family friend. The man @CAPS4 dad invited was @PERSON1. He wasn't racist, but he made inappropriate jokes about how people dressed and sometimes went too far with racist comments. We tolerated him. When we went to check in at the hotel, the clerk at the counter was @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We paid for our room without any issues and waited for @PERSON1 to ask for a room. @CAPS4 father asked him what he was doing as he just stood there looking at the clerk. @PERSON1 then took out a pamphlet from his shoulder bag and gave it to the girl. I have no idea what was in the pamphlet, but when she received it, she dropped it, looked at him with tears in her eyes, gave him the finger, and then went to the back to get a man.  As the large man approached @PERSON1, @CAPS4 father stepped in. @CAPS4 dad tried to talk to the man, but he was focused on @PERSON1. @PERSON1 said, 'Look, I was only kidding with the girl. She needs to learn how to take a joke.' @CAPS4 mom took me and @CAPS4 brothers to our room and tried to get @CAPS4 father to come with us, but he promised to join us soon.  Half an hour later, @CAPS4 dad came back with @PERSON1. I asked what was on the paper, and @CAPS4 father said it was an AIDS pamphlet from a rest - stop. @PERSON1 said it was an inside joke about 'blacks' and AIDS. It turned out the clerk's mother had died of AIDS the previous year. Although this was an unpleasant incident, we stayed at the hotel for the whole weekend. The clerk and @PERSON1 exchanged angry looks, but we moved on. This shows that just because something or someone might be offensive, we don't need to remove them. Similarly, libraries should not remove materials just because they might offend some people.
245	3222	2	2	I think materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to young kids and others. If the materials have nothing to do with learning, they don't belong on the shelves. There are specific things that kids should read, so if there are materials meant for adults, they should be placed in a separate section away from the kids' area.  There should be no music or movies with violence because kids are already exposed to too much of it these days. The only music or movies that should be available are those with learning materials. In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should only be put on the shelves if they contain learning materials and can inspire kids to achieve something in life.
246	3223	2	2	Libraries house a diverse range of materials, including books, movies, magazines, and tape recorders. Books can fall into either the fiction or non - fiction category. However, these materials may be offensive to some, while others simply view them as regular items to consume. Thus, libraries should not remove such items from their shelves. The selection of these materials is made by library customers, not the authors. The authors present their works, leaving the choice to the users. Blaming the authors is unjust. Moreover, there are various types of writers and artists who invest time in creating novels or series for our consumption. People should not take these materials too seriously as they can be either fictional or non - fictional. Another reason libraries should not remove items is that what offends one person may not offend another. For example, the topic of slavery might be offensive to a person of color, but for others, it is a historical event. People should read the introductions before borrowing a book to decide if they like it. Therefore, they should not attempt to have the item removed. If a child checks out an item with parental permission, it is the parents' responsibility. If someone has an issue with a particular item, they can complain, but libraries should not remove it. As mentioned, one person may dislike an item while another may enjoy it. Libraries are places for people to borrow materials, not for removing them from the shelves.
247	3224	2	2	I'm here today to share my views on library censorship. Why is it important, and why should we care? When you enter a library, you expect a public space to read and borrow books. But what if you come across something offensive while browsing? How should you react? In my opinion, censorship is acceptable when necessary. It protects children and young adults from content meant for adults, such as horror books, offensive music, and in many cases, pornography. Censorship plays a crucial role in libraries because anyone can pick up any item. An adults - only section for books, movies, music, etc., alleviates parents' concerns about their children being exposed to inappropriate content. For example, a twelve - year - old named @PERSON1 could check out a violent video game without his parents' knowledge if there were no censorship. However, censorship can be overdone. In reality, parents also bear some responsibility for their children's actions, like allowing them to listen to swear - filled music or have unrestricted access to personal computers. Censorship can also lead to the removal of important information related to past events. For instance, a ninth - grade student looking for a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movie in the library may be left without a source if the movie is too graphic and has been censored, forcing them to use a computer. Censorship has its pros and cons. If properly controlled, it can be a powerful tool in libraries, schools, and homes. Although it can sometimes get out of hand, when managed well, it can benefit the community and the country. In essence, censorship is acceptable to a certain extent, and I hope you can see the same perspective after considering these points.
248	3225	2	2	I've read some truly interesting books that are offensive in some way, and there are even excellent books that have offended me. If we didn't have such books and stories, we'd never know what truly offends us. That's why I believe books, magazines, music, or any such materials that might be considered offensive in some way should remain on the shelves. Almost all books can potentially be offensive or hurt feelings; it depends on the reader's perspective. What offends one person or group may not offend another. If we removed all the books that someone claimed were offensive, there would be no books left. Writing is a means of self - expression or storytelling. Some authors may do this in an offensive way, while others may try to soften their views. Either way, it's possible to find something offensive in the writing. In conclusion, I firmly believe that offensive or hurtful books should stay on the shelves. If we removed them all, the selection of available books would be severely limited.
249	3226	2	2	Offensive material is widespread, and many people try to shield their children from it. However, if children are determined to access it, they will find a way. So, I don't think all offensive material should be removed from shelves. But when something offends multiple people, it may need to be removed. Take music as an example. Some songs have explicit lyrics, but that doesn't make them bad enough to be removed. Music is ubiquitous, and if someone tries to restrict listening due to a few words, people will find other ways to listen. Movies are a bit different. Some movies have age restrictions because of offensive content. Yet, some people watch these movies knowing the offensive material and then complain. Movies should not be removed from shelves as it's a matter of personal choice. There will always be someone who wants to watch them. Books may be an exception. Many people read books, and while some enjoy them, others find them offensive. With music and movies, people know they are fictional. But some books are written based on the author's real beliefs. So, some books might need to be removed because one person's beliefs can influence others. There's a big difference between choosing not to consume something and being prohibited from it. All materials with explicit content come with warnings, and the decision to continue consuming them lies with the individual.
250	3227	2	2	In my view, library censorship is a bad idea. Nowadays, libraries have books with offensive language. If we removed all such books, libraries would have very few items left. The same goes for music; much of today's music may contain offensive words, and people should get over this. Some parents may not like offensive content in library materials such as books, movies, magazines, and music. But if they don't want their children to access such content, they should choose their children's reading materials. Removing all offensive items is not a smart move because some people enjoy reading and listening to this type of content. Many of today's best - selling books and popular music contain elements like drugs, offensive language, sex, and gang - related themes. However, these can teach valuable lessons on how to avoid such situations in the future. If we remove these materials, children may be more likely to engage in these activities without understanding the side - effects. Some of the top - selling books and music have offensive content, and it's unfair to restrict children from them just because of a few offensive words. If there are books you don't want to read, simply don't read them. It's unfair to remove all materials with offensive language or racism just because you think it's not suitable for your child. People who enjoy these materials should not be deprived of the opportunity to read or listen to them because a few parents are unhappy. Some old books with racism and offensive language are even used in school curriculums. Removing them would be a loss to our education. In conclusion, library censorship is a terrible idea as it can deprive us of important lessons and educational opportunities necessary for success in life.
251	3228	2	2	Censorship in libraries is a highly controversial issue. A significant number of individuals believe it to be the correct course of action, while an equally large group vehemently opposes it. There are several compelling reasons why censorship should not occur in libraries. In @LOCATION1, all people are entitled to freedom of speech. When books are removed from library shelves because they are deemed offensive, this fundamental right is being violated. Authors have the right to express themselves and to have their works equally recognized by the public. Although censorship can be acceptable in certain circumstances, the decision of what to censor should not rest with the government.  First and foremost, freedom of speech holds great importance for the people of @LOCATION1. If this freedom were to be revoked, it would surely not go unnoticed. When books, music, movies, and magazines are censored, the author's freedom of speech is being undermined. For instance, if an atheist were to write a book claiming that @CAPS1 does not exist, many @CAPS2 would likely seek to remove this book from all library shelves. However, the fact that one group of people dislikes the topic, message, or theme of a book does not justify its removal from a library. A library is a place where all books should have the opportunity to be read, not a place where people can cherry - pick based on their beliefs.  Secondly, authors have the right to express their thoughts and to have their works equally acknowledged by the public. Naturally, some books will be more popular than others, but there are also books that are overlooked not because of the quality of the writing, but because of the chosen topic. There is no valid reason for an entire community to ignore an author's work simply because a large group of people disagree with its content. Among the small group of people who do not wish to have the book removed, there will be individuals who would read it. Just because the majority dislikes the topic of a work does not mean that the minority should be deprived of the opportunity to read it. The author has the right to their creation and should have the chance to have their work recognized.  Finally, censorship can be beneficial in certain situations, depending on how it is implemented. For example, many parents do not want their children exposed to certain materials. It should be the parents' prerogative to decide what their children can read, listen to, or watch, rather than a large group of people. Different parents have different standards, and what one parent finds acceptable for their child may appall another. Therefore, it is impossible to establish a set standard for what is acceptable without causing a great deal of controversy. Once a child reaches adulthood, they have the right to decide what they want to obtain from a library. However, there should be certain age - related limits. For example, a person must be at least seventeen years old to rent a '@CAPS3' rated movie, which is the same age required to enter a '@CAPS3' rated movie without parental supervision. Some of these age limits should be applied in libraries, but otherwise, the decisions should be left to the individual.  Censorship in libraries will always be a dynamic issue. It may be in effect at times and not at others. The people of @LOCATION1 have the freedom of speech, and removing books from libraries is, to some extent, a violation of that right. Authors should have the right to have their books equally acknowledged by the public and kept on the shelves. Censorship decisions should be made by individuals themselves, and parents should have the say over what their children read, rather than having these decisions made by others.
252	3229	2	2	Have you ever searched for a book only to find it banned from all local stores? I've been fortunate enough to avoid such a situation, but I can only imagine the extreme distress of wanting a controversial book and not being able to find it. In my opinion, young adults should have the freedom to read any book or news article they desire. The fact that a book is considered offensive or off - putting by most people is not a valid reason to completely ban it from both store and library shelves. If there is even one person who can gain educational benefits from reading the book, they should at least have the opportunity to access that information.  One crucial point to keep in mind when considering this topic is that regardless of the source or its content, there will always be someone who finds the book too graphic or too close to home to tolerate. However, there are also books that are not suitable for younger children or the faint - hearted. For example, the book series 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' features people being thrown into an arena and forced to fight for their lives. Most people over the age of twelve can handle most of the 'offensive sources' available to the public, but there are even some cases where adults may struggle. Take the famous book written by @PERSON1 during incarceration, ' @CAPS3 @CAPS4.' Even in these extreme cases, most adults can still read it.  Now that I've presented my argument and you're aware of my view that the ability to handle a book varies from person to person, I wonder if you share the same opinion. My main reason for this conclusion is that if someone thinks a book is too offensive, they should simply avoid it. We live in @LOCATION1, the land of the free, and I believe we can tolerate a little controversy over a book or magazine. I sincerely hope that in the future, our nation can overcome these minor setbacks caused by over - reactions to offensive materials. I am confident that one day, no book will be banned from the shelves, allowing our children to gain the knowledge contained within those fragile pages.
253	3230	2	2	I firmly believe that books, movies, and other forms of media should not be subject to censorship. People have the right to know and see what they wish. They can learn from books, and by studying history through these books, we can prevent events like @CAPS1 war @NUM1 from happening again.  Libraries are places of freedom, where people can read, do as they please, and look up information. In newspapers and magazines, people like to know what is happening in @CAPS1 or to others, whether the news is good or bad. This knowledge helps them avoid similar situations. Some people may think that others should not read or watch certain things, but who are they to dictate what others can do? Everyone should be able to make their own decisions.  In conclusion, censorship of media is unjust. We should preserve the freedom to access information, and libraries should remain as havens of free knowledge, enabling people to learn and grow.
254	3231	2	2	There are several books that I would not want my child to pick up and read. When I learned what I was going to write about, one book immediately came to mind: '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.'  The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' is about a young girl who grew up without a father. Her mother never wanted to talk about him because she knew it would only make the situation worse. The young girl had a dream of being daddy's little girl, and she often wondered if this was too much to ask for.  After a few years, she finally gathered the courage to search for her father. She went on this journey alone, leaving her mother behind. Her mother had always instilled in her mind that her father was up to no good and that she would be better off without him. However, she embarked on this hunt, relying on her faith in the Lord.  After praying to the Lord, she felt that she needed to know what this search would entail. So, she went to her @CAPS9, hoping to find the answers she needed to ease her heartache and pain. She hoped that she could find her father somewhere in the world.  Just before sunset, she noticed an elderly southern woman sitting on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She approached her @CAPS9, kissed her on the forehead with tears in her eyes. Her @CAPS9 asked why she was crying. With a lump in her throat, she asked if @CAPS9 knew where she could find her father. @CAPS9 replied yes, saying that @CAPS2 was lying in his bed. At that moment, her face lit up.  She entered the old cottage and found her father lying on the bed, writing. She was nervous, but with the support of her @CAPS9, she sat down and talked with her father. Her father told her that he had written her a letter every day, which amounts to @NUM1 letters a year. She told him that she had never received a single letter from him. It then dawned on her that this might be why her mother never let her check the mail.  After @NUM2 years, she finally found her father. The truth was that her father had been kept out of his daughter's life because the mother did not want him to be a part of it. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even going against legal orders. Her father explained that her mother needed her to take care of her because she was involved with heavy drugs at the time. Back then, there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter away from her mother.  The reason I chose this book is that when I was young, my father did the same to me. He left me, and I never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either parent is excruciating. You shed many tears and try to mend the holes in your heart, but sometimes the pain still seeps through. After reading the book, I wondered why the girl was called 'she.' It was because she took the blame for her father leaving.  Many children are growing up without one or both parents. There is a higher percentage of single - parent families today than before. Just like in the book, most kids often blame themselves for a parent's absence. If I could remove this book from the shelves, I would, because no child should be reminded of the pain they've endured. Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child? All these children want is to feel loved and know that someone cares about them. If such books are to be available, there should be a form for parents to fill out to give permission. If the child is an adult, it's fine, as they should be able to handle it rather than going through these feelings alone.
255	3232	2	2	The question of whether certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive is a complex one. In my view, if a book is not suitable for a particular age group, one should refrain from getting it. Some libraries have books that are highly inappropriate for children. To address this, libraries usually have separate sections for adults and children to check out books. Additionally, some libraries may need book monitors to guide patrons and ensure that certain types of books are properly managed.  The library is a place with a wide variety of books. Therefore, people should go to the appropriate section and check out books that are suitable for them. When I first visited the library, I was unsure which book to choose. The librarian showed me the section corresponding to my age group. After that, I was able to check out books that were appropriate for my age. I was more interested in reading whole books than magazines.  In conclusion, whenever you need to check out a book, make sure it is appropriate for you. By doing so, you can feed your mind with valuable knowledge.
256	3233	2	2	Censorship in libraries is a complex issue that raises concerns about freedom of access and expression. Libraries offer a wide range of books, from children's literature to challenging adult works, providing readers with diverse options. Censorship involves restricting the availability of certain materials, which can have far - reaching implications. When a book is censored due to its content, it calls into question other related books and media. I firmly believe that censoring books, magazines, movies, etc. in libraries limits people's exposure to different ideas. Many authors and artists create their works to express themselves or earn a living. If a book is removed from one library, it often leads to its removal from other libraries and a decrease in its marketability. Some people simply want to share their thoughts and messages with the world, and censorship disrupts the flow of knowledge. Another challenge with censorship is determining where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored. When a book is removed, people start to wonder about the criteria and which other books might also be considered offensive. Since censorship is often based on personal opinion, there is no clear - cut boundary for what can be available in libraries. Censorship also strips people of their freedom of the press. If a publishing company accepts a piece of media only to have it censored later, it either implies a need for new publishers or that the current ones are not fully committed to sharing diverse content. The boundary for censorship is highly subjective and should not be dictated by a single group. When one book is removed, it only raises questions about others. In conclusion, the practice of censorship in libraries should be carefully re - evaluated to ensure that the freedom of access to information and the rights of creators are respected.
257	3234	2	2	A library is a haven for those seeking solitude and peace for research or reading. There is no valid reason, other than personal opinion, to remove certain materials from libraries. We, the people, have the right to access the thoughts and ideas expressed by others in their written works. Certain materials may be offensive to some individuals, but for those who need them for research or pleasure reading, removing them would be unfair. If materials are removed based on someone's personal or religious opinions, those who could benefit from the information will be deprived of it. Has anyone considered the efforts of the authors when asking for offensive materials to be removed? Authors put in an enormous amount of work to share their information with the world. Imagine how an author would feel if their best work was taken off the shelves because someone found it offensive. How would you feel if your best piece of writing was rejected from libraries for the same reason? There are materials that I've encountered that might be offensive to some, but they are part of the media that reflects our society. Some people may have religious restrictions on what they can read, watch, or listen to, but for others, these materials are an important part of their lives. We cannot simply remove materials from library shelves. These materials are the lifeblood of our society. Cutting off access to them will have negative consequences. Remember, the media we produce represents who we are, what we do, and what we live for. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and the rights of all readers and creators, and avoid hasty removal of library materials.
258	3235	2	2	In our daily lives, we encounter many things that can be offensive. While we want to protect children from inappropriate content, we should also trust that when they are old enough, they can handle reading books and listening to music that might be offensive. I believe we shouldn't eliminate all offensive material from libraries. Today, a great deal of hard work goes into creating music, movies, and books. If we start removing all offensive material, we'll offend the people who dedicated a lot of time and effort to these works. The creators spent countless hours collaborating with others to get their work published or produced. It would be unjust to discard pieces of great literature just because they might be offensive to some. Almost every book today contains offensive language or gestures. For example, a certain well - detailed book with many great facts is considered offensive by some because it mentions that a particular person had a wife and children. It's just a story full of conspiracy theories and doesn't force readers to believe anything. Similarly, a movie titled something that might seem offensive at first glance is actually a great movie about a basketball team. Just because something has offensive language doesn't mean we can't be mature and understand that they are just stories. In our country, with its diverse ethnic groups, people have different opinions. We have the right to our own opinions and to like what we want. Some people enjoy reading offensive literature. Even if a book in the library contains offensive material, it might still be a good read for some. As Katherine Paterson said, if one person can remove a book, then everyone can, and eventually, there will be no books left. Removing offensive books won't stop people from reading them; it will just reduce library usage. In conclusion, we should not censor all offensive materials in libraries as it goes against the principles of freedom of choice and the rights of creators.
259	3236	2	2	"The world is filled with an abundance of knowledge and information in the form of books, music, magazines, and movies. If we were to line up all the books in the world, they would form a bridge of knowledge stretching around the moon twice and back. However, there are young minds that are not yet ready to absorb all this information. There is no such thing as ""bad information""; rather, there are people who are not prepared for the information they are about to receive. So, should these materials be censored? The answer is yes. First, children need to maintain a certain level of modesty and curiosity. They should have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners and intelligent individuals. If information is presented to them out of the proper chronological order of importance, it can distort their minds and make them develop in ways they are not ready for. Secondly, exposing children to information too early can cause physical harm. Children have an innate instinct to repeat what they observe, which is essential for survival. For instance, if a child watches movies with sexual themes and actions, they may be tempted to imitate what they see. This can lead to an increase in the number of teen mothers. Finally, premature exposure to information can also cause mental harm. Music, in particular, can be a greater source of mental damage than movies. Many people underestimate the impact of music because it is not visual, but children can form vivid images based on the lyrics. There should be stricter restrictions on music, such as raising the age for purchase, to block explicit content. In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials. However, I do not believe that all potentially harmful or offensive materials should be removed completely, as adults have the right to access them. Libraries and other institutions around the world need to improve their restrictions and even enact laws to protect young minds. We all need to work together to ensure that children are exposed to appropriate information, as they are the future of our world."
260	3237	2	2	I don't think certain materials should be removed from libraries. People should have the right to freedom of speech. If someone has an idea or thought, they should be able to express it. I always tell people to be sincere in their words. However, when it comes to younger kids, there is a need for caution. If magazines and movies with inappropriate content are easily accessible to them, then censorship is necessary. These materials should not be placed in areas where young children can reach them. It's important to balance the rights of adults to access a wide range of materials and the need to protect children from potentially harmful content. In conclusion, while we should uphold the principle of freedom of access, we also have a responsibility to safeguard the well - being of young minds.
261	3238	2	2	I firmly believe that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. Young children typically do not understand the meaning of offensive content. The library serves as an invaluable source for information and a place to discover enjoyable books. If we remove materials that some may find offensive, it will become challenging for people to access the facts they need. People often use offensive language or concepts, but not always with the intention to insult. Libraries do not aim to insult anyone; they simply provide factual information about various subjects. Some individuals lack the maturity to handle such content appropriately. If they cannot approach these matters maturely, perhaps the library is not the right place for them. I can understand concerns if the intention is to insult, but this is rarely the case. So, why should magazines, movies, books, and music be removed from libraries? It is unfair to others who are seeking information. For example, slavery is an offensive topic for people of color due to the derogatory terms associated with it. However, over the years, most people have become more mature in dealing with past issues. In conclusion, people should be able to handle offensive content without getting overly upset. They need to recognize that the inclusion of such content is usually not intentional.
262	3239	2	2	I firmly hold the view that books containing offensive content should be removed from libraries. It is inconsistent to tell your children one thing while they find the opposite in the library. For instance, if you educate your children about the dangers of smoking and its potential to cause harm and lead to a troubled life, you would not want them to claim it's okay to smoke just because characters in a book are doing so. This is clearly wrong. Libraries should not allow such books, music, movies, or magazines. During high school, our parents taught us to avoid smoking, using drugs, and engaging in similar harmful behaviors. Sometimes, it can be difficult for teenagers to fully grasp the severity of these warnings. Modern movies often portray drug - use as cool and the act of driving a stolen car as fun. This misrepresentation can mislead teenagers into thinking these actions are acceptable with no negative consequences. The media fails to effectively convey to teenagers that these behaviors are wrong. Libraries set a poor example by allowing offensive books on their shelves, assuming that people will not take offense. I once read a book that promoted racist attitudes, using derogatory language and making mean remarks. I found this extremely offensive because I would not tolerate such treatment myself. If readers believe the offensive content in books, it can lead to significant problems. Some may take offense, while others may think it's acceptable, creating conflicts between the two groups. There are differing opinions on whether offensive materials should be in libraries. In my opinion, it is wrong to have such books in libraries. We tell people that certain actions are wrong and offensive, yet these books may suggest otherwise. It is unacceptable that movies, music, books, or magazines with offensive content are allowed in libraries. In conclusion, libraries should take responsibility and remove offensive materials to prevent misleading readers, especially teenagers, and to avoid potential conflicts.
263	3240	2	2	In my opinion, I don't really care about the removal of offensive materials from libraries. It should be up to parents to decide if they want to have certain books, music, movies, or magazines removed from library shelves. After all, it's just a book, and it doesn't really matter that much. I'm not easily offended by this kind of argument. If there is content that kids shouldn't know about, it should be placed in the adult section, not where kids can easily access it. Libraries should not put such content in the kids' section. I also don't understand why movies should be removed. If they are trying to block kids from seeing certain movies, it's a foolish approach. There are movies suitable for children, and many parents won't let their kids watch inappropriate movies at their age, unless they give permission. The same goes for music. I haven't seen much bad - language music like rap in the library. In conclusion, these are my thoughts on this argument. The decision - making power should largely rest with parents, and proper categorization in libraries can help address the issue of inappropriate content for children.
264	3241	2	2	I think offensive books should be removed from library shelves. Young children who read these books may have difficulty distinguishing right from wrong. If the books contain violence, children may think that such behavior is acceptable. When children are exposed to inappropriate content at a young age, it can have a negative impact on their moral development. They are in a stage of learning and forming values, and offensive books can mislead them. In conclusion, to protect the healthy development of children and help them establish correct values, offensive books should be removed from library shelves.
265	3242	2	2	Censorship has become a significant controversy in modern society. With the emergence of numerous new media platforms, people have a plethora of opportunities to express their opinions. When individuals hold a particular view, they often want to share it with the world or defend it against opposing viewpoints. However, some people may take offense at what is being said or the way it is presented. As a result, the government or other authorities may remove or replace certain words, photos, lyrics, or film from a specific audience, such as children, or the entire public. This practice of censorship has sparked many debates about what is acceptable in society's media. I firmly believe that censorship is wrong. It violates people's fundamental right to freedom of speech. When a person has an opinion, they should have the right to express it in any way they choose. Authorities should not interfere with what someone writes, sings, or creates. Censorship undermines the integrity and purity of human thoughts. Who has the authority to determine what can and cannot be said? Should we simply allow the government to dictate our speech and label certain expressions as illegal? Should we stop expressing ourselves as we desire because it is considered inappropriate? The answer is no. As individuals, we must have the freedom to express ourselves in various forms of media, including stories, songs, and movies. If someone does not like what they see or hear, they can choose to ignore it or voice their opposition in a proper way, but they do not have the right to suppress others' freedom of expression. Censorship is not beneficial for any society. People have the right to say what they want. It is not a solution to discrimination or anger; instead, it can fuel these problems. If parents do not want their children to be exposed to certain content, they should educate their children about why it is wrong, allowing them to make their own decisions based on the provided information. An opinion is a fundamental right of every human being, and it belongs to the individual, not the authorities. In conclusion, we should oppose censorship to safeguard the right to freedom of speech and allow individuals to express their thoughts freely.
266	3243	2	2	Have you ever entered a library in search of a good book, only to pick up a vulgar and inappropriate one? Were you disappointed upon seeing what children could easily access, or did you simply put it back on the shelf, thinking it wasn't your kind of book? In this essay, I aim to discuss both perspectives on censored books and explain why I believe they should be censored.  People around the world vary greatly. In terms of color, race, size, shape, and personality, no two individuals on the planet are exactly alike. So, why would they all share the same interests in reading or music? Some people enjoy romantic novels that make their hearts skip a beat, while others prefer the thrill of horror stories. Everyone has their own opinion on what makes a great book. The same question arises regarding whether censored items should be allowed in public libraries.  Many people say yes, arguing that individuals have the right to choose what they observe or listen to. They claim, 'If you don't like the way an item is presented, don't pick it up.' Others say no, stating, 'The library is supposed to be a safe haven where children don't have to be exposed to inappropriate content.' In my personal view, I side with the latter, although I can also understand the opposing opinion.  Regarding the opposing view, I can understand why some people think censored items are acceptable in libraries. If an author writes a great story while maintaining their personal style, I believe the book is fine as long as it is out of reach of children. However, people have different ideas about what 'censored' means, and there could be a consequence of losing many books. But every choice, whether good or bad, has consequences.  In my personal experience, I once took my ten - year - old sister to the library to borrow a movie and some books. She is very studious and grasps things quickly. When she found a book that she thought would be interesting, it turned out to be full of curse words and profanity. Imagine what you would say to your child who has just learned curse words from a place you expected to be safe. To me, it's absurd to have to search every book, CD, movie, or magazine for profanity to ensure it's safe for my sister to read. Kids today have changed significantly in their attitudes, language, and responses, and I believe a major factor is the content they consume through various materials. If the books and music they encounter are offensive and rude, what else will they learn? Therefore, I believe that libraries should not have censored books, and parents should have the right to request their removal.  When I consider what I would want my kids to read and listen to, I wonder why people would risk their children being negatively influenced. Why tempt them to adopt offensive behavior when they could be so much more? Parents should do everything possible to help their children reach their full potential, and they have the right to protect them. In conclusion, books should be censored.
267	3244	2	2	Some books are not suitable for children. Libraries should create an adult section for uncensored books. These books should not be available for checkout by children under a certain age, say @NUM1, unless their parents or guardians give permission. While some adults may not be concerned about what their children read, libraries should take responsibility.  I recall in elementary school, borrowing many books from the library, and I don't think they were adult books. Some kids enjoy reading adult books, which can improve their reading skills. However, the content in these books is often inappropriate for them.  Creating an adult section would prevent children from accessing adult - oriented material. I firmly believe that every library around the world should implement this measure. By doing so, libraries can better safeguard children from inappropriate content while still providing a diverse range of reading materials for all ages.
268	3245	2	2	In my opinion, as long as a book is not offensive or contains inappropriate content, people should continue to read it. However, if a book is offensive, it should not be read at all because it is not right to engage with such material. Similarly, I believe that offensive music should be removed from the shelves. Parents and teachers would not want their children to learn bad words from books or music.  In conclusion, we should be selective about the books we read and the music we listen to, especially when it comes to protecting the younger generation from inappropriate content. By avoiding offensive materials, we can create a more positive and healthy reading and listening environment.
269	3246	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials, such as pornographic content, should not be accessible in public libraries or other places where young people can see them. It is widely agreed that children should not be exposed to such inappropriate material.  I once visited a movie rental shop and saw movies that my parents would not want me to watch. This kind of material should be stored out of sight and only available upon request.  I also have a religious perspective on this issue. I know that looking at porn is considered a sin, and those in charge of libraries and shops should respect my religious beliefs. As @PERSON1 in the @CAPS1 said, if eating meat causes his brother to stumble, he will refrain from doing so. We should have the same mindset in life. If something can cause harm to others, we should avoid it.  This is a daily issue, and I use pornographic material as an example because it is so prevalent. For instance, when I'm in the @ORGANIZATION1 checkout line, I find the people magazines offensive.  However, I do think that adults who are independent should have the freedom to access such content if they choose. But it is unacceptable to display offensive materials where people who do not wish to see them are forced to be exposed. In conclusion, it is essential to ensure that inappropriate materials are properly managed to protect the well - being of the public, especially the younger generation.
270	3247	2	2	Do you think offensive materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves? I believe that certain materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed just because they are considered offensive.  My reasoning is quite logical. Libraries are places for learning and should offer a wide range of materials. They are not meant to offend anyone, but they should also reflect the diversity of human thought. Everyone is equal, and not everyone has the same taste in reading. There should be offensive books because many kids prefer books that are original and not overly sanitized. Books are created for enjoyment, to evoke interest, laughter, and a sense of pleasure.  I spoke with some students at my school, and they said that on bad days, listening to music helps them feel better. It allows them to relax and get through the day more easily, avoiding depression and anger.  From my own experience, when I was feeling down, I found books, magazines, music, and movies to be helpful. I'm not a big reader, but I enjoy music because songs can relate to my experiences, making me feel less alone. It also helps me learn to cope with difficult situations and relaxes me, just as some of my friends feel when they read a book.  There is offensive music and books out there, but it doesn't drive us crazy. Instead, it can be a source of relief from daily stress and can teach us how others deal with their problems. I'm a big music fan, and I've come across many offensive songs, but they haven't bothered me much.  In conclusion, music and books should not be removed just because they are offensive. They are amazing resources that can help us learn, relax, and find our own space. If you haven't given them a chance, I encourage you to do so.
271	3248	2	2	I firmly believe that books in libraries are not offensive. However, movies present a different situation. If a child is under 18, they should not rent a rated [@CAPS1] movie without parental approval. This is one reason our public library should not have rated [@CAPS1] movies. One afternoon at the public library, I was looking at the movie selection, trying to decide which one to choose. There was a little boy, about nine or ten years old, holding two action - type movies. They looked really good, but from the title picture, they seemed gory. I asked the boy if I could quickly check the movie, and he agreed. I grabbed it and saw it was a rated [@CAPS1] movie. I was surprised his parents would let him watch such movies; at his age, I never could have.  Another reason is that our public library should get rid of swimsuit magazines like [@CAPS5] and [@CAPS6]. One day, while looking at the magazine rack, I noticed these swimsuit magazines. We should consider whether children should see such magazines in the public library. If a little girl saw one, she might either want to look at it or pretend not to notice. At her age, she looks up to someone, and seeing a model in the magazine might make her want to look like her, which could lead to eating disorders.  In conclusion, I think our local library should remove rated [@CAPS1] movies and magazines like [@CAPS5] and [@CAPS6]. If you agree, contact your library and share these points. Let's put a stop to inappropriate content in our libraries in [@MONTH1].
272	3249	2	2	There exists a boundary known as censorship that restricts readers from accessing certain knowledge in books. This issue is contemplated in every school and public library. Consider this: what would you do if you saw your child reading a book with frightening or overly adult - like descriptions? This question troubles library and school authorities with each new shipment of books.  However, it is not right to remove books from the shelves for several reasons. Firstly, there is the freedom of press. Enacted in the [@CAPS1] of [@CAPS2], this law remains in effect. An individual can write a non - children's book without facing penalties. While children may read such books, the blame should not fall on the author. Otherwise, the author would lose royalties and the means to support themselves. It's understandable to be concerned when children learn something inappropriate, but blaming the writer is unjust.  Secondly, the freedom of thought is a significant argument. This law allows citizens to think as they wish about anything. Just like the freedom of press, individuals of any age can pick up an adult book. If they are not interested, they can put it down. But if they enjoy the unique language and content, they should be allowed to continue learning.  Children have a remarkable ability to absorb and recall information, often better than adults. Although not scientifically proven, this is evident when one is around children regularly. A child's mind is like a sponge, especially during their pre - teen years. Allowing them to read a wide range of books, rather than sitting in front of the TV all day, helps them learn more. Whether a book is a fantasy or not, it's the words and their usage that provide knowledge. An educated person may struggle with language, while someone who reads a lot can use words more easily. Wouldn't you want your child to speak intelligently at important events?  In conclusion, censoring public books is a waste. These books may contain valuable knowledge that not everyone can access. Removing them could prevent people from learning new words or grammar rules. If one parent can remove a book, others may follow, and soon there will be no books left. This would be a setback for society, as it goes against the progress of human intelligence. So, we should keep the books on the shelves.
273	3250	2	2	Some people find certain books in libraries offensive, but others want to read them. No one has the right to say that because a book offends them, libraries should remove it. Just because a book offends one person doesn't mean it will offend everyone.  In my opinion, libraries should not remove such books. People who don't like a book and find it offensive should simply choose not to read it and instead read what they like. They shouldn't demand that the book be removed. Everyone has different reading preferences.  In conclusion, libraries should offer a wide variety of books to meet the diverse interests of readers. Removing books based on individual offense would limit the choices available to others. So, libraries should keep all types of books on their shelves.
274	3251	2	2	If everyone in the world could permanently remove a book, movie, music, etc., from the shelves because they find it offensive, would there be anything left for us to enjoy? I personally believe that if people could do this, they would. But just because something is offensive to one person doesn't mean it's offensive to you. Does that person have the right to permanently remove an item so that no one else can access it? I think no one has the right to remove an item based solely on their own opinion.  If anyone could remove items they find offensive, there would be no uniqueness among people. Just because you think the music someone listens to is offensive doesn't mean they feel the same way. So, if a person enjoys listening to a particular type of music, it shouldn't be taken away from them.  I understand that some people may not want their children to hear offensive language in music or read it in books. But that doesn't mean the music or book should be removed from the shelves. Consider this: if a person uses offensive language in real life, would we remove them from the world?  In conclusion, just because you find something offensive and don't like it doesn't mean everyone in the world feels the same way. We should respect the diversity of opinions and allow people to have access to a wide range of cultural products. Before making a decision about removing something, think about whether what is offensive to you is also offensive to others.
275	3252	2	2	Library books come in a wide variety. There are children's books, adult books, and those suitable for in - between ages. Libraries aim to offer materials that spark readers' interest. Not all books are targeted at a specific age group or gender. This means libraries should not be criticized or have their contents restricted based on the nature of novels, magazines, music, or movies. A library is for anyone who enjoys reading a diverse range of materials, not just a select few who approve of every item.  In our town's library, different types of reading materials, music, and movies are separated. There is a children's section with classic books, taking up half of the building. There is also an adult section for more complex novels that teens and younger children may not be interested in or that parents may not want them to read. Additionally, there are books for in - between ages, like teen books that appeal to readers like me.  We can't control what authors write. Some of the greatest books have deep meanings that not all audiences prefer. The beauty lies in people's freedom to find a book, magazine, or [@CAPS1] they like. If the freedom to choose what to read is taken away, readers will lose interest. Schools want students to read to improve test scores. If you remove the books they like, they may stop reading, which could lead to lower test scores.  In my experience, I've read books with more grown - up topics than my mother would like. But people will read what they want. They don't like being told no. Removing popular topics, even if they contain certain words or content, is unfair to readers.  In conclusion, I believe that censoring books, music, movies, magazines, etc., is a bad idea. It would mean the end of libraries as we know them, as they would lose the variety that makes them valuable to readers.
276	3253	2	2	When faced with the question of whether offensive items should be removed from library shelves, different people hold different views. Some may immediately say yes, while others may not care and move on. I firmly disagree with those who advocate for removal. Instead, I believe such items should remain on the shelves.  As a child, I always frequented the children's section of the library and avoided the adult area. If my mother found an offensive item, she would ensure I didn't see it. I think if parents monitor what their children are exposed to, they need not worry about their kids encountering offensive content.  However, suppose an adult believes an item should be removed. While they have the right to do so, what if that item is exactly what someone else is looking for? The world is filled with offensive things that we encounter daily, such as newspapers, certain programs, and billboards. If someone were to remove all of them, we would be left with only one person's interests.  This is why libraries contain a diverse range of materials. If someone dislikes an offensive book or other item and feels the need to remove it, that's their choice, but they aren't considering others' preferences. As the saying goes, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I wholeheartedly agree with this.  If everyone had the same taste, then anyone entering the library could remove offensive items. But if this happens, authors may stop writing, and singers may not want their works in libraries if they know their creations are constantly being removed. Moreover, people may stop visiting libraries if they know they won't find what they want.  I disagree with those who want to remove items because a particular book might be perfect for someone. I believe that books, magazines, or other materials should stay on the shelves for those who intend to read them. If a person finds a book offensive, they should realize that it may not be offensive to others and simply walk away. I'm sure some people would find my choice of books offensive and want to remove them, but I would stop going to the library if that happened. That's why I think books should stay where they are.
277	3254	2	2	Censorship, the act of removing material considered inappropriate or offensive, has been employed for centuries as a means to control people's thoughts and feelings. The British used it in the American colonies during the American Revolution to maintain colonists' loyalty to the crown. The Nazis used censorship not only during World War II as a form of propaganda but also during the post - war period under Hitler's guidance.  In the United States today, censorship persists as a way to 'protect the children.' The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) dictates what the American public can and cannot watch on television and listen to on the radio. Other organizations regulate what books we can read, what video games we can play, and what items we can buy. In my opinion, such organizations are pushing the United States and other freedom - loving nations towards totalitarianism.  As Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' If one person can control what we buy, listen to, and see, then why don't we have the same right over them? Where do we draw the line? Eventually, all forms of media, including books, movies, magazines, music, and video games, would be deemed offensive and inappropriate. Culture would gradually decline, and our lives would become dull and meaningless.  I recently read a book titled 'The River Between,' by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, which depicts two periods in a boy's life: his childhood in tribal Kenya and his life after his mother's death in the colonial capital of Nairobi. Ngũgĩ's work contains some less - than - innocent passages. Had strict censorship been in place, the book might not have been published. His work gave me and many others an understanding of the challenges that Africans face in the changing landscape of their continent, and it made me appreciate my own life filled with family, friends, and comfort.  In conclusion, censorship is a terrible phenomenon that gradually invades and consumes every aspect of our lives. If one person can censor what they find offensive, then why can't others do the same? Some degree of censorship is inevitable, but we must ask ourselves where to draw the line. Censorship blatantly disregards the First Amendment, as freedom of speech is guaranteed to all American citizens. As a famous colonial revolutionary once said, 'Give me liberty, or give me death!' If censorship continues to expand and libraries become emptier, then I would rather choose death over a life without true liberty.
278	3255	2	2	If you come across offensive books, music, movies, magazines, or other materials, don't even bother looking at them. Even if you initially find something interesting but later realize it's offensive, just move on. No materials in these categories should be removed from the collection because they are the creations of authors, directors, and music writers. Everyone has different views, so why should we be so bothered by something that isn't intentionally offensive to us?  Each person has their own opinion about different materials. What might be offensive to one person may not affect another's views at all. Even if something is written down, it may not be directed at the person reading it. If someone takes it the wrong way, they should just walk away and not let it get to them. Don't let others change your opinion.  Library censorship is not designed for just one person; it's for everyone. If you don't like a book in the library or think it's inappropriate, simply put it down and walk away. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean others won't find it interesting. If you find any material offensive, you could try to come up with an argument to prove the author wrong. You need to be strong and ready to face different things.  I visit the library from time to time. Usually, I'm just browsing for something to read. When I find something interesting, I pick it up. But if I start reading and feel that the material is offensive or directed at me, I just leave it alone and put it back. I don't take it personally because I know it's not about me. I don't view such materials negatively because I know it's someone else's opinion.  If someone takes something the wrong way, they should consider other aspects of the topic and form their own opinion. Your own opinion matters more than anyone else's. Small things shouldn't upset you, especially if they don't really matter. Your feelings about a topic shouldn't affect how others see it. In the end, we should respect different opinions and keep a diverse range of materials in libraries.
279	3256	2	2	I firmly believe that censorship in libraries should not be allowed. If there is to be any form of censorship, it should be determined by parents when it comes to their children. For adults, there is no need for such restrictions. By censoring materials like books and movies, we are presenting people with a false view of the real world. Just because something isn't censored doesn't mean it should be misinterpreted.  Think about it this way: when you walk down the street, you're exposed to all sorts of things. People may use bad language, display bad habits, and you might even witness death. As a child who has never been overly censored, including in my reading materials, I've learned a great deal. If I went to a library and found that books were censored or removed from the shelves, I would be presented with a fake world. Since life can't be censored, we shouldn't censor other things either.  A censored book, movie, or other item can also limit how much someone can learn from it. People go to libraries to access hard facts supported by proof and evidence, depending on the subject they're researching.  In conclusion, these are some of the many reasons why I think library censorship should not be permitted. Censorship should be a personal choice, not imposed by others. In the end, we won't know what's truly better until we experience things without excessive censorship.
280	3257	2	2	No, we shouldn't censor books because the writer is trying to depict how the story actually happened. If your child asks about a certain word, you can tell them it's not a good word to use. Alternatively, you can return the book and get a new one for them.  Suppose your child comes home from school and uses a curse word. When you ask where they learned it, and they say the teacher said it. You can then tell the teacher that you don't want your child reading that book.  Using certain language can be a way to better convey the story, I suppose. In the end, while we should be cautious about what our children are exposed to, we also need to understand the author's intention and give them the freedom to tell the story as they see fit.
281	3258	2	2	The Library @CAPS1 presents a question: Is it good or bad? I rarely visit the library as I'm an individual who enjoys sports, video games, and socializing with friends. When not at school, I avoid anything associated with it, including libraries. On the rare occasions when I do go, such as for a summer reading book for school, I usually browse the shelves. Some of the items I see in the library catch my attention, not because they seem like @CAPS2 books, but because it's astonishing to see what is allowed on the shelves. I've noticed romance novels on the shelves. They're not as bad as I initially thought. Their titles often pique my interest as they're rather unusual. I believe these books are suitable for young adults, but younger children and pre - teens should not read them. As long as there is a clear separation between the children's and adult sections, it's acceptable to have romance novels and other graphic novels on the shelves since they are forms of literature. Magazines can be viewed from different perspectives. Gossip magazines can be entertaining but also highly offensive. The issue with magazines is that much of the content is based on people's opinions, and they may speak negatively about certain individuals or things. I think it's up to the library to make a decision. If someone complains, the library should be considerate and remove the magazine from the shelf. There are also magazines featuring models in swimsuits and clothes. If the models are nude, these magazines should either be kept in a back - room for special requests or not be in the library at all. I once saw a parent enter a library with their son, and the son asked why a magazine had a half - naked woman on it. I felt it was irresponsible of the library to leave such magazines out for children to see. Controlling access to music and movies is relatively straightforward. Nowadays, music cases often have parental advisory stickers. So, I believe the library can have all types of music on the shelves as the warnings are in place. Movies also have ratings. If a librarian allows a @NUM1 - year - old child to check out a rated @CAPS4 movie, she should be dismissed as there is no valid reason for such an action. There can be no excuses as one can usually determine the appropriateness of a movie by looking at the rating and the viewer. @CAPS5 movies should not be in libraries at all. Libraries are meant to be places where people can access pleasant reading materials or listen to good music. Having pornography in a library is unethical, similar to having strippers in school. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a good thing. If libraries organize their collections well and ensure children stay out of inappropriate areas, everything should function smoothly.
282	3259	2	2	I see no valid reason to remove books from library shelves. If an individual dislikes a book, they simply don't have to read it. Books are intended to entertain or inform people. There are books that depict black people in a negative way, but they should remain available so that people can be aware of such perspectives. Libraries are primarily profit - oriented. We should allow them to make money by selling or renting out whatever they choose, as it is an honest means of generating income. If I owned a library, I would offer a wide range of items for sale or rent. People are generally open to watching, listening to, and reading various things. Therefore, it makes sense to provide these materials. In conclusion, there is no need to restrict the availability of books in libraries. Libraries should be free to offer diverse materials, and consumers have the freedom to choose what they engage with.
283	3260	2	2	The song '@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 I like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste and a round thing in your face you get sprung' has a rather provocative tone towards both women and men. In contrast, '@CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' suggests that love can be found anywhere. Upon closer examination of these two lyrics, a connection becomes evident. The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 describes a man finding love in large buttocks, while the other lyric implies that love is ubiquitous. Advocating for the banning of music, magazines, books, and other media is equivalent to saying that it's acceptable to disrespect an @CAPS6 flag. This is clearly not the case. Banning these forms of media is akin to censoring people's imagination and creativity. It's similar to the situation in the book @DATE1, where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is restricted, and our thoughts and knowledge are limited to what we're permitted to read. Removing movies and books prevents people from learning from the past. Take the movie @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 as an example. Although it is gory and morbid, it reveals the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1. It reminds us that the past should never be forgotten as we can learn valuable lessons from it. If this movie had been censored or removed, I personally would never have learned about the hardships of the @CAPS13 and its impact on people's souls and emotions. Books, magazines, movies, and other forms of media are gateways to new worlds. They allow children to exercise their imagination and develop their personalities. I firmly believe that books and songs have the power to save lives. The other day, a friend of mine was on the verge of suicide. He was about to pull the trigger when I told him he was wrong. I was @NUM2 at the time, and I quickly searched through my iPod to find the song '@CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16' by the @CAPS17. After reading him the lyrics, he abandoned the idea of suicide. While there are songs and books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that have incited people to do extreme things, including violence, the overall positive impact of reading and writing far outweighs these negative examples. These forms of media are essential for self - expression. A song can inspire as much as it can cause harm. Allowing the imagination to flourish is better than suppressing it. If a book is removed, it may create a greater desire for it, as the forbidden often becomes more appealing. In conclusion, media censorship should be limited. We should embrace the diverse range of materials available as they offer opportunities for learning, self - discovery, and personal growth.
284	3261	2	2	In today's @LOCATION1, the world is far from free. The content we see, hear, and read is often subject to censorship. Whether this is beneficial or not is a complex question, but for the most part, it is a good thing. Adults, teenagers, and children should have restricted access to certain types of movies, music, books, magazines, and radio stations. I do not advocate for the complete removal of these materials but rather for limited access. Some materials are difficult to keep away from children and teenagers, and it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to decide whether their children can engage with content that some may find offensive. Censorship should be implemented to a certain extent. For example, at a movie theater, a person must be @NUM1 years of age or older to watch an @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 or unrated movie. This is the law, and I believe it is a sensible regulation. Parents should definitely be the ones to censor what their children watch, see, hear, or read. Children are generally unaware of what is appropriate and are naturally curious. If a parent leaves something unfamiliar around the house, a child will likely be intrigued and may explore it. For instance, if it's a magazine, the child might look through it. There is an appropriate age for accessing certain materials as there are many adult - only items in the world. These materials need to remain accessible to the public. Otherwise, those who do not find these materials offensive will face financial hardships. People are willing to fight for their beliefs, and this often involves legal battles, which are costly. They may hire lawyers to defend their right to access the content they desire as adults. Lawyers require payment, and without it, they will not represent their clients. Many people around the world have a clear understanding of what is good and bad, which is largely influenced by their upbringing. If someone believes a particular material is offensive, they can choose not to engage with it. These activities are only suitable for those who have no issue with the content. Therefore, censorship should be applied, but only to a certain degree. If every piece of content that even one person finds offensive were removed, what about those who do not find it offensive? What about adults who see no harm in consuming such materials? People have different opinions, and not everyone shares the same views. In conclusion, not all content should be censored. Parents should be in charge of what their children are exposed to. People will fight for their right to access the content they want as they know what they desire and will take whatever measures necessary to obtain it. This is @LOCATION2, and we should not be overly strict.
285	3262	2	2	How many of us have heard offensive language or seen something inappropriate for kids? I'd wager that the answer is most of us. Almost everyone in the world has either heard, said, or witnessed something they shouldn't have. Many children hear curse words before they can even walk. If we can't prevent kids from being exposed to offensive content in their daily lives, then why try to edit what they read in libraries? After all, libraries are public spaces where people can read in peace. Almost everyone has made mistakes in their lives, but these experiences help us grow and mature. Children are constantly learning new words, and it's inevitable that they'll come across inappropriate ones. They will use these words to see what happens and learn from the consequences. If we remove such content from the books they read, how will they learn about the real world? The books children read vary according to their age. Younger kids are usually unaware of bad words until they get older. Older kids' books may contain such words to depict a serious part of the story or a tragic moment in a character's life. Some books even show the consequences of a character using a bad word. Authors typically use a diverse vocabulary in their stories. If they're writing about the @DATE1's, they wouldn't try to sanitize the language of that era, as it would distort the reader's perception of the time. We should leave library books on the shelves regardless of their content. No matter how hard parents try, kids will always encounter offensive content. Books use language to convey important aspects of stories and our history. Therefore, these books should remain in libraries. In conclusion, libraries should not censor books. Allowing children to encounter a wide range of language in books helps them learn, grow, and understand the world around them.
286	3263	2	2	In my view, the censorship of books is unwarranted. Books should be read as the author originally intended. However, I do understand the censorship of songs and movies to make them suitable for radio and theater play. The currently controversial books carry profound messages and should remain on the shelves for everyone to read. The language used in these books reflects how people spoke in the past. These are classic works that should neither be altered nor removed. Take the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee. It contains a fair amount of strong language, but this was the norm at that time, and the author is conveying a powerful message. The book should stay as it is. It is reasonable to modify songs by removing offensive language so that they can be broadcast on the radio. When artists compose a song, they are aware that explicit or graphic language will prevent it from being played on the radio. I believe they don't mind making minor word - changes to reach a wider audience. For example, in the song 'F**k You' by CeeLo Green, the offensive word was replaced with 'Forget'. The artist knew the original version couldn't be played on the radio, and the modified song still retains its quality. Movies are similar to songs. A movie that is too graphic cannot be shown in theaters. Certain scenes may be removed or a few words changed, but this doesn't fundamentally alter the movie. These scenes or words can be restored when the movie is sold in stores. I respect everyone's opinion on this matter, but I am simply expressing my own. If authors or artists wanted their works to be different, they would have created them accordingly.
287	3264	2	2	When I was in seventh grade, I was determined to read every book by [Author's Name] I could get my hands on. Unfortunately, some of the content in her books was considered too racy for middle - schoolers. Some parents found it inappropriate, and the school librarian decided not to stock those books in the school library. I was heartbroken. My mother wouldn't buy me all the twenty - odd books she had written, and I didn't have enough money from my allowance and lemonade - stand earnings to purchase them myself. At that time, I couldn't understand why some parents thought the subject matter was too mature for our age group. However, my perspective has changed. Now, I understand why the school library might not want to carry books with racy elements. I believe that in school libraries, some books should be censored or marked as mature. But in public libraries, these books should remain uncensored. In school libraries, books need to be censored because some children may be too immature to handle the content. Most parents want their children to stay innocent for as long as possible, and I respect this. Having such advanced books in school libraries could also give the school a bad image, as not all parents would support it, and some would complain about their children accessing content they didn't want them to see for years. Censorship isn't just about sex. Violent graphic novels are also often censored. Real - time war stories that depict the horrors of war, while also showing the supposed valor of it, can be very graphic. These stories are important for our culture as they can prevent misconceptions about war from a young age. They should not be censored in libraries, as war should not be seen as just fun and exciting, and young people should know the truth before they reach the age of military service. One might question whether these books could incite violence. I'm not suggesting that books with unnecessary violence be stocked. Instead, school libraries should display books with violence that conveys an important message. Public libraries are different. They have separate sections for children's and adult literature. In school libraries, most of the collection is for children or teenagers, while in public libraries, it's the opposite (except in children's public libraries). In public libraries, it's okay to have any type of book in the adult section, marked as mature. The main purpose of public libraries is to educate citizens, and as long as people are reading and using the government - funded resources, the subject matter shouldn't be restricted. If a library is privately owned, the owner can decide which books to stock and censor. The purpose of libraries is to educate citizens and help them make informed decisions. If books are overly censored, important messages may be lost, and misinformation could spread. We should prevent this from happening.
288	3265	2	2	A wise person in [Person's Name]'s life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation is to remove the temptation altogether.' [Person's Name], while growing up, was surrounded by poor influences. He attended a dilapidated school, lived in a crime - ridden neighborhood, had a drunk for a father, no mother to support him, and an older brother who physically and emotionally abused him. Despite the moral temptations around him, he stayed away from alcohol, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence, and even seemingly 'minor' vices like pornography. As I grew up, my situation was different. I had a hard - working [Person's Name] as a role model and my mother to assist me with schoolwork and college preparation. Just before I was born, my parents moved from the old crime - infested neighborhood to the suburbs, where crime is less common and mostly consists of misdemeanors. [Person's Name] once told me, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed. When I was a kid, foul language in songs was unheard of, but now songs are full of sex, drugs, violence, and even rape themes. I'm worried about what your kids will be exposed to.' He had a valid point. Nowadays, young people can access books on illegal drugs, movies with sex scenes, and music advocating violence against law enforcement officers in public libraries. It's shocking that an eight - year - old can walk into a public library and browse or check out a book on cocaine. Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that instead of just hoping, we should remove such inappropriate books from library shelves. Public libraries are supposed to be safe havens for children and adults. But what if a parent feels threatened by the presence of inappropriate materials in the library? Public libraries and other public resources should be monitored and controlled. Parents should not have to worry about their children accessing inappropriate books; they should be assured that the library is a safe place. In conclusion, the current state of public libraries regarding the availability of inappropriate materials is concerning. We need to take action to protect the well - being of our children and ensure that public libraries live up to their reputation as safe and educational places.
289	3266	2	2	I firmly believe that everyone has the right to decide which books their own children should avoid, but not to ban those books from the public. Each person has their own beliefs about what to read, write, or watch, and the library, in its current form, is ideal. We cannot remove books that we find offensive based on our personal beliefs because someone else might be interested in reading about a particular religion or topic. If we were to remove all the books we disliked and create a library with only the books we wanted, it would be extremely costly. We would have to build separate libraries for each individual instead of having one that allows everyone to enjoy their favorite books in the same place. Therefore, if we have an issue with a book or movie from the library, we should keep our children away from it and explain to them why it is not suitable. By doing so, we can respect the diversity of interests and beliefs while also protecting our children's well - being. In conclusion, maintaining the current state of libraries with a wide range of materials, while taking personal responsibility for our children's reading choices, is the best approach.
290	3267	2	2	Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote highlights the complexity of book censorship. There are indeed books that many people consider graphic or shocking. However, removing these books from library shelves is not a viable solution. Doing so would violate the author's freedom of the press, as enshrined in the First Amendment, which gives all American citizens the right to express themselves freely through writing without government or public interference. Moreover, if we start censoring books in libraries due to a few controversial elements, we are infringing on their natural rights. Another issue is determining who should be in charge of censorship. Everyone has different opinions on what is right and wrong. One person may find something inappropriate, while another may think it is normal. This diversity of thought is what makes our country great. If the government were to assign someone to censor books, magazines, or music, it would likely cause an uproar. If we allow one person to judge what should be censored, the scope of censorship could expand beyond books, movies, and music to include clothes and lifestyles. This would lead to a world where self - expression is stifled, and people would be afraid of being labeled 'inappropriate'. We must recognize that there will always be people who disagree with certain things. But we need to learn to accept the extraordinary and understand different perspectives. By respecting the rights of authors and the diversity of readers, we can create a more inclusive and free - thinking society. In conclusion, while the desire to protect children from inappropriate content is understandable, widespread censorship of library books is not the answer. We should find a balance that respects both the rights of authors and the concerns of parents.
291	3268	2	2	In libraries, there exists a wide array of materials, including books, magazines, music, and movies. These materials, while enjoyed by different individuals, may sometimes contain content that offends certain people. However, this does not warrant their removal from the library.  People have diverse preferences regarding the media they consume. For instance, some individuals prefer rap music, while others lean towards rock. My personal preference is rock and metal because I find rap to be somewhat offensive. Even my family members have expressed concerns about the language in the music I listen to.  When it comes to reading materials, consider the scenario of being in a doctor's office. If you pick up a magazine and come across something offensive, you can either continue flipping the pages or put the magazine down. It's important to recognize that what you find offensive may be of interest to others. Sometimes, checking the magazine's cover can help you decide whether to read it.  Movies also offer a variety of genres, such as action, comedy, romance, and drama. Some people may avoid action movies due to the violence, while others may dislike comedy because of the rude humor. Before watching a movie, it can be beneficial to research its content.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries should not be a significant concern. The diverse range of books, magazines, music, and movies caters to different tastes. Instead of removing offensive materials, individuals should exercise the choice not to engage with them.
292	3269	2	2	The issue of whether books, magazines, music, movies, and other media should be removed from library shelves if they are deemed offensive is a complex one. On one hand, some people believe that certain content, such as that which is offensive to religion, contains offensive language, or includes adult materials, should be censored. On the other hand, there is the principle of freedom of speech and religion, which allows individuals to make their own choices.  In my opinion, people should have the right to censor what the library provides for their students or children to a certain extent. However, this censorship should not be taken to an extreme. If a book or other item is offensive to someone, they should be able to request that it be removed, but only after providing a valid reason and specifying the group of people they believe it is offensive towards.  Our generation faces different challenges compared to the past, with many of the issues we encounter being potentially offensive to certain religions or types of people. This has an impact on the overall concept of censorship. When a person feels that an item in the library is offensive, they should sign a statement explaining their concerns. Only then should the item be removed from circulation for that specific group.  Overall, I believe that library censorship is a good idea, considering the amount of inappropriate content in the world. People have the right to make changes when they believe something is wrong. By allowing a reasonable level of censorship, we can create a more suitable environment for everyone. So, yes, I firmly believe that censorship in libraries is a positive step forward.
293	3270	2	2	I firmly believe that censorship should not be a major concern in libraries. The reason is that books, magazines, music, and movies are enjoyed by a wide range of people with different tastes.  People have diverse preferences when it comes to the media they consume. For example, some like rap music, while others prefer rock. I personally like rock and metal because I find rap a bit offensive. My family members have also told me that I shouldn't listen to such music because of the language.  When it comes to reading, imagine you're in a doctor's office and you pick up a magazine. If you find something offensive, you can either keep flipping the pages or put it down. You need to understand that what you find offensive might be interesting to someone else. Sometimes, looking at the magazine's cover can help you decide whether to read it.  Movies are also a matter of personal preference. Some people like action movies, while others don't because of the violence. Some may not like comedy due to the rude humor. Before watching a movie, it's a good idea to learn about its content.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is unnecessary. The variety of materials available caters to different people. Instead of removing offensive items, individuals should have the freedom to choose what they want to engage with.
294	3271	2	2	The question of whether books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are considered offensive is a matter of much debate. On one hand, there are certain types of content that clearly need to be censored. For example, music that talks about drugs, violence, or inappropriate sexual content, movies with excessive blood, nudity, or other offensive elements, and some magazines that may contain inappropriate material.  However, it's not always clear how something can be considered offensive. For instance, some books are about history or personal experiences. Take a book about slavery. A colored child might read it and get offended, but it could be that the child misinterpreted the book. I've had similar experiences where I either got angry or threw a book away because I took it offensively.  I'm very sensitive to certain books, movies, and music. For example, when I read the books and watched the movies of a particular series, I was offended because the movie didn't match the book. In books, I can get emotional when a character does something I don't like or when a character dies, reminding me of someone close.  Music is another area where I have strong opinions. I used to love rap, but now it has become mostly about killing, drugs, and sex, which I find horrible. There are other great music genres like [list of other genres].  Some people are also over - censoring TV shows. For example, [mention the TV show], which is actually a fine show, is being censored by some adults who think it's bad. I've watched it since I was five, and there's nothing wrong with it.  In conclusion, while there is a need for some level of censorship, people should be more careful and understanding. They should take the time to understand the content before deciding to censor it. We should also respect the different types of media that are out there and not be too quick to label something as offensive.
295	3272	2	2	Libraries are filled with a vast collection of books, CDs, movies, and magazines, catering to people with various interests. These materials are often divided into sections for different age groups, such as kids, teens, and adults.  It's inevitable that some of these items may contain content that is offensive to certain individuals. However, this doesn't mean that these offensive materials should be removed from the library. Instead, people have the simple option of not picking them up.  For example, if someone finds a particular book or magazine offensive, they can just avoid it. Everyone has different tastes, and what one person finds offensive may be interesting to another.  In conclusion, when it comes to library products, people should be responsible for their own choices. They can easily avoid offensive materials without the need for strict censorship. This way, the library can continue to offer a diverse range of materials to meet the different needs and interests of its patrons.
296	3273	2	2	I am firmly of the opinion that books, movies, music, and other forms of media should remain uncensored. Sheltering the youth is an unwise approach as it piques their curiosity. They may then seek answers independently without informing adults. Most media and books are left uncensored for various valid reasons, and I believe this is a positive state of affairs.  It's true that some young people might take certain things too seriously, but this often stems from a lack of parental guidance. I'm not advocating showing a four - year - old an adult - rated movie, but we should be more lenient in some aspects. Music is ubiquitous, making it nearly impossible to shield children from it. Instead of trying to block it completely, parents should monitor what their children listen to. Since kids will encounter it sooner or later, it's better for them to hear it under their parents' supervision rather than from someone who might give them wrong advice.  Some parents complain about this issue because they don't want to be constantly available to explain things. However, if they can't take on this responsibility, they should question why they had children in the first place.  Books are similar. If a book contains content parents don't want their children to read, they can take it away. But most such books lack pictures, so children would have to imagine the content. If they don't understand what's being described, they won't form negative thoughts. I don't want to be a negligent parent, but I firmly believe that sheltering kids from the real world, media, and books is a bad and unwise idea.  Kids will inevitably learn about curse words, drinking, and drugs. It's the parents' duty to be present and teach them right from wrong when they have questions about what they've heard, watched, or read. People worry excessively about censoring and ensuring everything is clean, but media and books have never been completely pure. Some people are just too lazy to guide their children.  When I was young, my parents didn't restrict my reading. I turned out well, without engaging in drinking or drug use, because my parents were there to answer my questions. It's not the media or literature that's the problem; it's the parents. If they can't fulfill their explanatory role, they shouldn't have become parents.  Regarding magazines, if parents are really concerned, they can simply prevent their children from buying them.  Don't we want our kids to live independently as adults? Then we shouldn't over - shelter them. Let them discover things when they ask questions. If they read something they don't understand, parents can either explain right and wrong or let them learn the hard way. It's the parents' choice. If kids see something on TV, parents should explain instead of panicking and blocking them from the real world.  In conclusion, over - sheltering kids will prevent them from having a good life. Censoring everything isn't beneficial. Media and books are important sources for learning about real life. By not over - censoring, the next generation can learn from the mistakes of the previous one.
297	3274	2	2	In today's world, libraries are remarkable places where one can find almost anything they desire under one roof. These institutions house nearly every written book and offer them to the public free of charge. In addition to books, libraries also provide other resources such as movies, music, magazines, and internet access.  I do not advocate for the banning of any offensive materials because what is offensive is subjective. In today's society, there are always individuals who claim to be offended, sometimes just to make a point or gain attention, even if they don't truly care about the matter.  The internet in libraries can take users to a vast array of content. While libraries do block extremely offensive websites, people have found ways to bypass these restrictions.  Libraries are well - organized, with children's materials in one area, teenage materials in another, and adult materials in a separate room. As a child, I loved going to libraries, reading, and having fun. I never ventured into the adult section, and I believe many other children feel the same way. In fact, I've never seen a child in the adult section of a library.  Movies and music in libraries have ratings. If the rating is above what a child should access, the child needs a parent's signature to check them out. This system ensures that children cannot obtain inappropriate materials without parental consent.  Our libraries are structured effectively as they are. There is no need to make any changes. With movie and music ratings, age - based organization of materials, and the requirement of parental consent for certain items, libraries are already doing a good job. If we were to remove all offensive materials from libraries, there would be no libraries left in our communities.
298	3275	2	2	"Dear [Newspaper Name],  I have become acutely aware of the problem we face in today's media. The way information is accessed has evolved rapidly, and it has become extremely difficult to censor due to the vastness of technology and new information.  Two weeks ago, I took my [Age] - year - old niece [Niece's Name] to our local public library to find a book. As soon as the automatic doors opened, she rushed straight to the movie section. When I asked her what movie she was interested in, she turned the cover and said, ""[Movie Name]"". I thought to myself that I couldn't let my young niece watch that movie. This incident made me realize how easily children can access adult information.  I agree with [Person's Name] to some extent. I believe that if we completely remove certain information, we will become ignorant. However, when we expose our children, the future of the world, to adult information, they are significantly affected, as seen in the cases of [Teens and Violent Video Games] or explicit magazines. For example, my niece can check out any book in the library, including [Author's Name]'s famous book ""[Book Name]"", which means ""My Struggle"" in German. My [Age] - year - old niece reads well and is highly impressionable, like many young children.  Public media outlets, including public libraries, retail stores, the internet, and [Other Outlet], need to be more strictly monitored. I believe that books should be censored by content, similar to movies. This would make the distributor responsible and the consumer more aware of the content and its impact."
299	3276	2	2	I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement that “All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.” I believe it is the government's decision whether to remove certain items from libraries, and there must be legitimate reasons for taking books off the shelves.  Some people want to remove books that teach children about history, but they have no right to deprive children of this learning opportunity. Katherine Paterson's statement seems to support this wrong idea of taking away children's right to learn US history. If we do so, we have to wonder what our future generation will be like. Some kids might not even know who [Historical Figure] is or how we came to this continent.  Parents often don't want their children to read books with foul language or nudity. I understand their intention to protect their children, but in real life, children will encounter such things. If they aren't exposed to them at a young age, they won't know how to handle them when they grow up. Some kids who are deprived of this exposure may be at a loss when they face these situations later. Moreover, the foul language in books can add authenticity and voice to the stories. We don't want future generations to be oblivious to the real world.  When I was in fifth grade, I loved reading, especially adventure books like “The Boxcar Children”. One time, I went to the library and picked out a book about a haunted house. The librarian wouldn't let me check it out because there was some inappropriate text. This incident really dampened my enthusiasm for reading, and I no longer wanted to check out books on my own. Adults who want to remove these books from the shelves may be hindering our generation's learning. If we don't learn, the next generation won't be interested in reading or learning either.  These are just a few reasons why we shouldn't take books, magazines, movies, and music away from us. There are many others who also have valid reasons. If you want to take this right away from us, be prepared for an argument because we will fight for it. So, adults who want to remove a book from the shelf, you'd better have very good and legitimate reasons.
300	3277	2	2	Censorship is a complex and delicate concept. It has the power to ban music from stores, books from shelves, and movies from theaters. Author Katherine Paterson once said that if all reading and listening materials deemed offensive were removed, nothing would remain. I wholeheartedly agree with her statement. Just because someone finds an aspect of a work offensive does not justify banning or discarding it. I firmly believe that offensive material should not be removed for the following reasons: it suppresses the author's feelings, removing such material would leave shelves empty, and there is no clear - cut definition of what is offensive.  I understand that there are many people who oppose my view. Some audiences believe that removing offensive material is beneficial as it shields those who can't handle the language or context. Others think that sensitive audiences may not be comfortable with certain texts. Additionally, many people fear that exposing young children to violent, risky, or habit - related content will lead them to imitate such behavior. While these are valid concerns, they are not sufficient reasons to automatically remove material from the shelves.  Contrary to popular opinion, I believe one reason offensive material should stay on the shelves is that removing it suppresses the thoughts and feelings of the writer. For example, the book “To [Verb] a [Noun]” was banned for a long time. Harper [Author's Last Name]'s book may contain slurs that are offensive today, but that was the language used during that time. Who are we to judge the people of the [Time Periods] for their way of speaking? By banning “To [Verb] a [Noun]” for that period, generations were deprived of the book's powerful and beautiful message that the innocent should not be punished. The same applies to other books, which is why I believe they should remain on the shelves.  Secondly, works of literature and music should stay on the shelves. As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone removes a book, “...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.” This is very true. Many books have been on the banned book list, such as “To [Verb] a [Noun]”, “[Book Name] in the [Place]”, “[Author's Name]”, and others. If we keep removing books, what will be next? After literature, music may be targeted. Consider the singer/songwriter [Artist's Name]. His sexually - themed music in the [Time Period] had to be covered or placed in brown paper bags. This was a form of censorship, and his record company refused to produce his music under his name due to the scandalous lyrics. As a result, he changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol. This shows the slippery slope of censorship.  Finally, it's impossible to clearly define what is offensive. A novel or song may be enjoyed by many, but should it be removed from record stores or libraries because of one person's objection? I don't think so. Many words and concepts that were once unacceptable have become more socially accepted over time. If we give “offensive material” time, it may lose its offensive nature in the future.  In conclusion, I strongly oppose removing anything from the shelves just because someone finds it unacceptable or offensive. If we remove everything based on individual opinions, the world of arts will cease to exist. We will become a group of narrow - minded and ignorant individuals, knowing nothing about books, music, magazines, or movies. So, I pose this question: If everything is deemed offensive, what will be left?
301	3278	2	2	Everyone in the world is distinct and has their own unique perspectives. This brings up the issue of censorship, as what offends some may not bother others. The focus here is on library censorship, and there are three main reasons libraries should remain uncensored.  Firstly, books are written to be accessible to the public. A library is a public space where people can choose any book they desire. If a few individuals start censoring books, it will trigger a chain reaction. With numerous books being censored, there will be fewer options for people to enjoy. All books were intended to be appreciated, and if they are censored, some people will never have the chance to read them or learn from their contents.  Secondly, people have the right to make their own decisions. If someone dislikes a book, they can simply choose not to read it. They do not have the authority to censor it because they don't like it. Others may enjoy the same book. People should be able to select the books they want and not be dictated by others on what they can or cannot read. They should respect others' decision - making when it comes to choosing reading materials.  Finally, parents can control what their children read. If parents find a book inappropriate for their children, they can restrict their access. Other people should not censor a book just because it might be unsuitable for children. Parents can protect their children, and everyone should focus on their own preferences while allowing others to enjoy what they like. This approach simplifies matters and allows everyone to access uncensored books.  In conclusion, library censorship is both wrong and unjust. One person should not be able to say, 'I don't like this book, so censor it.' The three reasons mentioned clearly show that books are meant for public enjoyment, people have the right to choose, and parents can set limits for their children. Books should remain uncensored so that anyone who wants to read them can do so. We should not deprive books of the chance to be loved through censorship.
302	3279	2	2	Some people question whether certain books should be censored from libraries. There are always parents who believe that libraries have books inappropriate for their children, so they voice their opposition and demand that the library censor or remove these books. In my opinion, whether a library should censor or remove books, magazines, movies, music, etc., depends on the subject matter of these items.  It is the parents' responsibility to monitor what their kids read, listen to, or watch. There is no reason for a library to censor and remove books just because one or two parents complain about their inappropriateness. Parents can simply guide their children away from such materials. It is not the library's job to supervise children to ensure they don't access anything inappropriate; it is the parents' duty.  Katherine Paterson, an author, made a valid point. She said that if she has the right to remove books from the shelf, then so does everyone else. If everyone starts removing books, there will be no books left. Everyone has different views on books. What one person considers bad, another may not. The same goes for the opposite: what one person thinks is good, another may think is bad. Regarding movies, there are some that should be censored, such as those containing extreme violence or gore. I recall going to the library as a child and wanting to borrow a [CAPS3] movie. I couldn't because I wasn't at least [NUM1] years old. I thought it was ridiculous as it was a [CAPS3] movie and seemed harmless.  For magazines and music, it also depends on the subject matter. Some magazines have inappropriate pictures and articles for young kids, and these should be kept away from them. They don't necessarily need to be removed but can be placed in a section for teens and adults. Music can also be a problem. A lot of today's music, especially rap music, can be very inappropriate. In my view, music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored in a library where young kids are present.  In conclusion, whether books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored or removed depends on the subject and its level of inappropriateness. What one parent deems bad, another may not. Overall, I believe that these materials should not be overly censored. Parents can decide what they want their children to read, watch, or listen to.
303	3280	2	2	Today, I will discuss whether certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the library if they are considered offensive. In today's world, it is impossible to satisfy everyone. Everyone will have disagreements at some point in their lives.  People live different lives in different places, but almost everyone has read a book, listened to music, or read a magazine. However, people may interpret these materials differently. Personally, I don't think materials from which people can learn should be removed from the library, except for pornographic materials, which should definitely be removed.  In conclusion, it is impossible to please everyone. I believe that materials that can help students learn should not be removed from the library.
304	3281	2	2	A local library houses hundreds of books, each with a different subject, style, and story. Not everyone has the same taste in reading topics, music styles, magazine fashion, or articles. Everyone is unique, with different likes and interests.  Some people may find certain books disturbing and inappropriate, believing they should not be on library shelves. However, what one person finds disturbing, another may find interesting. Since everyone is different, not all books will appeal to everyone. If one person deems a book inappropriate while another finds it interesting and recommends it to friends, should the person who disapproves be allowed to remove the book from the shelf, preventing others from reading it? Everyone should have the same opportunity to read a book that someone else may find inappropriate.  People should be able to read the materials and topics they enjoy. However, nude magazines focused on sex and nudity should only be available in adult stores. A child in the library might wander to the adult section and pick up such a magazine, which parents don't want their children to access. These magazines are restricted to those aged eighteen and above, so they should be kept in adult stores where children can't see them. Some books may contain a naked picture, but it could be for educational purposes, such as showing how to perform a breast examination to educate women about breast cancer and prevent serious health issues. Books about diseases with nude photos should be allowed as they educate the community and save lives.  In our society, there are different views on what children should read or pick from the library shelves. Books are written by different people with different perspectives on life. Just because a book contains a curse word doesn't mean it is a bad influence. It could be one of the best books a child or adult has ever read.  Everyone has different views, likes, interests, wants, and needs. We all have different preferences for reading materials. We should all have the opportunity to read or not read what others find inappropriate. Authors also deserve to have their voices heard, and books should be available for everyone to read and experience different emotions.  In conclusion, in our world, society, and community, there are diverse opinions on library materials. We should respect these differences and ensure that everyone has the chance to access a wide range of reading materials. No single person's opinion should overshadow others, and books should be treated equally, allowing everyone to enjoy the adventure, excitement, and knowledge they offer.
305	3282	2	2	I'm [PERSON1], and I've heard there's been a discussion about various things in libraries. I'd like to share my thoughts on the matter. Many people have different opinions on what is appropriate, especially when it comes to what is suitable for kids. There are materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that some may find inappropriate.  If a parent believes a book, movie, etc. is inappropriate for their child, they should talk to the librarian. The librarian should listen to the parent's concerns, examine the material herself, and decide whether it is appropriate. If she deems it inappropriate, she has the right to remove it from the shelf.  If the parent discusses the issue with the librarian, but the librarian believes the material is okay, she could move it to a different area of the library. For example, if a parent says a book is inappropriate for a young child, the librarian could move it from the young - child section to an older - child area.  I have personal experience with this. At my old school, adults often complained about books they thought were inappropriate. We girls were upset because we loved reading those books. The librarian at the time thought the books were appropriate and didn't want to remove them. So, she had a great idea. She put the controversial books on a special shelf behind her desk. To borrow these books, students had to get permission from their parents or bring a note. This was a good solution because those whose parents didn't allow them to read the books weren't tempted, and those who were allowed could still access them.  Another idea is that if you see a younger child near materials meant for older people, you should talk to them, explain that it's not age - appropriate, and guide them to materials suitable for their age.  In conclusion, everyone has different opinions, and just because one person complains doesn't mean it should ruin things for everyone. Censorship should exist in libraries to some extent, but not to an extreme degree. Libraries should offer a wide variety of topics, including action, adventure, humor, and love, so that everyone can find something they enjoy. Instead of immediately removing a material because of one complaint, we should talk to people to understand their preferences. Thank you for considering my opinion.
306	3283	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries generally should not remove music, movies, or magazines. One can never be aware of the circumstances at people's homes, and the library serves as a place for them to relax and read. Removing these items would defeat the purpose of the library, as people love visiting it for such resources. Moreover, if these items are absent, the library will not make a profit. When patrons go to the library and do not find what they expect, they will be left wondering what has happened.  It is not the children's fault that books are missing; rather, it is the responsibility of the library owners and staff. When children visit the library, they will ask their parents or others about the missing books, as they want to read and borrow them. People enjoy borrowing books from the library, especially on weekends when they may not have such resources at home.  Removing any items from the library would cause a significant commotion. It would be a sad situation if someone, feeling lonely and with nowhere else to go, went to the library only to find the desired items missing. The idea of removing books, music, or magazines from the shelves is a terrible one. In the real - world scenario, it would lead to a crisis for the library users. People love to read, listen to music, and engage with other library resources to relieve stress.  In addition, library staff likely understand that people cherish their jobs and would not want to implement such a measure. I personally enjoy the quiet environment of the library, where I can listen to music on my device. Some people also visit the library to meet friends, communicate, or use the computers. Removing items could result in the loss of jobs and other negative consequences. In conclusion, libraries should keep all these resources to meet the diverse needs of their patrons.
307	3284	2	2	Do you get offended when you come across swear words while reading a book or hearing them in person? In today's society, it's nearly impossible to avoid harsh language. Have you ever entered a library, picked up a book, and then put it back on the shelf because of the offensive language within? Many books in modern libraries contain such language. Sometimes, it adds character to the book and makes the story more relatable to the reader, but in other cases, it can be offensive.  In my opinion, if you don't like the language in a book, simply put it back on the shelf. The author writes the book according to their own vision, not to suit every reader's preferences. Some materials may be inappropriate for younger readers, and the maturity level of the reader is a crucial factor when discussing censorship.  Take, for example, the movie 'The @CAPS1'. Many parents have concerns about its use of alcohol and drugs, yet many others find it funny and entertaining. Should this movie be removed from the shelves just because of these elements? The words and actions we try to censor are prevalent in our daily lives, regardless of where we are. So, if you don't like the language in a book, choose another one. In conclusion, rather than trying to censor everything, readers should have the freedom to make their own choices about what they consume.
308	3285	2	2	I am of the view that if certain materials are offensive, they should be removed from the library shelves, depending on the nature of the offense. Materials that are offensive due to racism or prejudice should definitely not be on the shelves. Similarly, if the material is offensive to women or men, it should also be removed. People should be able to read and listen to content without being offended.  If the material is offensive to different races, it must be taken off the shelves. Children who read such content may believe that racism is acceptable, which is a dangerous message. Both children and adults should be able to access non - offensive materials and not learn offensive behavior from what they read or listen to.  Allowing offensive materials in libraries can lead to problems. It can cause dissatisfaction among patrons, who may then stop visiting the library. This, in turn, can lead to a lack of patronage, forcing the library to close due to insufficient service.  I also believe that materials offensive to women or men should be removed. Magazines featuring women or men in an offensive way can create a bad impression. They may put inappropriate thoughts in people's minds and are simply rude to have in the library.  In conclusion, offensive materials should be removed from library shelves. Their presence can cause numerous problems, including the potential loss of libraries. Any content that is offensive in any way should not be left in the library for the well - being of its patrons and the sustainability of the library itself.
309	3286	2	2	Some people think certain things should be removed from library shelves or not even be created, but this is just their personal opinion, and not everyone should follow it. In my view, offensive materials can be both removed and kept on the shelves. They should be removed because they may offend someone, but they should also be kept so that people can read, see, or listen to them and gain knowledge. This way, they may avoid repeating offensive behavior. People have the right to decide what should be banned, but they also have the choice of whether to engage with the material. Even if parents don't want their kids to read offensive content, kids will still encounter it elsewhere.  I believe offensive materials should not be removed because no matter what we do, offensive content will always exist in the world. I listen to a lot of rap music when driving to school, and much of it is offensive to girls. However, it's just music and not necessarily a reflection of reality. People can choose not to listen to or read offensive content. If they find it offensive, they have the right to avoid it.  Rather than spending time trying to get something banned, it's easier to simply avoid what you don't like. Keeping offensive materials on the shelves allows those who want to read or understand them to do so. When I come across offensive content that I don't like, I just stop engaging with it instead of trying to get it banned, as that is a time - consuming process.  In conclusion, written materials should remain as they are. People can choose whether to read them or not. If they read offensive content and get offended, it's their own responsibility. Not reading what you don't like is a better approach in the long run, as it avoids unnecessary bans and potential negative impacts on future content creation.
310	3287	2	2	Censorship in libraries can be useful to prevent children and young people from accessing content their parents don't want them to see. Libraries typically have separate kids' and adult sections for this purpose. However, parents may bring their children into the adult section to avoid leaving them unattended.  Completely removing offensive materials from the library is not a good idea. It takes away literature that some people may enjoy, and it also upsets those who advocate for censorship. As an avid reader, I've visited many libraries but have rarely seen material so offensive that it needed to be removed. If such material exists, libraries should create an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people consider offensive.  For instance, albums with offensive language or topics often have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' stickers. These can be easily identified and placed in the alternative section. People who want to listen to such music can then access it. Books usually have reviews, which can help determine if they are too offensive. Library staff can place such books in the alternative section. Movies have ratings, so those rated @CAPS4 or above can be put on specific shelves. I've never seen offensive magazines in a library, and based on my experience, people don't need to worry about them.  In conclusion, creating an alternative section for offensive materials in the library is a better solution than complete removal. Removing materials would deprive those who enjoy them of certain literature. Classic movies like '@CAPS6' or '@CAPS7', though rated @CAPS4, are still great works and should not be removed. Instead, they can be placed in the alternative section for those who want to access them.
311	3288	2	2	Throughout the world, there exist thousands of libraries, all stocked with numerous books, magazines, music, movies, and other materials for people of all ages to access. A debate has arisen regarding whether the materials in libraries should be censored. Some advocate for censorship, while others believe all materials should be permitted. I firmly hold the view that library materials should neither be removed nor censored, as this would lead to a reduction in available materials, limit people's choices, and impede research.  Censoring library materials would result in a decrease in the available resources. People have diverse opinions on what is appropriate. If one individual decides a book is inappropriate and removes it from the shelf, others may follow suit, removing books they find offensive. Given the wide range of beliefs about appropriateness, the number of available materials would rapidly decline. This applies not only to books but also to other items such as magazines and movies.  Everyone has the right to choose what they want to view in a library. A 50 - year - old man and a 13 - year - old girl have different interests. If materials are removed, the variety for selection will be limited. This could lead to a decrease in library users, ultimately causing the library to close due to lack of patronage.  Moreover, every item in a library can be valuable for research. A high - school student might visit the library to find a book for a class report, and an elderly woman could search for a cookbook to learn a new recipe. If some materials are removed, they may not be able to find what they need.  In conclusion, despite the views of those who support removing items from libraries, I strongly believe that library materials should not be censored. The current wide variety of materials in libraries around the world caters to people of all ages, and this should remain the case.
312	3289	2	2	In my view, certain items should not be removed from the library. This is because people have a wide range of interests. I personally never remove anything from a library, as I'm aware that many others have different preferences. At the same time, I understand that some items may not be suitable for children. However, removing certain items would likely anger library users.  I think no item should be removed. Instead, libraries can be organized into sections. This way, specific books or topics can be grouped together, and areas inappropriate for children can be clearly demarcated to prevent under - age kids from accessing them. By not removing items, libraries can attract more visitors. On the contrary, removing certain types of books would lead to dissatisfaction among users, causing them to stop coming. As a result, the number of library visitors would decline.  In conclusion, since people have diverse interests, no item should be removed from the library. Doing so would lead to a loss of visitors. People deserve to enjoy the wide range of materials available in libraries, and we should preserve this variety.
313	3290	2	2	Books hold great significance for avid readers. They can contain pictures or be collections of poems. However, some books should not be available on library shelves as they contain offensive language and inappropriate images. Even if they are learning materials, young children do not need to be exposed to such content. I believe offensive books should be removed from the shelves.  Libraries need to raise their standards regarding what should and should not be included. Books, movies, music, and other materials should be placed in specific sections where young children cannot access them. A library is a family - friendly place, not merely a place for adult entertainment.  On a particular day, I went to the library with my six - year - old brother, who was about to turn seven. He wanted a book about dinosaurs, but I suggested one on space and aliens. He was an enthusiastic reader and read to our mom every night before bed. As we walked down the street, a bolt of lightning struck through the trees. My brother exclaimed in fear and ran around me. When we entered the library, the old lady at the front desk warned us about an approaching storm, but we ignored her and focused on choosing books for my brother.  We went upstairs to the children's section. My brother picked up a naughty magazine and asked me what it was. I quickly snatched it from his hands, and he got scared. I told him to choose a book and leave. As we were about to check out, the lights went out. A man told us to stay calm, and the backup lights came on. We moved to the lobby and waited for 20 minutes until the main lights came back on.  After the lights were restored, we went to the front desk. I returned the bad magazine I had taken from my brother and informed the lady that it was in the children's section. She was shocked. My brother placed his chosen books on the counter, and we checked out. Then we left the library and headed home. This incident clearly shows the importance of proper management of library materials to protect children from inappropriate content.
314	3291	2	2	In my opinion, public libraries should not censor the books, movies, and music they display. People have the right to learn, read, and expand their minds in ways they deem fit. There are three main reasons why “offensive” writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries.  Throughout history, humans have been documenting experiences, events, and ideas through various forms of art. These records often include profanity, sexuality, death, and other situations that the public may consider “offensive.” If we were to try to remove all such content, we would be destroying a significant part of history, and there are simply too many works to eliminate. Almost every form of art contains some negative elements, and removing them would leave us with very few, if any, books.  Secondly, people have different opinions on what is “offensive.” For instance, during a band trip, we played a movie that one parent found inappropriate, so we had to turn it off. However, other parents were upset because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same applies to books and music; it all depends on personal views.  Thirdly, people will encounter the things we try to hide in the real world. If we remove offensive materials from the library, people will still hear about them through the news, radio, or in daily life. For example, some want to remove the book “The [Title] of [Organization]” because it uses the word “nigger.” But replacing it with “slave” takes away the authenticity and power of the book.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that libraries should not remove “offensive” books, music, or movies. Doing so would erase part of our history and knowledge. With everyone having different views on what is offensive, it's impossible to determine which items to remove. Moreover, removing these items from libraries will not solve the problem, as people will still be exposed to such content in society.
315	3292	2	2	Katherine Paterson once astutely stated that if everyone had the right to remove a book they abhor from library shelves, there would be no books left. Her view on library censorship is quite valid. Most books contain ideas and topics that may offend someone, yet I believe books with offensive content should not be censored.  What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. For example, a person who is pro - life may find a book about a teenage girl getting an abortion offensive. However, the author may be simply trying to convey the girl's feelings and experiences. If every person removed a book they were offended by, libraries would have to close as no books would remain. Religious books would also face censorship due to different religious beliefs. A religious text from one faith may be offensive to someone of another faith, and this could lead to endless disputes.  Censoring books would cause a rapid decline in literature. When authors write, they pour their hearts into their work. If a book is considered offensive and censored, the author is deeply offended. An author may invest their life's work in a single book, and having it removed from the shelves because a group of people dislike it is unjust. I prefer to read books with interesting and controversial topics rather than those that lack substance. If library censorship were to occur, many authors would likely give up writing, as it's extremely difficult to create a book that pleases everyone. Also, people are less likely to be attracted to books without engaging topics, leading to a decline in interest in literature.  Furthermore, censoring books would harm the quality of learning. Books are essential learning tools, and removing them would be detrimental to education. Some teenagers, including myself, may find some school - assigned reading materials offensive or controversial. However, these books have meaning, which is why teachers select them. A few offensive words will not prevent readers from understanding the book's message.  In conclusion, although a book may be offensive, it won't ruin someone's life. Removing a book or censoring music due to a few offensive words denies the creativity and passion of the author or artist. Given that what is offensive to one person may not be to another, and considering the negative impacts on literature and learning, library censorship should not be allowed.
316	3293	2	2	"Recently, I became aware of the growing issue of library censorship, which is extremely unfortunate. People have the right to unimpeded access to knowledge, and censoring libraries directly violates this right. Libraries are intended to be places of learning and should remain so. History is filled with both glorious and inglorious moments. We may not always be proud of our actions or what has occurred, but these events exist regardless of whether we choose to acknowledge them. Thinking that ignoring the less - savory aspects of history will make them disappear is not only unrealistic but also completely ignorant of facts. I understand that there are things children should not be exposed to, and I'm not suggesting otherwise. However, trying to shield them from what we consider ""unclean"" is neither right nor a good general idea. We can't protect our children forever; eventually, they will learn things we'd rather they didn't, which is inevitable. Life doesn't hide its darker side from us, and hiding it from our children will only handicap them. Children do need protection for a time, but it is the responsibility of individual parents to safeguard their own children, not at the expense of everyone else. Why should the views of some restrict the access of others? Those who presume to know what people should or should not see are out of touch. Those overly prudish individuals who believe people need to be protected from history, nature, or their own desires have no more right, and perhaps even less, to interfere with individual decision - making. People have the right to make their own choices, but they have no right to impose their opinions on others. This essay may not change the situation, but it has expressed what needed to be said and thus fulfilled its purpose. With this task completed, I can conclude with a clear conscience."
317	3294	2	2	I firmly believe that offensive content, whether heard or read, should remain accessible for several reasons. Everyone should have an understanding of the world's history, which may involve aspects of racism or offensive elements. If you come across offensive content while reading a book or listening to music, simply stop. You aren't being forced to engage with it; it's your choice. Libraries should retain such materials because people should experience what it's like to be offended. I don't enjoy the feeling of being offended, but it's a part of life. There will surely be people who disagree with me, but this is just my opinion. There are libraries around the world that restrict certain people based on their views regarding the library's material selection. I once witnessed a woman at a library discussing how she reported someone who wrote offensive remarks about her religion on the internet to the police. It's not so much about what happened to the person, but the fact that she involved the police. She could have handled the situation herself by approaching the person. As soon as she started reading the offensive content, she should have stopped or left the website. It was her decision to keep reading. I don't see why she needed to involve the police over someone's opinion. Libraries should keep these materials as some people may want to understand the concept of offensiveness. Libraries shouldn't hide this topic from anyone. People can be offensive due to their upbringing or nature. Others have to deal with such people, even if they don't like it or may take action against them in their lifetime. In conclusion, libraries should keep certain materials, even if they are offensive. They shouldn't change their approach for those who dislike the materials. There are many people who want to learn more about these topics, and they shouldn't be hindered by those who don't. It's simply a part of life.
318	3295	2	2	The question of whether certain materials like books, magazines, movies, etc., should be removed from library shelves if they are offensive to some is complex. However, I firmly believe that if someone dislikes or finds a particular item offensive, they should not have the right to have it removed. One reason is that what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. For instance, @PERSON1 might be interested in reading a book about abortion, while @CAPS1 is against and offended by this topic. If the book is removed, it restricts the access of others, like @PERSON1, who wish to learn about it. Another reason is that if one type of material is offensive to some, another will likely be offensive to others. If we start removing all offensive materials, there will be very few resources left for students to read. Even though certain materials may offend some individuals, I think they should not be removed from the library. People who dislike a particular item should not have the power to take it away. This is because other people may want to read it, and removing such materials would severely limit the available resources for learning. In conclusion, libraries should keep a diverse range of materials on their shelves, including those that may be offensive to some. Everyone has the right to access information, and we should not let the sensitivities of a few restrict the learning opportunities of many.
319	3296	2	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I disagree with the decision to remove materials from the library. It is not the library's fault if someone is offended by books, movies, music, or magazines. If a person doesn't like an item, it's their own choice to pick it up in the first place. Children under the age of thirteen should not have access to inappropriate movies, as they are too young to view such content. Movies can be very entertaining for children. Funny movies amuse them daily, and some children even quote movie lines to make others laugh. As a teen, I often watch funny movies to brighten my day. There are some movies that are so hilarious that I can quote every line. Music is extremely important to teenagers today. It brings me great joy. I love various types of music and find it very enjoyable. I'm not a fan of rock music, so I wouldn't borrow it from the library. Teens use music for many activities such as dancing, singing, working out, and simply enjoying themselves. Books are also important. Although I don't read often, I do like to read books that interest me. For example, I wouldn't read a scary book as it would give me nightmares. I'm more interested in fiction books. My two favorite books are A @CAPS1 To @CAPS2 and The @CAPS3 @CAPS4, both written by @PERSON1. I love all of his books, but these two stand out. Please reconsider your decision to remove so - called ""bad"" music, books, and movies. It's the responsibility of the borrowers, not the library. If someone doesn't like an item, they shouldn't have taken it home. Let's keep the library diverse and allow people to be happy with their choices."
320	3297	2	2	There are numerous books that are inappropriate for children and teenagers, yet they can still borrow them from the library. By taking these books home and reading them, they may discover things that are not suitable for their age. Children also check out rated @NUM1 and rated @CAPS1 movies, as well as unedited @CAPS2's, and may learn inappropriate words and behaviors. Libraries are supposed to ensure that borrowers are of a certain age, like @NUM2 years old, before allowing them to borrow rated @CAPS1 movies. Similarly, there should be age restrictions for purchasing @CAPS2's and games intended for older teenagers. There should be age limits for borrowing or buying any material with vulgar language. Today's kids are not as mature as in the past, and the situation has changed significantly. In my opinion, teenagers should have age - related restrictions for renting or buying inappropriate items. However, I've also read books that weren't entirely suitable for my age. It really depends on an individual's maturity and their ability to accept vulgar content. Parents should be the ones to decide if their children are ready for such materials. In conclusion, the decision of whether a teenager can access certain materials should depend on their maturity level and readiness. Libraries and stores should set age limits for books and other items. Although not everyone will agree, there should be boundaries and age - based privileges that teenagers should respect.
321	3298	2	2	Many individuals base their actions on personal views. What may seem justified to them, due to their beliefs, can cause an uproar among others. A prime example is media censorship, which occurs daily and everywhere. Some people take it upon themselves to, in their opinion, “improve a piece for public viewing.” In reality, they are ruining the media experience for others and even infringing on the rights guaranteed to us by the Constitution: Freedom of the Press.  First, consider library books. Every time I visit the library and pick up books, there is often one with “bad parts” marked out. Someone found these words offensive and decided no one should see or read them. This is irritating. I may not always like those words either, but having them marked out is distracting and ruins the author's voice and writing style, thus impairing my understanding of the book. Moreover, some marked - out words may not be offensive to others. Simply put, if you find a book offensive, don't read it. Others may enjoy it, regardless of whether they share your views.  People also freely remove entire pieces of media from shelves because they find them offensive. If everyone removed what they disliked or found offensive, there would be nothing left for anyone to enjoy. As American citizens, we have the right to make our own choices, and our choices should not be limited by the views of certain individuals. That means if I want to read or view something, it should be available to me so I can learn and expand my views, even if it makes someone else uncomfortable.  Whenever a controversial form of media is released, people often harass the producers and claim the piece should never have been made. This is wrong. Producers and authors can publish whatever they like. It's called Freedom of the Press, a right guaranteed to us as American citizens under the Constitution. Clearly, if such pieces are being produced, people are reading them. If everyone found it offensive, no one would buy or read it, and it would stop being produced. But since some people do read it, it continues to be produced. Again, if you don't like it, don't read it.  People should not take it upon themselves to censor what others can do, see, or read. If someone wants to read a story with “bad words,” so be it. Others should not ruin the experience by marking out the words. Not only is it rude and ruins the reading experience, but it also destroys someone else's property. If someone wants to view something against a certain religion, they have the right, and no one can take that right away. In my opinion, censorship in libraries, whether by the government or other civilians, should not be allowed. We citizens have the right to make our own choices, and in public libraries, the public should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want. Choice is one of the principles of the Constitution and should be protected, not limited.
322	3299	2	2	Many libraries house books, movies, music, and magazines that some may consider offensive. However, these libraries have valid reasons for including such materials, whether for educational or recreational purposes. Therefore, libraries with “offensive” books should be allowed to keep them because these books are not offensive to everyone and can be beneficial to readers.  Books that offend some people may not be offensive to others. For example, Sarah, who is from the South, visits a library and finds a book about the Civil War. She reads that the South had people who mistreated their slaves and gets quite offended. Meanwhile, Tom, an African - American historian, picks up the same book. He thinks it is a great book that provides valuable insights. This example shows that the people of the United States are diverse, and with this diversity come opposing views among citizens. A library aims to appeal to all races, and in the process, it may accidentally offend some. Citizens need to be more understanding that their race is not the only one in the country. If a book offends someone, they simply shouldn't read it.  Moreover, these books that many may find offensive can also be beneficial to readers. Consider the Civil War reference again. Sarah was reading her Southern history textbook. She got offended because it described the South's actions regarding slavery and its loss in the war. On the other hand, John, who is in the same class as Sarah, was reading the same history textbook and became more and more excited. He was happy that kids across the country were learning about what happened to his ancestors and that the Union defeated the South. If this book were removed from the library, how would students across the nation learn about the Civil War?  Libraries cannot discard books just because they offend someone. As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone removed the books they disliked, there would be no books left on the shelves. Libraries should keep the books they have and acquire more. The nation needs as many books as possible because they are helpful to those who choose to read them. We must remember that not all books will appeal to us, and we should not be offended by those that don't.
323	3300	2	2	In my opinion, library censorship is over - rated. We often hear that books, music, magazines, and movies are offensive or degrading, but does that mean they should be removed from public library shelves or bookstores? I say no. Future generations may be short on knowledge or become naive due to library censorship. Katherine Paterson once said, “All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.” If books are removed because they are considered offensive, there will be so many gone that children will not have as broad a view as many people have today.  Everyone has different opinions about what is offensive. Just because one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean others will. I've heard of teachers not allowing students to see pictures of the Confederate flag because they think it's offensive. But not everyone agrees. The Confederate flag is an important part of history, and categorizing it as offensive is wrong. It's not the only unpleasant part of history. If we start removing significant parts of history, they will be forgotten.  I believe libraries should not tell us what we can and cannot read. We have the right to choose what we read. If we think a book is bad, we won't read it. But that doesn't mean a book should be removed because one person finds it offensive. Someone else might want to read it. I think people are mature enough to choose what they read, and parents can make choices for their children.  With so many different opinions, it's difficult to decide what to do about censorship. I believe that if something is offensive, there could be a special section for explicit media and reading. That way, people won't be offended. Just because one person doesn't like something doesn't mean others won't.
324	3301	2	2	Dear [Recipient's Title],  My name is [Your Name], and I believe everyone has the right to their own opinion. Some adults may not want their kids exposed to certain movies, books, or music. However, there are far more harmful things in the world that children encounter, such as hearing bad language, seeing fights, and witnessing people getting shot. There is more bad in life than what children listen to, watch, or read.  I think the world can be more harmful than anything else at times. Adults may want their kids to grow up differently, so they should tell them not to watch or listen to bad things on TV. But if kids want to learn about less - than - ideal things, we should let them.  It's not right for people, movies, or other things to change just because some people don't like them. Why should others have to change for those who don't approve? There are some materials that are inappropriate for minors, but they can only be purchased by those 18 and above. So, people should be okay with things that don't involve minors. Censoring things ruins a lot, as they were made a certain way for a reason and should be kept that way.  I'm sure many people may not agree with my view, but it's something to consider. People wouldn't create the things they do if they were supposed to be censored. Censorship takes away the meaning of many things. So, my answer is no to removing non - censored things. We should keep them so people can understand life in both easy and hard ways.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
325	3302	2	2	As a citizen of this city and an avid library - goer, I believe that library censorship is necessary. Some of the materials in libraries today are very graphic and often quite offensive. Do we really want our children to see half - nude people or the murder of innocent people because of their skin color?  In today's libraries, there are many books and movies that depict racism. For example, the movie “[Movie Name].” In this movie, white children are yelled at for playing with African - American children. This is a clear example of why censorship is necessary. Imagine if your child watched this movie and then said something rude to an African - American friend. It would be very offensive. Although the movie is about historical events, in my opinion, it still needs to be removed from the shelves.  In today's society, nudity is becoming a major issue in movies and books. You might think it's okay to let your child watch a movie rated [Rating], but there could be nudity in it. Depending on your child's age and whether you allow them on the computer, they might think it's okay to look up nude pictures on the internet.  This is also an issue in books. The other day, I sat down to read a book about a musical I wanted to see, and it had nude pictures in it. Once I discovered this, I asked my mother to return the book. These are the kinds of things that need to be removed from library shelves.  The language used in music is also a big problem. Many rap artists think it's okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music. They don't seem to consider that young children will be listening to it. This genre of music should be removed from the shelves. You might think it's okay for your young child to listen to it now, but wait until those words end up in their vocabulary.  I think library censorship is a serious matter that needs to be carefully considered. It may seem strange at first, especially when you can't find your favorite rap tape or [Rating] movie. But in the long run, you'll thank the library for removing these materials, especially when you have children of your own. You won't want them listening to, reading, or watching the same things you did as a child.
326	3303	2	2	Today, I am writing this paper to discuss the censorship of books, movies, music, and other media. In my view, there should be a restricted selection of content accessible to children. When one enters a store or a video - rental shop, children are exposed to a wide range of materials. Seeing such content may lead them to believe that inappropriate behavior is acceptable. I firmly believe that inappropriate items should not be visible to children. They should be removed from public display and stored elsewhere. Regarding music on the radio, although it is censored, people can still figure out the original lyrics. Certain words that offend some individuals are still prevalent in radio broadcasts, on television, and in books. If people were more mindful of what they produce, the situation would be different. Currently, children are being exposed to inappropriate content, such as through violent video games like “@CAPS5 of @CAPS6”. Seeing shooting and other violent acts in these games makes children think that such behavior is normal. This could potentially contribute to the high levels of violence we see today. I am writing this paper to advocate for an article in the newspaper to propose stricter rules. By implementing such rules, we can reduce the exposure of inappropriate content to the public, especially children, and hopefully decrease the prevalence of violence.
327	3304	2	2	Imagine being disrespected and called derogatory names, like hearing “@CAPS1 did you say to me @CAPS2”. Would you think materials with such content should be available in libraries? I believe anything hurtful, harmful, or offensive should be accessible to the public. It offers a valuable opportunity to learn. Books, magazines, and music related to slavery are essential resources. They might cause pain, depression, or irritation to some, but they also provide valuable historical knowledge. People of all races can gain an understanding of the pain and struggles faced by those who came before us. Despite the discomfort, this kind of learning is beneficial and should be available in libraries. Knowledge about suicide should also be accessible. Some of our friends and family have either attempted or committed suicide. Without knowledge about it, prevention becomes difficult. Books on this subject can offer help to those with suicidal thoughts. Reading about past struggles and facts can provide tips on how to avoid suicide. I believe that enlightenment on this topic is the only way to prevent it. In conclusion, I am of the opinion that all types of literature should be made available to the public. All forms of literature present a great opportunity to learn. By reading about past situations and struggles, we can avoid or overcome the challenges we face in our lives.
328	3305	2	2	Should certain books be allowed in libraries? If we limit the selection, people will have to read the same books repeatedly. There is a wide variety of books, including history, poetry, drama, romance, and horror. However, some books are not suitable for all places. Regarding music, some types are acceptable, while others I do not approve of. Rap, for example, consists of people rhyming about their lives. Rock - and - roll was initially disliked by many when it emerged in the late @NUM1. But as time passed, more people started listening to it. Many parents didn't want their children listening to it back then, calling it “devil music”. Today, a lot of people still enjoy it because they grew up with this kind of music. There are numerous movies available, with different ratings like @NUM2 and @CAPS1. Many parents don't let their children watch certain movies because they are scary, ugly, or gross. There are also shorter shows suitable for kids. Magazines are a relatively new form of media. Older people often read magazines because they have more free time. However, some people are really into magazines and want to buy every issue that catches their eye. There are various types of magazines, such as those about fitness, food, cleaning, and toys. In my view, these forms of media can be addictive. Some people get so caught up in them that they end up spending a lot of money. By the time they realize it, they may be broke.
329	3306	2	2	If we were to remove everything that someone in the world finds offensive, there would be nothing left. Different cultures have different sensitivities, and it is unjust to take away something just because a select group of people are offended by it. Being offended is not always a negative thing, and removing something based on someone else's opinion is wrong. Firstly, the perception of what is offensive is largely influenced by culture. In most @CAPS1 cultures, declining food is considered offensive. In @CAPS2, any form of harm to cows or eating them is a disgrace. When someone finds something offensive, it may be due to their different cultural background. It is impossible to satisfy everyone. Secondly, one of the great aspects of @LOCATION1 is the freedom to hold one's own beliefs. If an item is removed from a library shelf because someone finds it offensive, it is an infringement on freedom of speech. I have my own beliefs that may offend some people, but that doesn't mean I should remain silent. Likewise, I don't want others' beliefs forced on me. Removing offensive items from public spaces means removing the right to free expression, which is not only wrong but also illegal. Some people may be offended by a book with a cross on it or a @CAPS3 cover with a pentagram. However, this doesn't mean these items should be removed. Getting offended can sometimes be a good thing as it makes people stand up for their beliefs. For example, the terrorist group @ORGANIZATION1 may be offended by the @CAPS4 flag, but we wouldn't stop flying it. In my opinion, removing offensive items from public view is wrong for multiple reasons. So many people find different things offensive, and removing all of them would eliminate everything. It would also violate freedom of speech. Moreover, offensive things can remind us of our own identities. We should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding their removal.
330	3307	2	2	One day at school, all our teachers informed the class that most of the books in the library would be removed from the shelves. Our class is against this decision. The teachers said that some parents had complained about what their children were reading. I think most of the books in the library are beneficial for kids. They like to read these books and learn about things they aspire to have or do in the future. It is a positive sign that children are interested in learning about their future careers. When I have kids, I want them to have dreams about their future. If they want to spend time in school reading magazines to figure out their interests, that's fine with me. If the school removes the books from the shelves, the students may lose motivation in school. They may not know what they want to be in the future. I'm sure that if this happened to my kids, I would buy them all the magazines they need to pursue their dreams. Taking away the books will likely upset parents because it will shatter the kids' dreams. When the kids want to read, and the school removes all the good books, they won't know what they want to do later in life. A good solution would be to let the students vote on whether to remove the books. I bet most students would want to keep the books on the shelves because they enjoy reading and looking at pictures. This shows that they have aspirations for the future. There are two possible outcomes. One is that the school removes the books, and the students lose motivation and may not know what they want to become. The other is that the school keeps the books, and the students will be more eager to read and have a better idea of their future. If I had the choice, I would keep the books on the shelves to make the kids happy.
331	3308	2	2	Rewrite of the first item Everyone holds a personal opinion on library censorship. In my view, libraries should not be subject to censorship regarding their shelf selections. People vary greatly in their preferences for reading, listening, viewing, and watching materials. In today's era, opinions on censorship are diverse. I oppose censorship because individuals have different tastes, thoughts, lifestyles, and learning desires.  Each person is unique. If libraries were to censor their offerings, not everyone would have access to the content they wish to consume. This would make some people feel marginalized. For instance, if a library only stocked romance materials, what would action - movie enthusiasts do? A library is a place for all its visitors, not just a specific group.  People grow up in different environments. Children don't choose their parents, and some parents censor their children's reading and viewing, while others do not. Kids with less - restrictive parents may have a wider range of interests. Not everyone likes the same things.  At school, students typically learn the basic required knowledge. Outside of school, there is a vast amount of additional information to discover. Libraries are a resource where people can explore topics that interest them. The topics people study in their free time can vary widely, from drugs and sex to other subjects. If libraries censor what people can access, not everyone will be able to learn the extra information they want.  I firmly believe that libraries should not censor the materials they make available to the public. People are different, and that is a good thing. Censorship would deprive individuals of equal opportunities. Parents have the option to censor what their children read, but since not all parents choose to do so, children develop different interests. By censoring library materials, libraries prevent everyone from having an equal chance to learn. Let people be themselves! Do not censor the books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries.
332	3309	2	2	I firmly believe that removing books from library shelves, even if they are considered offensive, is unjust. I have three main reasons to support this stance: access to knowledge, the sectioning of libraries, and the principle of freedom. Before delving into these reasons, it's important to note that many who advocate for censorship often do so out of fear.  When a book is removed from a shelf due to its perceived offensiveness, it becomes inaccessible to those who wish to read it. This is clearly unfair. In life, there are numerous things that can offend people, but we must learn to accept diverse views. Everyone has the right to form their own opinions, which is only possible through exposure to different ideas. Reading enriches our vocabulary at any age. Just because one person dislikes a book doesn't mean others won't find value in it. We should allow others the opportunity to develop their own perspectives.  Libraries are ubiquitous. If parents are concerned about their children accessing inappropriate books, they can take them to libraries with well - defined sections. All libraries are divided into various sections. By keeping young children in the 'children' section, parents can avoid potential concerns. As children grow older, they can explore the library independently and discover their preferred types of books.  We live in a country that has always championed freedom. Some people cannot afford to buy books or access the internet, so they rely on public libraries. If they cannot find books that interest them, they may stop reading. They might even be searching for a specific book that has been removed from the shelves. Additionally, there is a religious aspect to consider. There are many versions of certain texts and a multitude of religions. Should we remove all books that don't align with a particular religious view?  I understand why some people advocate for censorship, but often, they are trying to avoid facing uncomfortable realities. We cannot pretend that the world is perfect. Allowing people to read whatever they choose is a positive step towards a more informed and inclusive society. We should respect the freedom of all individuals to access and engage with different ideas.
333	3310	2	2	Censorship in public libraries is an affront to these institutions. Libraries, as repositories of knowledge, should not be restricted by society in terms of the information they provide. One of the primary purposes of a library, a haven for researchers, is to offer information that people need to access safely. Books are neutral vessels of knowledge and do not make judgments.  Censoring library books hinders human progress. The principles of freedom of thought and freedom of the press, which are widespread globally, oppose the idea of such censorship. If one book can be criticized or opposed, then by the same logic, all books are potentially subject to the same treatment. Valuing one opinion less than another undermines the very culture from which libraries emerged. Libraries are communal spaces that welcome all views and writings. The goal of bringing books together is to give them equal standing as literary or scholarly works.  From personal experience, library censorship has cost me valuable time and deprived me of parts of my life. Growing up in a small town with rigid views on gender and sexuality, I struggled to find dissenting opinions in the school library. As a child seeking answers about my sexuality, I found only heteronormative love stories. It was only after leaving school that I discovered that books on alternative perspectives were in the library but were restricted. The most offensive part was not just the lack of representation but the separate treatment of these books.  The root of the problem is that some people believe that ignoring minority opinions or values will make them disappear. This is the essence of censorship: pushing an issue or a lifestyle choice to the point of extinction. However, books do not force their values on us. We must actively choose to read them and engage with their knowledge. Unlike advertisements that may surprise us, we have to pick up a book to access its content.  If my library had provided the guidance I needed, my personal growth would have been much smoother. I would have learned to accept myself and others more easily.  In recent years, as the effects of certain global events have reached the younger generation, our country has tried to honor the victims of violence and oppression. However, it has struggled to create effective memorials because there is a lack of material to draw from. The consequences of violence and book - burning have left a void. Architects have created 'anti - monuments' to represent this loss, such as a wall with gaps in the shape of book spines. This symbolizes the knowledge that has been lost. We must ask ourselves what valuable perspectives, prose, and beauty have been taken from us without our ever having the chance to experience them.  Library censorship is equivalent to burning books. Once a book is removed from the shelf, it is likely to be forgotten. To safeguard the future and educate our descendants, we must preserve all books, regardless of whether they are considered offensive, disgusting, brave, or new. Let readers determine the value of a book. Give books a chance to have an impact. Leave libraries as they are, as monuments to the preservation and advancement of knowledge and wisdom.
334	3311	2	2	Have you ever thought about how libraries select their books? I certainly have. There is some material out there that is not suitable for young children. I firmly believe that libraries should practice censorship. There are three main reasons for this: protecting children from books about violence, safeguarding the social lives of everyone, and addressing the issue of inappropriate music.  Let's start with the impact on children. Look around and you'll likely see children in libraries. They might be reading books that are too explicit for their age. For example, a six - year - old child with no restrictions could check out a book about violence and sex from the library. What can parents do when their child brings such a book home? In many cases, they do nothing. It's time for librarians to take a stand and censor these harmful books. If libraries don't censor, any child could be exposed to inappropriate content.  Children aren't the only ones affected by uncensored library books. Think about the conversations at school and work. Most of them revolve around sex and violence. These conversations often stem from the uncensored books available at the library. People of all ages, from toddlers to the elderly, can borrow books. When I was a child, my parents encouraged me to go to the library to learn. But if the library had no censorship, what would I have been reading? Our social lives are significantly influenced by what we learn and how we learn it.  Another issue is the music available at libraries. Every time I turn on the radio, I often hear songs that are inappropriate. I sometimes listen to radio station @NUM1, and most of the music is about violence. Libraries also have some of the CDs of these artists. The combination of uncensored books, music, and movies in libraries can create a negative social environment. Censoring music is a good step, as it would reduce the obsession with violence in our society.  We shouldn't have to tolerate the presence of uncensored books in libraries. Librarians and concerned individuals should fight for censorship. A library is a place for peaceful learning, not a source of violence. By implementing censorship, we can create a safer environment for everyone. No one should be exposed to the harmful effects of uncensored books and music.
335	3312	2	2	When a woman screamed '@CAPS1' after being stabbed in the back by her abusive husband, it highlighted the kind of violence that children are exposed to around the world. The inappropriate content children encounter on television, the internet, and through their classmates is already concerning. This is why books and magazines in libraries worldwide need to be censored.  In our local library in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, the magazines are extremely graphic. Kids are more likely to read these magazines than educational or interesting books. They draw disrespectful images in them, rip them in half, and engage in other destructive behaviors. This lack of respect for library materials may stem from the idea that they can do whatever they want. Many of the books kids read contain content that doesn't teach them anything valuable, such as stories about a zombie apocalypse. Having such books in a school library doesn't offer any educational value. Instead, it may encourage kids to take the books home and expose their siblings to inappropriate language. These are all valid reasons to censor or remove some of the leisure - reading books in libraries or to censor offensive language.  Another important point is the financial loss that schools face due to damaged books and stolen property. Kids draw inappropriate pictures in magazines and books, causing schools to spend a significant amount of money on repairs and replacements. If schools restricted the removal of these books from the library, they could save money and use it for more educational purposes.  If libraries around the world censor books and magazines, we can expect to see better - behaved children. By not allowing kids to take books out of the library, we can prevent them from damaging, stealing, or defacing the materials. This shows authority and teaches kids to respect library resources. The money saved by libraries and schools can be used for more educational initiatives. I hope you will consider the points I've made and take action to implement censorship in libraries.
336	3313	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should implement a degree of censorship. There exist books that may be offensive and cause issues. However, even if a book is insulting, it shouldn't be hidden from others. Libraries house some books with rather objectionable content. As libraries are public spaces, many people visit to borrow books. What's to prevent a child from accessing such books or movies available in libraries? Do we really want a child to check out materials containing violence, foul language, and sexual innuendo? One solution could be to censor these books and keep them from the public, but this would create another problem. The concept of censorship may seem reasonable at first glance, but it's not the right approach. Hiding materials from the public simply because they contain some undesirable elements is excessive. If an adult wishes to read a book with a bit of violence, they'd have to look elsewhere as the book might have been removed due to swear - words deemed inappropriate. Censorship would make it more difficult for adults to find the books they want to read. So, what should be done when there's an offensive book on the shelf? Should it be left there or removed? A better solution is to impose age restrictions on books. If an underage person wants to borrow an offensive book, they should obtain permission from their parent. This way, the book can remain on the shelf and be accessible to those who are allowed to read it.
337	3314	2	2	People have diverse perspectives when it comes to judging things. That's why I believe libraries should retain books that some might find offensive. What one person deems offensive may not be so for another. If people claim certain books are offensive, they can choose not to read them, but a single person's opinion shouldn't lead to a book's removal from the library. What is offensive to one individual could pique the interest of another. The person who doesn't find a book offensive should have the right to read it. Removing a book because one person objects to it is a violation of others' rights. Some people might find a book useful as they want to learn more about the topic. If the book is removed due to one person's objection, they'll lose the opportunity to gain knowledge. Personally, I enjoy thrilling movies and books with some violence. If a library removes such books or movies because a parent saw their child engaging with them, it's unjust. The parent would be depriving me of my preferred reading and viewing materials, which is completely unfair. A viable solution is to allocate specific areas in the library for different age groups. This way, people can access materials appropriate for their age. In conclusion, due to the wide range of opinions, we should respect everyone's right to access the books they want. Age - appropriate areas in libraries can effectively balance the needs of different age groups and ensure fairness.
338	3315	2	2	Over the years, libraries have served as a valuable resource for research, movie rentals, and discovering new reading materials. They open the door to a vast world of learning and reading. All libraries should have the freedom to stock the content they choose. No book, music, movie, or magazine should be excluded from the shelves based on its content. There are numerous books on topics such as sex and drugs that many people may find offensive or simply ignore. Each person's interests in reading, watching, or listening are unique. When someone wants to purchase a book on safe sex, the library shouldn't deny them access. Instead, it should be placed in a separate section. What some consider explicit content may not be so for others. When I was in middle school, I was curious about sex and drugs. I knew I could find relevant information in the local library. If a child wants to learn more, they'll look for information. If I had been denied access to books on these topics, I might never have been aware of their consequences. In a library, not everyone is reading light - hearted books. Many people read books about real - life situations that they can relate to. These books may be considered explicit by some. The purpose of a library is to provide access to materials of all kinds, regardless of others' concerns. Libraries can organize their collections by topic and genre. Explicit materials or those for adults can be placed in a back room or on a separate side of the library, out of reach of children. In conclusion, books, magazines, music, and movies should not be removed if they are found offensive. Every item has the right to be on the shelf, and people should have the freedom to access them according to their needs.
339	3316	2	2	Censorship is a highly debated topic. If one person dislikes the content of a text, they may claim the right to prevent others from accessing it in a public library, online source, or other public location. But what about the opinions of others? Shouldn't they also have a say? Suppose 'person one' disagrees with the language in a text, while 'person two' likes it. In this situation, which person's rights should be prioritized? Freedom of speech and expression are highly valued in our society, though sometimes overlooked. In this case, both 'person one' and 'person two' have the right to express their thoughts about the text. Should 'person one' have the right to demand the removal of the text from a public location? If everyone had the power to remove materials they disagreed with from the public domain, there would be nothing left. In a large and diverse society, there will always be someone who disagrees with the content of every lyric, magazine, book, and text available. Some may argue that it's unfair to the group that disagrees with a material. However, it's equally unfair to the group that supports it. The group that disagrees still has the right to voice their opinions, just like those who agree. Take iTunes as an example. If a song contains offensive language or content, it is marked with a red 'explicit' tag. This alerts those who may be offended by foul language. Additionally, there is often a 'clean' version of the song, which has the offensive content removed or replaced. This way, both parties can be satisfied. Movies are another example. They are rated based on their content, with a higher rating indicating more explicit material. The rating is accompanied by an explanation of why the movie received that rating. This allows viewers to make informed decisions. In conclusion, a material should not be removed from the public just because some people disagree with its content. Both parties should be able to express their opinions, and solutions like tagging and rating can help achieve a balance.
340	3317	2	2	Have you ever borrowed a book that you found offensive or thought should be censored? I once checked out a book with a lot of racism and sex - related content. Some books, movies, magazines, and other materials in libraries may not be suitable for all viewers, and we should consider restricting access to them. Libraries contain books with significant amounts of racism. In some cases, the racism in these books can be so severe that it may influence young readers and lead them down a wrong path in the future. A young racist might persuade their friends to adopt the same views. No parent wants their child to be racist, although there are racist families, which I find hard to understand as I believe we are all equal. Some library books also contain detailed sex - related discussions. This is inappropriate for young viewers as it may give them ideas that are not suitable for their age. Young children should not be exposed to such content until they are older. Many parents, including me, would not want their children to read books like this. Music is popular among people of all tastes, whether it's rap, country, or the blues. Some people think rap music is offensive and should be removed from the shelves. Rap music often reflects the artists' past and lives, and it may contain some racism and inappropriate language, which is not suitable for young listeners. Although there are materials with offensive content on library shelves, I think they should be placed in a separate room so that only adults can access them. At the same time, I believe books with racism can be kept as they show how much society has changed over time. By implementing these measures, we can protect young viewers while still preserving the value of these materials.
341	3318	2	2	New restricted sections in the library. Have you ever come across a movie or book that you didn't want your kids or family to engage with? I have, and sometimes it's impossible to stop them from accessing such content. I don't believe offensive books should be removed, but I think they should be moved to a different part of the library. This restricted area of the library should only be accessible to adults or with an adult's permission.  Kids often mimic their peers, not realizing that much of what they see in movies is fake. By having this separate section in the library, parents can keep racist, drug - gang - filled, and murder - themed books away from children. This is beneficial for all races. For instance, an African - American family can prevent their child from accessing books about slavery or gangs. Some books can be highly emotional and trigger strong feelings. Someone going through a tough time might be more likely to think about suicide after reading a related book.  I'm convinced that separating bad - influencing books from good - influencing ones will be very helpful. People under the age of 18 are not allowed in this restricted area without a parent or a parent's signature. So, come to the library council on [DATE1] and vote for the new restricted section of the library! Thank you for your time.
342	3319	2	2	When I was a little girl, I went to the library one day. I was eager to find a book to read. I made my way to what I called the “big kids side” and tried to check out a book. The library lady gently told me I was too young and showed me the books appropriate for my age level, taking the book I wanted back. That experience made me realize how libraries do a great job of keeping books at appropriate age levels.  Censorship in libraries is like cutting off the world's air supply. It takes away from a reader's imagination and stops them from expressing their minds. In my view, censorship in libraries is unnecessary. Libraries worldwide are already good at categorizing books according to age. If certain materials are removed, readers will wonder why, demand that their books be left alone, and may even fight for more books like those, which could then lead to the need for censorship.  Books are meant to make people wonder, learn, and get excited. Cutting out different materials stops people from enjoying the world of ideas. The more books are taken away, the more people turn to television. Eventually, there would be fewer authors and more actors and actresses, and people's minds would no longer be engaged in wonder, learning, or excitement.  So, in conclusion, censorship is not needed in libraries. It would undermine a librarian's job and take away from readers' imaginations.
343	3320	2	2	The issue of censorship in media and literature involves a certain level of responsibility, and determining who should bear this responsibility is a complex task. Children are highly susceptible to the influence of various media, and much of this material is readily accessible. Once individuals reach the age of making life - affecting decisions, they should have the freedom to choose what they read, watch, and consume. Shop owners, within the boundaries of the law, should be able to sell whatever products they deem fit to earn a living.  In a library setting, children usually do not visit alone. Parents have the authority to decide whether their children can borrow certain books, movies, or magazines. When a child presents an offensive or inappropriate item, it is the parent's decision to allow or restrict access. If a parent permits a child to access offensive media, the child may perceive such content as acceptable.  Adults who have reached the legal age and enjoy other freedoms should be allowed to purchase, read, and watch what they desire. To access offensive material, they should be required to present valid identification as proof of age.  A shop owner or businessperson should have the right to sell legal products without being unjustly restricted by non - legal authorities or non - guardians. Only law enforcement officers or legal guardians of minors should have the power to restrict an individual's access to non - illegal material.  In conclusion, only law enforcement or legal guardians of minors should be able to restrict the purchase or rental of certain media. There is no valid reason to prevent people from accessing non - illegal material. If someone is offended by certain literature, they should attempt to have it regulated through legal means.
344	3321	2	2	Censorship is a highly debated topic in today's society. People around the world have vastly different views on it. In some countries, dictators restrict citizens' access to the internet, news, and even television. They do this because they don't want their citizens to know what's happening globally. This creates a “fish bowl” environment where outsiders can see the country's problems, but the people inside are oblivious.  Although we don't always encounter such extreme forms of censorship, it still plays a significant role in modern society. Everything from radio music to military files is subject to censorship. Think about how often you can listen to a radio song with all its original lyrics intact. Debates about censorship have raged on for years without much progress. Each side of the argument, whether for or against censorship, is mostly based on opinion. It's impossible to say for sure whether censorship is completely necessary or not. It's just too difficult to determine which opinion is more convincing.  In my opinion, nothing should be censored. When a writer of a TV show uses a vulgar word, it's often to evoke an emotional response. The same goes for songs; artists use certain words to convey their message more effectively. Parents argue that their children are exposed to too much violence on TV, causing behavior problems. However, instead of censoring everything, parents can simply prevent their children from watching inappropriate shows.  In [LOCATION1], we have the right to freedom, which we exercise daily in our clothing choices and speech. We should apply this freedom to the issue of censorship. Instead of complaining about violence in movies or sex on TV, we can choose not to watch such shows. Everyone has the option to say no. It's a simple solution; we just need to exercise our right to choose and say no to what we don't want to see or hear. This could potentially end the long - standing debates about censorship.
345	3322	2	2	Dear [CAPS1] [PERSON1], the question of whether certain books should be removed because some people believe they are inappropriate for their children is a complex one. In my view, these books should not be removed but rather placed in different sections of the library according to age.  All children's books and magazines should be grouped in one section. Young adult and teen books and magazines should have their own section, as should adult books and magazines. Autobiographies and documentaries should also be in their own dedicated section. This categorization would make it easier for readers to find the books they want. For example, a teenage girl looking for a book about a high - school girl with a crush on a boy would most likely find it in the young adult section.  Parents who are concerned about their children's exposure to certain books should be able to voice their opinions. However, consider a situation where a teenager needs to find a famous person's autobiography for a school project, even though it includes details about the person's past drug use. That student should not fail just because a concerned parent deemed the book inappropriate and it was removed from the library.  In conclusion, the best approach is to categorize all books by age. This would simplify the process of finding books and ensure that all readers, regardless of age, have access to the materials they need.
346	3323	2	2	In contemporary society, inappropriate materials appear to be ubiquitous. They can be found in magazines, books, and music lyrics, with countless opportunities for offensive references to sneak in, and they seem to pop up everywhere these days. However, should one's access to such materials be restricted based on others' morals or values? I firmly oppose this, and here's why.  Everyone has distinct morals, values, and a sense of right and wrong. Perhaps one's religion or culture leads them to avoid certain materials. But why should one's values and beliefs determine what another person can access from the library? I'm certain I'm not alone in saying that I'd be extremely annoyed if I couldn't obtain the books or materials I wanted or needed simply because someone else disagreed with the content discovered through research.  I do believe that certain materials should be segregated in libraries. For instance, books offensive to children should be kept away from the children's selection area. This is entirely reasonable. Nevertheless, when materials are removed because some people find them offensive or disagree with them, it goes too far. This nation was founded on the principle of freedom of belief. So, why should we force others to adopt our beliefs? Just because I find something offensive doesn't mean others will, and that's perfectly acceptable to me. It's their personal opinion, and my beliefs shouldn't prevent them from learning about what they're interested in.  One solution to this problem is to separate potentially offensive materials into a different section of the library and post a sign or notice indicating the content of that section.  In conclusion, I do not believe libraries should be censored. I know I might encounter offensive materials in my local library, but I wouldn't want my personal opinion to influence others' access to that material. People should consider others' perspectives occasionally and not be overly fixated on their own beliefs. The world is full of diverse opinions, and without them, we'd have nothing. Libraries are filled with valuable resources, so the focus should be on what can be gained from them rather than on what one doesn't want to see. If something is offensive, simply avoid it, but don't try to remove it from everyone else.
347	3324	2	2	I think libraries should have censorship because young kids might come across inappropriate materials. Censorship would ensure that kids don't view such content. There are three main reasons for library censorship. First, inappropriate materials can teach kids bad things. Second, they can have a negative influence. Third, there's no real need for kids to be exposed to them.  Regarding the first point, inappropriate materials can teach kids bad things. If kids start looking at such content, they're more likely to get into trouble. There's absolutely no valid reason for them to be exposed to it.  Secondly, these materials can have a bad influence. Kids might show and tell their friends about it, leading them to engage in inappropriate behavior and potentially have a negative future.  Thirdly, there's no real need for kids to look at such materials. Unless, by some rare chance, a book with inappropriate content falls off a bookshelf and lies on the floor, there's no reason for kids to encounter it.  I believe that implementing censorship in libraries would protect kids from harm, allowing everyone to lead a proper life. In conclusion, library censorship is necessary to safeguard the well - being of young children.
348	3325	2	2	I firmly believe that library censorship is unnecessary. The justifications for censorship are highly subjective and biased. Two readers can have completely different interpretations of the same book.  When a reader chooses a book, they are likely aware of the general plot from the back - cover summary before even starting to read. People are capable of making their own decisions about whether to read a book. The books considered inappropriate or offensive are usually found in teen novels or adult literature. In such cases, the readers should be mature enough to handle encountering such content and decide whether to continue reading or put the book back.  It's true that some material may be unsuitable for younger age groups. However, at that age, children should be accompanied by an adult when checking out books. The unacceptable material is almost always in novels intended for a mature audience. If a younger child is reading such a book, that in itself is the problem. Teens and adults reading such materials are surely old enough to handle a few foul words and innuendos in the plot.  The perception of inappropriate or offensive material varies between different audiences. A high - school teen has probably heard worse in the school halls, and an adult worried about their children's reading material has likely been exposed to enough in their lifetime to either overlook it or put the book away. It's not right to label material as offensive based on just one person's view.  Tough situations and our surroundings prepare us for the future. Should we ignore the unpleasant aspects of life? Should a child being beaten at home suffer in silence because the story is too graphic? Should the story of a homeless man who turned his life around not be told because his past troubles are disturbing?  I believe these are the stories that need to be told the most. They teach us how to prevent and overcome life's difficulties. There will always be things we don't want to see in life, but it's our actions after encountering such misfortunes that define us. Libraries should not be censored but should be open to the public who want to explore these stories. Books are written for a purpose, which may be to inform people that these things are happening and to show that they're not alone in their struggles. In conclusion, libraries should remain uncensored to allow people to access these valuable stories.
349	3326	2	2	I think that certain books indeed don't belong on library shelves. Some people may feel the urge to remove books of their choosing, but if the library deems it appropriate to include such books, that's their decision. I believe that if one doesn't like a book, they should simply stay away from it.  If a book is intended only for adult readers, then by all means, it should be removed from general access. I know some parents who won't let their children read a book just because the main characters kiss, as mentioned in the book review. I find this rather ridiculous, but it's their parenting style. As long as they don't try to impose their parenting methods on libraries and other learning institutions because of the books, I'm fine with it.  Some people find books about slavery, the Holocaust, and similar topics offensive. I see these books as part of our history. These topics are taught in schools, and we're likely to learn about them as we grow up. What's the difference between learning about them as children and as adults?  People seem to want to shield the world from swear words. If a book has a few curse words, so what? If parents think it's bad, they should tell their kids to avoid it, but they shouldn't remove the book from the library. People have always had and will always have different views. If a parent strongly opposes certain books, they can take a position, gather signatures to have the books removed or moved to a different section of the library. They shouldn't force their opinions on others.  In conclusion, while there may be a need to manage certain books in libraries, we should respect different views and avoid imposing personal opinions on others. Libraries should strive to balance the diverse needs and views of their patrons.
350	3327	2	2	I'm writing to discuss the issue of offensive materials in libraries. Many adults find certain books inappropriate for kids, and I believe libraries need to take action.  First, there are many books in libraries that are offensive to kids. These materials are often in the adult - reading sections, yet libraries allow kids to access them without proper identification. These books can teach kids bad things and mess with their young minds. Libraries should provide more age - appropriate materials, like educational books for school.  Second, parents should protest to get rid of offensive materials. They can either have offensive books removed from the shelves or make a list of such books and restrict access to adults with proper identification. This way, the valuable books won't be completely removed.  Third, libraries should carefully consider what kids are taking home to read. Adults should monitor their kids' reading choices. Kids need to understand which books are suitable for their age; otherwise, it can cause confusion in their developing minds.  In conclusion, libraries must come up with a solution to prevent children from reading offensive books. These books can have a negative impact on kids' mental health, and parents may even have to pay for therapy to help their children. Libraries should act to relieve parents' concerns about what their kids are reading. For me, I don't want my child to read offensive materials as it may lead them to imitate such behavior. So, I urge libraries to address this issue of offensive content.
351	3328	2	2	In my view, censorship has no place in libraries. People are intelligent enough to decide what they want to read. There are several reasons why censorship should not be permitted in libraries or in public. First, censorship shows disobedience. Second, many individuals may over - use their authority, which will lead to a negative reputation for the library. Third, it will alter the entire atmosphere of a library.  Censorship in libraries is a form of disobedience. I believe that some people may use profanity and adopt a non - caring attitude. If people use inappropriate language at home, they should keep it there and not bring it into public. In my opinion, censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else.  When people over - use their authority in libraries, such as being loud and preventing others from reading, it drives people away. A library should be a quiet and welcoming place, which will make the reading experience more pleasant.  Ultimately, I firmly believe that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or other public places. A library is a place for reading, studying, and completing homework. People should be able to make their own decisions about reading materials related to censorship, as long as they can handle it.
352	3329	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials, like those inappropriate for young children, should be removed from the general library area. These materials should be placed in a separate room where access requires an ID. This is crucial because we don't want young children, like my own son, to stumble upon inappropriate content such as Playboy magazines.  Little kids shouldn't read books with excessive swearing. Such content can have a negative impact on them, getting them in trouble at school and at home.  It's true that adults may be interested in reading about sex and drugs, but we need to consider whether we want our children exposed to the same material. People who manage libraries should be more mindful of what they leave accessible, as kids are always eager to explore new things.  So, whether you're working at a library or just visiting, you should be careful about where you place materials. Otherwise, children will likely come across them. In conclusion, libraries need to take proactive steps to protect young readers from inappropriate content.
353	3330	2	2	"Inevitably, everyone encounters offensive content at some point. The government has attempted to shield youth from such material, believing that parents should be the ones to inform children. However, if children are introduced to these topics at an early age, there's no need to keep them a secret. Libraries and all forms of media should not be subject to censorship.  Kids often ask questions like ""where do babies come from?"" Adults, to avoid awkward conversations, may fabricate stories or withhold the full truth. Imagine a world where the government allows the media to be unrestricted. Initially, it might seem vulgar, but then the government could properly teach about sex and drugs in schools. More children would be educated, reducing their curiosity and the likelihood of engaging in such behaviors.  This doesn't mean that newscasters should curse on television. It simply suggests that the media should report the whole truth instead of hiding half of it. They have the right to freedom of speech, and we have the right to know.  At first, people might think this would create a terrible world. But with proper leadership, it would foster a more truthful environment. Children would learn about sex and drugs in a safe school setting, and drug use and rape rates could decline. Eventually, ""offensive"" topics would no longer be a source of embarrassment for kids. This change would make the world a better place."
354	3331	2	2	The library is a haven of dreams and imagination. For many, it offers an escape from reality into a world where anything is possible. It houses a vast collection of books for all age groups. However, books suitable for one age group may not be appropriate for another, which leads to problems.  Young children are frequent visitors to the library. They often wander around and access various books and magazines. There are many adult - only magazines in libraries. For example, one evening, my mother, brother, and I visited the library. While my mother and I were searching for books, my younger brother browsed the magazine rack. He found a Sports Illustrated magazine with pictures that my mother was not happy for him to see. Library staff should place such revealing materials out of reach of young children.  There are also many books in the library about historical events. While some people find them interesting, others may find them offensive. Certain races have endured painful historical experiences, and they don't want to relive those traumas. The library should consider how different people feel about certain books. When I was in elementary school, I did a unit on slavery and the underground railroad. I went to the library to find research materials and came across a book with horrible acts against black people that I shouldn't have seen at that age.  Personally, I love reading as it helps me escape the real world. But I've encountered books that were inappropriate for me. For instance, I found a book in the young - adult section that described a young girl experiencing rapes and beatings. Although I might appreciate it now, I shouldn't have read it then.  The debate over which books should be in the library is endless. Many think inappropriate books should be removed. In my opinion, if these books are placed where younger audiences can't access them, this ongoing feud could be resolved.
355	3332	2	2	I do not believe that offensive materials should be removed from library shelves. This is just my opinion, but I think it's a pointless task.  Children will encounter offensive material outside of school, such as racism, murders, and inappropriate language in music, movies, magazines, and books. When we come across offensive content outside of school, we usually avoid it and choose something more suitable.  Some movies and books about certain topics may be offensive to some people. But if we remove them from libraries, it will be difficult to find accurate references for essays. The internet may not provide completely correct information, while factual books in the library are reliable.  In conclusion, removing offensive materials from library shelves is a futile effort. Since children can avoid such content outside of school, they can do the same in school. Libraries should keep these materials available for those who need them.
356	3333	2	2	In my view, offensive materials in libraries, including books, movies, music, and magazines, should not be removed from the shelves. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another; it's all a matter of personal opinion. If you come across something offensive, simply don't pick it up. Admittedly, some content can be highly offensive to certain individuals, and they may try to have it removed. However, this is a misguided approach. What might be offensive to you could be crucial for someone studying a particular topic. Removing such materials would disrupt their research. I'm not advocating for violent or offensive materials. I'm just suggesting that if you find something offensive, ignore it. What offends you may not bother others at all. There are numerous books and movies that many people find offensive. If we were to remove all of them, there would be very few subjects and titles left for people to read and watch. In conclusion, I firmly support keeping offensive materials on the shelves. They can be beneficial to many, even though they may offend others. If you're offended by something, just look for another subject or topic. Denying someone the right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong; everyone has their own opinions and rights.
357	3334	2	2	"There are certain books that should not be removed from libraries due to censorship. From my past experiences with censorship, I've learned that it can have a detrimental impact on literature. For example, in the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, the burning of books leads to the breakdown of society. Censorship often stems from people with a more ethnic background who don't want children to be exposed to inappropriate language. The most recent book I've heard of being censored is @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The main word being removed from this book is ""nigar"" because some people find it extremely offensive to their race. Committees are trying to remove the book from school shelves. I believe we should not have censorship. Just because parents don't want their kids to hear certain words in school or read them, it doesn't mean these materials should be removed. Eventually, kids will learn these words on their own, whether from their parents or on TV. Personally, I think committees should stop trying to censor everything because they can't control how adults talk around children and young adults. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is an over - reaching measure that can have negative consequences. We should respect the diversity of literature and allow individuals to make their own choices about what to read."
358	3335	2	2	I wholeheartedly agree with the idea presented by well - known author Katherine Paterson. She says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf left for any of us.' If everyone has the power to remove books they find inappropriate, there will soon be nothing left to read. While it's good for parents to voice their opinions and stand up for what they believe in, books should not be banned. People have diverse views on what is right and wrong. Some may think a certain book is obscene, while others may be offended by a different one. If every parent could get a book banned, there would come a time when no book meets their approval. Many of these potentially controversial books offer great learning opportunities for students. They encourage students to think in new and different ways, allowing them to learn from alternative perspectives. Students can also reflect on their own morals and values through these books, which is a positive thing. When a teacher selects a book they deem appropriate, parents should respect that decision. They can suggest other readings or offer ideas, but getting the book completely removed is unjust. On the other hand, the situation with movies can be different. My parents would be appalled to see grotesque and inappropriate movies on display for everyone to see. The difference between books and movies is straightforward: books usually don't have inappropriate covers, while bad movies often do. This means that even those who don't want to watch the movie are forced to see disturbing images. When walking past a book one doesn't intend to read, there's no need to be appalled by its cover. In conclusion, although parents are concerned about what their children read, books should not be banned. Books are a unique medium that allows for deep thought, observation, and the formation of opinions. They are essential for growth, learning, and discovery.
359	3336	2	2	Censorship in libraries is a topic that requires careful consideration. In my opinion, materials in libraries that some people find offensive should not be removed. Just because a few individuals are offended by certain content doesn't mean that everyone shares the same view. There are people who actually appreciate the content that others find offensive. The library is meant to be a place with a wide variety of books. If we were to remove a book every time someone found it offensive, there would soon be no library left. A library should not focus on just one genre that appeals to a single person; it should offer a diverse range of reading materials. Providing a wide variety of content is crucial. If a library lacks variety, it will lose customers from different demographics. A library aims to attract people of all ages and interests, even if it means including some content that some may consider inappropriate. In fact, any book can seem inappropriate if viewed from the wrong perspective. In conclusion, offensive materials in libraries should remain on the shelves. Everyone has their own point of view, and a library should respect this diversity. By maintaining a wide range of books, libraries can serve the needs of all their patrons.
360	3337	2	2	Have you ever been in a library, seen a book that seemed interesting, but then thought it was inappropriate for younger people after reading it? I have, but unlike some, I don't blame the library. I take responsibility for my choice of picking up the book. Some people don't want to take responsibility for their actions and instead blame the library for having certain authors' books, bands' songs, or magazine articles. This leads me to believe that books, music, magazines, and newspapers in libraries should not be removed from the shelves. Just because some people don't like the content doesn't mean it can't be useful or entertaining to others. The availability of these materials should be a matter of personal choice, similar to choosing what to wear in the morning. There are countless options when it comes to books, movies, music, and magazines. If something seems inappropriate, simply return it and choose something else. I can recall an incident from when I was @NUM1 years old. My mother took me to the library, and I found a book called 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.' I showed it to her as I always did. But this time, she didn't want me to check it out. She thought it was too harsh for me at that age and wanted me to wait until I was older. The book was about @CAPS1 abuse, and she considered it inappropriate for my age. However, she didn't blame the library for having the book. I also found that other parents have a similar attitude. My best friend's parents had a similar situation with her. Instead of a book, it was a music CD. They thought the lyrics were too 'sad' for her to hear and agreed she could borrow it when she was a bit older. They didn't blame the library; they recognized that it was a personal choice for others to listen to the CD or let their children listen to it. In conclusion, libraries should not have censorship. They can have different sections for adults, children, and young adults. But they shouldn't remove books, music, magazines, etc., just because of a few people's preferences. It should be an individual's personal choice, and people should take responsibility for their selections rather than blaming others.
361	3338	2	2	I find censorship laws acceptable to some extent. However, the government should not ban all content it deems inappropriate. Instead, family values should play a more significant role in determining what is suitable. There should be no completely off - limits areas in libraries for younger children. Viewers should obtain family consent to access certain content. If the content doesn't align with their interests, they can simply avoid it. Libraries have the right to decide whether to hold books, music, movies, and magazines. If they choose to keep them, they can set limits and ratings. Adults should not complain about inappropriate material; if they don't like it, they aren't obligated to view it. The government should not tolerate parents' complaints about content. One parent shouldn't be able to deprive others of access to books due to personal views. Just because someone dislikes the content doesn't mean others can't enjoy it. If a library has age - restricted materials, appropriate discipline should be taken for underage viewers. But if a viewer has an adult family member's consent, they should be able to access the material regardless of ratings. In conclusion, a balanced approach that respects both family values and individual freedoms is crucial in dealing with library content.
362	3339	2	2	The world is full of a vast array of books, magazines, music, and movies. Some are funny, sad, strange, or scary, while others may be controversial, leading some to question their presence in libraries. I firmly believe that everyone's voice should be heard. If we start suppressing voices we dislike, we'll lose a great deal of diverse perspectives. We all have our own opinions, and while some people are more opinionated on certain matters, we all hold strong feelings about something. Many people want to share their feelings with those who understand and agree. If we take away this opportunity, it will be difficult for people to connect. Some content may seem offensive to some, but who has the right to decide what shouldn't be shared? I've noticed that shared interests in music, books, or movies bring people together. At concerts, everyone connects because they're there for the same reason. As Katherine Paterson said, if we all remove books we dislike from the library shelves, there will be nothing left to read. There is a wide variety of materials waiting to be discovered, and each person has their own preferences. Censorship is not a good idea as these materials keep people connected. It gives a voice not only to the creators but also to those who agree with the content. In conclusion, we should embrace the diversity of library materials and refrain from censorship.
363	3340	2	2	Libraries offer a wide variety of books, movies, and music. People often find something they like when they visit. The question is whether we should remove offensive materials from library shelves. From experience, there are indeed things in libraries that younger children and teenagers shouldn't access. Most libraries have age - appropriate sections, and people should choose materials according to their age. Younger teens and children are naturally curious. They may pick up materials not suitable for their age, especially if they see their parents or guardians accessing such content. Children look up to their parents or guardians and tend to imitate them. So, parents and guardians should set good examples and be cautious about their own choices. There are many reasons why people may find certain things offensive, but we are also the ones who bring these materials into libraries. Children are growing up faster, and we can't always stop them. Instead, we should set good examples to prevent them from accessing inappropriate materials. Libraries can be a fun and educational environment for everyone. In conclusion, by setting good examples and being mindful of our own actions, we can ensure that libraries remain a positive place for all.
364	3341	2	2	Libraries should have the freedom to stock whatever materials they choose. Everyone has different opinions. If you don't like what's on the library shelves, you can either stop going or pick something you do like. We can't start removing offensive materials just because they offend someone. The only valid reason to remove books or magazines is when the facts are incorrect. Libraries are a valuable source of information, holding materials, books, music, movies, and magazines for factual purposes. Removing offensive materials could deprive teenagers of resources for their papers. Since no one in the world agrees on everything, removing offensive materials would only lead to conflicts. Libraries are open to anyone who wants to read about various topics. Similarly, we can't remove music just because it's considered offensive. Everyone has their own preferences. We can't completely control children; they will grow up and make their own choices. If we try to keep them from certain books, they may end up reading them anyway. While keeping kids safe is important, removing offensive materials from libraries won't guarantee their safety. We should only be concerned about removing materials when the facts are wrong. In conclusion, libraries should maintain their diverse collections to serve the needs of all users.
365	3342	2	2	Libraries are a great source of knowledge, entertainment, and tranquility. You can go there to learn, do research, or just relax. However, some people find certain library materials offensive and question whether they should be removed. In my opinion, we shouldn't discard books, magazines, movies, or music just because they contain a few vulgar words or images. Just because one person finds something offensive doesn't mean everyone will. People have different views on various topics. For example, history books may contain harsh facts that can offend some, and different people have different reactions to movies based on language or plot events. Also, what is offensive to one person can make something more interesting to another. Many movies and books that are considered offensive actually pique the curiosity of others. So, we shouldn't remove offensive materials from libraries. If we do, libraries will become empty, younger people will lose interest, and we'll miss out on historical artifacts and stories. Libraries should keep offensive materials in a separate area away from younger users and, if possible, label them to inform readers. In conclusion, a balanced approach that respects diverse views and preserves the library's collection is the best way forward.
366	3343	2	2	"Katherine Paterson once remarked, ""All of us can envision a book we hope no child will pick up from the shelf. However, if I possess the right to remove the book I detest, then everyone else has the same right, and eventually, no books will remain on the shelves for anyone."" I firmly hold the view that books and other items should remain in library shelves, and library censorship is unnecessary. As Paterson pointed out, if every book deemed offensive by someone is removed, there will be no books left. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. Children, teenagers, and adults have the right to choose what they read, watch, or listen to. In the case of children and young teens, parents should have a say in their media consumption. For instance, in my family, I'm not allowed to listen to music with curse words or watch rated [CAPS2] movies. But this doesn't mean such media should be removed from library shelves. Every family has different beliefs, and what my family deems inappropriate may not be so for others. Each person has the right to make their own choices. If someone finds a book offensive, they can simply not read it. Parents should set rules for their children regarding offensive content. As long as children are aware of their parents' rules and values, there's no need for library censorship. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is unjustified. Everyone has the right to make their own decisions, and parents can monitor their children's media intake. Just as Paterson said, if we all remove the items we find offensive, there will be nothing left on the shelves."
367	3344	2	2	Offensive media pervades our daily lives, from books to music lyrics. Exposure to inappropriate media can have detrimental effects on both children and adults. Children are particularly vulnerable as they tend to imitate what they see. For example, if they hear swear words on TV or witness drug - related content, they may mimic such behavior. Prolonged exposure to inappropriate media can corrupt a child's social skills and mindset, leading them to believe that such behavior is acceptable in everyday life. Libraries should remove inappropriate media as it can have a negative impact on a child's development. Adults are also affected by offensive media. They may pick up offensive habits such as swearing or even develop violent tendencies if they are exposed to violent or inappropriate content for an extended period. For instance, seeing killing in a movie may make an adult think it's acceptable, which can lead to dangerous and harmful behavior. Our country's libraries should take action to remove such content to safeguard adults' emotional well - being. Moreover, the world would be a better place without offensive media. Media often influences people's behavior. If a person sees their favorite celebrity engaging in illegal activities like [CAPS1] in a magazine, they may think it's okay to drink and drive or experiment with drugs. This can lead to actions that are harmful to themselves and others. In conclusion, offensive media should be removed from library shelves. It has the potential to corrupt children's minds, make adults emotionally unhealthy, and contribute to negative behavior in society. By removing inappropriate media, we can create a safer and more positive environment for everyone.
368	3345	2	2	"Every individual is endowed with rights and has an equal opportunity to express their feelings, thoughts, and beliefs. Freedom is an inalienable and precious asset that no one can take away. It is a fundamental part of our being. As human beings, it is often challenging to understand and accept the opinions of others. A library is a repository of diverse materials that can answer a wide range of our questions. Some of these materials may be offensive to certain individuals, while others can be extremely helpful. If I had the power to remove any magazine, book, or movie from the library shelves, I would carefully consider its value to those who might genuinely need it. If everyone had the same right, the library would be left empty. Music is a highly debated topic. Some people are accustomed to listening to music that others may label as ""rude,"" which can be offensive to children. However, it is unfair to judge people based on their musical preferences, the books they read, or the movies they watch. We must recognize that no one is superior to others and respect the feelings of others. This is a value that we need to actively cultivate. In conclusion, we should respect the rights of individuals to access different materials and respect each other's choices, as freedom and respect are the cornerstones of a harmonious society."
369	3346	2	2	The question of whether offensive books, magazines, or movies should be removed from the shelves is a complex one. In my opinion, these items should remain on the shelves even if they are considered offensive by some. What is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another, as everyone has their own perspective on what is appropriate. I believe that the authors of books and magazines usually do not intend for their works to be offensive. They write according to their vision of the story, and it's unfortunate that some people take offense. However, there's no need for argument because it's likely that the author did not have malicious intent. In conclusion, books, magazines, and movies should stay on the shelves. The diversity of opinions means that what one person dislikes may be valuable to another, and we should respect the author's creative freedom and the readers' right to choose.
370	3347	2	2	"Censorship is an increasingly pressing issue in today's world. Many people believe that certain materials are unsuitable, but what is unsuitable for some may not be so for others. I firmly believe that individuals have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want, as long as it does not violate the law. I am conflicted on this topic. On one hand, I oppose censorship; on the other hand, I support it when laws are being broken. People should have the right to read whatever they choose. Although some may read incriminating books, it's unfair to punish everyone for the mistakes of a few. Terrorist and illegal groups usually do not target the general public. However, when materials pose a threat to [LOCATION1], they should be removed. The constitution of [LOCATION1] guarantees the freedom of [CAPS1], which means we have the right to print and read what we wish. Nevertheless, sometimes there are books, articles, movies, or songs that cross the line. Some people misuse materials to gain fame or influence. I think that people should create content for the love of it, not to spread bad ideas. The government has the power to control our access to materials, but is this fair? While I understand their concerns, the presence of offensive content does not necessarily mean it should be removed from society. People who want to experience such content should be able to do so without fear of it disappearing. Those who disagree with the so - called ""offensive"" matter can simply avoid it. In conclusion, I do not believe the government has the right to dictate what we can and cannot read. People should be free to make their own choices as long as they are not breaking the law. The freedom of [CAPS1] is a fundamental right, and we should be able to enjoy it without unnecessary restrictions."
371	3348	2	2	Have you ever encountered books, movies, music, and magazines related to drugs, sexuality, and violence? In my opinion, such materials should be removed from library shelves. There are multiple reasons for this view. Firstly, young children may access these items and learn inappropriate behaviors. Secondly, a library is not the place for parents and children to read, watch, or listen to content involving drugs, sexuality, and violence. Thirdly, these materials should be placed in a separate building, away from children and accessible only to specific individuals. Lastly, from personal experience, I once found a book about drugs that was highly inappropriate for children, with pictures of drugs and their effects on the body. In conclusion, I hope that readers will recognize the negative impact of these books, movies, music, and magazines on those who consume them.
372	3349	2	2	Currently, there are numerous books in libraries that some people find offensive to young readers. I firmly believe that these materials should not be removed from the shelves as people have the right to choose what they read. There are several reasons to support this stance. Firstly, a large number of books could be considered 'offensive'. If we were to remove all such books, we would essentially be removing half of the library's collection. Most young - adult books deal with topics like teens, drugs, and violence, which are often read by teenagers for entertainment purposes, and reading these books does not necessarily affect their actions. Secondly, individuals have the right to choose what they read, listen to, and watch. Everyone has different opinions and tastes. Finally, censoring library shelves would be a mistake. Many great books or movies might be removed, and children would miss out on wonderful stories. While it's understandable that parents want to protect their children, censoring library materials would make it difficult for others to find suitable books. Libraries should offer diverse materials to cater to different tastes.
373	3350	2	2	I don't think these materials should be removed from the shelves. Everyone has the right to read them at some point, as long as young children are restricted from renting them. If people complain about the content being vulgar or sexual, removing the materials is not the solution. An adult section could be a better alternative. Different people have different views on this topic. Some parents don't want their children exposed to certain lifestyles, but not everyone shares the same concerns. Moreover, some parents may not know what their children like to read. If parents have the final say on what is removed from the shelves, it could affect their children's reading habits. For example, if a child wants to read a horror book and parents remove such books, the child may lose interest in reading. In my view, as long as the materials are appropriate, parents should not control what we read. The decision on which books should be removed should be left to the government.
374	3351	2	2	In the matter of censorship, I believe that only a very small number of things should be removed. Just because some people find a material offensive does not mean it is offensive to everyone. A material should be removed only if it offends an overwhelming majority of people. If you find something offensive, you can simply ignore it instead of buying it, as there may be others who find it interesting and useful. When it comes to books, music, movies, or magazines, almost anything should be allowed, except for materials depicting nudity, drugs, and alcohol. A little cursing and some violence are acceptable, but excessive content should be kept away from young children. Exposure to such inappropriate material at a young age can lead children to believe that such behavior is normal. Many parents think certain materials should be banned to protect their children's morals. However, I believe that good parents should take responsibility. If they don't want their children to be exposed to something, they should take action, like blocking a TV show. Some people think any material with negative content should be removed, but in a free society, people should have the freedom of speech and the right to be creative without being criticized.
375	3352	2	2	Children should not be exposed to inappropriate materials. Books, music, movies, and magazines with bad content should be removed from the shelves. Children should be reading materials that contain useful information relevant to their studies. Some music has bad language, and children should not listen to it. Movies with inappropriate scenes and magazines with inappropriate pictures are not suitable for children. Parents should take action to prevent their children from accessing such materials. For example, if they don't want their children to watch a certain movie, they should ensure it doesn't happen. In conclusion, it is crucial to protect children from inappropriate content in various media to ensure their healthy development.
376	3353	2	2	In my view, censorship in libraries is necessary to a certain extent. Some books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive. If left available, young children or teens might access them and encounter inappropriate content. For instance, a child might ask a caregiver about a disturbing picture, and the caregiver may not know how to respond. Parents and caregivers may not always be ready or willing to explain such things immediately. People learn at different rates, and some knowledge should be imparted at a young age, like how to brush teeth, while other topics, such as having babies or drinking, are better left until later. Parents don't want to have to explain complex topics like reproduction to a five - year - old. Libraries are public places that should be safe for all ages, including young children and adults. Public schools also have libraries, and it's not desirable for children to read offensive books. Offensive content isn't limited to books; it can also involve religious materials. Everyone has opinions about different religions, and a child from one religious background might pick up a book about another religion and ask questions. Young kids and teens can find inappropriate things at certain ages, but we can reduce this by implementing library censorship. In the past, parents didn't want to take their children to the library and face awkward questions because of offensive materials. Since this approach has worked for many years, there's no need to change it now.
377	3354	2	2	I firmly believe that it shouldn't matter what books are in a library. If a book is offensive to you, simply choose not to read it. When reading a book with opinions about a particular race or religion, it's best to keep your own opinions to yourself. Many people make a big deal out of certain things just to gain attention. If libraries were organized into sections based on topics, it would be extremely helpful. It would not only make it quicker for people to get the books they need but also free up space for others. Personally, I haven't seen a [@CAPS1] in a school library, probably because I didn't spend much time looking for it. And if it's not there, it's likely because someone complained about it. Religious people should have the right to read what they want. There are all sorts of strange books in libraries, and many people look at them just for fun. I can't understand why some people have so many issues with certain things. As I've said before, if you don't like it, don't read it. In conclusion, libraries should offer a wide range of materials, and individuals should have the freedom to choose what they engage with.
378	3355	2	2	I don't think any of the materials found in a library are offensive. Even if children don't find offensive materials in libraries, they can easily find them elsewhere. These offensive materials are accessible to everyone, including children. Books are not offensive when they are in the adult section. Children won't read them because they are usually long and lack pictures. Music can be offensive, but it's typically in the adult section. Kids at that age aren't interested in such music, so they won't bother with it. Movies and magazines can contain offensive content and can be found anywhere, but it's rare to find them in libraries. The only potentially offensive item in a library is likely to be a magazine, as there are many different types, and they can be found everywhere. To distinguish between offensive and non - offensive books, let's take “[@CAPS1 @CAPS2]” as an example. The [@CAPS3] book contains a lot of bad words, sexual scenes, drug references, gang violence, and racism. It's so offensive that parents wouldn't let their children read it. However, it's based on a true story. Everything in the book actually happened, and people need to know what took place and why the characters in the story behaved the way they did. Some books may seem offensive, but they can teach us from others' mistakes. Everything can seem offensive from one perspective, but from another, it can be a learning experience. People who made those mistakes can tell children that those actions aren't worth it. Everything has its purpose. Books can tell the story of people's lives, movies are based on those stories, and music can express people's lives through poetry. Magazines, on the other hand, are mainly for gossip. In conclusion, offensive materials in libraries can have educational value and should be evaluated from multiple perspectives.
379	3356	2	2	The question of whether library censorship is really necessary is a complex one. In my opinion, it is necessary, but only to a certain degree. Most regular library - goers can distinguish between materials intended for adults and those for teenagers and children. Censorship helps prevent our youth from adopting inappropriate words and actions from the materials they encounter and integrating them into their daily lives. If we don't want them to read or hear certain content, then censorship can be a beneficial measure. If some forms of censorship were to be removed, I would propose an alternative method that is more favorable to adults while still maintaining a form of control. When people check out books, movies, magazines, etc., we could use a rating system similar to that of movies. For example, when a [@NUM1] - year - old child comes to the library to check out an item, they would bring it to the librarian. The librarian would then check the rating of the item and the age of the child using their library card to determine if the item is appropriate. There could be several ratings, such as [@CAPS1], [@CAPS2], [@NUM2], and [@CAPS3]. I believe that ages [@NUM3] are suitable for [@CAPS1] - [@CAPS2] rated materials, ages [@NUM4] for [@NUM2] rated materials, and ages [@NUM6] and above for [@CAPS3] rated materials. I often observe children learning inappropriate words, phrases, and actions from movies and books, which makes them think such behavior is acceptable. I think this is wrong. I believe that this proposed rating system could assist our youth and their parents in making better choices about the content they engage with. So, if you think this is a good idea, contact your local library and express your support for the “[@CAPS7, @CAPS7 @CAPS8]” system. Don't delay; call now.
380	3357	2	2	Books, movies, music, and even [@CAPS1] play important roles in our lives and environment. They all offer learning opportunities. Reading, watching movies, and listening to music can all expand our knowledge, whether it's about the past, present, or future. As citizens, we have the right to learn. I firmly believe that just because a single book or movie makes someone uncomfortable, it shouldn't be removed. Doing so not only deprives you and your children but also everyone else. Take the book “Huckleberry Finn” as an example. It's a wonderful book that depicts a time when slavery was still prevalent, yet there were also kind - hearted people. However, this book is offensive to some because it contains the word “nigger” 127 times. Last year at my school, a mother tried to have it removed because she didn't want her mixed - race son to read it. Fortunately, the committee preserved it, and it's still available. This is our history, and everyone needs to learn it, regardless of whether it's offensive. Similarly, offensive movies should not be removed. As I've said before, removing them deprives others of the opportunity to learn. If you don't want to watch a movie, simply don't buy it or change the channel when inappropriate content comes on. History is important, and people shouldn't be deprived of their right as citizens to learn what they want or need for the future. Regarding music, I can understand that some may be inappropriate for younger listeners. In such cases, change the station or don't buy the [@CAPS2]. We shouldn't deprive people of what they want to learn, watch, or listen to. People who feel offended or embarrassed should be ashamed because it's selfish and rude. No one should be ashamed of themselves or of movies that accurately depict the past. If history is sugar - coated, it becomes a lie. That's why I don't believe in censorship. All books, movies, magazines, and [@CAPS2] should be available to those who want them.
381	3358	2	2	"Libraries are commonly regarded as repositories of knowledge and information. While many people appreciate libraries, others may have an aversion to the very mention of the word ""@CAPS1"". In truth, in my experience, only a few individuals currently utilize libraries as an information source. The question of whether library - sourced information can be offensive is subjective. In my view, some information found in local @CAPS1 can be rather disturbing. There are books and materials that one wishes they had never encountered, but this is a common occurrence everywhere.  Music, movies, and similar media follow a similar pattern. One person may not agree with the content they select or that others might be interested in. Undoubtedly, such content can be offensive, but people have diverse opinions. You may disagree with something, while your friend has a completely different view. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. However, if graphic movies or explicit music are easily accessible to young children, it becomes a significant issue.  Some parents do not want their children exposed to such content at a young age, although in today's America, children are likely to encounter such things eventually. If a five - year - old can easily access a graphic movie or an unwanted CD, I don't think the items should be banned from the @CAPS1. Instead, they should be relocated to a place less accessible to young children. These are common arguments regarding various places and similar disagreements.  In conclusion, while some content in a @CAPS1 may be offensive to some, I believe it should not be removed unless it is extremely offensive. If multiple people in the community find something offensive, it should be brought to the attention of the local @CAPS1 authorities."
382	3359	2	2	I firmly believe that if you feel that certain books, magazines, music, or movies are saying bad things, you should refrain from engaging with them. If the content offends you, simply avoid it because what one person finds offensive, another may not. Encountering offensive content is a part of life, so there's no need to take extreme measures now.  Consider the situation with TV shows. There are many offensive shows on the air, yet they are not removed. So, why should books, music, movies, and magazines be taken off the shelves? I strongly oppose such actions. If I don't like something, I choose not to look at it, and I don't get angry about others' views on my beliefs.  People have different musical tastes. You may not like the same music as someone else, but that doesn't mean we should remove it from the shelves. Instead, we should stop paying attention to what others say about our beliefs.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that there is no need to remove books, magazines, music, or movies just because some people find them offensive. Everyone should respect different opinions and make their own choices about what to consume.
383	3360	2	2	Libraries should not remove books, movies, and magazines from their shelves simply because some children might be offended. If town and school libraries were to eliminate the popular movies, magazines, and books that most children enjoy, those children would likely stop visiting the library.  For instance, I enjoy hard rock, heavy metal, and rap music, while church - goers prefer church music. If you're with a friend who invites you to church and you're listening to rap music in the parking lot, some people may not like it. However, this doesn't justify removing the things that some people don't like from the shelves to please them.  Libraries should implement a policy where, when a child checks out a book, magazine, or rents a movie, their parents must sign and return a permission slip indicating that their child has permission to access the item. There should also be an age limit for checking out books and magazines. For movie rentals, a signed permission slip from parents should be required, and this slip can be used for all movie rentals.  In conclusion, libraries should not remove their books, magazines, or movies. Instead, they should establish policies that allow older children to access these materials. Library material should be a matter of choice.
384	3361	2	2	Some individuals may think that certain books, movies, magazines, or music should be removed from libraries because they can be considered offensive. However, I firmly believe that libraries should not get rid of so - called 'offensive' material.  The concept of what is offensive is highly subjective. For example, if someone tells me I've lost weight, I might find it offensive, even though the person may not have intended it that way. Another person could view it as a compliment. Defining something as offensive is merely stating one's opinion. Since everyone is entitled to their own opinions and equality is important, one person's definition of offensive should not be given more weight than another's. Removing 'offensive' material from libraries would mean elevating one person's view over others'.  Moreover, removing 'offensive' material would likely result in the loss of a great deal of interesting content. Take my religious beliefs as an example. I am @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and do not believe in '@CAPS3'. A book about my religion would interest me, but some @CAPS4 might find it offensive. If a library removed the book due to someone's offense, I would be less likely to visit. When I go to a library, I hope to find books I'll enjoy. If all offensive - labeled material is removed, there may not be much left that I or others would find interesting.  Additionally, removing a book because it's considered offensive would offend the author. Authors put time and effort into writing, and everyone has the right to express their opinions. By removing their books, we would be going against the very idea of respecting different views.  In conclusion, I maintain that nothing can be truly defined as offensive in an absolute sense. People should be free to express their thoughts, and libraries should not attempt to remove 'offensive' material from their shelves.
385	3362	2	2	Dear @CAPS1,  Have you ever noticed offensive books on library shelves? Have you considered whether you'd want your children exposed to such content? These are important questions when it comes to the materials in libraries.  As a concerned citizen, I'm writing to share my view on censorship in libraries. In my experience, I've come across offensive magazines, books, and music in libraries, and I believe they have no place there. However, I understand that some people still want access to these materials. So, my suggestion is to create a separate room for offensive materials. This way, we can keep them away from young children.  When I have children in the future, I envision libraries as kid - friendly places. To achieve this, we need to find a proper place for offensive materials or eliminate them altogether. Libraries should be accessible to everyone, whether it's a college student preparing for a test, a young child exploring @PERSON1, or an elderly person seeking peace and quiet. Offensive materials are a distraction and not needed in a library.  Libraries are places for learning and exploration. For young children, they are like fairytale lands where anything is possible. If there are materials that parents don't want their children to see, they won't feel comfortable bringing their kids to the library. Libraries must be suitable for all ages to enjoy.  In conclusion, offensive materials should not be in libraries. All ages should be able to enjoy what libraries offer. I hope you will consider these points.  Kind regards, @PERSON2
386	3363	2	2	The bookshelves should be removed as all students desire the library to have a wide range of books, such as Spanish books or those representing different cultures. With these books, students can learn different languages and engage in various activities. For instance, they can read extensively and re - phrase the content of the books. Additionally, music and movies should be removed as some DVDs contain inappropriate content. Worldwide, libraries often need to meet the borrowing demands of many people, and the public wishes for libraries to be free, allowing them to borrow books at no cost. There are differing views on library expansion across the world; some consider it a great idea, while others oppose it, arguing that libraries may not adequately manage the borrowing of books, DVDs, magazines, etc. Therefore, libraries should inform the public about their borrowing policies. In my opinion, libraries should interact with the public, showcase their collections, and offer borrowing services for books and DVDs as per people's requests. Sometimes, libraries can rent out interesting DVDs that are hard to find elsewhere, like new movies. If the library doesn't have a particular DVD, people can inform the bookshelf staff and suggest alternative sources. Encouraging more reading is a wonderful idea. Moreover, libraries should enhance their appeal to excite people and motivate them to borrow and read books.
387	3364	2	2	Censorship holds significant importance, especially when it comes to the books, magazines, movies, and music that the vast majority of people consume. In libraries around the world, some media can be extremely offensive to certain individuals or convey inappropriate messages to children and teenagers. This leads to the question: should such media be removed from library shelves? Personally, I believe the answer is no. Although a large portion of the media on library shelves can be offensive, much of this perception is based on personal opinions. It's the readers who claim that the books and other media in libraries are offensive. Authors, directors, and singers create their works, and the judgments and opinions come from the public, fans, and critics. We shouldn't remove all offensive media from library shelves just because it offends some people. This aligns with Katherine Paterson's quote: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Given the diverse opinions of individuals, if we censor everything, there will be nothing left. Currently, efforts are being made in censorship, such as rating video games and movies. Rated - adult movies and video games are clearly marked for adult audiences. Radio music is also censored to remove foul language. This gives people the choice to consume media while being aware that it might offend them. Even though some might feel that the current level of censorship is insufficient, removing all media from shelves to avoid offending everyone is not a practical solution. Doing so could anger others and deprive them of the content they want to read or watch. Censorship can be beneficial without completely removing all media from library shelves and the world.
388	3365	2	2	I'm aware that, like everyone else, the library offers a vast array of reading materials. It houses everything from children's books, love stories, and magazines to newspapers, movies, and music. While libraries are open to all, the question arises: should everyone have unrestricted access to all the materials? In my view, it's a good idea to keep such a diverse collection in libraries, even if some of it is inappropriate. For those who don't have access to a library at home and need specific information, the library can be their first choice. Although we can't control what people find in the library, I believe it's beneficial to maintain such a collection in a public space. Sure, the internet can provide information, but what if the information you need isn't available online? I, for one, prefer books to the internet. On the internet, anyone can post information, but in books, the content is more reliable as it has to be published and reviewed to ensure it doesn't contain false information. If librarians are concerned about under - age children accessing inappropriate books, they can place adult books in a separate adult section and restrict children from entering. They can also store these books in high places so that children are unaware of their existence. In all the libraries I've visited, there were distinct sections for adults and children. If parents are worried about what their children might find, they can keep their children at home and create a personal library with carefully selected books and magazines.
389	3366	2	2	Should we remove certain materials from library shelves just because they contain uncensored content? My answer is a resounding no! Now, I'm not someone who always prefers reading such materials, but occasionally, there are really good uncensored books or magazines that I'd like to read. The problem is that I'm often told I can't, simply because the content might be considered inappropriate for teenagers. One of my main questions is why statues from ancient Roman times are allowed in history books, even though they often depict naked figures, while other contemporary materials are restricted. We live in an era where people are more open - minded, and such content doesn't always bother them. Admittedly, some materials may not be suitable for teenagers, but I hear offensive language in the hallways of my high school on a daily basis. Some people might find certain materials offensive, but if it bothers them so much, why do they keep complaining? Everyone has the right to their opinion, but that doesn't mean their opinion is always correct. Different people have different views, and we can't know whose opinion is truly right. As teenagers, we're learning to make our own decisions because we'll soon be adults and have to make choices independently. So, we should be allowed to decide whether we want to read uncensored materials. It's our choice, and we should be able to make it without others dictating what we can and can't read. I still can't understand why allowing uncensored materials in libraries is such a big deal. We should be given the freedom to make our own decisions as we're learning to be more mature.
390	3367	2	2	The censorship of certain media is a highly controversial topic. Whether a piece of media is considered offensive and should be censored is often a matter of personal opinion rather than logical opposition. It's difficult for most people to empathize with different viewpoints, be persuaded by alternative perspectives, or resist public pressure. There are numerous reasons for censorship. Sometimes, the content is so intentionally offensive that the author or producer might even want it to be censored or welcome the resulting controversy. Other times, a new view or opinion is so radical that it goes against the majority and is thus considered offensive. The question then arises: when does someone have the right to remove a song from the airwaves or permanently take a book off the library shelf? The first consideration is whether something is truly offensive. There are extreme cases in media where one might wonder, 'What were they thinking when they created this?' For example, a movie with excessive graphic violence or a book with overly explicit descriptions. However, what one person might consider unnecessary gore in a film could be exactly what another person is excited to see at the cinema; it's all a matter of opinion. Another interesting aspect is that someone might develop a revolutionary scientific theory and present it in a book or documentary, but certain groups could find it offensive. Yet, upon personal investigation, others might not be offended at all. This is understandable as people grow up in environments with their own sets of ethics and principles, which they tend to uphold throughout their lives. If a piece of media goes against someone's deeply - held beliefs, it will naturally be offensive to them. But does this mean it should be censored just because it offends a few groups? The decision to restrict public access to a piece of media depends on the general public's opinion, which is shaped by the current time, trends, ethics, and existing problems. When something goes against too many of these factors, people get upset. If a large number of people are offended, the media will likely start disappearing from public view. This is bad for business, especially for libraries, which are already losing customers as people are less inclined to read due to the many alternative activities available. Some content can leave a bad impression, and if library - goers encounter such content frequently, they may stop visiting. In conclusion, censorship in libraries, or anywhere else, boils down to public opinion. While censorship has its place, we need to be cautious not to let it eliminate all diverse and potentially valuable media.
391	3368	2	2	It's truly astonishing that certain books, music, movies, and magazines available in libraries today are inappropriate for children. In my view, if there's any doubt about whether a child should access a particular item, it has no place in or around the children's section. Some content can be offensive not only to children but also to teenagers and adults.  Certain music may contain words that children should not be exposed to. Genres like hip - hop and rap often include degrading comments about men and/or women. I would never want my child to listen to such music or read books that discuss it. Moreover, music can be offensive to cultures, religions, sexual orientations, and races. Books or music with such content should have notes indicating what they contain.  I once picked up a book called '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2' in the children's section. After reading the first chapter, I wondered how anyone could classify it as a children's book. The character used profanity and talked about sex throughout. A child looking for a book about pie shouldn't end up with something completely off - topic.  Another time, I was watching a movie from the library with my two - year - old. The movie was full of inappropriate words, so I had to turn it off. Such movies should not be on the library shelves for children to access. Now, I have to be extremely cautious about what we borrow.  Magazines are also a concern. Some contain inappropriate pictures and words. They would be better suited for grocery stores rather than the library I take my child to.  Books, music, movies, and magazines that are meant for adult viewing should stay in the adult section. Any parent would agree that some of the items on local library shelves today are unacceptable. Offensive content has no place in the library. I've learned to keep a closer eye on what my child reads.
392	3369	2	2	All kids have their own preferences when it comes to books. @CAPS1 people may like scary, funny, or romance books. But can we really take offense to this? We need to consider how removing @CAPS1 books from the shelves would impact multiple people. @CAPS1 people might be mature enough to read more 'grown - up' books or magazines. Libraries offer a wide variety of styles for different individuals; you just might need to search a bit harder to find the right book for you.  I don't believe that @CAPS1 books and magazines are offensive. Libraries vary in the types of books they carry. For example, an elementary school library won't have adult or teenage books, and a middle - school library won't have books for little kids.  We also need to think about whether peer pressure affects what books or magazines kids read. When I was in middle school, my friends were all reading romance books, while I was still into @ORGANIZATION1. To fit in, I changed my reading style.  Books with offensive content shouldn't be removed from the shelves. If there are 'offensive' books in the library, you can simply ignore them. We can't remove more grown - up books just because @CAPS1 kids may not know what they should be reading. Libraries have diverse book styles to suit everyone's taste. So, look for the book that suits you and don't judge a book by its cover.
393	3370	2	2	@PERSON1 once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  Books are a wonderful escape from daily life. They can transport us anywhere at any time. Imagining a world where books are a luxury or non - existent is truly disheartening. I believe this could become a reality if we censor books.  Where would we draw the line to determine that a book is unfit to be read or circulated? Censorship would hinder the world's progress as it would limit our ability to express ourselves through writing. So much would remain unsaid.  I think the quote by @PERSON1 is very true. If we censor one book, everyone has the right to ban others. Just because certain books, movies, and magazines are offensive to some doesn't mean they should be banned for all. No one should be denied access to a book due to age, race, gender, or any other factor.  I've experienced the unpleasant feeling of being restricted due to age or size. I remember going to @LOCATION1 with my cousins and their friends. As the youngest and shortest, I couldn't ride many of the rides because of my height. I understood the safety reasons, but I question why age restrictions are placed on watching movies or TV shows. People mature at different rates, and everyone has a unique personality and perspective. There's no need to ban a book for everyone. Not wanting to read a book is different from being prohibited from doing so.  The popular book To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 was once banned in the @LOCATION2 for using the 'n - word'. This is extremely frustrating, especially when we consider how slavery and the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have shaped us. America is a great nation because of the @ORGANIZATION1. We shouldn't restrict our personal freedoms. If anything should be banned, it's censorship.
394	3371	2	2	When one person is given the right to do something, everyone else should have the same right. However, there are times when people abuse their rights.  I firmly believe that all books, music, movies, magazines, and other media have a place on library shelves. They should not be removed just because they are considered offensive. In almost every book one reads, there may be some form of offensive content.  I also think that all these forms of media have a purpose. If the purpose is strong enough for them to be published, then they carry a valuable message, even if it's a bit offensive.  I've encountered a few books, movies, and songs that were offensive to me. But considering the underlying positive message, I liked some of the movies and songs that most people might dismiss as 'junk'. Although I don't have a lot of experiences with offensive media, I believe that even the ones that bother me have some good in them.  Personally, I think no one should have the right to remove a book, a piece of music, a magazine, or any other item from a library shelf. Everything has a purpose and a message for each individual to discover.
395	3372	2	2	Initially, I thought that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from library shelves. Young children visit libraries, and there should be separate shelves for kids, teenagers, and adults.  Young kids are already engaging in inappropriate behavior, such as hanging out on the streets and with older kids. They watch inappropriate movies instead of educational ones. The current music is full of cursing and violence, and children shouldn't be exposed to it. Parents need to spend more time with their kids and discuss these issues.  Teenagers also have appropriate content boundaries. I don't think they should read about killing or sex. Parents should talk to their teenagers about these topics instead of hiding things. After all, parents have been through similar experiences.  Magazines can also have a negative impact on young children. They may feel bad about themselves because they don't look like the actors and actresses in the magazines. Young ladies may strive for unrealistic body types, and young men may want to be overly muscular.  However, upon reflection, I don't think these items should be removed from the shelves. Instead, there should be dedicated shelves for young kids, teenagers, and adults. The music played on the radio these days should be regulated. Magazines with inappropriate content should not be within reach of children. Teenagers should have access to appropriate reading and viewing materials. In conclusion, proper categorization and parental guidance are the keys to ensuring that library resources are used appropriately.
396	3373	2	2	"I firmly believe that libraries should allow all types of materials. The principle of freedom of speech dictates that no one should ban something based on its content. If an individual finds a particular item offensive, they have the option to ignore it. I recall visiting the local library and noticing a large collection of books. None of them seemed offensive at first glance. However, the library had an upstairs section with more ""colorful"" books, such as adult-oriented ones. While these books may be offensive to some, they should not be banned but rather relocated. On another occasion, I was searching for a book to assist with a school assignment when I saw several young children looking at adult books and magazines. I believe these were likely for advertising purposes, but they should be promoted in areas where kids and teenagers cannot easily access them. Although it might seem ideal to ban certain books and magazines, it would be extremely challenging to implement. I maintain that nothing should be prohibited based on its content, appearance, or sound. Instead, materials should be moved to different areas. For example, items that may be inappropriate for younger audiences should be placed at a higher level or behind the counter. In conclusion, libraries should prioritize the freedom of access to information and use appropriate placement strategies rather than outright bans."
397	3374	2	2	Have you ever come across an offensive book? Many people can say they have. They might disagree with the book's point or specific viewpoints within the text. When this occurs, people often stop reading that book and others in the same category. However, materials should not be removed from library shelves simply because they offend certain individuals. Everyone has their own opinions, and if we start removing books, what will be left? In my local public library, city residents can request that specific books, movies, music, or magazines be added to the shelves. This is a valuable service, especially for those who cannot afford to purchase certain materials. Many people are grateful for this system. What would happen if library staff refused to order books requested by citizens because they find them offensive? More people would stop visiting the library as there would be fewer materials to pique their interest. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Just because one person disapproves of a book does not mean it should not be available at the library. There are countless books on display at the public library, and no one is required to read them all. There are also various genres of novels, movies, music, and magazines, catering to different interests. If everyone liked the same things, life would indeed be boring. In conclusion, materials should not be removed from library shelves if they offend certain people. Everyone has the right to their own opinions. If a book is requested and one person finds it offensive, the book should remain in the library. With so many different genres available, there is something for everyone. Imagine if the library did not carry your favorite type of novel; would you still go?
398	3375	2	2	I am of the opinion that libraries should not remove offensive materials from their shelves. Even if a particular item is offensive to some, others may wish to learn about the topic it covers. For instance, [Group 1] did not like [Group 2]. Some books contain offensive statements about [Group 2] made by [Person 4]. While some members of [Group 2] may find these statements offensive, people from different races or religions might want to understand what was said. Just because people read about something does not mean they will agree with it. Everyone has their own perspective, and no one has the right to dictate what others can or cannot like. If censorship begins in libraries or other community spaces, I believe people will become angry, leading to a more significant problem than a few individuals being offended by the material. They may feel that their freedom to read, listen, and believe is being restricted, which could spark a larger conflict and cause widespread outrage. It would be simpler for libraries to keep the materials on the shelves and for those who are offended to ignore them. Why would someone read or listen to something that only makes them angry? People may be offended by what others say, but that is just one person's opinion. Not everyone will think or agree the same way. We should respect individual viewpoints and stay true to our own beliefs. No one is perfect, and we should all be ourselves. In conclusion, libraries should maintain the availability of diverse materials and allow individuals to make their own choices.
399	3376	2	2	Materials should not be removed from libraries. The decision of what to view or read should be left to the individual. Books, music, movies, and other materials are used by everyone, and for some, the library is the only place where they can access such resources. Therefore, we should not attempt to take these things away from anyone. One reason why certain materials should not be removed from library shelves is that there will always be subjects and materials that some people object to, while others have a different view. If we allow the removal of such materials, we are taking away an individual's right to choose, which is something we should strive to protect. Moreover, who would be qualified to decide which materials should be removed and which should remain? Is there really one person who can make such a decision for everyone? Additionally, it is impossible for everyone to agree on what materials should be removed. By attempting to do so, we would only create more opportunities for conflict. If not everyone can be satisfied, then there is no point in trying. Another reason why certain materials should not be removed from libraries is that it would interfere with education. Books, movies, and other resources are used for learning, whether people are aware of it or not. The more opportunities a person has to learn, the better. Who are we to decide what a person should educate themselves about? Throughout history, there have been instances where those in power wrongly decided that the public should not be educated about certain things. This was wrong then, and it would be even more wrong in our modern society, which is based on learning and knowledge. We should not hinder a person's ability to learn. I understand that some people argue that certain materials are not suitable for young children. However, this is the responsibility of parents. They should decide what their children can read or see, as long as it is within the bounds of the law. In conclusion, libraries should not be allowed to determine what materials and subjects are available on their shelves. Since no one can make a decision that satisfies everyone and is morally right, it is best to leave these choices to the individuals themselves.
400	3377	2	2	I don't think libraries should remove materials like books, music, movies, and magazines, except for those with nudity or excessive profanity. Some books and movies may not be suitable for young children, but libraries should still offer materials that can teach us something. People often need to do reports and homework using books, and it's okay if they contain a little profanity or graphic content. If libraries have such materials, they should have rules in place, such as allowing access only to those of a certain age or with a note from a teacher. Libraries would attract more visitors if they had a wider variety of books and better - quality materials. Most of the things people like are often in the books or movies that libraries don't carry. It all depends on the situation. There are many offensive things in the world, but we can't keep them away from people because they will find out about them eventually. I think it's unnecessary for libraries to remove offensive materials. I always find it frustrating when I'm told I have to be [Age] or older or have an adult with me to access certain items. Moreover, some people don't have computers or internet access, so they rely on the library to look things up. They may have to travel to the library, and if the library doesn't have what they need, it's very disappointing. In conclusion, libraries should balance the need to provide diverse materials with appropriate access restrictions, rather than simply removing offensive items.
401	3378	2	2	Many people hold the view that censorship is crucial in libraries, believing that materials with inappropriate subject - matter should not be made available as they might send a bad message to children and teach them improper behavior and language. However, I firmly disagree with this stance. I believe that books, music, movies, and magazines containing swear words should remain on the shelves and continue to be sold. The world is filled with numerous unpleasant things, and children need to learn about this reality. Swearing and similar content are not as significant as many other issues. I listen to music and read books with such language, and it has no influence on me. We should not overly control what is available; instead, we should let these materials stay on the shelves and allow individuals or their parents to decide if they are appropriate. In conclusion, these materials should be accessible, and people should be free to read or listen to whatever they want as long as it causes no harm.
402	3379	2	2	I am writing to express a concern regarding the situation in the school library during the month of @MONTH1. Many students in the school are not returning borrowed books, which has become a major problem. Students often forget about the books they have checked out or let them go past due. This makes it extremely difficult for those trying to complete reports. If books, music, magazines, etc., are not returned, the punishment should be more severe than just paying an overdue fee. I have witnessed many students who are reluctant to return the materials they borrowed. For example, when the junior class at my high school needed materials for a term - paper, we were lucky that the senior class returned all their used materials. However, many juniors still haven't returned what they used. Teachers have threatened them with overdue fees or payment for lost materials, but this doesn't seem to bother them. Future classes will struggle and may have to purchase materials if the current students don't return them. For instance, the classes taking @CAPS4 @NUM1 next year and doing their term papers in @MONTH1 may not be able to succeed. It is unfair for them to worry about having the necessary materials. I think involving parents could solve this problem. If schools take the time to get parents involved, fewer students will break the rules. In conclusion, when someone borrows a book, the library should collect detailed personal information. Everyone has the right to use library materials, but they must remember to return them for the benefit of others.
403	3380	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials should not be removed from public library shelves just because they are considered offensive. In a public library, materials are on display for everyone. People have the right to choose what they read. Just because a particular religion group or an individual disapproves of a book or movie, there is no need to discriminate against it. If someone finds something offensive to their beliefs, they can simply choose not to read or look at it. After all, what one person finds offensive might be interesting or useful to another. For example, a biology teacher might find a book on animal mating useful for their studies, while some might think it's inappropriate for the library. A public library is open to people of different races, beliefs, and religions. It's inevitable that some people will see something they don't like. They have the option to either engage with the material or ignore it. People should be strong - minded enough to rise above negative opinions. They should not let others' opinions affect them and should continue to believe in what they believe. Censorship in public libraries is unfair because those who might be offended don't have to read the materials. In life, there will always be people with different views, and one should learn to be resilient. In conclusion, censorship in public libraries is unjust, and people should have the freedom to access all materials available.
404	3381	2	2	I am of the opinion that books should not be removed from library shelves simply because they are offensive or disliked by some. If every person removed the books, music, and movies they didn't like, the library shelves would be empty. Libraries have the right to keep a diverse range of materials. Some people claim that the library has inappropriate books, especially when it comes to their children. However, libraries have sections marked for different audiences, such as adult, young adult, children, and reference. Everyone has different opinions. For example, a book on animal mating might be considered inappropriate by some as they worry about children picking it up, but a biology teacher might find it useful. Also, a book about slavery might be offensive to some, but it serves the purpose of informing people about history. What is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. In conclusion, books should remain on library shelves regardless of personal opinions. People need to accept that others have different views and learn to co - exist with this diversity. This is why I firmly believe that books should not be removed from library shelves.
405	3382	2	2	There are individuals in the world who may be offended by various forms of literature, movies, music, etc. While I understand this, I don't think these forms of media should be banned just because someone doesn't agree with them. Others might like them, and even those who initially dislike something could change their minds if they give it a chance. Before making a final decision about a piece of media, one should try it out. For example, read a few pages of a book or watch one or two episodes of a TV show. Some people avoid certain media because it goes against their beliefs. In such cases, they should simply ignore it. If you don't like a particular type of music, don't listen to it; if you're not fond of a movie, don't watch it. In conclusion, people should learn to give things a fair chance. They should not get rid of something just because they personally find it offensive or unappealing. Therefore, I do not support the banning of certain media.
406	3383	2	2	"For numerous students, crafting essays in a public - school library poses a significant challenge. Obtaining the necessary information is as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack. This issue is not due to a lack of funding or the quality of teachers and staff. Instead, the root cause of many students' inability to compose thought - provoking essays and conduct in - depth analyses on various topics is the extreme censorship imposed on libraries and schools in general. A substantial amount of relevant materials essential for truly understanding our ever - changing world is being kept out of the reach of future leaders.  Notable examples of this knowledge tyranny include the removal of books such as those by @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and the @CAPS1, along with many other classical works. According to many parents, there are valid reasons for these removals. @PERSON1 promotes discrimination and racial supremacy, and the author has been labeled by @CAPS3 as one of humanity's most despicable figures. @PERSON2 contains inappropriate racial slurs that are unfit for young children. The @CAPS1 violates the separation of church and state. Moreover, many other classical works reference racism, drugs, murder, sex, and use excessive profanity. These are all legitimate reasons for parents to advocate for library censorship.  However, in today's evolving environment, these reasons are no longer sufficient. Many of the books recommended for removal offer an unfiltered view of a particular time period from the perspective of those who were not the ""victors"" in the social battle. As the saying goes, ""History is written by the victors."" While it is positive that the @CAPS5 won the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and contributed to the abolition of slavery, it is crucial to recognize that we cannot erase these viewpoints from our knowledge centers. Forgetting often leads to repeating the same mistakes.  Parents who aim to preserve their children's innocence by banning these books from libraries should realize that the media exposes their children to such content more than books do. Censoring libraries hinders children from acquiring the knowledge needed to fully understand our complex and fragmented world. Ignoring the realities of the world does not make them disappear. It is better to face and understand these issues than to enter the world uninformed and naive."
407	3384	2	2	I firmly believe that offensive material should not be removed from the library. Many books, movies, and magazines are not intended to offend but rather to convey the author's feelings. If we remove so - called offensive materials, what will remain on the library shelves? It seems that only the dictionary would be left. When Katherine Paterson made her statement, she was, in my opinion, making a significant error.  What is considered offensive varies from person to person. Topics like gossip and politics are popular among authors in the @DATE1, yet some people find them offensive, likely due to their personal backgrounds. If a reader finds a piece of writing offensive, they should simply stop reading. Instead, some people go on a crusade against the material and try to get it banned, preventing others from accessing it. Readers have the freedom to choose what they want to read. If they disagree with a subject, they should just move on.  At the library I frequent, people of all shapes and sizes come in daily, each with different reading preferences. It's common to see everyone engrossed in different topics. Occasionally, someone may disagree with an author, but they don't go overboard. They simply choose another book to enjoy. People read for pleasure, not to criticize the author.  In my own reading, I've come across content I disagree with. Instead of getting angry, I try to understand the author's perspective. Similarly, some movies are intended for a specific audience, but when a different group watches them, it doesn't mean the movies should be banned from the library. If people follow the age - rating guidelines on movie boxes, there wouldn't be an issue.  I disagree with @PERSON2's view that certain materials should be removed from the library. People have the right to read and watch whatever they want. If they disagree with a subject, they should accept it. In my community library, there hasn't been a problem with people wanting content removed. Once people start following the guidelines and respecting different opinions, there won't be a need for such bans.
408	3385	2	2	Currently, there are intense debates about whether offensive materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves. People base their arguments on personal experiences, observations, and reading. I've read various concerns regarding this issue, and both sides have valid points. No matter what your stance is, there will always be opposition. We see censorship of offensive language on television, but here's my take on whether it should be applied to these materials.  First, people around the world encounter offensive things. As kids grow old enough to understand conversations, they will come across offensive content at some point. From my own experience, I know that there are things some people think should be censored. Even though I come from a religious family that avoids offending others, I'm aware that life doesn't always go as we wish. If we can't censor the offensive things we hear in person, why censor them in materials?  Second, no matter how hard we try to censor certain materials, people will still find things offensive. There are aspects of life we can't control, and being offended is one of them. Even the most popular people have been offended. It's not about censoring every potentially offensive thing; it's about people learning to handle criticism.  Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work i abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote makes a powerful statement. Most well - written books on the shelves have something that could be considered for censorship. Without these elements, what would these books be?  In conclusion, there have been many arguments about censorship. People have shared their observations, personal experiences, and readings. The truth is, there will always be disagreements on this subject. We may never know who is right or wrong. However, based on the points above, it's unlikely that offensive materials will be removed from library shelves.
409	3386	2	2	I am firmly against the removal of certain materials from library shelves if they are deemed offensive. Imagine a world without movies, music, books, or magazines. There would be no creativity, and people would lose the ability to express their opinions.  Without certain materials, creativity would be stifled. If people can't access information on so - called offensive topics, they will be forced to think the same thoughts. Creative thinking depends on exposure to diverse ideas. Banning topics of interest prevents people from thinking differently and learning about new perspectives.  In the process of determining which books are offensive, all books may eventually be removed. As Katherine Paterson said, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Everyone has different preferences, and if one person can remove a book, others will do the same. This will lead to a lack of self - expression. For example, if someone finds books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 offensive to @CAPS4, then no one will be able to learn about this topic from library books.  If people can't express themselves or their opinions, everyone will become the same. Banning a topic means banning the associated thoughts. If a topic can't be read or watched, people may also be restricted from thinking or talking about it. Moreover, if people can decide what books are in a library, this control may extend to other aspects of life, such as clothing, food, and thoughts. Eventually, everyone will conform to the same standards.  In summary, removing offensive materials from library shelves is a bad idea. It will eliminate creativity, lead to the banning of all materials, and make everyone the same due to a lack of self - expression. If you haven't considered a world without these forms of media, I hope you now understand how dull and restrictive it would be.
410	3387	2	2	Everyone has the right to freedom of choice, including the right to speak freely, watch what they like, and so on. The issue of media censorship is complex. Those who prefer censored items can find places to buy them, and nowadays, most stores offer both censored and uncensored products. For parents or individuals who disagree with what is on the shelves, there are solutions.  On @CAPS1, if parents are unhappy with the content, they can use the channel button to change the channel or, with modern technology, block certain channels. People also have the right to choose what they buy, whether it's censored or not. As long as their actions are within the law, they can say and do as they please.  It's all about personal style and what you allow your children to see. However, it's not easy to shield children from inappropriate content in the digital age. For example, a child may go to a friend's house where the parents have fewer restrictions, and the child may watch @CAPS4 - @CAPS5 rated content, while your child is only allowed to watch @NUM1 - rated material.  It's difficult to keep children sheltered from things you'd rather they didn't see, but they will discover these things eventually. A child who has been overly sheltered may be more likely to seek out restricted content out of curiosity. They may sneak around and do what they want because they've never experienced it before. For instance, if you don't allow your @NUM2 - year - old child to play a certain game, but their @NUM3 - year - old friend has it, your child will likely play it at their friend's house.  People have different views on censorship. Some believe everything should be cleaner, while others have different opinions. Thanks to these diverse perspectives, stores can offer products that meet different preferences. In the end, everyone should respect each other's choices regarding censorship and allow individuals to make decisions based on their own values and beliefs.
411	3388	2	2	People shouldn't take all the books from the library because others may also want to look at them. If people start taking books out, all the books will be gone, leaving none for others to view. Therefore, there should be a law stipulating that one can only borrow a book for a specified period. This would help keep all the books in the library. If people start taking books from the library without proper regulations, there will be no books left for checkout. Hence, there needs to be a law stating the number of books one can check out at a time and the borrowing duration. If books are not returned within a certain time, a charge will be imposed, and the amount will accumulate daily. Also, if the bill is not paid, one cannot check out books until the amount is settled. This would prevent people from stealing or taking books without permission. Regarding the books, movies, and magazines in the library, they should all stay on the shelves. If one is removed, all of them should be, as everyone should have the opportunity to see these things in life. Even if a movie or magazine contains something objectionable, it should remain on the shelves. If a book, magazine, or movie is taken off the shelves, all of them need to be removed because it's unfair to the authors who spent time creating their works. If they get angry, they may stop creating books for us to read. This is what I think about handling the situation when someone tries to take books off the library shelves. However, if something is extremely inappropriate, it may be removed from the library shelves or anywhere it's sold.
412	3389	2	2	I firmly believe that all uncensored books, movies, music, and magazines in a library should be removed from the general shelves and placed in a dedicated room within the library, labeled as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 section. In most libraries, there is a children's area with age - appropriate books. But when children accompany their parents or older individuals to the areas where @CAPS1 @CAPS2 materials are located, they may randomly pick up a book or other item without understanding its content. Some people are concerned about being seen entering the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 room. However, if they don't want to be seen, they can simply avoid going in. By segregating the @CAPS1 materials, we can prevent children from accidentally accessing content with uncensored pictures or inappropriate films. This can help avoid situations where a child, after seeing such content, may develop an early interest in sexual activities, especially during puberty. I hope this idea of sectioning off the @CAPS1 materials will keep children away from such inappropriate content and prevent them from engaging in sexual activity at an early age, such as thirteen. When it comes to music, it's difficult to completely stop kids from listening to rap music that contains foul language, references to sex and drugs. Kids may admire the artists who seem successful after engaging in such behaviors. In my opinion, the best way to limit kids' exposure to such music is for parents to restrict their listening when they are together. Other types of music, like @CAPS5 @CAPS6, @CAPS7, or hip - hop, rarely have such references. Additionally, parents should be vigilant about their children's actions and discipline them when necessary to make them aware of the consequences of their choices.
413	3390	2	2	One afternoon in the library, after my brother read the front cover of a magazine, I said to him, '@CAPS1'@CAPS2 say that word!'. I personally oppose using curse words, but my brothers are influenced by the media to use them. We need to consider whether we should allow the media to include such words in magazines and books, or if items with such content should be removed from library shelves. Magazines are a popular source of the latest gossip and appeal to many people worldwide, most of whom are adults. Libraries often place magazines on the shelves to attract adult customers. However, many magazines today feature pictures of half - dressed people and explicit language on their covers. This should not become the new norm. I love reading and believe it's better than watching mind - numbing TV. But nowadays, some books are filled with curse words and degrading scenes. In the past, books were read to learn new things or explore different cultures. Now, it's difficult to find a good book like the classics. Replacing the great works of authors with common, vulgar content on library shelves is wrong and should not be allowed. With electronic devices like the @NUM1 player, most music is purchased from online sites. Parents often don't know half of the songs their children buy, especially when the purchases are made at home. In libraries with internet access, kids can buy songs with offensive language or graphic content without anyone noticing. Librarians should consider putting restrictions on these sites, but it's difficult as kids may find ways to bypass them. So, I think libraries should either restrict music downloads or ensure that songs are free of offensive language. Although times are changing, we can still take steps to restore a more appropriate environment. The issue of kids using foul language is serious. By implementing censorship in libraries, we can solve some of these problems. We should speak up about this idea, as it may lead to positive change.
414	3391	2	2	Opinions on censorship vary widely. Some people dislike books and movies with profanity, while others don't mind. Similarly, some enjoy scary mystery books and movies, while others do not. In my view, all movies, music, and books should be considered acceptable to some extent. I understand why some people want to remove certain movies or books from libraries. They believe these materials are inappropriate, but what is inappropriate to one person may not be to another. Many people like books and movies with profanity because they think it makes the content more realistic. Personally, I believe that some magazines should stop being produced. For example, @CAPS1 magazines are unacceptable to me as they are full of nude women. I think these women lack self - respect, but others may see it as creative and beautiful. This issue is not limited to magazines; more and more movies are also advertising sex and drugs. Since everyone has different opinions on censorship and it's impossible to satisfy everyone, if you are offended by a movie, music lyric, book, or magazine, the best thing to do is not to read or watch it.
415	3392	2	2	Freedom of speech allows individuals to read, write, and listen to whatever they desire, but this right comes with certain conditions. I believe that all books should generally remain on the library shelves. As Americans, we have the freedom to express our thoughts and feelings without excessive worry about the consequences. However, we must also be mindful of our actions and words, and take responsibility for any mistakes. There are, however, exceptions. Some books that promote ideas or actions that could harm the country, such as those related to terrorist groups, drugs, and alcohol, should be removed from the shelves to prevent the pollution of young minds. Today's youth are highly influenced by the music they listen to, the books they read, and the television they watch. These media shape how they act, dress, feel, and interact with others. Freedom of speech is important, but we must choose our words carefully, as our speech can have long - term effects. In conclusion, while we should uphold the principle of freedom of speech, we also need to exercise responsibility to ensure that our actions do not cause harm, especially to the younger generation.
416	3393	2	2	There is a debate on whether certain materials should be removed from public libraries. People hold different views. What might be offensive to one person could be enjoyable to another. Personally, I firmly believe that nothing should be removed from a library. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean others won't enjoy it. You shouldn't deprive others of the opportunity to learn about things you're not interested in. If libraries start removing items from their shelves, those items should still be accessible to those who want to view them. Even storing them away is better than completely removing them from the library. Every day, more and more books are being banned, which I think is unfair to the younger generation who won't get to experience what the previous generation did. In conclusion, no books should be removed from libraries. We should respect the fact that different people have different preferences.
417	3394	2	2	In today's society, the question of what is appropriate in libraries is a topic of much discussion. Across @LOCATION1, opinions vary widely among different people. Censorship has taken on different forms in public and school libraries. In public libraries, it has become a matter of concern, while in school libraries, it has been strictly enforced. Personally, I believe there is a clear distinction between what is considered vulgar or inappropriate in public and school libraries. A public library is a place where people from all walks of life can come to find materials that interest them. Given that everyone has unique interests, they should be able to access books, music, and other items that suit their needs. However, the challenge lies in keeping uncensored materials out of the hands of children. A practical solution could be to divide public libraries into sections, each dedicated to a specific subject matter. This setup is commonly used in well - known bookstores and libraries such as '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' and '@CAPS4'. Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as in school libraries. School libraries serve a different purpose. Their main goal is to support students' academic achievements. However, the level of censorship in school libraries should also depend on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have stricter censorship compared to high - school libraries. High - school students are generally mature enough to handle uncensored materials without causing a commotion, as younger students might. I've seen so - called 'inappropriate' books in my high - school library, and the readers have been mature about it. Some offensive and vulgar items can be both interesting and educational, which is part of the growing - up process. In conclusion, the censorship policies in libraries today vary from one library to another. School and public libraries are distinct in terms of their content. It's up to individuals to choose the library that suits them. Parents with young children should select appropriate areas in the library. Thus, there should be no issue with encountering 'bad' books. As @PERSON1 said, if we keep removing books based on our concerns, there will be no books left for anyone.
418	3395	2	2	The decision of whether to censor a book should rest with the author. I firmly believe that libraries should not remove books with offensive language. If the author is satisfied with the original version of the book, that is how it should be presented. Censoring a book would be a violation of rights in @CAPS1. Imagine writing a book and having someone tell you that you can't use a certain word. It's not up to the public to make such a decision. Censoring books is almost like rewriting history. It's similar to changing a word in the @ORGANIZATION1; any change would make it an incorrect version and alter the entire subject. We cannot simply reword what has been written. In today's world, public views are having a significant impact. Instead of accepting facts as they are, people want to make adjustments to make things less offensive. If this trend continues, there might even be a replaced word for slavery. Slavery is a powerful and bold word that represents a terrible historical event. Changing this word could potentially lead to the repetition of such atrocities. In conclusion, people should respect what has been written. They should either leave the books as they are or choose not to read them. We must not let the desire to avoid offense override the integrity of written works.
419	3396	2	2	First off, the question of whether certain materials like books, music, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they're considered offensive should never be asked. There are many people who read and listen to things that others might not like at all. When I first saw this question, I thought to myself that if everyone thought the same way, the world would be boring. I firmly believe that no books, music, or magazines should be removed from shelves. We all have different likes and dislikes. Just because something is offensive to some people doesn't mean it should be removed. There are things that you enjoy doing, reading, listening to, or looking at that others may not like. Also, just because you don't like something, it doesn't mean others should stop doing or buying it. @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you shouldn't only think about yourself. If you want to be a good person and achieve something in the future, you should care about others too, as you may need them or the knowledge from those books when you face difficulties. In conclusion, I think nothing should be removed from libraries, even if it's offensive to some. These materials can help people in life, while others may be offended by what's written on a piece of paper. I hope this letter makes you think and change your decision about this issue.
420	3397	2	2	One person's strong negative opinion about a book can have an impact on everyone else, which is neither logical nor fair. A library is a haven where people can freely read their favorite books from various genres. There is a book for everyone in the library; it's just a matter of finding it. So, just because one person finds a book offensive or unsuitable doesn't give them the right to take away others' access to it. Books have the power to soothe our minds, either by providing an escape or being an enjoyable read. What one person finds offensive, another may find relatable. For example, a scene that one reader deems too graphic or horrific might be enjoyable to someone else who can relate to it. People who can't relate to such scenes may try to have the book removed, but every person's opinion should be equally valued. The book '@CAPS1' is a well - written fictional novel that has won numerous awards for its quality. However, it contains a rape scene and other inappropriate events. Despite this, it is still on the suggested reading list for @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 classes at the college level. It's disappointing that people focus on the graphic scenes rather than the excellent writing style. If readers could look beyond the surface of these scenes, fewer books would be considered for removal from library shelves. Readers are usually warned about the maturity level of the book's contents. Books are ranked, critiqued, summarized, and sorted in libraries. If someone finds a book offensive, they should look in a different section. Genres are sorted to appeal to different people and age groups. If a book is offensive, it's not the book's fault but rather the reader's for being in the wrong section. In conclusion, the main problem with book censorship in libraries is not the content itself but the different interpretations of it. People's opinions about removing specific books are often overlooked. When someone complains about a book, others have the right to protect it. Removing books from libraries due to censorship is seen as favoritism and goes against the rights that @LOCATION1 stands for.
421	3398	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should not remove a book from the shelves merely because someone dislikes it or finds it offensive. If there is a group of people interested in a book and want to read it multiple times, they will likely recommend it to others. However, if only one or two individuals complain about a book being offensive and demand it be removed, I do not think it is right to deprive everyone else of the opportunity to access it. It is just a book, and students should understand that its presence does not mean it is directed at them.   Similarly, when it comes to music, if a song contains cussing, references to drugs, or other inappropriate content, it should not be played in a school setting or around religious individuals or those who oppose such themes. Respecting others' beliefs and preferences, one should choose music that everyone can enjoy. Libraries should monitor who checks out such music.  Movies also require careful consideration. Since movies already have ratings, it helps people determine whether a movie is suitable for viewing. When borrowing movies from the library, it is reasonable to assume that an adult has pre - screened them to ensure they are appropriate for students or children. No one wants their younger siblings to be exposed to inappropriate content.  Magazines in libraries should also be clean and interesting. Kids may not be able to distinguish between good and bad, and teenagers are also in the library. Magazines should not contain nudity, cussing, or references to drugs. If one were to see such content in a library magazine, it would be advisable to remove it to protect the healthy thinking of children.  Libraries need to be vigilant and ensure that all materials are suitable for public access. These safety measures for kids are commendable, and everyone should be aware of such issues. As a future parent, I would want my children to be in an environment where they can understand and engage with positive and appropriate content. Thanks to libraries that take these precautions.
422	3399	2	2	I personally think that censorship in libraries is a sensitive topic. Some parents with young children believe certain books should not be in libraries, while others argue that any book should be allowed. For instance, someone might need to write a paper on a controversial book. In my view, as long as books are placed in appropriate sections, people of the right age should be able to access them.  Libraries should have distinct areas for children's books and for adult or teenage reading materials. This reduces the risk of young children accidentally getting hold of books with adult - oriented content. The library in my town has clearly marked areas for children and teenagers, which is a good practice as it prevents young children from being exposed to inappropriate materials while looking for their favorite books.  If there are concerns about the age - appropriateness of certain materials, libraries can impose age restrictions. This way, those under the age limit cannot access the materials, while those of the proper age can.  Libraries are crucial for people's studies. Without libraries, many would struggle to research papers or complete other tasks. If someone dislikes the material in their local library, they can simply ignore it. However, I firmly believe that young children should not have any chance of stumbling upon disturbing books. There should be a separate room for such materials that children cannot access. This allows children to visit the library without their parents worrying about them seeing unsuitable content.  Readers should be able to visit libraries without fear of encountering books they consider inappropriate. Also, if I need to research a topic that others find offensive, I should have the opportunity to do so. As an author, I would not want my book to be removed from libraries, as it deprives readers of the chance to learn from it.  I don't think censorship should be taken lightly. We all have freedom of speech, and authors should have the same right. Parents and those who don't want to see certain literature can take precautions. Total censorship would limit people's ability to broaden their minds. By taking appropriate precautions, there is no need for total censorship of materials that authors have worked hard on.
423	3400	2	2	I find that libraries can sometimes be a source of offense, but it varies depending on people's beliefs and cultural backgrounds. I understand that some library materials can be offensive, while others are not. Parents are often more sensitive to this issue as they don't want their children to be exposed to content that is not age - appropriate.  For example, a parent might rent a movie from the library, thinking it is a kids' movie, only to find out it is actually an adult - oriented film when they get home and play it. To solve this problem, parents should keep an eye on their children and ensure they only stay in the children's area. If parents follow this advice, many issues can be avoided. Some parents raise their children to respect the boundaries and only go to the areas they are supposed to, unless given permission otherwise.  I myself can get offended when I visit the library. There are people who look at offensive materials just for fun, which gives the library a negative image. If I were offended by something on the library shelves, I would usually ignore it. However, some people prefer to inform the library staff about the offensive items.  If I had an issue with the library, I would definitely complain. Complaining in a calm and respectful manner is more likely to bring about change. When complaining, it is important to be polite, as the staff is more likely to respond positively.  Everyone has different views and sensitivities. But we should not let simple library - related issues affect our lives. If a library is a problem, one can choose not to go there or simply ignore the offensive content. There are multiple ways to handle such situations, and being respectful is key. Our attitude when complaining matters a lot. If we can't resolve the issue, we should just move on and continue living our lives.
424	3401	2	2	I am strongly of the opinion that offensive materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries and other sources. If we were to remove all offensive materials, library shelves, movie stores, and other places would be empty. There are many books, movies, and music that might offend some people, but removing them all would leave us with nothing.  When something like a book or movie offends an individual, it is better to simply put it down and not worry about it. Moreover, offensive materials have value. They show us the contrast between good and bad, right and wrong. Books, movies, and magazines are important in our world, and they play a role in educating us. We should learn from them rather than getting angry.  For example, if we removed all offensive materials, it would not make the world a better place. In fact, these materials can teach us how to be better people and inform us about different aspects of life.  In conclusion, removing offensive materials is not a good idea. If we did so, libraries, movie stores, and other places would be empty, and we would be less informed about life. Therefore, we should keep these materials on the shelves and make the most of the knowledge and perspectives they offer.
425	3402	2	2	In today's world, there are certain things that children should not be exposed to. The media, including music, magazines, and movies, often sets a standard that can have a negative impact on children. I strongly oppose the images and ideas that the media promotes, as they can shape children's views on looks and lifestyle.  The library is a place where children can explore colorful books with morals and where adults can relax from work. However, it is also an uncensored environment. Children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 are naturally curious about the adult world, and the open library shelves can expose them to inappropriate content, potentially taking away their innocence. Many parents assume that their neighborhood is a safe and harm - free place for children, but they fail to realize that the world is full of unfiltered information that children can discover at any time.  The media focuses on attracting children's attention. We need to be cautious about what our children watch, listen to, and read. For example, a magazine featuring a girl who had a nose job can give an eight - year - old girl the idea that she can have surgery to fix her nose, which is being teased about at school. Similarly, if a boy listens to rap or rock music that promotes violence, drug, and alcohol use, he may think it is acceptable to fight at school or curse the teacher. A movie with a sex scene can also give children inappropriate ideas.  In our society, we should not present an image for children to strive for. Instead, parents should encourage their children's imaginations. We can teach them about life through @PERSON1's '@ORGANIZATION1' or the adventures of 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'. Parents should focus on feeding their children's imaginations rather than promoting a particular image. Children's lives should be about having fun, gaining knowledge, and having life experiences, not being exposed to all the inappropriate content that might be on library shelves.
426	3403	2	2	Have you ever visited a library? Have you ever thought that some library materials could be offensive and should be removed? I'm here to discuss library content and what we should do about it. Every time you enter a library, you're surrounded by books and other learning or reading materials. While this material can help pass the time or understand a subject, some has been found offensive. Romance novels, vulgar horror, and action stories are considered inappropriate for certain ages. These novels may contain brutal horror, adult content, or foul language. Parents argue that these books should be removed from libraries. However, I disagree. I believe such books can stimulate imagination and get the mind working. Although some novels aren't age - appropriate for young children, that doesn't mean they should be removed. If parents are worried about their children reading these books, they can accompany their child to the library or designate a specific area for book selection. Another solution is to section off more explicit and adult - oriented books to a specific area in the library and restrict access to age - appropriate people. An age restriction of thirteen and up would be a responsible decision. A younger age might be inappropriate, but an older age could prevent them from fully developing their minds. In conclusion, removing these books from libraries won't help. Instead, it could limit our mental growth. Sectioning off novels or having parental discretion can ensure the right age group accesses the books.
427	3404	2	2	Libraries contain a wealth of helpful books, as well as magazines, music, and movies. Many of the movies are for adults, but most libraries have a kids' section. Unfortunately, most of the books, magazines, and movies are accessible to young children. As a child, I often went to the library with my parents or grandparents. We usually visited the kids' section. I'd read books or do puzzles. I can't recall ever seeing anything offensive during my library visits. I've never found anything offensive in the library myself. I'm sure there might be offensive books or movies in every library, but I can't provide a personal example. If libraries do have offensive materials, they're doing a good job of keeping them away from me and other kids. I also haven't read about people finding such content in books or magazines. I prefer reading biographies of sports players and magazines about sports or cars, so I don't encounter much offensive material. If libraries have offensive books but no inappropriate readers accessing them, there's no need to remove these books from the shelves. Some adults may come to the library looking for such books and can ask for them. In my opinion, libraries shouldn't have to remove these books.
428	3405	2	2	We encounter books with inappropriate language, mentions of sex, disturbing ideas, and cuss words in libraries, yet they remain on the shelves. I firmly believe that libraries should be more modest and not stock books with such content. The presence of profane ideas in library books across @LOCATION1 is, in my view, one of the root causes of the problems in today's teenagers. Personally, I've come across books with inappropriate language. As a third - grader, I was assigned school books with descriptions of sex and bad language. I would show these books to my parents, as I was raised in a @CAPS1 home and found such content unacceptable. There are many things that can offend people, like racism, sex, cussing, rules, and religion. We need to address the main issues, even though it's impossible to please everyone. The prevalence of such ideas in media has turned the world upside - down. When I was young, we were taught not to cuss, yet it's common in books. In @LOCATION2, we have the freedom to do as we please. Authors can include profane language and dirty ideas in their books, but libraries aren't obligated to keep such content. We should consider the future of @LOCATION2. If we expose our youth to this material, they'll grow up without morals, and the world will deteriorate further. Katherine Paterson made a valid point when she said that removing books from shelves would prevent proper education. However, I think she also acknowledges our fear of what our children read. So, why do we keep these books in libraries? I believe that removing certain books, magazines, movies, songs, and internet sites from libraries and schools would steer teenagers away from the wrong path. Today, the world has become a disaster. The kids who were on the right track @NUM1 years ago are now involved in smoking pot, having sex, and other inappropriate behavior. I truly believe that the offensive content in school and library materials is to blame. It's up to the @LOCATION3 to decide whether our kids will be the future of @LOCATION2 or a source of shame. We need to fix this situation.
429	3406	2	2	Offensive literature, sexual content, and disagreeable topics are present in books, and it's impossible to remove all books that might offend someone. There are several reasons why censorship is both pointless and wrong. Firstly, censorship only piques curiosity. Children are constantly told what to do and what not to do. It's well - known that they often do the opposite. Being restricted from certain materials makes people want to rebel and discover the truth. No one likes having their reading choices limited. Secondly, censoring books can impede learning. In English classes, students are required to read a variety of books. Some of these books, depending on the teacher, contain what some consider offensive language and topics. But reading such content is a part of life. Reading foul language is no more offensive than hearing it in real life, and in fact, the real - life situation might be worse. If we're shielded from these things, we won't learn that they exist. Thirdly, the real world isn't censored, so books shouldn't be either. We can't expect a beep to cover up offensive language on the street. In the real world, we must learn to handle offensive remarks maturely. Since we can't censor real - life conversations, there's no reason to censor reading materials. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right. The amendment was created to allow @CAPS1 to express their beliefs. Nowadays, everything is being censored to please those who might be offended. But sometimes, offensive language or topics are necessary in writing. People should be able to express their thoughts, and readers should be able to handle offensive content constructively. Everyone will encounter offensive material at some point in their lives. It's just a part of life.
430	3407	2	2	Books are crucial in human life, whether for study, entertainment, or other purposes. However, some books can be offensive. The question is, should we avoid offensive books or remove them from the shelves? There are several reasons why offensive materials should not be removed. Firstly, what's offensive to some may not be offensive to others. In books, movies, and daily life, different people have different views. For example, to fully convey a character's hatred, offensive words may be necessary. To satisfy some readers, a detailed and brutal description of a killing may be required. Secondly, people are taught to recognize offensive content. If a reader finds a book offensive, they should stop reading instead of finishing it and then complaining. Just as someone renting a movie should know not to choose an @CAPS1 - rated one, they should also be responsible when choosing a book. If they're concerned about a particular material, they can seek advice or check online. Thirdly, even if a material is considered offensive, it shouldn't be removed. It's just one person's opinion. If a book is needed by someone, they won't be able to access it if it's removed. If we removed materials every time someone claimed they were offensive, there would be no books left, as anyone can be offended and may exaggerate the situation. In conclusion, materials should not be removed from the shelves. If everyone started claiming offensiveness, there would be no more books. People shouldn't have absolute control over book removal, as some might complain out of spite. So, do you still think offensive materials should be removed?
431	3408	2	2	Every parent holds distinct views on matters like this. However, even if one censors books, movies, music, etc., children can still access uncensored versions of these on the internet. Parents often think that censorship is beneficial for their children, yet children today have extensive access to technology and uncensored music. As time passes, children become more curious about the world. The more parents shield their children from certain aspects of life, the higher the likelihood that children will rebel or deviate from their parents' expectations. Each individual is unique. In my opinion, it is best to leave books, music, movies, etc., on library shelves. Children will discover them eventually, whether through friends or the media. It is not to say that listening to such music will corrupt a child. I believe that at a certain age, parents should have conversations with their children about real - world issues because childhood is fleeting, and parents cannot control their children indefinitely. Everyone was once a child, and most parents disliked it when their own parents restricted them. Life is not always fair, and these are just my personal views. Whether one decides to censor all music, books, and movies, there will always be discontented adults and parents. Children will almost always find ways to bypass these restrictions; it is in their nature. As I've said, every parent and person has their own stance on such topics. I think it's best to let parents handle these matters as they see fit, as it's impossible to please everyone.
432	3409	2	2	Should offensive books, music, and movies be removed from shelves? These forms of media present specific viewpoints to their audiences. If someone disagrees with the content, they can choose not to engage with it. However, it is unreasonable to remove great works just because they represent different perspectives. People should give these materials a chance because sometimes alternative ideas are valuable. Censoring movies due to their offensive nature is a form of controlling what we see and hear. Books, music, and movies should not be removed because they teach us about life without us having to experience the events directly. Books are a means for people to express themselves without causing harm. For example, poetry allows readers to sense the writer's emotions. Books with political or social views should not be discriminated against just because someone dislikes the author's stance or presentation. In novels, the use of profanity does not diminish the clarity of the message. The message might be about the over - use of profanity or the potential decline of the next generation, but it is not intended to harm. Music is a way for people to express their emotions without taking it out on others. When profanity is used in a song, it is a general expression of how the singer feels about a situation, not targeted at a specific person. Many listeners may misinterpret the lyrics, but music should not be removed as it is just a form of expression. In movies, scenes of violence, such as shootings and murders, are shown to educate people about real - world dangers, not to teach them how to harm others. Movies are about sharing ideas and showing the world one's thoughts and feelings. Removing these forms of media shows that the previous generations are afraid of our collective potential or our ability to voice our dislikes. Books, music, and movies based on reality should not be banned just because they showcase individuality and reveal the truth beneath the lies told by those in power. Only truly vile content should be censored, not materials that are relevant to our society.
433	3410	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials such as books, music, and magazines should not be removed from library shelves or any other public places. Libraries and similar institutions should provide information to those who seek it. If these places start hiding such materials, many people will lose interest in visiting. In my view, libraries are places that showcase our history, our experiences, and our achievements. Can you imagine visiting a library and finding nothing about your past? I certainly can't. Although some materials may seem offensive to some, they could be part of someone else's history. Nowadays, many people rely on magazines, books, and music for information. Everyone has the right to know about their past to shape their future. Therefore, taking away information that might seem offensive to some is unfair. We should keep all information in libraries, museums, and art shows because everything has its own history. Covering it up means we'll never truly understand. Personally, I'd rather know than remain ignorant.
434	3411	2	2	I believe that certain materials like books, movies, and magazines should be removed from public libraries. Consider the scenario where a young child stumbles upon an inappropriate magazine. The images could be imprinted in their minds and potentially lead to bad decisions. There are numerous books and movies that are not suitable for young children. They should either be placed more appropriately or removed entirely. Some people may find certain materials more offensive than others, and reading such content could make them angry or trigger negative thoughts. In my opinion, most fictional books are mainly for entertainment. They generally do not represent real - life events or thoughts. If someone finds them offensive, they may be misinterpreting the message. Most libraries have adult - only sections, but these are not monitored. So, there's no way to know if a child has entered a restricted area and accessed inappropriate material. In today's society, many children are already aware of sexual content and other graphic material. However, just because they know about it doesn't mean we should expose them further. There are many TV shows and movies that are more graphic than books and magazines, but that doesn't mean they should all be banned. The world is full of offensive material, and adults usually get used to it. But young children lack the judgment, and there's no guarantee they won't act on ideas from inappropriate content. So, perhaps it is necessary to remove certain materials from library shelves.
435	3412	2	2	When entering a library, one expects to find interesting things to read, listen to, or watch. Most people use libraries to gather information on various topics, some of which may not be suitable for certain age groups. I believe that library materials should reflect the current world view. Kids often visit libraries in search of interesting books, but sometimes they come across content they're not ready for. Libraries should be able to have any material on their shelves, but they should also organize them according to age groups. Imagine being a little kid looking up information on racing. You might pass by books about racism. As a child, you may not understand what it is, but all it takes is to pick up the book and read. That child has suddenly gone from reading about NASCAR to learning about racism. I think books should be sorted by age. When a teenager goes to the library, they should be able to access a section dedicated to their age group. Most libraries have materials on topics like sex, killing, and violence. Children should not be exposed to such details until they are ready. I always look for interesting books at the library. My book - choosing skills have improved since I was younger. Now, I prefer action and mystery books. I was at my hometown library and was shocked to see a 3 - year - old looking at books about pregnancy. On the same day, I saw a younger child approaching his father with books about sex and killing. This made me realize that libraries should display their materials in age - appropriate sections. Kids visit libraries frequently in search of interesting books and often stumble upon inappropriate content. It's difficult for libraries to control what kids read, but they should still expose different topics in an age - appropriate manner. When kids are young and read about these topics, they'll be more informed as they grow older. Next time you visit the library, observe what the local children are reading and talking about. You'll be surprised when a child approaches their parents with a book about sex. I think libraries should share their knowledge, but they should do so in a way that is suitable for different age groups.
436	3413	2	2	I firmly believe that nothing should be removed from library shelves if it offers educational value to children. Children can glean a great deal from library books. Whenever one needs assistance or answers regarding specific matters, the library is a reliable source, housing all the necessary information. The internet cannot provide everything; sometimes, one has to open a book to find what they're looking for. During my childhood, I was able to complete my schoolwork using resources from the library. Libraries are brimming with educational materials; one just needs to know what to look for. For some adults, having difficulty finding what they need in the library doesn't mean the same for their children. Sometimes, children understand better than adults did at their age. Parents, please don't deprive libraries of materials that can truly benefit your children. If these materials weren't useful, they wouldn't have been placed in the library in the first place. There are things that are better found in books because not everything is available on the internet. Many scientists have sourced their information from books as it's more convenient. Libraries offer a wealth of knowledge. The books and resources in libraries greatly aid in research. I strongly oppose the removal of materials from libraries.
437	3414	2	2	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, should not be removed from library shelves even if they are deemed offensive. There are several reasons to support this stance, including a relevant quote from author Katherine Paterson. People develop their character through their responses to how others treat them. For instance, in real life, someone may offend another person, but that doesn't make the offender disappear. How does this relate to libraries? Books and movies in libraries should not be removed if they are offensive because there are numerous offensive things in the real world. It is an individual's choice what to read, listen to, or watch. Just because one has the option to borrow something they consider inappropriate or offensive doesn't mean they have to do so. Some people actually enjoy consuming offensive content. One might argue, 'But I don't want my children exposed to such offensive materials.' That's why most public libraries are divided into children's and adult sections. If you come across an offensive book in the children's section, simply prevent your child from borrowing it. It's that straightforward. Trying to remove the book from the shelf or complaining about it would only waste time. Katherine Paterson's quote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' perfectly summarizes why books should not be removed from shelves. She implies that if one person can remove a book, everyone can, and eventually, there will be no books left. In conclusion, if there are offensive books, music, movies, or magazines, simply don't borrow them. You don't need to get rid of them as someone else may want to borrow them.
438	3415	2	2	I firmly believe that books and other materials should not be removed from library shelves just because someone finds them offensive. Everyone has different preferences when it comes to reading. If you don't like a book and consider it offensive, you should simply leave it on the shelf because someone else might enjoy it. Not everyone has the same taste in books, but every book in a library has a purpose. Libraries screen all the books they acquire and wouldn't purchase a book if no one requested it or if it wasn't a worthwhile addition. Everyone has the right to read what they like, and no one should have the authority to remove books from library shelves. What if someone is searching for a particular book and the library is the only place that has it? Where would people then spend their time reading and enjoying the books they're interested in? If everyone removed books they found offensive, there would be no books left on the shelves, and no one would have anything to read. Additionally, if you don't like the selection of books in a particular section, you should move to another part of the library and explore the types of books you prefer. Libraries offer something for everyone. This is why I believe it's a bad idea to allow the removal of books from shelves. If everyone did so when they encountered something 'offensive,' no one would have access to the books they enjoy.
439	3416	2	2	I think there are some books that should be removed from library shelves and sold in bookstores for personal use. However, for other books, people need to be more mature. For example, history books that discuss wars and slavery, as well as books containing curse words. School libraries, such as those in elementary and high schools, should stock books appropriate for their age - groups. If a librarian knows a book is not suitable for young children, they should prevent them from borrowing it. Similarly, music, magazines, and movies should also be age - appropriate. Young children don't need to hear curse words every few seconds in a song. Movies should also adhere to age - appropriate standards. That's why libraries have sections for babies, toddlers, pre - teens, teens, and adults. If you're worried that your child or you might come across an offensive or age - inappropriate book, stay in your designated section. For instance, if you're a teen and there's a book meant for older people, you can inform the librarian, and they may move it to the appropriate section. Since everyone has different views on what's offensive, libraries shouldn't have to remove every book that offends one person as it's unfair to others. After all, no one is forcing you to borrow that book. In conclusion, a balanced approach should be taken to ensure that library materials are accessible while also being age - appropriate.
440	3417	2	2	"I believe censorship is unnecessary in libraries. Some parents might say to their child, ""Hey, what book is that? Let me see it. I don't think you should read it; it's too graphic for a [age] - year - old boy."" But kids will be exposed to things parents don't want them to see sooner or later. I don't think anyone other than library managers has the right to remove items from the shelves. People can complain if they don't want something in the library, but if the library has acquired it, it should be allowed to keep it, regardless of people's objections. Only library managers, if they agree with a patron, should be able to remove a book. At the library I visit, they have a wide range of materials, from adult - content books to rated - R movies, and they get new items weekly. If a person doesn't want a particular item on the shelves, they shouldn't be able to remove it on their own. For example, if a parent removes a movie because they don't want their child exposed to it, another person who wants to watch it won't be able to. I witnessed a verbal fight between a patron and the library manager. The patron thought a children's book was too provocative and wanted it removed, but the manager refused as the library can stock whatever books it wants. Another time, someone broke a DVD because they thought children of their age shouldn't watch that kind of movie. But this deprives other people who want to see it. In summary, citizens should not be allowed to remove anything from library shelves. Only library managers should have the authority to do so if they wish."
441	3418	2	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that if certain materials are found offensive, they should be removed from the shelves. Young children are likely to pick up a book, movie, @CAPS3 case, or magazine and read whatever is on the front. We don't need younger children repeating things they see or hear without understanding. It's already bad enough that they might hear inappropriate language from family members or those around them.  The seller could create an edited version of the book, movie, @CAPS3, or magazine. Sayings like 'If you don't like it, then don't look', 'If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all', and 'If you wouldn't want to hear it, then don't say it' are very relevant here. Nowadays, it seems that some companies don't really care who sees their products as long as people are buying them.  In today's world, younger children are often very smart. For example, if a four - year - old picks up a @PERSON1 @CAPS3 case and sees a nearly naked adult on it, it can give them the wrong idea. That child might grow up thinking it's okay to be naked because @PERSON1 did it. Children learn a lot from their family and friends before they start learning the truth in school.  It's like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 where half - naked to naked women are walking around freely. This is not something a five - year - old should see, just as they shouldn't hear cussing or the use of the @CAPS10 name in vain.  Exposing young children to such things makes them think it's okay to say or dress however they want, and they might believe it's perfectly natural. Although this might be a wake - up call for some parents, it's not normal. It's no more normal than telling your kids they were a mistake. Such things should not be said to or around children.  Every parent wants the best for their child. They don't want their children growing up in a world full of bad influences or doing wrong. By allowing companies to sell products with half - naked people on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 case, or selling books about murder and hiding bodies, or playing offensive music in stores with young kids, we're letting companies think they can sell and promote anything they want.  I'm not a mother, nor will I be one soon, but I find it highly offensive that companies and stores do this. I wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine and asking me questions about nearly naked people or the meaning of a cuss word. I certainly wouldn't buy a book that seems strange or offensive to my child.  I do believe in '@CAPS13 of @CAPS14', so in a way, companies have the right to sell their products as they are. But if they really want to sell them so badly, they should sell them online. It might cost more, but at least children won't see them. Once a product is purchased, it's the parents' responsibility if their child sees it.  Children's brains are still developing at a young age, and their imagination is very vivid. When they go to the store with their parents, they're already excited. It's bad enough for them to see inappropriate things. I'm sure I wouldn't let my children see such things, and I'm about @PERCENT1 certain you wouldn't either. So, for the sake of children, think about their minds, their developing brains, and their wild imaginations. Treat children as you were treated growing up.  Thank You, @PERSON2.
442	3419	2	2	I think all books should be removed from the shelves because I find some of them offensive in their content. It really annoys me when I'm trying to talk to someone with a book, and all they do is ignore me and keep reading. I find that disrespectful.  I don't like reading in general. It's usually boring and sometimes tiring, unless it's a really good book. I also think some movies should be taken off the shelves. For example, Harry Potter, Twilight, and most books with mythical creatures are so stupid and pointless.  On the other hand, I believe music shouldn't be taken off. It's easier to relate to and understand. I might be wrong, but that's my personal opinion. The lyrics in some music can show who you are and what you stand for in life. Music shows character and is easier to follow than movies or boring old books. I listen to music all the time, and you hardly ever see me with a book in my hands. I do watch movies sometimes, mainly action and comedy. I really don't like scary movies, especially those with weird - looking creatures.  I can list some books, movies, and music I like. Two books I like are 'Blood is thicker' and 'Until we @CAPS4 again' by @PERSON3. I like all five of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movies, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS4 The @PERSON4, and my all - time favorite '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7' and 'The new karoti kid'. The music I listen to includes @CAPS8 - @CAPS9, @ORGANIZATION4, @PERSON2, @PERSON5, @LOCATION3, @CAPS10 - @CAPS11, @CAPS12 @CAPS13, @ORGANIZATION5, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, and @PERSON1. They are all great singer - songwriters and do a great job, making millions from their music. People love music more than anything. There are more music albums sold in the world than books and movies combined, which proves my point that music is better. Surveys always show that music wins.  So, this concludes my opinion on this subject. I hope I've made my point clear to those who say books and movies are better because I don't think they are.
443	3420	2	2	I sometimes think it's good to have inappropriate materials on the shelves of stores or libraries. When people see offensive stuff, many are willing to buy it. Also, when people have gone through tough times in their lives, they might like to read offensive books because it reflects how they've been brought up.  My view on censorship is that offensive materials like music, magazines, books, and movies should be kept. These materials can entertain adults and teenagers because of the inappropriate sayings. They can boost people's style and way of acting. Music, in particular, is a major source of offensive material. It comes from all over the world, and young teens often adapt to it and get influenced by that inappropriate vibe.  Another reason I think offensive materials should be kept is related to what we see and watch. Movies and television can be offensive and inappropriate, but we can learn from them. Many offensive movies can teach lessons if you're willing to follow. Some movies also contain advice for people going in the wrong direction in life. That's why I think offensive movies should be kept in stores. Television is similar. You can learn a lot from an offensive @CAPS1 show, like what to do and what not to do.  Regarding what we read, books are a form of entertainment. People read books because the categories often fit their lives, such as reflecting rough, lovely, funny, or dramatic aspects. We read offensive books because of our past experiences as kids or just because we want to feel the same sympathy as others. Books can also give advice on careers or life choices.  However, when it comes to magazines, I'm against having them on the shelves. They are full of gossip and false information. Although many people buy magazines because of these things, in my opinion, they shouldn't be in stores unless they change.  Overall, I believe offensive materials like music, movies, books, and to some extent magazines should be on the shelves because many people are willing to buy them. They attract people with gossip and provocative ads.
444	3421	2	2	@PERSON1, an author, once stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In essence, she was proving that books should not be censored in any form, a stance with which I concur.  Censorship involves the banning of certain things deemed offensive. A prime example is the society depicted in the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1' by @PERSON2. In this narrative, @PERSON3, the main character and eventual protagonist, is a firefighter who starts fires instead of extinguishing them. The government in the book believes that books are dangerous as they make people knowledgeable. As a result, they order the burning of books, rendering society ignorant and potentially subservient to the government. Despite losing his job and facing the threat of death from the government, @PERSON3 comes to realize that books have true meaning and that the government's actions are wrong.  This topic raises the question: 'Is all censorship bad?' Certainly not. Some forms of censorship are justifiable. For instance, any form of media, whether books or magazines, that portrays hatred towards a certain religion or group should be censored by the government. This is in line with the constitution, which guarantees people the right to believe and practice whatever they wish (also known as 'freedom of speech').  However, the majority of censorship has negative implications. In the political realm today, censorship is often applied to those who speak out against their government or leader, especially when the government has been dishonest or ruthless. In some cases, this violates the constitution, as people have the right to freedom of speech, albeit to a certain extent.  In conclusion, the negative consequences of censorship outweigh the positive ones. Censorship leads to people becoming uneducated and restricts their ability to speak out against wrongdoings. While censorship of materials that promote hatred is not bad, excessive censorship ultimately results in widespread ignorance.
445	3422	2	2	I think it's kind of funny when people think it's their job to go to the bookshelf and say what should or shouldn't be there. I mean, if you don't like a book, just don't look at it or read it. I sort of get the concern about magazines because sometimes they can be really bad. But at the same time, it's not anyone's place to say what's right and wrong.  I'm @PERCENT1 okay with music being taken out of libraries. A lot of the music people listen to today isn't suitable for kids or adults. People wonder why there's so much killing and hate in the world, and this kind of music might be part of the problem.  The movies in libraries are pretty good. They don't let them get too bad, so I can't complain much about that.  Overall, libraries are doing a good job handling things. There are some things I'd change, but my opinion doesn't really matter. I'm just a @NUM1 - year - old kid. I can give my thoughts, but that's about it. I love libraries, and nothing will stop me from going. If I don't like something, I just don't read it or look at it, and that's how everyone should be.
446	3423	2	2	The question of whether libraries should censor reading materials for school - students is a complex one. Reading is beneficial for people of all ages, but the key lies in whether the topic is suitable for a particular age group. In my opinion, libraries should censor to an extent. They should have distinct sections for young kids, teens, and adults. If a child wishes to read more graphic material, they must obtain permission from their parents. This is because some content published by authors is intended for specific audiences. In conclusion, a balanced approach to censorship in school libraries can ensure that students access age - appropriate reading materials while still having the opportunity to explore within the boundaries set by parental guidance.
447	3424	2	2	Whether it's religious groups demanding the removal of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series from library shelves or @CAPS3 wanting to burn the @LOCATION1, books often spark controversy. In our country, we have the rights to freedom of speech and press. So, it's unjust for anyone to demand a book be banned. People around the world have diverse thoughts, beliefs, morals, and values. Imposing our views on others can be achieved either by removing a controversial book from the shelves or by keeping it there. The same goes for music, movies, and magazines, which all express the ideas of their creators and should be accessible to those who want them. There are hundreds of banned books, and one could find numerous reasons to ban any book. If we ban a writer's words on a controversial topic, we'd have to ban all such words and the writers themselves. This would lead to a world without opinions, voiceless and directionless. For instance, if the @CAPS4 had banned the @CAPS5, our world would be far different. We'd be unaware of @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, and there'd be no powerful voices influencing our lives and history. It would be a terrible place with no one to express or discuss ideas. While children shouldn't be exposed to porn or '@ORGANIZATION1', they should have the freedom to access what they want. Values and morals should be developed through reading and thinking, not forced by the government or parents. Different people have different reactions to offensive material, and it's a part of everyday life. We should have access to all opinions to form our own. Censorship is wrong, and the government has no right to restrict our exploration. In conclusion, a world without the freedom to express and access diverse opinions is a world without progress.
448	3425	2	2	I firmly believe that everyone has the right to choose which book to pick up. One should have an idea of the content before making a selection. If you think a book might be offensive, simply put it back on the shelf. Censorship in libraries is unnecessary. People should be able to take care of themselves. However, children should be supervised by adults to ensure they don't pick up inappropriate materials. Removing offensive articles from library shelves ruins good books for others because not everyone is offended by the same things. Offensive material is a part of everyday life and can't be avoided. Instead of removing such books, a warning sticker can be placed on them. This way, readers will be aware that the book may contain offensive content, benefiting both those who might be offended and those who enjoy such books. Everyone is exposed to offensive material in daily life, so having censorship in libraries serves no purpose. In conclusion, we should respect individual choices and not let a few people's sensitivities limit others' access to diverse reading materials.
449	3426	2	2	I firmly believe that we should censor the materials our children read and view in libraries. Young children have impressionable minds, and exposing them to inappropriate content at a young age can lead to the wrong kind of learning and development. We need to take a stand and ensure that our kids are protected from content that is not suitable for their age. Censorship is essential for the future well - being of our children. By implementing proper censorship, we can guide children towards age - appropriate materials that will help them grow in a healthy and positive way. In conclusion, taking a stand on censorship in libraries for children is a necessary step to safeguard their development.
450	3427	2	2	I don't think we should have to remove certain books from library shelves. Consider it from your own perspective. If you love horror books and someone who dislikes them gets them removed, you'd be quite angry. I'm a fan of @CAPS1 magazines like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @ORGANIZATION1. If there's something inappropriate in them, instead of removing the whole magazine, one should simply put it back. I've had a personal experience at my school. We used to have @ORGANIZATION1 magazines, which were harmless. But one person's complaint led to their removal. This is unfair to fans like me. I understand that to some extent, people may have sensitivities, like religious individuals avoiding certain content. However, when people act out of spite, it's hurtful. In conclusion, if you have an issue with a book or magazine, keep it to yourself. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean others won't, and you wouldn't want the same to happen to you.
451	3428	2	2	Censorship, with its totalitarian nature, often precedes the decline of humanity. Throughout history, the horrors of totalitarianism have been evident, from the @CAPS1 regime in @LOCATION1 to the banning of @CAPS2 in the @CAPS3 empire. These instances have always brought about great terror.  In the mid - twentieth century, @PERSON1 wrote Fahrenheit @NUM1, foreshadowing a grim future if censorship is imposed on humanity. When censorship takes hold, people will lose access to real knowledge and will only know what the authorities tell them. In the book, the population is prohibited from possessing any books, and the government fabricates history, leading to psychological chaos. Propaganda already distorts people's minds, and book censorship would be the final blow.  It is essential for humans to understand their roots. Once one book is removed from the shelf, it may lead to the removal of all. The government may rewrite history to make people believe it is just, even when the government itself is the problem.  This situation raises a fundamental question: What should truly be restricted from public view? We generally agree that pornographic material and adult language should be kept away from children, but what makes these things unacceptable in the first place? We have been taught this throughout our lives, but real - scale censorship would mean the end of knowledge. People tend to believe what they are told if enough voices support it.  I firmly oppose censorship in all forms. People have the right to know everything. Parents can still decide what their children should or should not access. Let individuals determine what is unacceptable to them. Censorship goes against the principles of Western democracies, as it strips away all freedoms. Democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government, which censored everything within the @CAPS4 @CAPS5.  History has repeatedly shown that totalitarianism fails. People must be free to live their own lives. Only then will they defend their countries to preserve freedom. In both World Wars, the free and uncensored people of democracies overthrew totalitarian regimes.  Words are just words, and people will always have different views. Disagreements are inevitable, but we must prevent censorship and accept diversity. If we fail to do so, censorship will prevail, and people will lose the right to believe in what they want. It is up to humanity to make the right decision, especially at this crucial time. What the future holds remains uncertain, but the choice is ours.
452	3429	2	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,  I believe that if a book on the library shelf is found offensive, it should be removed. Library users often fight over a single book. If there are disputes over a book, the library should have multiple copies. A lack of multiple copies can cause many problems for everyone.  When people fight over a single book in the library, in my opinion, the first - comer should get the book, but that's just my view. If two people fight over a book, they should be banned from the library. This is the root cause of book - related fights. Next time you're in the library, think before you act. Ask yourself, ""Did they get there before me?""  Libraries should have multiple copies of books. For example, if the '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' book series is in the library with only one copy of each book, and the last book of the series is coming out on @DATE2 (@DATE1), and many people, especially kids, want to read it, having just one copy won't suffice. The solution is to get more copies.  A lack of multiple copies of books can lead to chaos and fights. You don't want to see people fighting in a library (refer to @CAPS4 @NUM1). If I were in that situation, I'd let others have the book if they wanted it. So, libraries clearly need more copies.  In conclusion, offensive books should be removed from the shelf. Fights over books are unacceptable. Libraries need to have multiple copies to avoid such conflicts. Failing to do so will create problems. So, think before you act, as a book can be offensive at times.  Sincerely, @PERSON1"
453	3430	2	2	The concept of an offensive item, such as a book, music, movie, or magazine, is highly subjective. Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive. Some items with graphic content, cursing, etc., offend most people, but there are always others who do not find the same things offensive.  Items that contain content offensive to the majority, like graphic scenes or excessive cursing, should be placed in a separate area of the library, away from the general collection. In fact, no one can definitively say that a particular book, music, movie, or magazine does not have the right to be on a shelf and should or should not be removed.  If parents do not want their children or teenagers to access certain materials, it is their responsibility, not that of the library or other institutions. At home, parents have the right to remove items they deem inappropriate from their shelves. If a child or teen accesses something the parents don't want them to, either the parents shouldn't have bought it or should have removed it earlier.  As a stranger, one cannot justify whether an item is offensive and whether a parent should restrict their child's access to it, or whether a library or store should stock it. If you don't want your children to see certain content, it's up to you to set standards and rules. In the end, the determination of what is offensive and appropriate should be left to individual parents and their family circumstances.
454	3431	2	2	Every book conveys a meaning or message that is valuable for people to know. Removing a book from a library shelf can deprive someone of knowledge they might need. Just because a book may have certain views that could be offensive does not mean it should be excluded from the shelf. Books should not be discriminated against based on their content from the perspective of the reader. Both positive and negative books should be available on the shelves for those who are interested.  Regarding music and movies, while it may be reasonable to categorize them in a similar way, they are not really necessary in a library. A library is a place for peace, quiet, and relaxation. If music or movies become a distraction or a hazard, they should not be allowed. However, on the positive side, music and movies can provide comfort when one is reading a good book. It is understandable to have a bit of variety along with the knowledge in books.  Magazines are also not essential in a library. A magazine can contain a mix of good and bad content. Not all magazines have educational value; most are for entertainment and providing updates on well - known figures around the world. Therefore, magazines should be removed from the library.  The library should be a learning environment, stocked with materials that aid learning rather than just for entertainment. Removing a book from the shelf is equivalent to reducing the available knowledge. No matter what the content of a book may be, it should not be removed. As for music, movies, and magazines, their use in the library should be limited. In summary, the library's focus should be on facilitating learning, and the availability of various materials should be carefully considered to achieve this goal.
455	3432	2	2	The idea that '@CAPS1' should be taken off the shelves is unfounded. In fact, for any book, one can find something negative about it. It's impossible to shield kids from all bad things. Whether it's cursing, sex, gore, or racism, teens will encounter these elements. It's better for them to encounter them in books rather than in real life.  Most young - adult books contain cursing. Teens hear cursing every day at home, school, or work. It's an inevitable part of life, and there's no way to stop it.  Many adults think that if they don't shelter teens, they'll be exposed to bad things in music. What these adults don't understand is that teens do what makes them happy. Today's music can be very offensive, but that's what's popular in the music world.  Imagine a child from a difficult home who only has a radio that can pick up one pop - music station. This music makes the child happy. Would you really take away this source of happiness just because the music is offensive to some?  Sex is present in many great books. If a child is reading about sex at home, they're less likely to engage in it outside. Additionally, sex can enhance the quality of a book. I've read books with rape and other sexual acts, but I've only read about them, not experienced them.  Race is another important topic. 'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6' is an excellent book that every child should read to learn. Learning about these issues is the essence of reading.  Sheltering us doesn't protect us; it only makes us more curious about what we can't have. Music, books, magazines, and other media help us learn. Don't take this opportunity away from us. If we're not interested, we won't read or listen. Let us make our own choices and learn from our own experiences. It's our life, and we should be allowed to make our own mistakes.
456	3433	2	2	In my view, libraries and librarians should carefully consider what items to place on the shelves of public libraries to ensure fairness for all. Many people enjoy libraries, which are present in almost every town. People visit libraries to read books, use computers, and engage in family activities. However, there are restrictions due to age or other prohibitions. Some may question whether the advantages and disadvantages of library policies are fair.  Most people recognize that irresponsible behavior, such as damaging checked - out items or returning them late, can result in costs equivalent to purchasing the item. Responsible patrons have no such issues. Additionally, some believe that if an item cannot be touched or checked out, it should not be in the library, as it can be frustrating for patrons who wish to access it.  Libraries could maintain distinct sections for kids, middle - schoolers and teenagers, and high - schoolers and adults. This would likely lead to a more equitable experience for everyone, as the public library is meant for the entire community.  In conclusion, after presenting these facts and opinions, it is hoped that libraries and librarians will reflect on their shelving decisions to make the library a fair place for all. The question remains: Are the advantages and disadvantages at the library fair enough for everyone?
457	3434	2	2	I'm writing to your newspaper company, sharing the same sentiment as Katherine Paterson. I firmly believe that certain books, specifically those numbered @NUM2 and any sexual books, should not be available in public libraries. These books can have a lasting negative impact on a child's mind. In my opinion, any books containing such content should not be on the library shelves.  Moreover, there should be more scrutiny of books with inappropriate language, as it can influence a person's thoughts. Let me give an example. Suppose a young boy asks a librarian where the action books are. The librarian might say he's too young for those books, but the child could reply that he heard it was a great book and his big brother recommended it.  In conclusion, based on these concerns, I believe that public libraries should take steps to remove inappropriate books from their shelves to protect the well - being of their patrons. Sincerely, your customer @PERSON2.
458	3435	2	2	"I think the idea of removing certain items from the shelves is wrong. People should have the freedom to read, listen to, or watch whatever they want. When someone reads something that might be considered ""bad,"" they may or may not like it. So, books, movies, and music that some might find offensive should not be removed.  People should have the choice in what they consume. Some people enjoy reading ""bad"" books because they find them interesting. If they don't like a book, they can simply put it back and find something else. When it comes to movies, it's a good idea to rent a new one first to see if it has offensive scenes. And for younger viewers, they should watch with an adult.  Music that some find offensive should stay on the shelves. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's bad for everyone. However, magazines are an exception. Magazines with inappropriate content should be removed from the shelves. People who want them can order them online and have them mailed to their homes.  In conclusion, books, movies, and music should remain on the shelves, but magazines with inappropriate content can be taken away. People have the right to enjoy the things they like, even if they contain what some might consider ""bad"" stuff."
459	3436	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should not remove books, music, movies, and magazines from their shelves. Many people find entertainment in movies with sexual or violent content. If we take all offensive items off the shelves, some people will be disappointed.  In today's generation, people are eager to see things they can't experience at home with their parents. Modern music often contains bad language, but that's what makes it appealing to many. The same goes for movies. Books, music, and movies today frequently discuss sexual intercourse, illegal drugs, and criminal involvement, which capture our attention and pique our interest.  If you have a child or family member you don't want exposed to offensive material, you can prevent them from accessing it. Many stores with offensive items keep them in a back room. Just because some people find these things offensive doesn't mean libraries should remove them.  People can make their own decisions about what to read, watch, or listen to. Everyone has their own preferences and opinions. I think libraries will attract more business by keeping offensive items on the shelves. Younger people are especially drawn to things that seem like a dream or are very unrealistic.  In conclusion, libraries should keep offensive music, books, movies, and magazines on the shelves. We have the freedom to choose what we want, and many people find pleasure in watching or listening to such things. If you don't like it, don't look for it at the library.
460	3437	2	2	If you're offended by a book, magazine, music, or movie, simply don't read, watch, or listen to it. America should not have widespread censorship. Censorship is appropriate for young children, but adults should be able to handle offensive content. If you're an adult and get offended by a word like the '@CAPS1 - word' in a book, just don't read it. If a movie has offensive language, don't watch it. I completely disagree with the idea of removing vulgar words.  I'm not offended by swearing because it can be used in a humorous way, like in jokes, or it can enhance a mediocre song. Censorship has its uses, but vulgar things should not be removed from society, and they never will be.  Kids often learn cuss words from parents or friends. If you don't want your child to be exposed to cussing, it's your responsibility as a parent to remove them from such situations and create a more appropriate environment.  In conclusion, while censorship has a role in protecting children, adults should have the freedom to encounter and deal with offensive content. Society should not try to completely eliminate vulgarity, and parents should take on the task of protecting their children's environment.
461	3438	2	2	In my view, most books, magazines, or other reading materials containing offensive content are acceptable. Many people need to read them to understand what they are about. I believe that people often take offense at minor things, such as curse words or when a book or magazine discusses drugs. In fact, I doubt there is a single book without a curse word. People frequently complain about such trivial matters, even though the reading material could be far worse. I've read numerous books with inappropriate words. Once, I encountered a book with an appealing title, but it was filled with curse words when I started reading. That's just the way it is these days; it's almost impossible to find a book without at least one bad word. People should learn to accept that offensive content is common in various reading materials. I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves. What might not interest you could be fascinating to someone else. Everyone has different opinions, and it should be up to individuals to decide whether to read, listen to, or look at certain materials. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of people's interests and choices when it comes to reading materials.
462	3439	2	2	The question of whether to remove books, music, and movies from library shelves should not even be raised. As stated in our constitution, people have the right to access information, a privilege that has existed since the founding of this great country. Moreover, individuals have the freedom to choose whether to pick up a particular book. Therefore, removing certain types of books and movies from library shelves is completely unacceptable. The constitution guarantees people the freedom of speech, religion, and access to information. For this reason, libraries should provide as much information as possible on their shelves. Even if some content is inappropriate, it can still serve an educational purpose, especially for children whose childhood is largely about learning. Parents and teachers always encourage children to explore new topics beyond what is taught in school or at home. Removing books from the shelves would only deprive our youth of knowledge. All books and magazines may be beneficial to some and offensive to others. Should we go against the constitution and deny those who could benefit from this information? Another aspect of the constitution is the freedom of choice. Even if there are books or magazines that some may find inappropriate on the shelves, children have the option to pick them up or not. Parents should simply advise their children to avoid such materials and choose something else. Books that seem inappropriate to some do not harm anyone by just sitting on the shelves. However, some people may find such books interesting and decide to borrow them, which has no impact on those who are not supposed to view such content. Finally, it is easy to avoid such information; one just needs to ignore it and move on. Personally, as a child, I was restricted from watching certain movies, reading certain books, or looking at certain magazines. For example, I was not allowed to watch rated - R movies or materials with inappropriate sexual content. I simply avoided such materials, and it was not difficult. I believe it would be unfair to remove these materials from libraries because it is a matter of individual choice. In conclusion, removing materials from library shelves goes against the constitution and the principle of individual freedom. We should respect people's right to access information and make their own choices.
463	3440	2	2	Libraries are a great source of information, housing a vast collection of books on almost any imaginable topic. They are extremely convenient, with many located in our communities. However, if a library were to carry misleading or offensive books, music, movies, or magazines, it could face serious problems. If any source of information in the library offends someone, the person should inform the librarian or the manager, and the item should be removed from the shelf. People expect libraries to provide clean and appropriate materials. A library is meant to be a quiet place where people can browse or quickly obtain the information they need. Most libraries are very selective about what they put on their shelves. If someone places an inappropriate item on the shelf knowing it should not be there, they should be fired. In conclusion, libraries are essential to towns and cities. However, it is crucial to keep an eye out for offensive materials. If such materials are found, they should be reported immediately to the librarian or the manager. While libraries may or may not get into trouble for having offensive items, it is in their best interest to maintain a clean and appropriate collection.
464	3441	2	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My answer is no. These materials can be valuable in helping us through life. The world is full of unpleasant and difficult things, and life is not always easy. Some of these seemingly offensive books can assist us in making decisions. Here are the reasons for my view. First, these materials can have a long - term positive impact on others. Some books deal with real - life issues, like teenage girls becoming mothers at a young age or kids dropping out of school and ending up on the streets, in jail, or in even worse situations. Such books can make a difference in someone's life. Second, these books can serve as guides. For instance, when people read about violence, sex, drugs, and other real - world problems in books, they can see what they don't want to experience. I once read a book called ""My Hood"" that described many real - life situations I had witnessed, such as gang - banging, sex, drugs, and street fights. Third, many people prefer to find solutions in books rather than seeking advice from others. These books can offer support and guidance to those going through similar problems. In conclusion, I firmly believe that offensive materials should not be removed from the shelves. They talk about real life, and life is not always fair. We should recognize the value of these materials in helping us understand the world and make better decisions."
465	3442	2	2	The books I've read in libraries so far don't seem offensive to anyone. I haven't listened to the music or watched the movies in libraries, and the magazines also seem fine. However, this doesn't mean there aren't any offensive materials. If there are, I think they should be removed from the libraries. But I suspect that if someone finds something offensive, they might just put it back and not visit the library again. If every book, music, movie, and magazine that people find offensive were removed, a large number of items would be taken out, which would be unfair to others who might want to read, listen to, or watch them. They would be very angry if they discovered that these materials were removed because others found them offensive. Some people may understand that certain materials can hurt others' feelings or be offensive, while others don't care. I believe that extremely offensive materials should be removed, especially to protect young children from getting their feelings hurt. But if the materials are not that bad, they should remain in the library, and people probably won't mind. If really offensive materials are kept in the library, fewer and fewer people will want to visit. Therefore, the best solution is to remove these offensive materials to keep library - goers happy. Many people enjoy reading as a form of entertainment, and they would be very disappointed if they couldn't visit the library due to such trivial issues. In conclusion, a balanced approach is needed to manage offensive materials in libraries, ensuring that the rights and interests of all users are respected.
466	3443	2	2	Censorship: To Censor or Not to Censor? Censorship is a pressing question that merits serious consideration. Many people may not realize it, but the content we consume through reading and watching significantly impacts us. For example, when children watch scary movies, nightmares tend to occur more frequently. Similarly, if teenagers read books that glorify bad behavior and make it seem cool, they may start to perceive such behavior as acceptable. Imagine reading an article filled with offensive language and inappropriate ideas. Most people would be offended and voice their complaints. Just as we would be annoyed if an old man on the street yelled obtrusive things and would tell him to stop, we should question why it is acceptable to watch movies with similar content. Clearly, books and movies should be censored. Children are highly impressionable at a young age. When they are exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol, and drugs in books or movies, they may think such behavior is normal. For instance, when I was young, I watched the movie '@CAPS1,' which seemed to contain a profanity in every other line. Seeing my favorite actors in the movie using bad words made me think it was okay. It is unacceptable for a child to talk offensively like that. I once heard a little @LOCATION2 quoting lines from the '@CAPS3,' a movie that is hilarious but extremely suggestive. It was disheartening to hear an innocent child talking about things beyond their comprehension. Teenagers who listen to music from @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 are receiving negative messages. Although these rappers are regarded as modern - day music heroes, their glorification is unwarranted. Their songs are mainly about smoking weed and getting high, making such activities seem cool. As a result, teenagers think, '@CAPS5 if they can do it, so can I!' and start engaging in previously frowned - upon activities. If they were not exposed to this kind of music, they would be less likely to participate in such behavior. Adults' movies and books should also be censored. Some adults may think that they can do as they please once they are older, but this is not the case. Consider a husband and wife watching a movie together. When an inappropriate scene comes on, it not only creates an awkward situation but also sends the wrong message. When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it may seem acceptable to them. They may start to lose the concept of abstinence until marriage, which is the only way to avoid certain diseases. If movies, books, magazines, and music remain uncensored, the world will become a chaotic place. People will lose their sense of right and wrong. We are on the verge of violence and total chaos. If we continue to expose ourselves and our children to such content, the situation will deteriorate. Therefore, libraries and stores should censor any offensive material before it corrupts more minds.
467	3444	2	2	I firmly believe that movies, books, music, and other forms of media should not be removed from shelves. People have the right to form their own opinions about what they choose to listen to, read, or watch, as everyone has a different level of maturity. Parents who are concerned about their children's media consumption can restrict their access, but no one else should have the power to decide what another person's child can or cannot view. People are entitled to determine what is appropriate for themselves. Whether it is books, movies, or music, individuals have the choice of whether to engage with a particular item. While it is reasonable to reserve more explicit content for adults, it is difficult for one person or company to define the appropriate age level for all materials. Different people have different sensitivities and perspectives. Many parents may disagree with this view, as they believe children should be protected from the violence, vulgar images, and language in the media. However, they also advocate for the right to raise their children as they see fit. Parents can censor what their children watch, but they should not impose their views on others. Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean that others will. If someone finds a particular piece of media offensive, they should have the common sense to stop consuming it. Everyone has the right to make such a choice, and companies should not take this right away. Parents can control their children's media exposure, and adults can make their own decisions. This clearly shows that items such as books, movies, and music should remain on the shelves. In conclusion, the freedom of choice in media consumption is essential. By allowing individuals to decide for themselves, we respect their diverse opinions and maintain a healthy and inclusive media environment.
468	3445	2	2	I am strongly opposed to the use of censorship in libraries. I believe that no one has the right to restrict people's access to certain materials just because someone deems them offensive, as this is merely a subjective opinion. What one person considers offensive may be highly valued by millions of others. In today's world, if everything were censored, there would be nothing left, not even the church, as everyone has their own beliefs and opinions. Eventually, everything would be eliminated because there will always be at least one person who finds something offensive in some way. If censorship were implemented everywhere, schools would be unable to teach half of the material they currently cover, and children would have limited resources. Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. As I have previously mentioned, if everything were censored, there would be nothing left to enjoy. Think about it: would you like someone telling you that you are not allowed to read or listen to certain materials just because they find them offensive? I am sure most people, especially adults, would be upset. Everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to. Therefore, if you are asked whether censorship in libraries should be allowed, consider all these points before giving your answer. Once censorship starts, it may lead to the control of all aspects of people's lives. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not a viable solution. It restricts freedom of expression and limits people's access to diverse ideas. We should respect each other's opinions and allow for a wide range of materials to be available in libraries.
469	3446	2	2	Katherine Paterson's quote makes a very valid point. In my opinion, it is completely true. Everyone thinks and perceives things differently, so what is offensive to one person may be perfectly acceptable to another. For example, one person's trash could be another person's treasure. A movie that touches one person deeply may be considered disgusting by someone else sitting right next to them. I once had a real - life experience that illustrates this point. In seventh grade, I loved playing a particular PlayStation game with my friends every day. However, my mother and most of the @LOCATION1 found it offensive. They tried to ban the game from local stores, which I thought was unfair, selfish, and inconsiderate. It felt like they were taking away something I loved and disregarding my feelings. In the library, people should be able to read whatever they want without the fear of their favorite books being removed from the shelves because a group of people protests against the language or other elements they find offensive. If this continues, everything will eventually be removed from the shelves, as everyone has different opinions. If you don't like a book, you should simply return it and not read it again. In conclusion, I believe that people should have the freedom to read any book they choose in the library. Censoring books based on the opinions of a few is unjust and restricts the flow of diverse ideas. We should respect each other's right to access different types of literature.
470	3447	2	2	The world is filled with people having a multitude of opinions. For instance, while one person may find an art piece unique, another may not see its beauty at all. In such a diverse world, if people struggle to understand others' perspectives, they should not be exposed to potentially offensive books or movies. I recall my seventh - grade experience. I was a shy and insecure girl who had just moved to a new school. I felt like an outcast for most of the first half of the school year. I tried everything, from changing my clothes to dyeing my hair, but still, I was unnoticed. Then @PERSON1 came into my life. @PERSON1, who had also just joined the school, seemed bold and confident. At first, people only gave a friendly wave. One day, as I sat alone at lunch, @PERSON1 asked to sit with me. We talked throughout the lunch period and discovered many common interests. Over time, we became great friends, and I trusted @PERSON1 with all my secrets. However, I always felt that @PERSON1 was hiding something. Whenever I mustered the courage to ask, the answer was always no. One afternoon after school, something felt off. We didn't talk until we reached my house. Then @PERSON1 suddenly asked, '@CAPS1 are people so cruel?' I was shocked and didn't know how to respond. @PERSON1 then revealed, 'I'm gay.' I was appalled not because of @PERSON1's sexual orientation but because @PERSON1 had never told me. @PERSON1 explained that @CAPS3 had overheard some classmates in the library reading a book that made fun of gays. I firmly believe that offensive books, movies, or music should not be available on shelves. Some people have never experienced being offended, while others may unknowingly or deliberately offend others. Everyone has feelings, and being offended can be hurtful. As a community, we should respect one another and avoid exposing people to offensive content. In conclusion, by censoring offensive materials, we can create a more inclusive and respectful environment where people's feelings are protected, and everyone can co - exist harmoniously.
471	3448	2	2	To the Newspaper, I firmly believe that if certain books, magazines, or other reading materials are found offensive, they should be removed from public display. In any situation, there are three possible outcomes: one - side benefits, both sides benefit, or neither side benefits. If an article or piece of writing is not suitable for certain audiences, it should not be publicly accessible. Instead, it should be placed in a secluded area for mature audiences who can handle the influence and consequences associated with such material.  Studies and personal observations have shown that teens and young children are often influenced by explicit media content. They tend to mimic what they see. For example, if they watch a violent movie, they may think it is acceptable to act violently. Until they reach an age of maturity and responsibility, they are easily swayed by external influences.  As children grow up, they are expected to follow rules and respect authority. Authority figures play a crucial role in a child's development. The people who display offensive media often fail to consider the aftermath of their actions, which relates to the saying “think before you speak.”  It's important to note that offensive material can affect not only children and teens but also adults. I'm not suggesting that everyone who reads about a murderer will become one. However, our surroundings and upbringing shape who we are, and the media can provide ideas that dominate our thoughts.  I believe that certain offensive media should be either kept in restricted areas or have an age - limit. My concern about public media display is centered around its impact on human lives. Thank you for your attention. Sincerely, @LOCATION1.
472	3449	2	2	There is an ongoing debate regarding whether certain books, music, or magazines should be removed from library shelves. Many people find some of these materials offensive or inappropriate for young readers and advocate for their removal. They argue that exposing young people to such content can influence their decision - making and behavior. They worry that it may corrupt young minds, leading to more aggressive behavior or poor decision - making regarding their own well - being and that of others. These individuals want libraries to be healthy learning environments where young minds can develop naturally, free from the influence of offensive material.  On the other hand, some people believe that it is not anyone else's right to remove these materials. They argue that it is the readers' right to choose whether to read them. Young readers are likely to learn about the content regardless of whether it is in the library. They think it is better for young readers to learn about such things in a safe environment like a library rather than from someone else later in life, which could be a more dangerous situation.  I hold a balanced view. I believe that it is not appropriate for someone to remove these books from libraries, but I also think they should not be easily accessible to young readers. While these books may be offensive to some, it is a matter of personal choice. The books that are not suitable for young readers should be placed on higher shelves or in a separate section of the library. If parents want their children to learn about the content in a safe way, they should explain it to them themselves. In the end, we all have the right to choose what we read and listen to, and it is a personal decision.
473	3450	2	2	There are certain books that I believe should be removed from library shelves. The quote “Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it” is highly relevant here. One such book is 'The @ORGANIZATION1'. This book contains instructions on building bombs and using firearms. It promotes hate towards people based on their religion and appearance. It also spreads propaganda about how the @CAPS1 should not be alive, which is utterly disgusting. Removing this book would give me peace of mind.  Another book that should be removed was written by @PERSON1, a man responsible for sending countless people, including men, women, and children, to gas chambers and death camps. One of the victims was @PERSON2, a talented writer who went into hiding from the Gestapo. Due to @PERSON1, the @CAPS7 lost one of its greatest writers in the @DATE1's. This book is filled with hate messages, claiming that the @CAPS4 people should not live among the so - called @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. However, keeping this book is also important as it serves as a reminder of the atrocities of the past, preventing another @CAPS8.  In conclusion, libraries should implement censorship, but only for books that are truly offensive and harmful, not for those that have historical value.
474	3451	2	2	The library is a public space where people can find a wide variety of books, movies, and magazines. Since not everyone has the same taste in reading or viewing, libraries aim to offer a diverse collection. When someone comes across offensive material, they should not overreact and demand its removal from the shelves.  I oppose the removal of offensive entertainment from libraries because it is unfair to other library members. For instance, if a group of adults enjoys a movie that some find disturbing, removing it would lead to a loss of business. If a mother reports an inappropriate movie for her six - year - old son, it would be unfair to those who are mature enough to watch it.  As public property, libraries have the responsibility to meet the public's entertainment needs. They should provide books, movies, etc., for anyone who wants them. If a person dislikes a particular item, they should look elsewhere.  A few years ago, my mom stopped taking my brother and me to the library because of the numerous complaints about inappropriate books being added or removed. That year, the library lost @PERCENT1 of its customers as every attempt to please one group dissatisfied another.  If all entertainment items remain on the library shelves, everyone can be satisfied. Those who don't approve of something can simply look at other options. Complaining only creates more work for oneself. In short, libraries should maintain a diverse collection to serve all patrons.
475	3452	2	2	The question of whether certain books should be restricted from certain people is a complex one. In my opinion, people should have the freedom to read and listen to whatever interests them. As long as they can read and understand the content, they should be allowed to access it.  Books and music are great learning tools. They allow us to experience different situations we may never encounter in real life. They are also a means of self - expression. Although some parents may not want their children to know certain things, the world is full of unpleasant realities, and children will learn about them eventually.  However, movies are a different case. They are rated for a reason. For a rated @CAPS2 film, I think @NUM1 - year - olds and above can watch it. By this age, they have been through high school, sex education classes, and have been exposed to various sexual, perverted, and cruel concepts.  It is not advisable to take young children to see movies not rated for them. For example, taking a @NUM3 - year - old to a scary movie can scare and scar them with images of blood, stabbing, and sexual content.  In conclusion, movies should be kept rated according to their intended audience. Books and music, on the other hand, are valuable for learning and self - expression. We should make use of the freedom we have to learn, experience, and express ourselves.
476	3453	2	2	I have a deep - seated passion for reading and have read numerous books since entering high school. Among the many books I've read during my high - school years, three of the best ones covered topics like drugs, rape, and partying and contained inappropriate language. Some parents might object to their children reading such books and demand their removal from the school library. However, I firmly believe this is completely wrong. We enjoy the freedoms of speech and the press, so there is no valid reason these books shouldn't be in our school libraries. What offends some parents may not bother others. In most cases, children often have different views from their parents and will read, watch, or listen to whatever they desire. People have diverse opinions, and we have the right to hold our own. Some parents advocate for removing these types of books from the library, but that's a misstep. If you don't like them, simply don't read them or guide your children away from them. After all, it's just a book, not a real - life occurrence. Moreover, books are categorized by age. Young children will pick books from the children's section, which are appropriately tailored for them. Teenagers also have their own section and should be mature enough to handle what they read. I am against the removal of certain materials from libraries just because a few people find them offensive. This would deprive those who enjoy such books. If everyone starts claiming everything is offensive, there will be no books left for those who don't share these sensitivities. When I become an adult, I'll communicate my expectations to my children and let them make their own choices. They will do so regardless. If they want to read a book or watch a movie with inappropriate language, so be it. It's not as if they're actually engaging in the actions described. In conclusion, removing books from libraries due to complaints about offensiveness is a completely unjust practice.
477	3454	2	2	I am of the opinion that certain materials, including specific books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves. There are indeed some books with awful content, and the pictures on magazine covers, CD cases, or movie/DVD cases can contain elements that many people find highly offensive. Although I've never personally encountered such materials, this issue occurs in schools worldwide. People may not fully understand the intent of certain materials, but they can easily get offended and report it. They usually advise others not to access these materials and inform the school about their offense. Removing certain offensive materials from the shelves is a necessary step. By doing so, we can create a more suitable environment for everyone, especially in educational institutions where the well - being and development of students are of utmost importance. In conclusion, taking action to remove offensive materials is crucial to maintain a proper and respectful space.
478	3455	2	2	"Libraries have the right to determine the level of censorship for the materials on their shelves. Much of this material may be considered offensive by certain individuals. However, what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. Americans possess the freedoms of speech, writing, and many other rights. A library should have the autonomy to place whatever materials it deems appropriate on its shelves. There will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines in the world. Just because some materials may be offensive to some, they may not be offensive to others. A library cannot satisfy everyone's preferences. As Paterson said, ""But if they have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then they also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And we have no books on the shelf for any of us."" This statement highlights that if people keep demanding the removal of offensive materials, eventually, all books will be removed, leaving the shelves empty. A library is a place where everyone can come to find what they need without disturbances. A person may not be looking for offensive content, and encountering such material can be disturbing. However, they should attempt to ignore it. It is their choice to visit a particular library. So, they may end up coming across offensive materials. If someone does not want to encounter offensive content, they should choose not to visit the library. Americans have the right to freedom, and libraries should also have this right. When a person comes across offensive material, they should ignore it. A library cannot please everyone by removing all potentially offensive merchandise; otherwise, there would be nothing left. People should be aware that they may encounter offensive materials when visiting a library, and it is ultimately their choice whether to use that library. In conclusion, libraries should be allowed to manage their collections based on their own judgment, and people should be responsible for their choices when using libraries."
479	3456	2	2	I firmly believe that some materials should be removed from library shelves if they are extremely offensive. However, if a material aids in learning, it should remain. Everyone has different views on what is offensive or appropriate, especially when it comes to books, music, movies, and magazines. Each person should check the cover of a book or other materials to determine its suitability. Libraries should use warning stickers on books to inform readers about graphic or vulgar language. By doing so, fewer books will be removed from the shelves. My decision is to refrain from removing certain materials unless they are offensive. Libraries should implement the use of warning stickers so that readers are aware in advance of any inappropriate content. I am convinced that this approach will help reduce the problems in libraries. I once had a personal experience that solidified my belief. When I was young and just starting to read, I came across a book. I was reading it to my mother, and she took the book away after I said an inappropriate word. She then informed the librarian. Since then, my mother always ensures that the books my younger brothers choose are appropriate for their age group. Wouldn't you do the same for your children? I certainly would, not only for my own kids but for all children. In conclusion, using warning stickers in libraries is a practical solution that can balance the needs of different readers and maintain the availability of a diverse range of materials.
480	3457	2	2	In today's world, being a child is far from easy. Their minds are constantly filled with ideas and thoughts, whether it's the stress of school or their plans for the day. The last thing on a child's mind is whether the literature they're reading is offensive. I strongly oppose increasing censorship beyond its current level. Although parents and the government may disagree, censorship will only make our future children more closed - minded and sheltered. Children should not lose their innocence prematurely, but they also shouldn't be naive about the world. Censorship is already applied to music and movies, yet it has limited effectiveness. Children still listen to age - inappropriate music without fully understanding the lyrics. Censoring movies and TV shows won't help much either, as the internet has made it easier for teens and children to access various content. Unless we censor the internet, which no one wants, we need to allow our children to be more exposed to the real world. They will discover certain things sooner or later. Censorship will eventually shape how our world functions, but it doesn't have to. If parents spent more time talking to their children about different issues, censorship wouldn't be necessary. By having open and honest conversations, parents can help children develop the ability to distinguish right from wrong. In conclusion, instead of relying on censorship, we should focus on educating children through communication, allowing them to grow into well - informed and balanced individuals.
481	3458	2	2	Hello! My name is @PERSON1. I'm writing to you on @DATE1 because there's a great deal of conflict regarding the issue of whether offensive materials in the library should be removed from the shelves. I understand that people may either agree or disagree, but in my opinion, these materials should remain where they are.  People around the world often get overly concerned about minor matters in life. What we fail to understand is that there will always be things we dislike, and this is an unchangeable fact. Take, for example, the situation where people are offended by library materials and demand their removal. It's time for people to wake up and realize that they won't always get things exactly as they wish. There will always be things they have to deal with.  I firmly believe that these types of materials should stay put because people can simply overlook them; they just choose not to. We tend to make a big fuss over something so trivial. People should just ignore it and move on. Instead of sitting there complaining, they should turn around and walk away. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean others don't. Everyone in the world needs to recognize that there will be things they don't like, but they have to get over them and move forward. This is an inevitable part of life, and there's nothing we can do to change it.  People around the universe may either agree or disagree with what I'm saying, but it's a matter of perspective, and everyone has the right to their own opinion. I will reiterate that these materials should stay, and people need to stop being so self - centered. They should see the truth of life and understand that even when there are things they don't like, they shouldn't argue about it. They should just leave it alone and go their own way.  So, this is my stance on the matter. People need to accept that they won't always get what they want in life, and they should learn to move on. If someone has a problem with library materials, such as being offended by them and wanting them removed, well, they need to learn to walk away. What one person likes may not be what others like, and vice versa. We just have to continue with life and leave these materials be because other people's opinions may not match ours. We should leave the materials alone and learn to accept that we won't always have our way in life. Instead of making a big deal out of something so minor, we should learn to let it go.
482	3459	2	2	I firmly hold the view that books should not be censored. If a book is on the library shelf, anyone should have the right to pick it up. In libraries, books are readily accessible, and young children often grab them. If the books are within their sight, there's no reason they can't read them. In my numerous visits to libraries, I've never come across an offensive book. If a book were truly offensive, I believe the library wouldn't make it available to the public.  During all my library visits, I've never encountered an offensive book. If commercial television can air certain content, then libraries should be able to display certain books. Reading is a great way to sharpen the mind. If a child picks up an adult - oriented book, who are we to say no? Libraries shouldn't be overly cautious about what they put on the shelves. If someone believes a particular book is inappropriate, they simply won't pick it up. If a parent doesn't want their child to read a certain book, they shouldn't have brought the child to the library in the first place.  If you don't like the music selection in the library, you can go to a different store. Libraries have more important issues to deal with than catering to individual music preferences. If you don't like the magazines in the library, you can order them online. There's no valid reason to complain about a library. A library is a place that offers assistance. It's not mandatory to visit a library. If you don't like what it has, you can simply choose not to go.  These are my well - founded reasons for believing that books, magazines, movies, and other materials in libraries should not be censored. If you don't like the movies in the library, don't go there. If you think the magazines are inappropriate, order them online. If you don't like the books, order them online or go to a bookstore. In conclusion, I am convinced that books should remain uncensored.
483	3460	2	2	As many would concur, censorship has emerged as a significant and growing concern globally. In my personal opinion, censorship is necessary to a certain degree. When an individual deems the content of music, a movie, or a book to be questionable, they have the freedom to decide whether to read, listen, or watch.  Among the various forms of media subject to debate, movies have a well - defined rating system, similar to the censorship applied to music. Movies are rated '@CAPS1' for general audiences, '@CAPS2' indicating the need for parental guidance, '@NUM1' suggesting parental guidance for viewers aged @NUM2 and older, and '@CAPS3' meaning that viewers under the age of @NUM3 are either advised or required to be accompanied by an adult during the screening. At home, the enforcement of these ratings depends on the parents' preferences. At movie theaters, however, these restrictions are more strictly enforced. Viewers under the age of thirteen are not allowed to watch a '@NUM1' or '@CAPS3' rated movie without being accompanied by an adult (aged @NUM5 or older). Those under @NUM3 cannot enter a '@CAPS3' rated movie screening without being accompanied by someone @NUM7 or older. The strictness of these restrictions may vary depending on the location. Ultimately, the rating system aims to prompt parents to make decisions about what is appropriate for their children.  Regarding radio music, all profanity is censored by 'bleeping' out the offensive words. When it comes to purchasing music, artists are required to produce two versions of the same album: one with censorship and one without. This usually places the decision - making responsibility on the parents, assuming they are the ones buying the music for their children.  In the case of books, there is no formal rating system. Instead, books are classified into different genres, which give readers an idea of the intended audience. Genres commonly include 'adult', 'young adult', and 'children' sections in libraries and bookstores. Similar to music and television, the final decision regarding book purchases lies with the parents.  Despite the numerous restrictions in place, the censorship system is not without flaws. Clearly, younger children (aged @NUM2 or younger) are unlikely to have identification. This leaves movie theater staff to make subjective judgments about a viewer's age, and appearances can be deceiving. Buying music online also doesn't require age verification. It's difficult to prove a person's age in such cases. When purchasing a book, cashiers rarely stop children from buying books that may be inappropriate for their age. Perhaps children of all ages should be issued with identification. However, despite these underlying problems, the responsibility for ensuring appropriate media consumption seems to ultimately fall on the parents.  Censorship is a hot - button issue for parents in today's society. In reality, if parents have concerns about the content of media, they have the power to remove the material or restrict their children's access to it. In conclusion, the issue of censorship boils down to the personal preferences of parents.
484	3461	2	2	I firmly believe that no books should be removed from the library shelves. People have diverse tastes when it comes to books, magazines, and movies. If someone finds a particular item offensive, they should simply ignore it and find something else that suits their taste. The fact that people have different preferences is what makes us unique. If everyone had the same taste in everything, the world would be an incredibly boring place.  Personally, I'm particularly fond of horror novels. In my opinion, they are full of excitement, with all the elements of killing and suspense. I'm not an avid reader in general; I only read when I have absolutely nothing else to do. It's quite challenging for me to switch to different genres of novels, such as romance, adventure, or even poetry. Understanding poetry requires a great deal of effort because it often contains complex and descriptive language. Take @PERSON1, for example. He's one of my favorite poets and is quite famous for his works. However, his fame didn't come until after his death.  In conclusion, it's evident that people have different tastes in books, magazines, movies, and poetry. We are all unique individuals, and this diversity in our preferences should be respected. Therefore, we should leave all types of books on the shelves so that everyone can find something that appeals to them.
485	3462	2	2	How frequently do you come across books or magazines that you wouldn't want children to read? I encounter such materials on a daily basis. For example, the language used in some books, like swearing, is something we often hear, whether we're with friends or in a crowd. It's an unavoidable part of our daily lives.  I strongly believe that libraries should not have materials that are inappropriate for children, especially those that are easily accessible to them. A library is a public place, and no one wants to see children with offensive books in it. Imagine if a child got hold of a book that dealt with crimes, rape, or other disturbing events. It could give the child nightmares or have a negative impact on their perception of the world.  Children often imitate what they read or see. If a child reads something inappropriate, they may think it's okay to do or say those things. For instance, if a child hears or reads offensive language, they might repeat it to their parents or friends, and the parents may have no idea where they learned it.  Movies also pose a problem. In libraries, movies for all age groups are often grouped together. This means that children may see the covers of movies that contain scary or drug - related content, which is not suitable for them. Libraries should either separate the movies or remove the inappropriate ones to protect children from being exposed to such content.  Even though offensive materials are common in our daily lives, we should never allow children to access them from public libraries or any public place where children are present. Libraries need to remove books and movies that deal with crime, drugs, or other inappropriate themes. In conclusion, it's essential to protect children from being exposed to such materials, and libraries should take the necessary steps to ensure a safe and appropriate environment for young readers.
486	3463	2	2	In my view, libraries should not remove materials just because they are deemed offensive. People have different sensitivities, and what one person finds offensive, another may not. If we start removing such materials, there's a high chance we'll end up losing a vast amount of books and alienating our patrons.  For instance, some people are offended by movies with violent scenes, while others enjoy them. The library might be the only access point for someone to enjoy their preferred content. Similarly, magazines may contain content that some don't want their kids exposed to, but the same magazine could be a valuable resource for a student's school assignment. Kids might actually benefit from the so - called offensive material in their lives.  In conclusion, we shouldn't remove movies and books just because someone finds them offensive. Some offensive materials can aid students in their education, and some adults enjoy consuming them. One person's offense doesn't mean everyone will feel the same way.
487	3464	2	2	"Can people limit freedom, imagination, and self - expression? Many in today's world seem to think so. Book censorship is a significant global issue. Whether to remove 'offensive' books from libraries is a serious matter. Censoring books restricts self - expression, knowledge, and our constitutional right to free speech.  I firmly believe that people should not censor books. Censoring a book is equivalent to putting a cap on human imagination. Throughout our lives, we are encouraged to think outside the box and embrace uniqueness. Yet, when writers express themselves in books, the same people who promoted out - of - the - box thinking want to censor those thoughts. By censoring books, we're sending the message that imagination is a negative trait.  Some people want to censor books to protect their children from 'offensive' content. They believe that removing such books from libraries can shield their kids from the world's evils. However, this is a fallacy. While people may attempt to censor books, life cannot be censored. Children will learn 'offensive' things regardless of books.  Book censorship also curtails knowledge. ""The [Title] of [Person]"" was a scandalous book when it was written. Due to its language, many considered it trash and wanted it censored. Today, it's a famous classic that I was required to read for school. Despite its language, it reveals a part of [Region] history. If it had been removed from libraries, I likely would never have read it or gained the knowledge from it.  It's our constitutional right to write and read the books of our choice. America was founded on the principle of freedom, and the constitution guarantees freedom of speech. Removing books from libraries limits this freedom. No one should dictate what we can read or write. If we start censoring books, writers will be forced to censor their thoughts, which restricts their freedom of speech. If freedom of speech is limited, what other freedoms will follow suit?  In general, book censorship is detrimental as it only restricts. If we start censoring books, we're telling our children that being different is bad. If freedom of speech is limited, how long before our other rights are? Before removing a single book, we must ask ourselves if we have the right to limit freedom."
488	3465	2	2	In my opinion, music, books, magazines, and other such materials should remain on library shelves. If they can be published, they should be available for reading or listening.  Let's talk about the content of these materials. In the music industry, many people think some songs are inappropriate, but this undermines the essence of the song. Age advice can be given, but the content should not be cut. Magazines are like illustrated books and should be accessible to anyone if they are published. Movies should be placed in libraries with age advice since they have already been approved for theaters, [Platform 1], or [Platform 2].  I've witnessed people complaining about these things, but I can't understand why. Now, it's up to you to decide your stance on library censorship.
489	3466	2	2	"What is censorship? It can be defined as limitations or restrictions and is sometimes considered common courtesy. The real question is what exactly are we limiting?  Censorship is not something to be supported. Censoring a book is like having a chocolate cake without the chocolate; it takes away the value and enjoyment of education. Despite the disapproval of some, libraries should not censor their books, movies, or music.  Some people find books like ""[Book 1]"" or ""The [Title] of [Person]"" offensive because of the repeated use of the ""[Word]"" word. However, there's an argument against this. Some [Group] I know find the ""[Word]"" word offensive in general, but not in the context of these books. They believe it adds educational value as the word was commonly used during [Person]'s time.  Censorship, both in the past and now, is about hiding reality. Writers, singers, and directors who create what is considered 'inappropriate' are trying to expose the truth. The 'inappropriate' language and experiences are real and reflect what actually happens. By using censorship, we're sheltering the world.  Censorship is a tool that blocks us from reality. Is this the right choice? Is it right to send sheltered teens into the world ill - equipped to face it? Or should we let them understand how the world truly works?"
490	3467	2	2	An author, Katherine Paterson, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I wholeheartedly believe that certain materials, such as books, should never be removed from library shelves under any circumstances.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about books. If books are removed due to censorship, then the very purpose of writing and reading books is undermined. There are countless offensive books out there, whether they conflict with religious beliefs or contain excessive sexual content. Authors write to express themselves, and if we ban a book, we're disregarding the author's right to self - expression.  The world is full of offensive and disturbing books, but it's not right to simply get rid of them because they bother us. Just because a book offends one person doesn't mean it offends everyone. Everyone has the right to read whatever they want.  I believe censorship is unnecessary. Who has the right to remove or change something just because it's inappropriate? I've read books I wouldn't want kids to read, but that doesn't give me the right to remove them from the shelves. There might be someone else eagerly waiting to read that book. By removing it, I'm restricting others' reading experiences.  In general, censorship is wrong. Everyone has the right to their beliefs and ways of self - expression. No one should have the right to take something that an author has worked hard on and remove it because they find it offensive. There will always be things we don't approve of, but that doesn't mean others won't. If we keep removing books because they're offensive, eventually, there won't be any books left to read.
491	3468	2	2	Censorship in school libraries presents a complex issue. On one hand, it holds significance as many books in school libraries may not be suitable for younger children. However, these same books shouldn't be removed from libraries because high - school students are mature enough to engage with such material. The content in these books often mirrors the realities of high - school life.  Most of these books offer perspectives on real - life stories and can assist readers in coping with challenges and realizing they're not alone. Yet, many of them do contain curse words, sexual scenes, descriptions of partying, drinking, and drug use, which are inappropriate for elementary and perhaps middle - school students. For example, the books by @PERSON1 are about a girl who becomes addicted to drugs, pregnant, goes to jail, and becomes homeless. I personally found these books very insightful as they showed how a single drug experience could ruin one's life. But I believe no one younger than fourteen should read them.  There should be a reasonable limit on censorship. The topics discussed in books are often the same as those in school hallways. Authors write about these things to connect with teenagers, and many books are based on the authors' experiences, making them more suitable for high - schoolers. Many authors indicate an age level on their books, like fourteen and older, and libraries should take these ratings into account.  While someone may be offended by the content of a book, it shouldn't be removed from the shelf due to one person's opinion. Only if it becomes a widespread issue should it be considered for removal. After all, that book might be a source of escape for someone facing hardships.  Some adults disagree, believing that if teenagers read about drinking, drug use, or sex, they're more likely to engage in these activities. But I don't think this is true. I'm currently reading a book with partying and drinking scenes, yet I'm not acting on them. There's little difference between reading such content in a book and seeing it on television, and I've seen worse on @LOCATION1 than in books. Parents should be glad their teenagers are reading rather than playing video games or hanging out with friends.  These are my personal opinions. Some may agree, while others may disagree, but I firmly stand by them.
492	3469	2	2	Censorship is a significant conflict in many libraries. There are numerous offensive books that some believe shouldn't be on the shelves. Many schools label these books, magazines, and movies as '@CAPS1.' There's often a week when people read all the books that have been @CAPS1 from school libraries, and I participate in this school - wide challenge because I oppose banning books. Banning books can have both positive and negative aspects.  First, let's consider the perspective of the author or writer. How would you feel if you spent around @NUM1 years crafting a story or movie for kids, only to have it @CAPS1 within the first couple of weeks on the shelves? I doubt many people would be happy about that. I also think that many don't give enough importance to authors. When I think about it, I realize all the things we'd miss out on in our world, such as newspapers, books, and magazines. Writing requires a great deal of effort to convey what people want to hear or see. When books or movies are @CAPS1 or removed, it makes the author feel worthless. The situation becomes even more complicated when considering the parents' perspective.  Imagine your child comes home from school with a book they want you to read with them. You sit down and start reading, only to encounter a violent or inappropriate scene. You stop abruptly and look at your child, who is enjoying the violence and loving the story. What would you do? Many parents would call the school, explain the situation, and demand that the book be banned. However, banning it from the school library doesn't mean children can't find it elsewhere. How do you think your child would feel if a story they loved suddenly disappeared? I know it would make me feel like I'd done something wrong.  On the other hand, taking a book, movie, or magazine off the shelf means it's gone from that library forever. This can be beneficial as it removes the obvious temptation for kids. If you don't want your child or other children to access it, it's a reasonable approach. It makes the @CAPS1 item harder to find and less likely to pique kids' interest. If the book or movie isn't readily available, they won't be as eager to read the next one or see the next movie.  There are many different views on censorship, which can influence decisions in libraries. My view on this topic is negative, and I fully support my stance. If an author works hard on a story, they shouldn't be punished for expressing their feelings. There are various perspectives on this issue, and next @CAPS1 book week, I'll support the authors whose work has been @CAPS1. I hope others will too.
493	3470	2	2	"In my opinion, censorship should be allowed in public libraries, but with multiple viewpoints in mind. Firstly, why should books be removed from shelves just because some people don't like the plot of a series? There are over a million people in the world, and we all have different preferences. Reading is one area where our differences are particularly evident. Some people prefer peaceful, warm - hearted stories, while others seek more intense reading material.  People around the world have different tastes in food, music, movies, and books. Just as we all practice our religions freely without punishment, people should be able to read the books they love without having them taken away. Taking away books is like taking candy from an innocent baby because it might rot their teeth. Sure, some books may offend certain individuals, but there will always be others who find different books offensive. As long as the ""teeth"" (in this metaphor, the well - being of the readers) aren't being damaged, there's no need to take away the ""candy"" (the books). If books are properly labeled on their individual shelves, indicating what they're about (which is usually the case), people won't be as likely to be offended by finding them in the wrong place.  Do you understand where I'm coming from? We're all the same in many ways, but in books, we find our unique selves. I know many book - readers with diverse tastes, regardless of who they are or who their friends are. Many people, besides myself, would agree with this. So, I ask again, why shouldn't there be censorship in public libraries?"
494	3471	2	2	Books are a form of history, each one telling a story from the past. In history, we don't block out offensive events, so it's wrong to remove books with offensive material. It would deprive kids of valuable learning tools.  Books are extremely important learning tools in today's schools, and every book offers something new for kids to learn. Removing even one book could mean a child misses out on one learning opportunity, and doing this deliberately goes against the principles that schools stand for.  There are many different genres of books, and not everyone likes every genre. If a person only likes to read young - adult books because they relate to their culture, these books may contain offensive language and events. If you take these books away from a young adult in school, they'll lose interest in the library's collection as they won't find anything appealing.  If you can think of even one instance where a student could be deprived of a learning opportunity, you shouldn't remove literature from library shelves. In fact, there are numerous reasons why we shouldn't remove any literature from library shelves.
495	3472	2	2	If an individual is in search of an offensive book, they will find it, whether it's gathering dust on a library shelf or is brand - new in a bookstore. The same holds true for an offensive @CAPS1, magazine, or movie. Removing offensive items from library shelves will merely prompt those seeking such items to look elsewhere.  Different individuals hold varying opinions on what is offensive and what is not. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is a controversial book that many people consider offensive to their religious beliefs. While some find it offensive, others enjoy the story. If the book were removed from libraries because some people were offended, those who truly enjoyed it would be unable to read it.  Another reason libraries should not remove offensive items is that, in most cases, the entire book, magazine, movie, etc., is not offensive throughout. Even if a movie has one offensive scene, the rest of the movie could be a great story that many would benefit from watching. The same applies to books and magazines. There may be a few offensive chapters or one or two offensive articles, but it's rare to find a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive from start to finish.  Of course, there are offensive items that are inappropriate for younger kids, even with just one or two offensive scenes, chapters, or articles. However, there are simpler solutions than completely removing these items from the shelves. One solution could be for libraries to set age limits on certain items, preventing younger kids from checking out inappropriate materials. More importantly, it's the parents' responsibility to monitor what their kids are reading, watching, or listening to.  Removing offensive books, magazines, music, and movies from library shelves would only create more problems and complaints. I firmly believe it's a good idea to keep the material on the shelves and caution library users to 'read at their own risk.'
496	3473	2	2	Libraries should not remove items merely because some individuals find them offensive. People have diverse preferences for books, and removing certain ones reduces the available selection. A limited book selection means fewer people will have a reason to visit the library. In conclusion, maintaining a wide range of materials in libraries is essential to cater to the varied interests of the public.
497	3474	2	2	Can books, music, movies, and other materials truly suit everyone? Each person holds distinct opinions and beliefs regarding what materials are suitable and what is unacceptable for the human mind. Globally, people of all ages engage in reading books, magazines, listening to music, and watching movies as common hobbies. People read different types of books, such as mystery, romance, or religious ones. Removing books, magazines, and other materials from library shelves leads to an unsuccessful and empty library. When people visit the library to search for a book, they look for something they think they'll enjoy. Just because one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean everyone else will. Taking that book away leaves those who would have enjoyed it searching for another. Everyone is unique, and so are these books. Magazines, like books, are meant to be enjoyed. While some magazines may not be appropriate for certain individuals, that doesn't justify removing them from the shelves. Instead, those who find them unsuitable should simply avoid reading them. Magazines are designed for a wide audience, which is why there are so many different types. The music industry offers a vast array of genres to cater to different tastes. Just because one song contains elements you dislike doesn't mean it should be deleted for everyone. Music serves various purposes, such as relaxation, motivation, and entertainment at parties and events. Banning music due to personal dislikes would change the music landscape forever. Similarly, people should be able to watch the movies they want. Movie ratings exist to indicate what is suitable for different age groups. If people were to ban all movies they deemed inappropriate, the movie - rental stores, theaters, and the movie production industry would suffer. In conclusion, books, magazines, movies, and music cannot be perfect for everyone. These materials offer a wealth of subjects and stories that bring enjoyment to different people. Banning materials based on personal beliefs would leave the shelves empty, which defeats the purpose of a library.
498	3475	2	2	As a student, a child, and a citizen of the United States, I firmly believe that every book should be allowed in any library. Books, along with movies and music, express feelings and emotions. Without them, we would struggle to learn about the world. Each book has an explanation, a title, and a reason to be read. Nowadays, millions of people read more because of the wide variety of books available. The reason every book should be in a library is that they are all different. Just because some people may find a book offensive doesn't mean it should be removed. Everyone has things they dislike. For example, people may be sensitive about certain topics, such as specific people, animals, countries, or skin colors. If you don't like a particular book, you can simply choose not to read it, while others may enjoy it. Magazines are similar to books; they are meant to be enjoyed. Some magazines may not be suitable for everyone, but that doesn't mean they should be taken off the shelves. Music is a popular form of entertainment, and there are many different genres to suit various tastes. Banning a song because of personal dislikes would change the music industry. People should also be able to watch the movies they want, as movie ratings help them make appropriate choices. In conclusion, banning materials that one believes are inappropriate would leave the library shelves empty, which is not a proper way to run a library.
499	3476	2	2	"Dear newspaper, I believe that libraries should not censor materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Censoring library materials can lead to numerous problems, and I disagree with it for several reasons. In the following paragraphs, I will explain my stance. Many libraries around the world currently censor their materials. I think this is mainly because there are often children under 18 in libraries, and they may be exposed to explicit content. However, libraries should not censor materials. Instead, they should ensure that under - age children do not check out materials intended for adults. If children have access to computers in the library, an adult supervisor should be present to prevent them from viewing explicit content. Censoring library materials can cause problems. Customers may not get all the information they need, children may not read at their full potential, and they may not acquire enough knowledge for school. If these issues occur, libraries will lose customers. Although some people may visit libraries for inappropriate reasons, for others, these so - called ""wrong reasons"" may be a source of valuable information. Materials in libraries may be offensive to some people, but what is offensive to one person may be useful to another. Removing offensive materials from the shelves can hide a lot of valuable information. In conclusion, censorship of library materials should be avoided as it can result in the loss of a great deal of information. Censorship doesn't always mean the material is bad; it may just be inappropriate for a certain age group. If a library I visit has extensive censorship, I would persuade the staff to remove it. Censorship is not always good or bad, but it can deprive us of important information."
500	3477	2	2	"I think offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the general library shelves because there are children in libraries, and they shouldn't be exposed to offensive content. However, there should be a dedicated area in the library for such materials. There are many libraries that have offensive materials, and these should be removed because they can be racist or offensive to certain groups. Racist content, such as descriptions of racial hatred, can hurt people's feelings and should not be allowed. I have personally encountered offensive words in books from my school library. For example, the use of the word ""nigger"" in some books is offensive to me as a black person. Although it may not be offensive to everyone, it affects me. Instead of having offensive materials on the open shelves, libraries should set aside an area where people who want to access such materials can find them without offending others. Also, children and other people don't want to see inappropriate or offensive content in books. Some books may contain descriptions of drugs, which some people don't want to read about. However, there are also people, like older individuals, who may have different views and want to access such materials. In conclusion, libraries should take into account the diverse needs and sensitivities of their users. By creating a separate area for offensive materials, they can ensure that both those who want to avoid such content and those who want to access it are accommodated."
501	3478	2	2	Censorship plays a significant role in many aspects of library operations. Libraries offer access to books, movies, magazines, and computers for all patrons. Children often visit libraries to borrow books and socialize with friends. However, some strict parents may find certain books, magazines, and music offensive and believe they should not be available in libraries, yet this view is not shared by everyone. People hold diverse opinions on such matters. Some worry that exposing children to inappropriate content will lead them to imitate it, while others believe it can be a learning opportunity. Another common concern in libraries is talking. Not all visitors want to sit in silence, and this is a deterrent for many. Libraries are enjoyable places where one can find almost any book they wish to read. There is no need for parents to worry about their children accessing age - inappropriate books. Libraries are proficient at labeling age - appropriate sections, and library staff ensure that patrons do not check out unsuitable materials. Additionally, younger children usually visit the library with an adult, allowing parents to monitor their reading choices. Parents who are concerned about their children encountering offensive content should accompany them to the library. Talking in libraries can be fun, whether it's about the books being read or just casual chatting. However, library staff and other patrons often get annoyed when children laugh or talk loudly. It would be beneficial to set aside a floor for socializing and conversation. Overall, libraries offer numerous positive experiences. The so - called offensive books are often the most interesting ones. To avoid such content, patrons and their children should simply stay out of the adult section.
502	3479	2	2	A library is a valuable resource that provides access to books, music, and other materials. The question arises: should offensive materials be removed from library shelves? If books, music, or other items on the shelves are deemed offensive, they should be removed and placed in a separate section. To access these materials, patrons would need the permission of a librarian. This prevents the offensive content from being accessible to everyone and potentially causing discomfort. Leaving offensive materials on the open shelves is inappropriate as they may conflict with some people's cultural beliefs or be unsuitable for young people. In conclusion, due to these reasons, offensive materials should be removed from the general shelves and placed in a restricted section. Libraries are meant to serve as resources and sources of enjoyment, and all patrons should have their needs met in a comfortable environment.
503	3480	2	2	Is it reasonable to restrict certain books based on the reader's age? In my opinion, it is not. The issue of whether libraries should restrict access to movies, books, and CDs based on age should not even be a topic of debate. My stance is not because such materials cannot have a negative influence, but rather because they can also have a positive impact. People often discover themselves through exposure to diverse materials in libraries. They learn about their interests, likes, and aspirations. Without libraries, most people would lack individuality and be very similar to one another. While people should be aware of the content in books, it is unnecessary to restrict access based on age. Movies and CDs are more understandable to restrict due to the graphic violence and explicit language they may contain. However, in books, it is about the reader's own interpretation. The way one reads and processes the text is more important than what others are doing or saying. In conclusion, instead of restricting access to certain age groups, libraries should label the content categories so that readers can make informed choices. This is my view on the matter of library access restrictions.
504	3481	2	2	Many books in libraries contain profanity, and its impact depends on how the reader interprets it. Some readers find that strong language helps the author convey their point, while others find it offensive. I disagree that most books with profanity are offensive. In fact, I believe it helps writers express their ideas more effectively. Children may come across books with offensive language, but if they stick to age - appropriate reading materials, this should not be a problem. Adult books tend to have more offensive language, but adults are more accustomed to such content as they may hear or use similar language in their daily lives. I believe that offensive reading materials should be placed in a specific area of the library, accessible only to adults. This way, children can be kept away from such content and maintain their innocence. Of course, it is ultimately up to the child's guardian to decide. Having strong language in books is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as the reader understands the author's intent, which is usually to enhance the theme. While children should be protected from such books, they should not be removed from the library altogether. Instead, they should be segregated for adult readers. In this way, libraries can balance the needs of different age groups.
505	3482	2	2	Libraries offer books for readers of all ages. The books on the shelves should be arranged in alphabetical order, starting with the author's last name. I believe that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed due to their graphic content. Bookshelves should be organized according to age groups and separated from one another. If children are in the appropriate aisle for their age - appropriate books, they are less likely to pick up the wrong ones. If children learn to follow instructions on finding age - appropriate books, fewer mistakes will occur. If a child takes an age - inappropriate book from the shelf, it is the parent's responsibility to return it and get the correct one. When parents take action, children should understand that they have made a mistake and learn not to repeat it. In conclusion, while libraries should arrange books alphabetically and by age groups, some reading materials with graphic content should be removed. This ensures that all readers, regardless of age, can have a suitable and safe reading experience in the library.
506	3483	2	2	In numerous libraries, there exist books, movies, magazines, and music that some individuals find offensive, with the degree of offensiveness varying among people. In my opinion, just because certain people are offended by these materials, they should not be removed from the library shelves. This is because other people might be interested in them, libraries' resources are crucial sources of information, and all books contribute to enhancing people's intelligence.  These resources are in the library for valid reasons. If the items on the shelves are a distraction, people can simply ignore them. They can choose what they like and avoid what they dislike. For example, some books describe real - life events in detail, and some readers may not be able to handle such descriptions. In that case, they can just put the book back and select another one. Everyone has different preferences.  Moreover, some library materials serve as informational resources. College students, teachers, and students worldwide rely on libraries with a diverse collection of books, movies, music, and magazines. For instance, they may need these resources for classes or presentations. If these materials were removed due to being considered offensive, it would be difficult for them to access the necessary information.  Finally, all books have the potential to make people more intelligent. Some concepts are complex, and books can help explain them better. We learn new things every day through reading books, magazines, and even watching movies. Reading also strengthens vocabulary and communication skills. For example, frequent readers are often more involved in plays and have fewer issues speaking in public, thanks to their higher reading proficiency and larger vocabulary.  In conclusion, people have different tastes, and some will find certain library resources offensive. However, books are valuable tools for learning and intellectual growth. If books, movies, and music were removed, our collective intelligence would be negatively affected. Life is full of problems, and we should learn to deal with them. Removing books from the shelves won't solve anything; instead, they can only benefit us.
507	3484	2	2	"I believe that people who find certain books, music, movies, and magazines offensive should simply stay away from them. There are some books that people need to know about. Take concentration camps as an example; people need to learn about these historical events to prevent similar horrors from happening again. By allowing people to read such books, we can better understand and learn from the past. Keeping these books on the shelves is essential, as failing to do so could put us at risk. We could face a situation like what happened with @PERSON1, who killed millions of Jews simply because of their appearance. Similarly, slavery was a great injustice; just because people have different skin colors doesn't mean they are not human. Keeping these materials in libraries can contribute to a better future.  If someone is disturbed by certain music or movies, they can choose not to listen or watch them, but others who are interested should have the opportunity to learn from them. My mom thinks that bloody - scary movies shouldn't be sold in stores, but I told her that some people enjoy watching them, and watching such movies can also help us avoid similar real - life situations.  In conclusion, we should keep some of these so - called ""bad"" books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelves. This way, we can strive to prevent horrible historical events from recurring."
508	3485	2	2	"I firmly believe that books, music, and magazines should not be removed from library shelves. No matter where you go in the world, you will inevitably encounter things that you find inappropriate or offensive. The world is far from perfect. One reason for my stance is that removing these materials would be unconstitutional. The freedoms of speech and the press are fundamental rights that should not be violated. If a library deems certain articles inappropriate, a simple solution is to place these articles in a specific section and warn patrons about their content.  The primary reason I oppose the removal of these materials is that the world is a complex and often unpleasant place, and books are the least of our concerns. Children cannot be protected from the real world forever; they need to face reality, and books can be a good medium for this. Today's children are resilient and can handle ""inappropriate"" content. Parents should accept that their children will be exposed to offensive things in our imperfect world, which is a natural part of growing up.  Another important factor is that removing books and other materials from @LOCATION1's libraries would be unconstitutional. When the amendments regarding freedom of speech and the press were established, they were meant to be permanent. They are not guidelines that can be ignored; they are the foundation of @TIME1 great country. People have fought for these freedoms on many significant issues. We have no right to restrict what people can write. People's natural opinions should not be regulated. Censoring library materials would be a violation of @LOCATION1's principles.  My final reason is that the solution lies with the library management. If they believe some articles are inappropriate, they can isolate them in a particular section and post warnings. Those who do not want to be offended can simply avoid these sections. We should take responsibility for the library's content and separate offensive materials, rather than removing them entirely, as someone might actually need that ""offensive"" book.  In conclusion, these are my reasons for opposing library censorship. The world is imperfect, and censoring libraries will not make it perfect. Moreover, such an act would be unconstitutional. Libraries only need to set aside these materials in specific areas and provide warnings. If libraries were censored, a vast amount of information would be lost because there are many ""offensive"" things in the world."
509	3486	2	2	"I hold the view that certain materials in libraries should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are considered offensive. If someone dislikes a particular item, they can easily choose another one. I once visited a library, and nothing there offended me or anyone else. If people don't like the fact that libraries display ""offensive"" items, it's their personal choice not to go. Everyone has the right to choose what they read or listen to, as long as they enjoy it. This is what I firmly believe. In conclusion, respecting individual choices and keeping a diverse collection of materials in libraries is essential. Removing items based on personal offense would limit people's access to different perspectives and knowledge. We should uphold the principle of allowing people to make their own decisions about what they consume from library resources."
510	3487	2	2	"Everything can be offensive to someone. There is no way to ensure that nobody is offended unless there is nothing at all to cause offense. If there is an item on the shelf, someone is likely to find something offensive in it. For example, there could be a children's book, one of the greatest ever written, but it was written before the Civil War and contains a racist comment. Then, according to some, that book would be removed. Some might think, ""It's just a children's book. We'll survive."" But let's consider a more significant example. What if someone says the Bible is offensive? Then that book would also be removed, and this could lead to more books being targeted as different religious beliefs come into question. Additionally, there are issues related to violence in various materials.  Moderate censorship can be acceptable for the young, but there is a fine line, although it can be difficult to define at times. It is reasonable to censor obscene images that are illegal for minors to view, but legal images should generally be accessible without censorship. For those who are mature enough to understand, censorship is unacceptable, although some items may need to be viewed under supervision. Stripping people of their rights is never justifiable.  The @LOCATION1 government has granted people certain freedoms, including the freedom of speech. This means that people can express their opinions and support what they believe in. A book is a form of speech. Although some forms of speech may be frowned upon, they should not be censored. Censorship essentially means telling people what they cannot say, which can lead to a gradual erosion of their right to express themselves.  In developing countries like Congo, if you criticize the government and oppose their actions, you could face serious consequences, such as being killed. In a sense, this is a form of extreme censorship. Similarly, if you write a book suggesting how Obama could be a better president and someone finds it offensive, the book may be censored, and you lose your right to express your opinion. There is no real difference between these forms of censorship.  Supervision can be a powerful alternative to censorship. With proper supervision, children can learn about different topics without being exposed to inappropriate content in an uncontrolled way. Everyone, including children, has the right to learn independently, and censorship can deny them this right.  In conclusion, censorship should not be used in libraries. It takes away people's freedoms and opportunities for learning, causes conflicts among people, damages cultural heritage, and ignores religious beliefs. Although censorship was created with good intentions to protect people from what they consider wrong, its negative consequences cannot be ignored. We should find a balance that respects people's rights and allows for the free flow of information."
511	3488	2	2	In today's era of constant innovation, as @PERSON1, I firmly believe that all materials in libraries should be organized according to specific subjects. I am not advocating for the removal or destruction of books, magazines, or any other library resources. Instead, I kindly request a fair consideration of my proposal.  I advocate for enhanced organization of certain materials. I understand that individuals hold diverse views on what should be included in books. While library books can bring joy to many, they may also offend some. Therefore, I propose the implementation of a classification system for books, music, magazines, and movies. This system could use numbers or letters to represent different categories. Although I personally believe this approach is slightly less effective than alternative organizational methods, it would at least alert people to the nature of the materials.  If such a system is adopted, those who dislike specific subjects can easily avoid relevant materials. This would also reduce complaints from those who call for the destruction of all books. I believe that reorganizing library materials would be a more viable solution, despite the significant effort involved. For instance, a mother could easily prevent her child from accessing books she herself would not read.  I oppose the removal of any materials from libraries. Once we start removing one item, it may set a precedent for removing more, potentially leading to a situation where either people constantly complain about specific books or the library ceases to exist. Therefore, I earnestly urge you to consider organizing library materials, including books, magazines, movies, and music, to prevent such issues in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you will explore this topic further and perhaps publish related articles in newspapers.
512	3489	2	2	Do you think everyone should hold their own beliefs? Do you believe that everyone should express themselves through their culture and opinions? A library is the place where you can experience all these without being judged. In a library, you have the right to an open mind.  I firmly believe that no books, music, movies, magazines, or other materials should be removed from library shelves simply because they are considered offensive. People are diverse, with different beliefs and understandings. For example, if someone goes to the library and picks up a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1, while another person dislikes @PERSON1 and is unfamiliar with his cultural background, the latter may find the book offensive. However, if everyone had a say in what materials are available in libraries, libraries would cease to exist.  If people keep their opinions to themselves in libraries, everyone can be happy and avoid arguments. Everyone can express themselves in their own way every day. In conclusion, libraries should remain a place where diverse materials are accessible, respecting the rights and choices of all patrons.
513	3490	2	2	I do not believe that materials considered inappropriate for children should be removed from library shelves solely for this reason. Libraries serve both children and adults. Children are exposed to various unsuitable things daily, whether at home, school, or in public. So, why should we modify libraries for children when we do not alter public spaces for them?  If certain materials are not suitable for specific age groups, children should be closely monitored when selecting materials from the shelves. Removing materials just because a parent does not want their child to see, hear, or watch them is unfair to adult library users.  Another reason I oppose removal is that it is like suggesting we remove children's materials because adults have no use for them. There are always ways to meet the needs of both children and adults in libraries while protecting children from inappropriate content. Most children are more interested in their own materials and are not concerned about adult materials. If parents removed everything they deemed inappropriate for their children, libraries would lose adult patrons, resulting in a lack of business as parents would have nothing to engage with.  In conclusion, there are always solutions to balance the needs of children and adults in libraries. Removing materials inappropriate for children is not the right approach.
514	3491	2	2	Personally, I firmly believe that there should be no censorship of books entering a @CAPS1. I consider it wrong to censor books because every book should be accessible, regardless of its content. Those who have objections to certain books should simply choose not to read them.  Although I have not encountered many offensive materials, I have come across some words that surprised me. However, I have not found anything personally offensive. Books serve their own purposes, and authors publish them to allow the public to form their own opinions.  In conclusion, censorship of books in a @CAPS1 is unjust and unnecessary. Everyone should have the freedom to access and read a wide range of materials.
515	3492	2	2	Throughout our lives, we all form our own opinions on various topics and issues in the world. One question that often troubles me is whether library censorship is a problem or a right. As a parent, I can understand the desire to remove certain books from library shelves. However, such an action is unconstitutional. Therefore, in my opinion, library censorship should not be permitted.  When I was twelve, I was reading the back of a book about the @CAPS1 at the library. My mother approached me and said the book was too graphic for me. Now, as an adult, I understand her concerns. This is one reason I can empathize with those who want to remove certain books, but it is not feasible because such books remind us of the importance of avoiding another world war.  I also recognize that everyone has the right to express their opinions on what should or should not be done. However, I have observed that exposure to inappropriate content can have a significant impact on children's lives, both in the present and the future. Instead of censoring books, I propose setting age - appropriate boundaries. For example, children should be accompanied by a legal guardian when accessing certain types of books, or there should be clear age ratings for different sections of the library.  I have come up with an idea that I believe is a good solution. Books with potentially inappropriate content should be placed in sections with ratings similar to movies. For instance, books with mild inappropriate language should be in a section for those over thirteen, and books rated @CAPS2 should be restricted to those over seventeen.  This approach would ensure that no books are removed while protecting children from inappropriate content. As a parent, I would not want my children to read books about sex, violence, or vulgarity. However, I also believe that everyone has the right to read and see what they want.  We should remember the actions of our forefathers over a hundred years ago. They wrote the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1, which includes amendments guaranteeing our rights to free speech, opinion, and reading. Removing books from library shelves is unconstitutional, and history has shown that those who go against the constitution do not find a favorable place in the world.  In conclusion, instead of removing books, we should improve library organization to make everyone happy. We should find a way to coexist with the diverse content in books and avoid censorship. Otherwise, libraries may lose their rich collection of materials.
516	3493	2	2	I firmly believe that books containing nudity, curse words, or gang - related violence should either be placed on an adult - only shelf or removed permanently. Such content exposes children to inappropriate things that they should not see or do as they grow up. Drugs, sex, and especially gang violence are topics that children should never be exposed to. Therefore, I propose taking these books off the regular shelves. If people want to read them, they can purchase their own copies. This way, we can protect the innocence of children and ensure that the appropriate reading materials are accessible to them.
517	3494	2	2	In my view, offensive books and other media should not be removed from the shelves. This is a free country where everyone has the right to freedom of speech and their own opinions. As long as the content is appropriate for the environment, there should be no issues. If we were to remove every book that someone finds offensive, there would be no books left. Different people have different views, and it's almost inevitable that someone will be offended. In some cases, being offended can even make a person better at what they do. Offensive content is part of history and shows how things have progressed over time. Even the group that might be most affected by this content isn't complaining, so no one else should either. We see offensive themes in movies about slavery, books about limited success, magazines about negative behaviors, and news about community failures. So, in conclusion, offensive books should remain on the shelves because this kind of content has always existed and is a way for people to learn about the real world. People often encourage kids to read more, but there won't be much to read if we remove all offensive books.
518	3495	2	2	I hold the opinion that certain books, movies, music, and magazines that offend some people should not be simply taken off the shelves. I personally have never encountered any such offensive media. First, those who are offended by specific media should voice their concerns and seek a compromise. If everyone could remove the media they find offensive, there would be none left. People who are offended should avoid such media instead. Second, there are individuals like me who are not bothered by this content. It's unfair to restrict our access to the media we enjoy, and businesses may lose customers if popular items are removed. To find a balance between the offended and non - offended, I suggest organizing media by age restrictions rather than by author, similar to how movies and video games are rated. This would make it easier for offended people to avoid unwanted content. In conclusion, allowing one person to remove media from the shelves is unwise. It's unfair to non - offended people, bad for business, and there are better ways to solve this problem.
519	3496	2	2	Dear Newspaper Editor,  Recently, I had an uncomfortable experience at my local library when I saw a rather graphic magazine on display. I understand that such magazines may interest some people, but they seem crude to others. I also noticed that the library shelves are filled with other forms of crude merchandise, including movies, books, graphic posters, and explicit music. While it would be unreasonable to ask for the removal of all this merchandise, I would like to propose a compromise.  What I find crude may be acceptable to others, but I shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable in a public place. I've come up with a simple solution. Since most libraries have children's sections, we could create a separate section for all explicit material. This way, customers who want this material will know where to find it, and it will reduce the discomfort of visiting the public library.  The benefits of this compromise are numerous. It will provide a safe environment for children to choose books and a comfortable space for adults who want to access the explicit material. Even though my main goal isn't to benefit those seeking the material, it will also make it easier for them to find what they want.  I believe that public libraries should be safe and family - friendly environments for everyone. Thank you for your time.  @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @PERSON1
520	3497	2	2	We can all think of books that we don't want children to access. If a book on the shelf contains offensive content, perhaps parents should pre - screen it or have it removed. In my opinion, offensive science - fiction books should be taken off the shelves. However, if a story based on true events is offensive, it should still be heard because it's part of history, and everyone should know the truth. When it comes to music, only those with a lot of bad language should be removed. For movies, children should only watch @CAPS2 - rated movies. Magazines should be removed from the shelves as well.  As a child, my parents didn't let me watch or listen to anything with bad language, but I could read any book I wanted. I couldn't fully understand the bad words in a book. I think @PERSON1 means that she wants to keep all books on the shelf as she said everyone has the same rights, but if we follow that logic, there may be no books left.  There is a way to keep books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelves. Parents need to pay more attention to what their children are exposed to. In conclusion, despite the arguments on both sides, I still believe that offensive media should be taken off the shelves to protect children from inappropriate content.
521	3498	2	2	In my view, the issue of offensive books, magazines, and movies in stores and libraries is a significant concern. I firmly believe that store or library managers should remove such offensive materials from the shelves. There are several reasons to support this stance.  Firstly, children often accompany their parents to stores. While parents are occupied with paying for their purchases, children may pick up a magazine or book and start reading. These materials may contain inappropriate or offensive content that parents might not notice, and it is not suitable for children to be exposed to such material.  Secondly, some people may feel offended when they see magazines or books that depict their culture or traditions in a way they consider inaccurate or disrespectful. The content written about their culture or traditions on the front cover or within the material can lead to feelings of anger or insult.  Finally, when I visit libraries and see young children looking at offensive or inappropriate books and magazines, it makes me question why managers do not remove them. Libraries should be a safe and suitable place for everyone, including children, teenagers, and adults, to study. Therefore, they should not have offensive materials on their shelves.  In conclusion, store and library managers should remove offensive books, magazines, and movies from the shelves because they can be offensive to both adults and children. I have presented my reasons for this view, and I hope that managers will take appropriate action to ensure that these spaces are free from offensive content.
522	3499	2	2	I firmly believe that no books should be removed from the shelves, as they are often donated and offer valuable insights into the experiences of others. Reading allows us to step into the shoes of different people and understand their lifestyles.  Although I'm not an avid reader, when I come across a book that catches my interest, I can't help but immerse myself in it. I keep reading, eager to find out what happens next. However, it can be frustrating when my teacher interrupts my reading.  I have a wide range of interests when it comes to books, from sports - related ones to those with sad and emotional themes. Reading aloud to myself helps me better understand the content.  In conclusion, books are a source of knowledge and entertainment. They should be available for everyone to read and experience, regardless of personal preferences. We should embrace the diversity of books and the different perspectives they offer.
523	3500	2	2	I hold the strong opinion that there should be minimal censorship in the United States. Our country is renowned for its commitment to allowing citizens to have their own ideals, likes, and dislikes, as enshrined in the law and the Constitution. Libraries, as public spaces for people of all ages, should not censor the materials on their shelves.  The United States is known for its acceptance of diverse lifestyles and religions, and censorship goes against this fundamental principle. Historically, censorship was one of the factors that led to the colonies' secession from Britain. The British King did not allow colonial newspapers to criticize him or his policies, which is why the Founding Fathers incorporated freedom of thought and speech into the Constitution when the US was formed.  However, I do support certain forms of censorship. The movie and song rating system is a necessary form of control. Without it, young children would be exposed to content they are not ready for. This rating system also helps people decide whether they want to engage with the ideas and language presented in the material.  In libraries, instead of completely removing controversial books, a rating or explanatory system should be implemented. A warning label on such books would be a better approach. As an American, I believe I have the right to read and experience any type of book, music, news, or picture I desire. If we start restricting what we can access, we risk losing our freedom, similar to the situation in communist countries where only government - approved content is available. The statement by Katherine Paterson, 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us', strongly supports my view. It shows that excessive censorship would leave us with nothing to read or enjoy.  In conclusion, censorship in the United States directly violates our Constitution. If something offends or upsets us, we should simply choose not to engage with it. By doing so, we can eliminate unnecessary censorship and fully exercise our rights as Americans, including the right to be informed.
524	3501	2	2	Movies, books, music, magazines, and other forms of media each have their own ways of presenting content, which depends on the author's intentions. As an author, one has the right to write what they want, even though there may be consequences for certain opinions. Once a book is published and sent to a library, readers can choose whether to read it.  A book should not be removed from the library shelf just because someone finds it offensive. There may be others who enjoy it. Similarly, when a movie is made and is considered offensive by some, it doesn't mean it should stop being shown. People can simply choose not to watch it.  If an individual finds a movie, magazine, or book offensive, they should exercise their right not to engage with it. Not everyone will agree on what is offensive, and it's impossible to please everyone. However, if a large majority of people find a book offensive, then the issue of removing it from the shelf can be discussed.  In conclusion, the decision to engage with offensive media is a personal one. There's no need to remove content from the public domain just because some people find it offensive. We should respect the diversity of opinions and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they read, watch, or listen to.
525	3502	2	2	In a library, the control of censorship should rest with the library - goers. In the case of public libraries, visitors should have the right to influence the selection of books on the shelves. Libraries should not remove books based on the beliefs of a single individual. Instead, all books should be rated, and it should be up to the readers to decide if a book, music, movie, magazine, etc., is offensive to them.  Of course, if parents don't want their children to read certain books, they can communicate with the librarian and set limits on the book ratings their children can borrow. By organizing books in this way, everyone can read what they want. Even if there are books one doesn't like to read or see on the shelf, they should realize that others may have different preferences.  Ultimately, it is the library that purchases the books, so they have a say in what is on the shelves. To avoid power struggles, a committee should be established to decide on book purchases. There will always be people who object to certain types of books, but they will have to accept the diversity of offerings.  Banned books should also be available in libraries. Whether one reads them or not is a personal choice. The exception is school libraries, where the administration or school board, as the funders of book purchases, should determine which books are included.  In summary, my view on book censorship is that libraries should choose the books for their collections. To simplify the process, a national - standard rating system should be implemented for all public libraries. As I've said before, books are just books, and the choice to read them lies with the individual.
526	3503	2	2	Censorship is a controversial topic. While some people believe it is necessary, others disagree. In my opinion, censorship is not required. Everyone is entitled to their beliefs, and others should have the maturity to accept this. Censorship is unnecessary because if one is offended by certain material, they can simply choose not to read or listen to it. It is that straightforward. Since everyone can be offended by something, if every piece of offensive material were removed, there would be nothing left. If materials were categorized by their level of offensiveness, it is likely that almost everything would fall into the offensive category. Due to the controversial nature of censorship, there are numerous perspectives on the subject, ranging from no censorship to complete censorship, and my view is just one among many. Censorship truly boils down to an individual's maturity and how they handle the material. One can only be offended if they allow themselves to be. Therefore, censorship is not necessary in libraries; people just need to be more mature. In conclusion, the idea of censorship should be re - evaluated, and individuals should take responsibility for their own consumption of content.
527	3504	2	2	I believe that if the public finds something offensive, it should be removed. This principle should apply to everything. If something offends you, you should voice your concerns. I'm not saying that the issue will always be resolved, but you might get lucky and have it fixed so you're not constantly offended. Growing up, my dad always told me that if I didn't like something, I shouldn't do it, unless it was something I had to do. So, when I encounter something I don't like, I either change my behavior or avoid it. I rarely change my ways, though sometimes this can be a bad thing, but everyone makes mistakes. Writing about this is difficult for me because I don't care what others think and I rarely get offended. However, I know some people who are easily offended, and I try to avoid them because you have to be careful with what you say around them. It's no fun having to watch your words all the time. People should be able to take a joke. If more people were easy - going, I wouldn't be writing this essay, and there would probably be less drama. If you know a book, movie, or anything that might offend you, just don't engage with it again. It might not offend the next person, who might actually like it. All you need to do is stay away from what bothers you, and you'll forget about it over time. If a large number of people are offended by something, then it should be removed. But if only a few people are offended, I'd tell them sorry, as more people like it, so it should stay. In conclusion, dealing with offensive content should be based on the number of people affected and a reasonable assessment of the situation.
528	3505	2	2	I personally don't find anything truly offensive, so I don't care what's on the library shelves. I'm not easily offended, so I'm not sure what might be considered offensive, but I suppose a racist book could be offensive to Black people. I don't think porn or anything involving nudity should be in school libraries because some parents are very strict about such content, and it's inappropriate for school. However, I think some parents go overboard in determining what's appropriate and what's not. Public libraries are different and should be able to have any movies and books. It shouldn't matter what they're about. If people don't like it, they don't have to look at or borrow it. In my view, libraries should have a wide variety of books and movies. If people don't like what's available, they can leave and not worry about it. I hope this view has influenced your thinking a bit. In conclusion, libraries should offer diverse content, and individuals should have the freedom to choose what they engage with.
529	3506	2	2	I firmly believe that certain offensive materials should not be removed from library shelves. This is because it is the parents' responsibility to monitor what their children read, watch, or listen to. Everyone has the right to do as they please, and it's impossible to avoid all offensive content. Firstly, it is the parents' duty to supervise their children's media consumption. If parents don't want their kids exposed to offensive material, they should restrict access. Some parents claim they were unaware of the content, but that's what warnings are for. This is not a valid excuse. Secondly, offensive material is everywhere these days. Shows, movies, and music all contain elements that may not be suitable for all audiences. Children will inevitably learn about such content at some point in their lives, whether it's through media or at school. Thirdly, everyone has the right to read or listen to whatever they want. It's up to the individual to decide what they consume, not others. They should be able to purchase or borrow what they like without being questioned. In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from shelves. Instead, a solution could be to place offensive material on higher shelves. This would satisfy parents of younger children while still allowing those who want to view it to do so.
530	3507	2	2	How can writing be offensive? Many people find swear words or violence in writing offensive, while others find these elements make the writing more interesting. Writing can cover all aspects of life, including ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts. In today's world, almost any piece of writing can offend someone. If libraries were to censor to the extreme, there would be no books left, as Katherine Paterson said, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We have the power to decide whether to accept or reject offensive ideas in our heads. When we encounter something offensive, we can simply put the book down and use our better judgment. Everyone perceives things differently. Regarding children, I'm concerned that they don't have the same level of judgment as adults. The responsibility of judgment lies more with parents than libraries. Libraries categorize children's books to ensure they find age - appropriate material. Both adults and children can find books that suit them and don't offend them. If libraries were to censor, it would deny us our rights and freedom of speech. Our country was built on radical and offensive ideas written about the [oppressors]. Those words inspired us to become an independent nation. If those ideas had been censored, we might still be under [oppression]. In conclusion, we should not censor our reading but rather use our better judgment to navigate through different ideas.
531	3508	2	2	In contemporary society, it is quite common to encounter minor matters that can offend individuals, whether in the realms of politics or religion. The reality is that it is impossible to satisfy everyone. A significant current debate pertains to the media. Should individuals have the right to remove books, music, movies, or magazines from public access simply because they are deemed offensive by one person? The answer is a resounding no, supported by three crucial reasons: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the understanding that everyone can find something offensive.  When @LOCATION1 achieved liberation from @CAPS1, a primary objective was to secure the freedom of speech. This was a momentous accomplishment for the @ORGANIZATION1. Allowing people to remove materials from public availability would violate the very principle for which so much effort was expended. In modern times, citizens rely on the ability to express their opinions as an integral part of participating in the governance of their country.  Another highly valued right in @CAPS2 is the freedom of the press. The ability to express thoughts through writing is fundamental to @LOCATION1. Without this freedom, would we not regress to the old ways that @CAPS3 fought so hard to change? This is a question that must be carefully considered when making this important decision.  Finally, an important factor influencing this decision is the recognition that everyone holds opinions on various matters. It is easy to find someone who is offended by the most trivial things. What would happen if someone decided that the @CAPS4 was offensive to their religious beliefs? Would we remove it from the shelves and offer apologies to the @CAPS5? If we permitted such actions, would there be any books, movies, music, or magazines left for public consumption?  It is a simplistic assumption to remove a book just because it is offensive to an individual. However, if we allow this practice for everyone, it could lead to a chaotic situation. Therefore, when deciding how to handle this issue, more in - depth thought is required than a cursory consideration. We must always remember the rights bestowed upon us as @CAPS3, namely the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, and consider the impact of our decisions on future generations.
532	3509	2	2	As a student, I firmly believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media should not be removed from shelves simply because of their content. Every day, I read, watch, and listen to things that my parents might not approve of, yet these experiences have not changed my character. Explicit content such as drugs, sex, and other sensitive topics are ubiquitous in society. We cannot shield ourselves or our children from them by removing certain materials from the shelves.  Inappropriate content is everywhere, be it on billboards, signs, books, magazines, music, television, or movies. However, removing books, movies, music, and magazines from the shelves will not stop inappropriate behavior. People in society will continue to act in certain ways regardless of whether we can prevent our children from being exposed to such content. There are still commercials, billboards, and other forms of media that children may encounter. It is unrealistic to ban children from the world to protect them.  Reading, listening, and learning about these topics will not turn a child into a bad person. In fact, at a certain age, children need to be aware of these aspects of life. For example, I am a well - behaved student with good friends and a harmonious family life. I have read all of @PERSON1's books, which often feature characters involved in drug use, suicidal thoughts, and sexual activities. These books are excellent and have provided me with a different perspective. Reading them has not influenced me to engage in such behaviors.  In my experience, exploring these types of content can be beneficial. It allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the world. School education provides basic knowledge, which is often rather @CAPS2. Reading books, listening to music, and watching movies with more complex themes offer a different point of view. Take the @PERSON1 books as an example. The trilogy of Crank, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 depicts the life of @LOCATION1. Through these books, I witnessed the struggles and pain that @PERSON2 and her family endured as she became involved with @CAPS5. Reading these stories made me realize that I never want to put myself or my family through such hardships. It has given me a new outlook on life and made me more determined to avoid 'offensive' behaviors.  Based on my experiences as a student, I do not think it is necessary to remove offensive material from the shelves. It provides a more in - depth understanding of these issues, and explicit content is an inevitable part of life that we cannot avoid. We should accept this fact and use such resources to educate ourselves and our children.
533	3510	2	2	I firmly believe that there should be no censorship because we live in @LOCATION1, a place that values freedom. Censorship goes against the very essence of this principle. My view on people who find a book offensive is that if they hear a book is 'bad' or dislike its cover, that is their personal problem and should not ruin the experience for others who enjoy the book. For instance, if two people find a book offensive while five people like it, does that mean the book should be removed? Imagine if you were one of those five people and your favorite book was taken away, and the librarian said it was because two people flagged it as offensive.  I am an avid reader, and once in school, we read a book called Fahrenheit @NUM1. I thought it was a great book for its time, yet some people wanted to ban it, and some succeeded. My response to those people is simple: it's not right. I believe that when you enter a library, you should expect to encounter a wide range of ideas, as that is the essence of freedom.  In my opinion, libraries should come up with a new system. If a majority of people flag a book as offensive and do not want their children to see it, the library should separate these books, movies, magazines, etc., rather than removing them entirely. To those who find a particular book offensive, they should be aware of where such materials are located and avoid that section of the library. This is my stance on censorship in libraries.
534	3511	2	2	Most of us have visited the library at some point in our lives. Have you ever taken your young children to the library, only to have them pick up a book or magazine with content that made you uncomfortable? Many of us have had this experience. The question then arises: should public libraries stock books, magazines, or movies that could be offensive to children, younger siblings, or friends?  Public libraries are meant to be accessible to everyone, providing a space for people to carry out their activities without being exposed to offensive content such as nude pictures. We can take steps to address this issue. Offensive pictures in books or magazines can have a negative impact on children and young teens, as they may receive inappropriate information. Books, magazines, and movies with offensive pictures or nudity should be removed from public library shelves.  Many parents do not want their children to see offensive pictures at the library or check out movies that could have a bad influence on them. Libraries should offer good and enjoyable books, magazines, and movies. Library staff should take the initiative to remove all inappropriate items. Allowing such content in libraries may give some teens bad ideas.  That is why libraries should remove offensive books, movies, magazines, and even music. Some older people may think this is unfair. However, they should understand that such content can harm their children and teach them inappropriate behavior. There are different opinions among older people, with some agreeing and some disagreeing.  In conclusion, since many parents do not want their children to be exposed to bad pictures or check out inappropriate movies or books, removing such items is beneficial for children and young teens who are just starting to learn about relationships.
535	3512	2	2	Libraries are public spaces designed to offer a diverse range of entertainment options to cater to different interests. I understand that people have varying opinions, but that is precisely why there is such a wide variety of materials available. In my view, certain materials should not be banned simply because they contain more mature content than some consider appropriate. I respect those who disagree with me, but I encourage them to think more deeply about this issue. I will present several reasons to support my opinion, as I believe they highlight important concepts regarding why these materials should not be banned.  Firstly, in today's society, everyone has different views and opinions on various topics. The public has the right to choose their own forms of entertainment and engage with any material or subject matter they prefer. Restricting their access to entertainment is equivalent to dictating what clothes they can wear or what cars they can drive. If you enter a library and come across a subject that does not meet your standards or interest, you should simply move on and find something more suitable. Just because you do not like a particular style of entertainment does not mean others do not.  Secondly, banning certain materials would result in job losses for many individuals who are passionate about their work. Some people object to the content of books or movies, but this content is often a reflection of an author's feelings or real - life experiences. Authors write about real - life events that happen to ordinary people every day, and these stories should be celebrated as a form of self - expression. Criticizing entertainment subjects is a form of devaluing different forms of art. It is hypocritical to accept mature content in a painting but not in a book.  Finally, if the materials being published today were not wanted in libraries, why would they be printed and sold globally? The fact that they are indicates that there are people who appreciate and enjoy them.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that no form of entertainment should be banned or removed from society. Doing so would deprive people of their joy and limit the diversity of ideas and experiences available to the public.
536	3513	2	2	In libraries, the question of whether censorship is truly necessary arises. I firmly believe that to some extent, there should be a certain degree of censorship. Libraries generally do a good job of sorting materials. In every library I've visited, they utilize a specific system. However, even when they categorize books, music, and magazines by topic, there are often offensive items that fit within those topics.  I recall when I was seven or eight years old, I frequently accompanied my mother to the library. Realizing I was outgrowing the children's book section, I explored areas I had never been to before. Every aisle of books was accessible to anyone, and I felt as if I held the world in my hands. Most of the books were too advanced for me, but I still perused them all. It was a novel experience, almost like an adventure. Then, I came across the music section.  There were numerous inappropriate titles, cover - arts, and band names. This piqued my curiosity, and I wondered if books were the same. I soon discovered that they were. There were even medical books with graphic images and books containing swear words. The innocence of the library was shattered.  I believe libraries should have a separate section for older, more mature individuals, excluding children. Some people love books and will open any book to read or look at the pictures. Libraries need to recognize this. I was once that child who opened the wrong book at the wrong time.  In conclusion, I am of the opinion that libraries should implement at least some form of censorship. I understand that some people enjoy the books and music that once disturbed me, but I think action should be taken to address this issue.
537	3514	2	2	I wholeheartedly agree with the author Katherine Paterson's quote. If we were to eliminate everything in the world that offended us, there would be nothing left to behold.  One evening when I was younger, right after school, I decided to go to our town's downtown library. I needed a book for a school project on the Holocaust. One of the library staff members told me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to Jewish people. Initially, I was quite outraged. She was telling the person checking out the book that it should be taken off the shelves. I was the one going to read it, so why complain to me? Moreover, it's more offensive to tell someone they shouldn't check out the book they want than it is to the Jewish community.  Another similar incident occurred when I was at @ORGANIZATION1. A customer was complaining about a religious magazine, saying it shouldn't be sold because some articles were offensive to people of certain religions. This customer, who actually ripped a few magazines in half, was taken to the manager's office. They were kicked out and had to pay for the damaged magazines.  Throughout my life, there have been many instances where people have voiced their dislikes. Although they may present good arguments, they lack some important aspects. Firstly, most of the items people want removed from the shelves are related to history. Secondly, there aren't enough people complaining.  Katherine Paterson's quote is a wake - up call. It makes us think about what would happen if we removed all offensive items. When I read her quote, another quote comes to mind: '@CAPS1 speak louder than words'.
538	3515	2	2	My views on censorship may not align with those of others. With a proper understanding of what the majority considers inappropriate, it becomes easier to evaluate which books should be on the library shelves. People often have different opinions on what is appropriate; what one person deems suitable, another may disagree with. Therefore, implementing a rating system would be the most effective solution.  A rating system for books, movies, magazines, and other library materials would enable parents to better understand what they want their children to read or watch. If a book contains vulgar language, it could be given a rating along with an explanation of the reason for the rating. This way, if there are complaints about an item, the library won't be held accountable.  Personally, I don't think materials should be removed due to others' complaints. Instead, the books could be retained but labeled or placed in a separate section of the shelves to indicate that they may be more inappropriate than the average item. What would happen if a college student needs a mandatory book for their class, but the book is banned because of 'inappropriate usage'? It's impossible to satisfy everyone completely, but this rating system would resolve many issues.  My views on censorship may not be shared by others, but taking away well - written books is unjust. Disagreement is difficult, but just because it's challenging doesn't mean we should give up. The rating system would reduce complications and allow people more freedom in their choices.
539	3516	2	2	Books serve as gateways to other worlds. Today, there are books on virtually every imaginable topic. People use books to escape their troubles and embark on a journey outside themselves. However, the content of some books is not always appropriate.  Schools strive to offer books that appeal to all audiences, but this ability is being undermined by the banning of books from shelves. Students are unable to read a book simply because someone else disapproves of its content. This is unfair and should be stopped. Students have the right to choose what they want to read, yet some people attempt to take this right away from them. Students are also capable of deciding what is appropriate for them to read. If lawmakers yield to the complaints of a few individuals, it could impede students' rights and make them feel untrusted.  The content of a book is the author's prerogative, and the choice of what to read lies with the reader. Sometimes, authors go into great detail to convey their message or write books with mature content. Some people believe that if a book is inappropriate in their view, it should not be available at all. This is unfair not only to potential readers but also to the author who worked hard on the book.  Students are more intelligent than many people realize. They know what they should and should not read. When the choice of reading material is left to others, they feel betrayed and untrusted.  Students have the same rights as non - students. If books are removed from shelves based on the opinions of a few, their rights are being violated by those who deem the books inappropriate. The students' freedom to choose what to read is lost, and only books selected by others remain. Rights are guaranteed to students when they enter school, but these rights are gradually being eroded. The right to choose what to read should not be taken away.  As author Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf, that work that i abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If one person advocates for a book's removal, and then another does the same for a different book, eventually, there will be no books left for students to read.  Books are essential for students' growth into adulthood. If people gain the power to remove books from shelves, music, movies, and magazines will also be targeted. Books are for any reader who wishes to explore new worlds. Students have the right to choose what they read and the ability to discern appropriate reading material. Books should remain on the school shelves.
540	3517	2	2	The question of whether certain books and magazines should be displayed in libraries is an important one. In my opinion, libraries should not stock certain materials due to issues such as racism and violence. Firstly, there are young children who use the library, and they should not be exposed to such content at an early age. Secondly, books and magazines with racist or otherwise offensive content can be hurtful to others.  Imagine how you would feel if your children were reading about such things. This is not the kind of knowledge that a child needs at a young age.   In conclusion, I firmly believe that libraries should carefully curate their collections to avoid including materials that are offensive or inappropriate for young readers. By doing so, they can create a more positive and inclusive environment for all library users.
541	3518	2	2	There exist materials in libraries that may be offensive to certain individuals. In my view, these materials should not be removed from the library but rather placed in a separate section. Offensive content is prevalent in daily life, ranging from minor 'blonde jokes' to more significant issues like remarks about someone's sexuality. While young children may not comprehend such content, parents cannot shield their children from the world indefinitely.   It is wrong to make offensive remarks about others. Many blondes I know do not take 'blonde jokes' seriously. For instance, one of my intelligent, naturally - blonde friends laughs at these jokes and responds humorously. Politics and sexuality are among the most common triggers for offense. Political stances can cause great distress to those with different views, and people who deviate from the so - called 'norm' in terms of their preferences often face offense.   Parents cannot isolate their children from these issues forever as children grow into adults. People should learn to cope with life's challenges. If parents wish to protect their children from offensive content, that is their choice. However, others are interested in learning about such topics. Keeping offensive books, movies, and magazines in a separate area of the library is a reasonable solution. Removing these materials from the shelves would offend those who want to understand different perspectives. In conclusion, this approach strikes a balance between protecting the sensibilities of some and respecting the learning desires of others.
542	3519	2	2	"Some books may be offensive to certain people, but everyone has the right to read whatever they choose. I firmly believe that schools should not censor books deemed offensive. If someone finds a book offensive from the start, they can either select another book or consult their teacher.  I've had my own experience with offensive books. Everyone has read a book that bothered them, yet the same book might intrigue others. As the saying goes, ""Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger."" So, we shouldn't take books too personally. Authors often target specific audiences.   Some students in my school told me that reading certain books was a terrible experience, especially those dealing with suicide. One of my best friends had a hard time with such a book because of her father's situation. I advised her to talk to the teacher, and the teacher changed the book for her. That's all one needs to do; there's no need to make a big deal out of it.  I also read 'To Kill a Mockingbird', which is censored in some states because it's considered hurtful to some. The story is about a white family trying to help a black man wrongly accused of rape. Despite overwhelming evidence, they couldn't save him. It's a powerful story about the struggles of black people in the past. To censor a story of a white lawyer helping someone of a different race is inspiring, not offensive. The lawyer and his children were harassed, but he fought hard to save his client. As a [NUM1] - year - old boy, this book made me cry. It's a shame that it's censored in some states as it's one of the best books I've ever read.  In summary, censorship should not be allowed as it deprives people of the opportunity to read potentially great and interesting books. High - school students, almost adults, should be allowed to read what they want."
543	3520	2	2	Censorship is a highly contentious issue. In my opinion, it should be rarely implemented, except in specific cases such as children's libraries or children's television networks. Censorship restricts freedom of speech and expression, which goes against the principles of our country.  There are indeed circumstances where censorship is necessary, like on children's TV networks or in school libraries. Growing up, my parents never imposed censorship rules on me, and I could read, watch, and listen to whatever I wanted. However, this doesn't mean I'm completely against censorship. I believe it's the parents' responsibility to decide what their children should be exposed to. When I become a parent, I'll censor content that I consider inappropriate for my children's age.  The moral issue with censorship is significant. We censor because we think the material is offensive or has bad morals, but these are just our opinions. In a society that claims to be tolerant, we should respect the creators' beliefs, even if they differ from ours. Censorship forces creators to change their self - expressions. A work of art, whether it's a painting, music, or a TV show, reflects the creator's mind and beliefs. Censoring it disrupts the communication between the creator and the audience, violating the freedoms we hold dear.  This is a sensitive topic, especially when children's well - being is involved. While we should have censorship in children's libraries and TV networks, we rely too much on the government to censor what we find inappropriate. In reality, it's the parents' job. To resolve this debate, I suggest that every creation should be available in both censored and uncensored versions. This way, children can access more advanced literature, creators can express themselves, and the public can get what they want. In conclusion, this approach can balance the needs of different parties.
544	3521	2	2	Offensive materials should not be publicly displayed, especially in libraries. Such materials can have a significant impact on children under ten. If library materials are found and proven to be offensive, they should be removed.  Library materials are not suitable for everyone, especially young children. For example, a child might want to check out a movie that seems interesting. Even if the movie is rated [NUM1], it may contain strong language, sex - related content, or humor. After watching it, the child is exposed to such inappropriate elements, and nervous parents may call the library. Nowadays, many children over [NUM2] have been exposed to profanity or inappropriate behavior through books, movies, or other materials.  Religious people may be bothered if they find profanity in books or magazines from the library. If libraries won't remove these materials from the shelves, they should at least maintain a list of materials with heavy profanity, sex, and strong violence to warn borrowers.  Given the unpleasant content in various library materials, people need to be informed about what they read and watch. Some books can be quite vulgar. Library materials should be carefully checked. If they are offensive and proven so, they should be relocated. In conclusion, ensuring that library materials are appropriate for different audiences is crucial for a positive reading environment.
545	3522	2	2	People's opinions on what is offensive vary greatly. What one person finds extremely offensive, another may not care about or even find amusing. In the following, I'll explain why censorship should not be allowed in libraries.  Firstly, censorship violates our freedom of speech. If we truly have this freedom, censorship goes against it. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, whether they are expressing it through magazines, books, newspapers, movies, or music. Authors and artists use these mediums to spread their ideas and beliefs.  Secondly, no single person can represent an entire gender, country, culture, race, or religion. Whether a person has low status or great power, there will always be others with different views. Censorship deprives people of the opportunity to be inspired or learn from different perspectives. For example, one man may find a book offensive to him or his family, while another similar man may find it funny.  Personal experiences also play a role. A near - death experience may inspire someone to write a book, and a bad break - up may lead to a song. These creations can inspire others, and no one should tell the creators that their work is wrong just because they find it offensive.  All these factors matter. No individual or group has the right to take away our freedom. I am firmly against censorship in libraries and hope others will share the same view. In conclusion, allowing diverse materials in libraries respects freedom of speech and promotes a more inclusive and learning - oriented environment.
546	3523	2	2	When your child says they're going to the library to study, have you ever considered that they might actually be looking for books about murder, violence, or other potentially concerning information? On @DATE1, you never know what @CAPS3 might find on the library shelves. Most of the books, music, movies, or magazines there cover helpful topics. However, there's always that one @CAPS2 you don't want your child to come across, or that one movie you hope they're not watching.  I firmly believe that topics like violence and murder should be removed from library shelves. Parents should be able to trust that when their child goes to the library, it's to study, not to look for inappropriate books, movies, or magazines. Many books and movies depict violence as a positive thing. For instance, when children search for an interesting book, they're not looking for something dull; they want something eye - catching. Unfortunately, many of these books involve violence. The more kids read about it, the more they may think violence is acceptable.  Magazines like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or '@CAPS3 @CAPS2' now feature stories about drug use, teen pregnancy, or the death of famous @CAPS3. On @DATE1, drug use among teens and adults has been increasing, and the teen pregnancy rate has risen significantly in recent years. These are serious issues. I personally think the reason for these increases is that kids see these topics in magazines, on TV, or in books and start to think they're normal. They may believe it's easy to have a child at a young age or that using drugs is cool because famous @CAPS3 are shown doing it. But they don't understand that it's not as simple or fun as it seems in the media.  What happened to libraries that provided truly helpful information for school? I understand that @CAPS3 want to read about famous @CAPS3 and their latest news. However, when libraries are filled with these types of books, magazines, and movies, it limits the amount of useful information kids need for school and adults need for work. When I was young, I went to the library either to study or to borrow a good book, not one about violence, murder, or teen pregnancy. Kids should be able to rely on libraries for books and information that will help them in school, not on irrelevant topics.  As author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I believe she's right. These inappropriate books, magazines, and movies should be removed from library shelves.
547	3524	2	2	Who has the right to label a book as offensive? What one person finds appalling, others @MONTH1 may find quite interesting. All forms of literature and other arts are created to be read and enjoyed by people. It seems unreasonable for libraries to ban books, music, movies, or magazines, given the wide diversity of people and their interests.  Books such as The @CAPS1, The @CAPS2's @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been removed from many library shelves. Although some people @MONTH1 still check these books out, many others find them offensive or think they don't belong among regular books. I've read a fair amount of each of these works and found them to be full of remarkable insights that have taught me a great deal. If books are banned from libraries, it's almost like limiting our education.  Why would a book be published if we weren't meant to read it? Any book, article, song, or film could be offensive to someone. But there will always be an audience that appreciates it, and that audience deserves to enjoy every word. Censorship in libraries has persisted for too long. It's time for the world to freely engage with the literature that interests them.  The solution to library censorship is to categorize books into various categories and sub - categories, starting with the subject and going down to the author. In this way, books that @MONTH1 be offensive can be clearly labeled as such, but still be available to those who want to read them.  Censorship in libraries undermines individual freedom every day. People should be able to read what they like without being criticized. All books are written to be read, and with proper categorization, everyone can agree that books contribute to our growth. Growth should not be restricted, and neither should freedom.
548	3525	2	2	People have the right to choose the literature they read, regardless of whether it might offend them. Books should not be removed from library shelves. Instead, individuals should try to avoid books that @MONTH1 be offensive to them. If they can't, it's not the library's fault. There are several reasons why books should not be removed.  Firstly, when people enter a library, they are aware of the risks they take, and it's their decision. Sometimes, decisions have consequences. If they are offended, they will know which types of books to avoid in the future.  Secondly, libraries can't know what offends everyone. A single minor element in a book doesn't mean the whole book should be removed. Just because one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean others will. People have different sensitivities; some are easily offended by small things, while others require more serious issues to be offended.  Thirdly, students need these books for school projects and assignments. Some school tasks may involve encountering offensive content, especially for African - American students working on assignments related to slavery. However, we need to learn about our past and history, and we can't do that if people keep removing relevant books from the shelves. You @MONTH1 get offended, but there's no reason to remove a book that others may need.  There are alternative solutions to this problem. For example, books can be tagged with a small yellow sticker to warn people that they may be offensive. There's no need to completely remove the book. Another option is to separate these books if there are multiple complaints. Also, when someone checks out a book, the librarian can inform them that the book has a warning sticker and may be offensive. In conclusion, removing books from library shelves is not a justifiable solution.
549	3526	2	2	Do you ever think that certain books, music, and magazines can be very offensive? If I had children, I wouldn't want them exposed to such negative influences. I firmly believe that we should remove all these bad things from the world to help children grow into better people.  There are many bad people in the world, and a large part of the reason is the content people read and see. When famous singers sing about drugs, kids may think it's cool and start using them, and then it can be hard to stop. We want our children to go to college and become doctors, but they can't if they follow the wrong examples. We need to encourage our children to be great, but it's difficult with drugs and violence surrounding them. We should try to ban bad books, movies, and music. We need more positive influences for our children.  We don't want our children to look at magazines and think they have to be extremely thin to be popular. If your children want to read or listen to such things, you must prevent them from being influenced. I listen to rap music all the time, but I never let it change my values because I want to be successful in life.  These are the reasons why we should ban these negative things from our children's lives. If you want your children to be successful, keep them away from violence and drugs. I know the consequences of not doing so, and you don't want these things to happen to your kids. So, take action to protect them.
550	3527	2	2	There are many books that some people don't want their children to read. For example, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1' is a rather straightforward book that I've read. However, I disagree with those who want to ban it. I think these books should be available because they show kids that the world isn't perfect.  People often complain about books, things said on @CAPS3, or in music being bad. But if you don't want your kids to be exposed to them, simply don't let them listen or read. If parents are so worried about what their kids are learning, they might as well lock them up. However, I do agree that there is a lot of inappropriate content in music and magazines. But I believe it can be avoided without corrupting kids.  I'm a big music fan, and there are some songs I don't listen to because of the content. But I don't let that change my views. I don't think people should be allowed to remove books from library shelves because it deprives others of the opportunity to read them. Some people are inspired by books about drugs, not to use them, but to know that others have overcome similar situations. I like reading books about teenage problems to learn how different people have dealt with them.  If people get offended by a book or movie, I don't think they have the right to take it away. Those who are offended should stay away from such content because everyone has different opinions.  There are many good and bad movies and books out there, and it's inevitable that someone will be offended by one or two. But that's not a reason to ban them. Once you start banning books, someone might ban a book you like, and that would make you angry. If people avoid what offends them and focus on what they like, there won't be many conflicts, unless there are overly picky people looking for something to complain about.
551	3528	2	2	Do you think inappropriate or offensive books, magazines, movies, or music should be available in a public library? Some materials can be highly offensive to people. When they take their children or younger siblings to the library, they don't want them exposed to such content. However, there are others who prefer to access these materials, and they would be angry if they were removed. Not all parents find the content in libraries offensive, even if it might be.  Materials that are inappropriate for children should be placed in a separate section rather than being removed from those who enjoy them. While it's bad for children to view inappropriate content, it's also unfair to those who visit the library specifically for these materials. They should not be deprived of access. If parents don't want their children to see such things, they should keep them away from that section. Some adults may not like seeing this content, which is understandable. Regardless of the decision, someone will be unhappy.  Libraries typically have an adult section and a kids' section. If an adult doesn't want their child to see something, they can simply take them to the children's section where such content is unlikely to be found. It's rare to find materials in the children's section that adults would consider offensive. For adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things, they can be placed in a section far from the children. Taking away things that people like is wrong and unfair to those who enjoy them.  Recently, the world has witnessed some disturbing and cruel events, and news about these can be found in libraries. It's understandable that parents don't want their children exposed to such content, but it's wrong to remove these materials from those who are interested in them. For example, scary movies can be too violent for young children but may be an adult's favorite. That's why placing more offensive materials in a different section would prevent children from noticing them.  If children are separated from these offensive materials, they won't be exposed to them. Removing what some adults find offensive is as unfair as removing the children's section. It's not fair to take away something that some adults or teenagers come to the library for. Not all adults understand both sides, but I can see the perspectives of both. If I had children, I wouldn't want them to see offensive things, but I would keep them away from it rather than opposing its presence. In conclusion, inappropriate materials for children should be placed in a separate section, not removed from those who enjoy them.
552	3529	2	2	Libraries around the world house millions of books and other media, which are accessed by millions of people daily. People have different preferences for books and media, and some dislike certain materials due to their content. Everyone has the right to choose what they read and watch, and not everyone will consume the same materials. Although some materials may be offensive, they should not be removed from libraries.  Books and other media should remain on library shelves because what is offensive to some may not be offensive to others. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and opinions. If someone wishes to read a book or watch a video, they should have the freedom to do so. The determination of what is offensive is a personal choice based on an individual's perspective. If someone finds the content of a book, song, or movie offensive, they can simply avoid it.  Materials should not be removed from libraries as they can be used for educational purposes, such as learning history. For instance, there are numerous books and movies about [@CAPS1]. Despite some people finding them offensive, these materials can teach us about the horrors of history to prevent similar events from recurring. People should educate themselves about the content before consuming it to avoid being offended. Some historical content is suitable only for mature audiences.  Offensive content usually belongs in the mature section of libraries and has the right to be there. Most offensive content is intended for adult audiences, and there are few children's books with offensive content. If an author or publisher has put effort into creating a work, they should receive recognition. In [@LOCATION1], freedom of speech allows people to express themselves. Content should be removed only under special circumstances when it is extremely offensive.  In conclusion, library content, whether offensive or not, should not be removed. People have the right to choose what they read and watch. Libraries are public spaces shared by everyone, and no one has the right to dictate what should or should not be available. Libraries play a crucial role in educating society, and without them, people would not be as well - informed as they are today.
553	3530	2	2	Have you ever wondered why a movie you rented from a library as a child is no longer available? This is due to censorship. Libraries censor certain materials they deem inappropriate for young children. The question of whether censorship should be allowed in libraries is a matter of personal opinion, and I firmly believe it should be.  Censoring books, movies, magazines, music, and other materials in libraries helps protect children who are not mature enough to handle the content. This could include curse words in movies, books, or music, nudity in magazines, or violence in video games. Young children often look up to role models and may imitate what they see or hear. Some children may not understand that repeating certain words or actions is inappropriate. For example, if a child sees a character in a movie solve a problem through fighting, they may try to do the same in real - life.  I think an age limit should be set for certain materials. Children under the age of [@NUM1] should not be allowed to rent movies rated [@CAPS1 - @NUM1]. Ratings are assigned for a reason. Just because a child can't rent a particular material doesn't mean an adult can't. Adults can check out the material, assess its suitability for their child, and then decide whether to let the child access it. Libraries don't want to be held responsible for a child's不良行为 after being exposed to inappropriate content.  My sister once took my niece to the library to rent a children's movie. She thought there would be no harm, but in one scene, there was arguing and fighting. My niece then started arguing with and hitting my sister, and my sister was unhappy that the library allowed such a movie on the children's floor.  Censorship is a valuable tool in libraries. Some children's maturity levels are not high enough to handle certain materials. Censorship not only should be allowed but also enforced. I believe all libraries should implement censorship policies. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is essential to protect children from inappropriate content and ensure a safe and educational environment.
554	3531	2	2	"When one enters a library and glances at the magazine rack, they might wonder, ""Why is that in the young - adult section? The content isn't age - appropriate."" In many libraries, books are not properly censored and categorized. Some reading materials may contain inappropriate content that readers may not immediately notice. There isn't always adequate supervision of children and young adults, and they may not be aware of what they're checking out. Therefore, libraries need to enforce censorship more strictly.  Most libraries categorize materials as children's, young - adult, adult books by genre, magazines, and music. However, the content inside these materials needs closer scrutiny. Some magazine articles may not be suitable for teens, even if they claim to be age - appropriate. I recall when I was fourteen, I read a series related to colors on the color wheel. Each book covered heavy topics like suicide, alcoholism, drugs, sex, same - sex dating, and jealousy. Looking back, I'm surprised I was allowed to check them out. The language in books and music can also be inappropriate for children and may be distasteful to some adults. The categorization system needs to be more detailed so that people know what they're getting when they check out a book or magazine.  When a child approaches the checkout counter with a book, librarians sometimes don't pay attention to the content and simply check it out. Libraries should adopt a rating system similar to that of movies. Generally, parents wouldn't let their ten - year - old watch a movie rated [@NUM1], [@CAPS2], or unrated. So why would they let their child get a book with similar content? If books had a rating system, a ten - year - old wouldn't be able to access a book rated [@CAPS2] or [@CAPS4] for mature content.  There isn't enough supervision in libraries. I understand that libraries aren't day - care centers and librarians aren't babysitters, but stricter guidelines are needed. Some people may not be fully aware of what their children or they themselves are reading. For example, a thirteen - year - old girl wants to check out [@CAPS5] magazine because her friend's older sister gets it. Her mother allows it, assuming it's just about fashion. However, the magazine may contain an article about sex and protection, which could expose the girl to inappropriate content. If the library had stricter guidelines, the girl might not have read that article. Even if librarians had to check a person's library card to ensure they can access a certain section or material, it would protect more people than it would inconvenience.  In conclusion, if libraries improved their censorship of books, children and teens would be less likely to access age - inappropriate content. I'm not suggesting that books be removed from the shelves, but rather that they be placed more carefully and monitored more closely."
555	3532	2	2	This essay aims to express my opinion on whether offensive materials should be removed from library shelves. In my view, any materials that are offensive to anyone should be removed from libraries.  If the materials are highly offensive, they should definitely be removed. However, if they are only mildly offensive, they can remain. Since libraries are open to people of all ages, materials that are offensive to children may not be offensive to adults. But because children have access to all the materials in the library, they may come across something offensive.  If a child finds something that their parents consider offensive, the library could face a lawsuit, which is not desirable. By removing books, music, magazines, or movies that are not suitable for all ages, libraries can reduce the risk of being sued.  Libraries are primarily meant to provide information. There is no need for offensive materials as they rarely offer useful information. Libraries should focus on their original purpose and contain encyclopedias, dictionaries, and other books that can provide valuable information to people.  In conclusion, materials that are offensive to anyone of any age should be removed from libraries. Libraries are established to provide information, and this should be their sole focus. By eliminating offensive materials, libraries can better fulfill their educational role and create a more suitable environment for all users.
556	3533	2	2	Should books, music, movies, and magazines offensive to the public be removed? I firmly believe they should not. There are countless books with diverse themes, and readers hold varying opinions. For instance, a book about abortions might be valuable to someone seeking knowledge on the subject, but another person could oppose it due to personal beliefs. Just because one individual dislikes something doesn't mean it isn't appreciated by others.  Some might argue for removing certain content, like sex - related materials, fearing it promotes inappropriate behavior among young people. However, most sex - related books teach the right and wrong ways and how to stay safe. Given that a significant percentage of teens worldwide are sexually active, such books can help them protect themselves and others.  In conclusion, while many may find certain books or other materials offensive, everyone has their own opinions. We can't remove items just because of one person's view. Doing so would be unfair to those seeking help or information on personal issues. Thus, I disagree with removing items that may be offensive to others, as people are different, and this should not change due to a disagreement or opinion.
557	3534	2	2	I don't believe that books or other materials should be removed from library shelves simply because some people find them offensive. If parents don't want their children to read certain materials, they have the right to restrict their access, but it's unfair to remove the items entirely. A book marked as 'offensive' could be a source of learning for someone else.  There are non - fiction books that might be labeled 'offensive', but they are based on real events. Reading them can provide knowledge, and taking them away would deprive others of that opportunity. In a library, people should have the freedom to choose what they read. If parents object to a particular book, they can communicate their concerns to their children.  I've read non - fiction books that some might consider offensive, yet I learned a great deal from them. Removing such books shows more concern for potential offense than for the educational value. If we remove every book with a racial slur or an act of violence, what will be left for children to read and learn from? By reading these books, children can understand the emotional and physical harm caused by such actions and learn to avoid them.  Overall, library materials should remain on the shelves. If someone finds something offensive, they should refrain from reading it rather than depriving others of knowledge. In a world where education is crucial, removing books based on personal preferences limits our learning resources.
558	3535	2	2	Censorship in libraries is an important consideration in schools and public settings. Some movies, books, and magazines can have a greater influence on children than we might think. For example, gory movies often depict people being cut up or shot. Children may be affected by such content and might think they can replicate what they see or read.  In the movie @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, people are beaten and killed because of their skin color. Some children might wrongly think this behavior is acceptable. They can easily borrow this movie from the library and watch it at home. However, if it is used as a teaching tool to show that this was a wrong and outdated way of life, it can have a positive educational value. Parents should ensure that the message conveyed to children is correct.  Certain magazines in schools or public libraries are not suitable for children. Gun magazines may give the impression that it's okay to carry a gun everywhere, and hunting magazines may make children think they can freely go out and shoot things without understanding the need for a license.  Similarly, some books start well but end up filled with gore and violence. For example, in the book @TITLE1, a group of people gain powers in a sphere, and when children read this, they might imagine they can cause harm to others or themselves.  In conclusion, it's necessary to censor some materials in libraries. If it's not possible to remove them, at least an age limit should be set to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content.
559	3536	2	2	I don't think offensive materials should be removed from libraries. If someone is offended by a book, music, movie, or other material, they should simply ignore it and find something else that interests them. Those who complain about offensive materials may not be the best fit for a library environment.  When I was in seventh grade, our class took a field trip to the city library. It was an exciting experience as the interior looked amazing. I was searching for a book about animals for a school research project. While looking, I witnessed a man of color yelling at a librarian. He was offended by a book about slaves because his grandfather was a slave. However, after reading the book myself, I found nothing offensive about it. It simply described the hard work of slaves and their eventual freedom.  In my opinion, offensive materials should stay in libraries. There are people who don't find them offensive and will benefit from reading them. If someone thinks a book is offensive, they should just move on and choose a different one. That's why I firmly believe offensive materials should not be removed from libraries.
560	3537	2	2	Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' There are indeed many books, magazines, and movies with content that may not be suitable for young children. Parents are responsible for ensuring their children's safety and access to age - appropriate materials. However, this doesn't mean removing these materials from library shelves for everyone.  Censorship in libraries takes away people's freedom of choice. Content inappropriate for children may be suitable for adults. It's the parents' job to censor what their children borrow from the library.  People in @LOCATION2 have the right to express themselves and be free. They have the freedom to choose their reading materials, whether it's books, magazines, movies, or music. Everyone has different interests, and libraries offer a wide variety of materials to accommodate these differences. While censoring library content may seem beneficial for children, adults have the right to choose what they want to read. Censorship would reduce people's freedom and individuality.  Moreover, censoring library materials limits the range of available resources. There is content that children shouldn't see, but adults may find it interesting and enjoyable. Libraries provide a large selection of materials that allow people to express themselves and find entertainment. Censoring these materials would greatly reduce the variety.  Parents are also responsible for overseeing their children. They make decisions about their children's clothing, living arrangements, and schooling. The same principle applies to books, movies, and music. Different parents have different parenting styles, and they decide what's best for their children. If one parent finds something offensive, they can protect their child, while another parent may not have an issue with it.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries creates more problems than solutions. It takes away people's right to choose and freedom, and it severely limits the variety of available content. It's the parents' responsibility, not the law's, to control what their children read. As citizens of @LOCATION1, we have the right to freedom and individuality, and library censorship undermines these rights. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
561	3538	2	2	"Censorship is a pressing question in today's society. What was deemed unacceptable even a few years ago is now freely accessible for viewing, reading, and listening. The question arises: is censorship a necessary process, or should libraries have the autonomy to stock their shelves with whatever they consider appropriate? Is it still a valuable practice, or has it become an outdated and unnecessary relic?  In contemporary society, there is a widespread encouragement to read. However, libraries often lack the specific literature that individuals are interested in. Why should one be forced to read something they dislike simply because the library does not have the desired book?  I firmly believe that libraries should implement censorship to remove any books they find offensive or immoral. Nevertheless, I do not support the removal of books due to bad language or content related to religious themes. Books, magazines, or movies with certain controversial content should be removed if the library deems it necessary. Libraries should curate their collections based on their own standards, rather than stocking popular but ""bad"" materials.  While I advocate for censorship in libraries, I do not believe it should be an overly strict system. Libraries should establish clear standards for the materials they acquire and adhere to these guidelines. However, there is a risk that some libraries may set their standards too low or too high, resulting in either an abundance of ""bad"" books or a lack of available materials. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a nationwide set of standards to determine what types of materials are suitable for libraries.  In conclusion, I believe that censorship remains a necessary and beneficial process. However, it is currently too subjective, lacking in factual basis and public input. To better serve society, censorship should be more effectively regulated."
562	3539	2	2	Author Katherine Paterson once stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This statement highlights the controversial issue of censorship in libraries in today's society.  Many types of books, magazines, music, and movies have been banned from library shelves due to their content. Based on my personal experiences, observations, and research, I firmly believe that censorship should not be permitted in libraries.  If censorship continues, library shelves will gradually become empty. Certain types of reading materials and entertainment have already started to disappear. It is understandable that an individual may disagree with the content of a particular book, but they should not deprive others of the opportunity to enjoy it. For example, when I was in elementary school, students were not allowed to read a popular book series because the priest at the corresponding church disagreed with its content. As a result, the books were removed from the school library, and students were prohibited from bringing them to school. This is a clear example of how censorship can limit people's access to information and entertainment.  Authors and artists have the freedom to express themselves in their works, and it is not the responsibility of the audience to determine the appropriateness of the content. If a reader or viewer does not agree with a particular work, they have the choice not to engage with it. Just because one person may find a book offensive does not mean that others will share the same opinion. Censorship undermines the creative freedom of artists and restricts the diversity of ideas available to the public.  In many works of literature, the theme of censorship is explored. For instance, in the novel Fahrenheit 451, books are burned because they contain information that the authorities deem inappropriate. In today's world, books are an important source of entertainment and knowledge, and it would be a great loss if they were to be censored.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. Everyone has the right to read and enjoy the works of their choice, and censorship should not be used to limit this freedom. We should respect the creativity of authors and artists and ensure that a wide range of materials is available in libraries for future generations to enjoy.
563	3540	2	2	Censorship is a legal concept, yet it is frequently violated, particularly in libraries. I firmly believe that censorship has a detrimental impact on writers and the school system.  In the United States, individuals have the right to express their beliefs and opinions on various topics. However, many libraries are undermining this right by restricting access to certain books and movies. For example, if a librarian dislikes a particular genre of books, they should not prevent others from reading them. Similarly, if a teacher does not want to show a movie in class, they should not ban all movies.  In schools, students are often prohibited from reading about certain topics in the library because the school system deems them inappropriate. However, if students are interested in learning about a particular subject, they should have the right to do so. We should respect the teachers' authority, but they should also respect our right to access information.  Censorship is illegal in our society, yet the government does not seem to take it seriously. This is a form of discrimination against writers, and it is unfair to both the writers and the readers. We should be able to expand our knowledge on topics that interest us, and the law should be enforced to protect our rights.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a significant problem that needs to be resolved. The government should take action to enforce the law and protect the rights of writers and readers. We should be able to access a wide range of information and express our opinions freely without fear of censorship.
564	3541	2	2	Do you think books with vulgar content should be available in libraries? We all know that there are books that parents hope their children never read. In today's world, it's almost impossible to find an action movie without swear words. However, just because a book contains vulgar language, graphic violence, or sexual content, it doesn't mean it should be removed from the library shelves.  Take a look at the banned book list. Some of the books on it are truly absurd. For example, *Huckleberry Finn* has been banned because of its use of the word 'nigger'. While this word is offensive in today's society, it reflects the language and attitudes of the time when slavery was prevalent. The book is written from the perspective of an anti - slavery author. Another example is *Charlotte's Web*, which has been banned because of talking animals. But we see talking animals in movies all the time, and it's obvious to kids that it's just fiction.  The TV show *South Park* has been banned for being racist. However, it's up to the viewers to decide whether they want to watch it or not. Just like in a movie store, where movies are rated, people can choose whether to watch a rated - R movie or not. The same principle should apply to books.  In conclusion, offensive books should not be removed from library shelves. People have the right to choose what they read, and censorship limits this freedom. There are already many banned books, and we shouldn't add more to the list. Just because a book might be offensive to some doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone.
565	3542	2	2	I am firmly of the opinion that censorship in libraries is unjust. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to educate, inform, and entertain readers. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. If parents are concerned about their children's exposure to certain materials, they should regulate their children's access rather than forcing libraries to remove these items.  I have personally experienced situations where I wanted to borrow a book from the library, but it was unavailable due to its adult content. However, having grown up reading similar books, I did not consider it inappropriate. Movies also have ratings, such as from G to R, which clearly indicate their suitability for different audiences. Libraries and movie theaters already have measures in place to ensure that children do not access inappropriate content without parental supervision.  Some parents, out of concern for their children's well - being, try to have libraries remove books, movies, and magazines that they find offensive. However, these materials are funded by taxpayers, and other people have the right to access them. For example, some libraries have banned *The Catcher in the Rye* because someone found the way the story was written offensive. A group of people who had not even read the book followed the lead of the person who claimed it was offensive and had it removed. In reality, it is a fictional story and not intended to be offensive.  I recall living in a town with a predominantly Christian population. The libraries in that town only stocked Christian books. When I asked for a particular series of books, I was always turned down because of the religious majority. I believe that everyone should have an equal right to have their preferred books on library shelves.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is wrong. People pay taxes to support the library's collection, and they should have the freedom to choose what they read and watch. Parents should take responsibility for guiding their children's media consumption rather than imposing their views on others. By respecting individual rights, we can ensure that libraries remain a place where diverse ideas and materials are available to all.
566	3543	2	2	Katherine Paterson has expressed her concern that she doesn't want her child to pick up an offensive book from the library shelf. In my opinion, libraries should set up restricted sections that are not easily accessible to the public but are available for specific individuals.   If my child were to pick up a book inappropriate for their age, I wouldn't be angry. I understand that the categorization of books may not be perfect, and some books may be placed in a way that makes them visible to all, which could be offensive to some. In such a case, I would simply tell my child that the book is not suitable for them and then help them choose a new one.   I once had a similar experience as a child. I wandered through the library shelves in search of an interesting book, only to come across one that was not age - appropriate. This incident made me believe that libraries should have dedicated sections for different age groups, and these sections should be off - limits to children.   In conclusion, library staff should be more vigilant to prevent such situations from happening again. By creating age - appropriate sections and closely monitoring the availability of books, we can ensure a more suitable reading environment for everyone.
567	3544	2	2	There are movies, books, music, and other forms of media that some people may find offensive. In my view, if a person is of the appropriate age for a particular type of literature, they should be allowed to access it. If someone reads a book and finds it offensive, they probably shouldn't have chosen to read it in the first place. These forms of media are meant for entertainment, and if they fail to entertain, they're simply not the right fit.  I had an experience where a movie offended me. It degraded women by showing them being beaten and treated as slaves. As I watched, I realized that these women could be someone's daughter or mother, and I couldn't accept such treatment. After the movie, I told my mother about how it had offended me.  I'm sure that most authors don't intend to offend readers, but there could be ways for them to rephrase their content. People have different opinions and ways of thinking. If it's clear that a book is intended to be offensive, one shouldn't buy it. However, just because one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean it should be removed from the shelf. Another person might enjoy it. Everyone absorbs information differently.  In conclusion, if you're offended by a book, music, or movie, you should learn from it and explain why it offended you. Parents who are offended should prevent their children from accessing such media as it can have a negative impact on them. Media is for entertainment, not for causing offense.
568	3545	2	2	Censorship is a highly debatable topic. In my view, I have a reasonable perspective on why censorship is beneficial and why it might need to be more strictly enforced.  The question of whether books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves is complex. I believe that adults should have the right to choose what they read or consume, even if it's vulgar. However, when it comes to children, they should not have unrestricted access to vulgar, sexual, or inappropriate content.  Libraries and other media platforms should have separate sections for children and adults. This way, children won't easily access inappropriate materials. If parents think it's okay for their children to read, watch, or listen to something, they should be the ones to provide it until the children reach adulthood. I don't advocate for sheltering children completely from the world, but there should be limits to what they are exposed to.  I firmly believe that censorship is a good thing. I think that more censorship could lead to less crime. Children are influenced by what they see on TV, in books, and in music from a young age. While not all children copy what they see on TV, these media forms do have a significant impact on how children view the world.  Even though I love rap music and movies like A.T.L and rappers like @ORGANIZATION1, sometimes they make me feel jaded and give me a negative attitude. I think that media has a big influence on our mood, actions, and even the way we talk and dress.  In conclusion, I believe that censorship should be focused on children, not adults. Adults are generally set in their ways and have a better understanding of what they should do. Since media affects children's perception of the world, proper censorship can help create a better environment for their growth.
569	3546	2	2	As a student who reads frequently, I often read in various places like at home, school, in the car, etc. However, not all the novels I read are self - chosen. I'm not an enthusiastic reader on my own; I only enjoy books that interest me. Many of the books I pick are related to real - life situations, which may contain explicit content. I firmly believe that books, magazines, movies, music, etc., should not be removed from the shelves.  As citizens, we have the right to free speech. This right allows us to express our thoughts freely and enables authors and producers to create works based on their own ideas. Media with explicit content may appeal to some people while disturbing others. We have the choice to engage with or avoid such media. Producers of movies with sexual content, strong language, or violence know that not all citizens will want to watch them, and there's no law forcing us to do so.  Explicit material is everywhere. In places like @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, we can see books, music, and magazines with explicit content on display. However, there are also many media without such content. People often complain about explicit content in novels, but they overlook the numerous novels without it. We tend to focus on the negative in situations, leading pessimistic lives. We should learn to look for the good. There is a lot of media without explicit or sexual material, and we are given warnings about what contains such content.  Parents have the power to monitor their children's media consumption. They can set rules, such as allowing their children to only watch @CAPS3 - rated movies or requiring parental consent for reading certain magazines or novels.  Katherine Paterson was right when she said that if everyone had the right to remove books they didn't like, there would be no books left. If we removed all media that some people find offensive, we'd have no variety left. Everyone has different opinions, and we should respect that.  In conclusion, media with explicit content should remain on the market. The choice of what to consume lies with the individual, and one's opinion should not influence others.
570	3547	2	2	I believe that books, movies, and magazines found offensive should not be removed from library shelves. What some people find offensive may be seen differently by others. Libraries should create a special section for such materials so that mature individuals can access them.  Books are highly valuable in the United States, and many people enjoy reading content that others might find offensive. Just because one person reads a book or magazine and doesn't like something in it doesn't mean it should be labeled as offensive. I think many people would share this view.  Similarly, movies and other forms of media should not be removed from library shelves. Libraries usually have sections for kids, adults, and teenagers. Some parents today don't want their children to learn about certain things at a young age. But if they don't want their kids to read or watch something, they should take the responsibility to restrict their access.  This is a topic that deserves careful consideration. Libraries around the world are well - organized, so it's feasible to create a section for offensive materials. It may require a bit more effort, but it's worth it.  In conclusion, there are good reasons not to remove materials that some people find offensive from libraries. A lot of these materials are based on true stories or are biographies, and many people enjoy them. Creating a special section for offensive materials would make many people happy and satisfied.
571	3548	2	2	In my view, no one should have the power to dictate what children or people of any age group can read. It's not the general public's place to determine what is right or wrong. When society bans a particular book or song because it offends some, it goes against laws protecting freedom of access to information. While there is media that may be inappropriate, it doesn't mean it should be completely removed. There are several reasons why society can't censor everything. Firstly, what offends one person may not offend another. Just because I dislike a video, book, or other content, it's unfair to censor it for others who enjoy it. I wouldn't want my favorite book taken away just because someone thinks it's not suitable for my child. Public - available content will always seem unsafe from someone else's perspective, but we should respect that others value it. Secondly, the decision to censor inappropriate books for young children should be left to parents. Parents are the ones who teach children values as they grow up, not a society with diverse opinions. An author once said, 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. If everyone could remove content they disliked, there would be no books left. I firmly believe this sentiment will resonate with many. Lastly, individuality is at stake. We all have different traits and preferences in the books we read and the music we listen to, which gives us our individuality. If people start removing content they don't want others to see, everyone will do the same, and we'll lose the things that make us unique. I've learned from experience that having something different about oneself is a good thing. I've also experienced the disappointment of a removed book. In the future, if I find a book I don't want my children to read, I'll accept that others may like it. In conclusion, what one person deems inappropriate or offensive may be valuable to another.
572	3549	2	2	How do you react when people release magazines, movies, or music that deeply offends you? And how can you prevent children and the younger generation from being exposed to such content? The reality is that we can't stop it. There is so much pornography and bad music in the world, and it's easily accessible everywhere, especially on the internet, which is beyond our control. If I come across something highly offensive in a store or online, I have the right to voice my opinion, and it should be taken seriously. Inappropriate content has no place in public stores or areas where children can go. It sets a terrible example for kids, and some people should be more aware of this. Almost daily when I go online, I see ads for pornography sites on the side of websites. It's unbelievable that such content is allowed on public platforms for everyone to see. If this continues, there needs to be a law banning it from public sites. Seeing half - naked women on websites is clearly not suitable for young kids. I understand that much of what happens in the world is driven by money. People make money by selling movies, magazines, and music with rebellious content to teenagers and adults. However, they could still make good money by creating funny content instead. Everyone loves to watch, read, or listen to something humorous. We won't be able to completely eliminate this problem, and we should all accept that. The best we can do is protest and hope that this inappropriate content will gradually fade from public view. Eventually, it should decrease. We can only hope for the best.
573	3550	2	2	Do I think certain materials should be removed from library shelves if they're considered offensive? I firmly believe that libraries should house all types of materials to meet the diverse tastes of people. Censorship has no place here because everyone has different views on what is offensive. Allowing people the freedom to enjoy what they like will bring more happiness. People's preferences vary widely. What one person loves, another may hate. This difference shouldn't determine whether materials are removed from public places like libraries. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art, and taking away art that some find offensive is unfair to those who appreciate it. If we start removing such materials, not everyone will be satisfied. Censorship has no role in libraries. Entertainment can't please everyone, and it will always be judged in various ways. Arguing to remove materials that some like will only create tension and make the situation worse. For example, it's understandable that a parent wouldn't want their child exposed to media with negative influences. But that's life, and people have different outlooks. We should respect others' views. Opinions on this matter will vary, but I strongly believe people should have the right to access materials they're interested in. Censorship has its pros and cons, but generally, it's wrong and shouldn't be part of library policies. Limiting people's access to their interests will only lead to frustration. Since we can't please everyone, we should look beyond censorship.
574	3551	2	2	Libraries contain a wide range of books and movies, including fiction, non - fiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure. Many of these may be considered offensive, but that doesn't mean they should be removed from the shelves. One such potentially offensive book is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'. It portrays blacks as slaves, describes whipping them for being let go, and uses offensive names. However, it's a classic and can be found in most bookstores and libraries across the country because it was written when slavery was legal, and slaves were treated as property. A recently popular movie, Slumdog @CAPS4, shows a slum boy being tortured because he knows the answers on the game - show '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be a @CAPS4?'. Many Indians, who are often considered intelligent, may be offended as it implies that those from slums can't be smart. But people often overlook this because it's just a movie. When asked about these books and movies, some people find them good, while others are offended. For instance, the book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' about the Civil War presents both positive and negative views on slavery. It's also a classic and remains on library shelves. In conclusion, library books shouldn't be censored due to offense to a race, sex, or group. Except for some children's books, most books have something potentially offensive. If we removed books for this reason, there would be little left to read.
575	3552	2	2	Would you read a book about the @CAPS1 times if it pertains to your @CAPS2? Would you read about the torture of people of your religion or family? Probably not. If you're a person of color, are you likely to read a book about slavery? Unlikely. As a mother, would you read a novel or magazine about abortion, or let your child read it? Of course not. You might wonder why such books are on library shelves. The main reason is to educate us. When it comes to learning about criminals, racism, or wars, there will always be someone opposed. When we read, we seek books that bring us enjoyment and spark ideas. However, many of us don't understand why others refuse to read books that go against their beliefs. Beliefs are crucial to people regardless of age, gender, sexuality, or race; it's a part of life. Some stories are for entertainment, some evoke emotions, and some are for knowledge. Authors write based on past events or future predictions, aiming to help us understand the world, not to offend. Books can have both positive and negative impacts on people, but authors can't control these reactions, so we can't blame them for our offense. I firmly believe libraries should keep these so - called offensive books. It doesn't mean we should 'consume' books literally. We should take time to read them. You may think you'd never pick up such a book, but reading them can help us understand how bad things were in the past and how some problems still exist. For example, books about abortion can show us its horror and its broader impact, making us think twice about life decisions. Books should stay on the shelves for our well - being. When faced with a choice, you'll know what to do. You understand how books help us distinguish right from wrong and why they're placed in libraries. So, we should head to the library and pick up books that can expand our understanding.
576	3553	2	2	Libraries have always housed a diverse range of interesting materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines, and this will continue in the future. They are among the best places to access such materials. It is not reasonable for libraries to remove these materials from their shelves simply because some individuals may find them offensive. Libraries aim to cater to people interested in reading their collection. If certain people find specific books offensive, they should avoid those books. Instead of complaining and potentially ruining the opportunity for others to access these materials, they should keep their concerns to themselves. Libraries should not be forced to remove certain materials just because some people do not like them. Reading a particular book is a personal choice, and no one is compelled to read something that makes them uncomfortable. However, if a large number of people take offense to certain materials, the library can decide whether to take action, but they should not be dictated to. It is the library's prerogative to determine which materials to keep and which to discard. If I were offended by a book in the library, I would not make a fuss. Arguing and complaining over one book is unnecessary. We should consider the interests of others before our own, as this will lead to less trouble in life.
577	3554	2	2	Materials in libraries should not be removed from the shelves. If someone finds a particular item offensive, they are not obligated to look at it or borrow it. They can request that the material be placed on the highest shelf. This way, they have the option of whether to access it or not. Many materials in libraries, even those considered offensive by some, can be valuable to others. They may contain much - needed information. People who find materials offensive have the right to avoid them. Just because some individuals find certain materials offensive does not mean everyone does. They do not need to look at what they find offensive. If there is something offensive about a book or movie, they can ask a librarian to place it higher on the shelves. If they find something offensive, they can simply avoid looking at it and not borrow it. If they want it out of sight, it can be placed on the highest shelf. There is a significant amount of offensive material in libraries. Although some people find these materials offensive, others may need them for papers or projects. Removing a material can deprive someone of information relevant to their research. Books are often the easiest way to obtain information, but this is undermined when materials are removed. Additionally, kids can still find offensive content on the internet. If libraries remove offensive materials, perhaps the internet should also be removed. No matter how hard one tries to protect children from offensive content, they will always find a way to access it. Therefore, offensive materials should not be removed from library shelves as they are needed, and children will encounter offensive content regardless.
578	3555	2	2	Imagine coming across a book on a library shelf that offends you. How would you react? Would you simply move on and search for another book, or would you demand its immediate removal? In every school, public library, movie theatre, magazine stand, and all forms of media, there will always be content that someone dislikes. For example, in a magazine's do - and - don't section, a person might be offended if they do something on the don't list, or if there is content related to a specific race. Everyone has been accidentally hurt by the words and publications in the media at some point in their lives, and this is unlikely to change. All forms of media serve the purposes of learning and entertainment. They are not tailored to a specific group but are meant for everyone. Each person has their own opinion, and not everyone will agree. Just because one person does not like a particular hairstyle featured in a magazine does not mean it should be removed for all readers. This seems ridiculous. Suppose you find a book about a certain organization in the library and you are of African descent. Would you be offended? Or, if you were watching a show about slavery from a hundred years ago, would it anger you? If I were of African descent, I would not be mad because it is just history, which happened long ago and does not directly pertain to me. We cannot discard history books because they are essential for learning about our past. Without them, we would not be able to prevent history from repeating itself. When I was a child, my father used to abuse my mother, so my mother is offended by any media related to abuse. I once tried to get my mother to watch a movie called '@CAPS1'. The movie is about a girl who endures abuse from her mother, has children with her father, and eventually improves her and her children's lives. My mother refused, saying it was too close to home. Everyone will be offended by the media at some point. The media views people as a population, not as individuals. Just because one person dislikes something does not mean it should be removed or erased from history. Instead, it can be rewritten or refilmed. We cannot control what is said or done in books and movies, but we can control our own reactions. This is what I choose to do, and it has worked well for me.
579	3556	2	2	No, materials in libraries should not be removed because people have different preferences for books, movies, music, and magazines. If libraries remove certain materials, people may stop visiting and go elsewhere to obtain what they want. Some people want these materials removed, while others do not. If parents do not want their children to access certain materials, they should prevent their children from getting them. In conclusion, libraries should respect the diverse interests of their patrons and not remove materials based on the preferences of a few.
580	3557	2	2	Regarding library censorship, I believe there should be some, but not excessive. Each person has unique interests and should be able to find suitable materials in the library. Some materials are too explicit to be placed in libraries. There are stores where one can purchase such materials. Most parents are reluctant to have their children exposed to these types of materials, so they believe libraries should not provide them. However, there are materials that push the boundaries of content. They are strong but not so extreme that they cannot be in libraries. Some people enjoy these more intense materials and should be able to find them in libraries for their enjoyment. Just because someone does not like the materials provided by the library does not mean they should be removed. If this were the case, there would be little left in libraries for people to enjoy. Everyone has different tastes in materials, whether they are more mature or more 'tame'. People are entitled to their opinions, but their opinions should not determine what is available in the library. I personally enjoy a wide variety of materials from libraries, including both strong and 'tame' ones. It all depends on an individual's interests and choices. Sometimes, I am disappointed when I cannot find a particular item in the library because some people consider it too strong, while others and I see it as harmless entertainment. In conclusion, libraries should implement some censorship, but not to the extent that people cannot find materials that interest them. Everyone has their own beliefs and forms of entertainment, and libraries should not be based on the opinions of a single individual.
581	3558	2	2	"The question of whether books, music, movies, or other materials that may contain offensive content should be removed from library shelves is a significant one. In my view, certain materials should not be removed. Just because an individual dislikes the content in a particular book does not mean others will share the same sentiment. Moreover, some books with offensive elements can help readers recognize the consequences associated with such themes or remind them of important issues. If a person deems a reading material inappropriate or unappealing, they can simply choose not to read it, leaving it available for those who are interested.  I once visited a library searching for a book I had seen in another store. When I inquired about it, I was told that if the library didn't have it, it might contain offensive content. However, I am aware that different people have different tastes; while some may dislike ""nasty"" or ""gross"" books, others enjoy them. The fact that the person with the authority to add or remove books from the shelves doesn't like a particular item doesn't mean others won't.  In conclusion, we should recognize that people have diverse preferences. We should leave offensive reading materials on the shelves so that individuals can learn to avoid what they don't like. This approach respects the variety of interests and allows everyone to make their own choices."
582	3559	2	2	Today, I'd like to discuss censorship of books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries. Some of these materials can be quite graphic in their content, but that doesn't mean they should be removed from the shelves. Not everyone is interested in sexual - themed books, but there are those who enjoy reading about such topics. Similarly, some people like books about murders and gangs selling drugs. Everyone has their own taste, whether it's novels, sports, true stories, or other forms of media. Imagine a world where everyone liked the same things; it would be incredibly boring. So, I don't think books should be taken off the shelves as what might be unappealing to one person could be the next great read for someone else.  Regarding music, today's rap music often contains content about sex, drugs, and alcohol, which some may think kids shouldn't listen to. However, that doesn't justify removing it from the shelves as there are people who enjoy this type of music. There are also many other genres like oldies, country, jazz, and hip - hop. For example, country music does mention sex and alcohol in some parts, but it mainly focuses on country boys and their experiences. Overall, music is an essential part of life, and people listen to it in various situations like working out, at work, driving, or relaxing at home. There is both good and bad music, and it's up to individuals to decide.  As for movies, there are adult - oriented movies that deal with sex, drugs, and alcohol. While this may seem pointless, it's a part of life, and not everything is perfect. Parents should educate their children about these issues and prevent them from watching such movies at a young age, as it can contribute to problems like teen pregnancy. There are also great kid - friendly shows like Disney offerings.  Magazines are a staple in the world. They cover news, entertainment, comics, and offer useful tips. While there are some magazines that children should not look at until they are adults, that doesn't make them bad. It's just a matter of personal preference. Parents should guide their children to avoid inappropriate magazines at a young age.  In conclusion, there is both good and bad in books, music, movies, and magazines. We shouldn't remove materials just because they contain offensive content. Instead, we should make informed choices and guide the younger generation appropriately.
583	3560	2	2	In my opinion, offensive reading materials should not be removed from library shelves. High - school students are generally aware of what goes on in the world. They talk about their lives, and issues like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are likely to be part of their conversations. If parents don't want their children to be exposed to such topics, sending them to school might not be the best option, as in school, students can witness verbal arguments and fights. Parents should take the responsibility of explaining these things to their children. One way or another, kids will find out about these issues, whether from parents, friends, or teachers.  Some teens need to grow up and act their age. If they can't read a book without being immature, they should simply not read it. If parents allow their children to watch certain movies, the kids shouldn't take advantage of that privilege.  Removing books from libraries won't change much. Kids will still engage in rough play and arguments. While some books may have outrageous content, not all do. Libraries should have age - or grade - appropriate sections. High - school students should be able to handle reading about sex, drugs, or drinking. If they aren't responsible enough, they shouldn't be given those books.  Regarding music, if a child listens to songs with bad words, and content about sex, drugs, and alcohol, parents should take those songs away. Mature teens shouldn't be punished because of the immaturity of others. It's unfair to those who can act their age and handle different types of media.  In conclusion, taking books out of libraries is not a solution. We should hold kids accountable for their behavior and ensure that materials are accessed in a responsible manner based on maturity levels, rather than punishing everyone due to the actions of a few immature individuals.
584	3561	2	2	I am writing to express my views on library censorship. I firmly believe that certain materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed from library shelves simply because they are considered offensive. Everyone has their own personal standards of what is acceptable, and just because one person finds something offensive doesn't mean others will. What one person dislikes, another may love.  The only situation where a library might consider removing a material is when there are numerous complaints about the same item. Libraries have ratings and different sections to help people know what kind of content they can expect from a book or a movie. It doesn't make sense for someone to pick up a book or movie that they know they'll find offensive when there are so many other options available.  Imagine how someone would feel if their favorite book or movie was removed from the library because of another person's dislike. They would be disappointed and frustrated.  In conclusion, I oppose the removal of certain materials from library shelves based on perceived offensiveness. I hope that my perspective will be understood and considered.
585	3562	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials like books, music, and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People have diverse views on various forms of media. For instance, in the case of music, there are all sorts of genres. Some people find rap music offensive, while others relate to it and enjoy it. This shows that what may be offensive to one person is not necessarily offensive to another.  If someone finds a particular type of material offensive, they should simply ignore it. It's likely that the material they enjoy may be offensive to someone else. Judging these materials based on personal sensibilities is not right.  I'm confident that if a library item was extremely offensive, the library wouldn't have it in the first place. Instead of constantly worrying about what is offensive and what isn't, we should focus on our own lives. Although people have different views, we shouldn't let these differences overly affect us.  With billions of people on earth, it's impossible for everyone to have the same opinion on what is offensive. There is a wide range of opinions and beliefs regarding different forms of media.  In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and not remove materials just because they may be offensive to some. This way, we can maintain a more inclusive and open environment for everyone to access the media they prefer.
586	3563	2	2	Katherine Paterson wrote an article about library censorship. The question arises: should we have the right to freely remove books, magazines, movies, etc., from the shelves, regardless of whether we're offended by them? In my view, we should not possess such a right. If we did, it would lead to numerous problems from multiple perspectives.  One issue it could cause pertains to people's opinions of books, movies, CDs, and the like. If an individual dislikes certain aspects of a particular item and simply removes it from the shelf, it deprives someone who actually likes it. Just because one person doesn't appreciate what the material offers to the public doesn't mean others feel the same way. Everyone in the world has their own likes and dislikes. If people had the freedom to remove items at will, there would be nothing left for anyone to read, listen to, watch, or consume.  We also need to consider how this would impact the business of stores, libraries, and other enterprises. If everyone were to remove everything from the shelves, there would be nothing to sell or read. A business that fails to make money will ultimately have to close down, especially in today's economy when no business wants to run low on funds.  In Katherine's article, she concluded by saying, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This essentially reiterates my earlier point about people's diverse likes and dislikes. If you don't want your kids or others' kids to access something you consider offensive, you should inform one of the workers so they can relocate it to a different section, such as one for older kids and adults.  Ultimately, it falls on parents to decide what content their children should be exposed to. You are responsible for raising your children as you see fit. If you believe they are too young for something, you should say no. We should not have the right to remove items from the shelves. Books, movies, music, etc., are meant for entertainment. Just because something doesn't entertain you doesn't mean it won't entertain someone else.
587	3564	2	2	There are numerous books in the world that carry deep meanings and a sense of compassion. However, some books can have a negative or hateful impact on the reader. Censorship, which involves removing books, movies, magazines, etc., from the shelves to prevent people from accessing them, is a highly positive practice.  In many instances, censorship serves a valuable purpose. It shields young readers from being exposed to harmful content at a young age. In libraries, librarians should censor materials for younger patrons to prevent them from encountering offensive and hurtful information.  Similar to books, music, movies, and magazines should also be subject to censorship. Some music has a catchy beat that can get stuck in a young person's mind, potentially influencing their behavior and causing them to emulate the person described in the song.  Movies, too, should be censored. When I was a child, my parents did an excellent job of censoring content that was inappropriate for my age. As a result, I rarely had nightmares because I was not exposed to such material. In contrast, my friend's parents were less vigilant about censorship, allowing her to read and watch whatever she wanted. She often had nightmares as a result of the movies and books she consumed.  As I've grown older, my parents have gradually allowed me to access more censored materials. In my experience, I've had some nightmares and have been personally offended by certain books. Although censored books may have an engaging story, the content can lead to disputes among people with different beliefs.  Thousands of books are censored each year, many of which relate to different religions or races, on which people hold varying opinions. Libraries need to censor books to safeguard the innocent minds of young children.  In conclusion, censorship is an important measure that helps protect young readers from harmful content and promotes a more positive and appropriate reading environment.
588	3565	2	2	People have different preferences when it comes to genres of books, music, movies, etc. What one person likes, another may not. This means that it's up to you to choose what you enjoy, and you're not forced to read or listen to anything you don't want to. Books, music, and other forms of entertainment are here to provide enjoyment, so if you don't like something, you don't have to engage with it.  I firmly believe that it's unnecessary to remove books from the shelves just because someone has been offended by them. You weren't compelled to read the book, and it's not the fault of the company or the author if you rented it and felt insulted. Most likely, the story wasn't directed at you, so there's no need to get worked up and take it out on the media. You made the choice to pick it up. Why should the company lose investment over something that can be easily resolved by simply returning it?  I've read many books, listened to numerous songs, and watched a lot of movies that didn't appeal to me, but I didn't demand that they stop being sold because I'm sure someone out there enjoys them. Why should I stop someone else's enjoyment just because I'm not interested? It's really not that necessary.  This is the problem in the world today: people turn minor situations into major catastrophes for no good reason. If you don't like something, don't get it. People need to put themselves in the company's shoes and realize that if they were in that position, they would understand.  Books, magazines, music, movies, etc., are created for the entertainment of everyone who is interested. Removing them from the shelves just because one person doesn't like them is not only unnecessary but also unfair to others who may enjoy them. People have different opinions about life, and that's what makes each individual unique. So, why ruin other people's fun to get what you want?  As I've said before, it's not necessary to remove an item from the shelves just because someone is offended. It's not the company's fault, so simply don't buy it or return it. Things would be much better if people could respect each other's choices and preferences.
589	3566	2	2	Should offensive or graphic books be removed from the library? In my opinion, books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are wonderful sources of entertainment and should not be removed from the local library shelves. People have diverse tastes in books, including drama, romance, action, and many other genres, which also apply to movies and magazines. The public should not be penalized for an individual's interest in certain themes or their interpretation of a book.  There should be an age limit for certain books, allowing those of appropriate age to read whatever they like. I personally enjoy reading scary books, which give me chills and spark my imagination. Others in my community may share the same enthusiasm for such books. Without books that cater to different personalities, fewer people would visit libraries, and some might even resort to criminal activities out of boredom.  People in the community have the right to read, listen to, or watch any material they choose. If someone has difficulty with certain materials, they should simply avoid them and look for something they enjoy. Just because a book is about violence or a particular theme that someone dislikes doesn't mean it should be held against others who might appreciate it. Books and other materials are meant to be enjoyed, and it's the author's or director's choice to share their stories with us. Without such books, many people would struggle to generate ideas for their own writing.  In conclusion, people should be free to enjoy whatever material they like. If you believe that books, movies, or magazines should be removed, I encourage you to spend a day exploring the offerings at your local library. You might just change your mind.
590	3567	2	2	Libraries offer a wide variety of reading materials, including those on cars, trucks, sports, and fictional stories. However, some of these materials may be offensive. The question is whether these offensive materials should be removed from the library. Opinions on this matter are divided.  In my view, items should not be removed from the library. What one person finds offensive, another may consider perfectly acceptable. Instead, there should be designated areas and age limits for certain materials in the library.  I believe that age limits should be established for different types of reading materials. No one wants a young child to read content intended for adults, as it could expose them to inappropriate information. There should be separate sections for elementary to high school students and adults, ensuring that children do not access materials meant for a more mature audience.  In addition, there should be more signs providing detailed information about the content of books. For example, if there are books about slavery, there should be a dedicated area for such materials, allowing those who may be offended to avoid them. The same principle applies to magazines. I do not think they should be removed from the library simply because some people find them offensive, as others may enjoy reading them.  Some reading materials may be offensive to certain individuals, but not to others. I believe that items should not be removed from libraries, as they may be necessary for people working on projects.  However, I do think that certain movies and music should be removed from the shelves if young children are allowed in the store. It is inappropriate for elementary school - aged children to watch adult movies, especially those that promote sex, violence, or other inappropriate behavior.  In conclusion, while some items, such as movies and music that are inappropriate for young children, should be removed from the library, magazines and other materials should be accessible only to adults. By implementing age limits and providing clear information about the content, libraries can ensure a suitable environment for all patrons.
591	3568	2	2	I firmly believe that censorship should not be an option for those who find a book, magazine, or movie offensive. If someone decides to remove a book from the shelf due to personal offense, it indicates paranoia. For instance, if a book contains a few cuss - words and a parent doesn't want their children to read it, they should simply restrict their own children, not impose their views on others. Censorship is an unnecessary solution for a non - problem. People have diverse opinions. Some accept violence in media, while others do not. If one person removes a book because they find it offensive, it may conflict with the views of another who finds the content acceptable and might let their kids read it. Moreover, parents should allow their children to grow and mature, teaching them the difference between right and wrong. Shielding children from content with violence or cuss words in their youth may leave them ill - equipped to handle such situations when they encounter them later. Censorship is similar to the tactics used by [PERSON1] to prevent independent thinking. It is a part of fascism and has no place in [CAPS2] society. The citizens of [LOCATION1] are responsible for exposing the truth and teaching children moral distinctions, which is an ideal that makes the country great. In conclusion, censorship should not be considered, and individuals should have the freedom to choose what they consume.
592	3569	2	2	Censorship is a complex issue. Sometimes it's necessary, and sometimes it's not. Today's children are exposed to many adult - oriented things through TV, movies, or real - life situations at home. I believe censorship is essential for young children. They should not be exposed to bad language, graphic scenes, or content strictly for adults. They will encounter such things in the future, but they need to be mature enough to understand them. Teenagers are a different case. They are often drawn to bad language and graphic, gory scenes. Boys are into action, and girls like drama, and they all want the juicy details. Censorship won't stop them from seeking out media with such content. Even though teens may claim they are old enough to handle it, sometimes they may not be. If you try to restrict them from watching a movie or reading a book, they may just turn to the uncensored internet. Adults don't need censorship as they can make their own decisions about what to watch or read. In libraries, it's sometimes necessary to remove certain items and have sections for children, teens, and adults. Movies have ratings, and books are written for specific age groups, so they should be placed accordingly. Ultimately, parents or guardians usually decide whether a child can read a book or watch a movie. Different people find different things offensive, so censorship is subjective. Personally, I support censorship, but others may see it as a waste of time. For example, I wouldn't want my child to watch a movie with brutal murders and constant cussing. Music can be either censored or uncensored, depending on personal preference. In conclusion, censorship is a matter of personal opinion, and it can be both loved and hated.
593	3570	2	2	Each person has a unique relationship with the books in a library. It's not for a group to decide whether a book relates well or poorly to an individual. Everyone has a different view on what makes a story interesting. There will never be a book that all humans agree is both appropriate and engaging. People, with their distinct minds, prefer different books written by different authors. They should have the right to choose what they want to read. No single book can unite the world. Human minds are too diverse. For example, reading [CAPS1] [CAPS2] by [PERSON2] in my [CAPS3] class last year was appropriate, but boring for most of the class. Books on racism, religion, and sexual content can either intrigue or disgust a person. It's impossible to find a book that everyone in a community will agree on. There will always be someone who disagrees. Reading is a personal choice. Forcing a particular book on readers restricts their mental freedom. For example, forcing an atheist to read a comprehensive religious novel won't be tolerated. Cursing can make a book more realistic for some, but it can also drive others away from the story. The right to choose what to read should be preserved. Finding an appropriate book isn't the real problem. The challenge is finding books that are both appropriate and captivating. I find [CAPS5] in the [CAPS6] inappropriate, but it fascinates me. Some of my friends don't read it because of the offensive content. While I don't find it offensive, I understand why others might. It's impossible to approve a book as non - offensive since it won't be offensive to every reader. In summary, every person should have the choice to read what they want. The human mind is unique, and no two minds are the same. Giving people the freedom to choose will prevent rebellion. Removing a book from the shelf may only increase people's desire to read it. As Katherine Paterson said, constantly banning books will leave nothing for readers. People should be given the freedom to make their own reading choices.
594	3571	2	2	In today's society, people perceive things differently. What may be helpful to one person might offend another. In libraries, there are various types of books, such as fiction and non - fiction. If someone doesn't like a particular book, they should look for a different one. Authors work hard to write and publish books. It's unfair to remove a book from the shelf just because it has offended a few people. In [LOCATION1], we have the freedom of speech, and authors should have the freedom to write what they want. The saying “One man's junk is another man's treasure” is very relevant here. A book may not mean much to one person but could be extremely valuable to another. We never know what people need to hear. For example, a book about a recovering alcoholic may offend some, but it could save a family, a friendship, or even a life for someone struggling with alcoholism. Take [CAPS2] [CAPS3]'s journal, which is now a book. It may offend some who were there or don't like [CAPS4] [CAPS5], but her story has the right to be told. Although there is violence in it, and it may not be suitable for a [NUM1] - year - old, the story is important. Librarians should not remove a book from the shelf just because it has offended a few people. There are many different types of books, and if a person is offended by what they are reading, they should look for a different type. In conclusion, books should not be removed based on the offense of a few, and people should have the freedom to choose what they read.
595	3572	2	2	I think many books are worth reading as they can teach us things we don't know. When you pick up a book, you might like it, but it may not always have deep meaning. Many books have characters with different viewpoints, which can add variety. Magazines can show us people's lifestyles. Some books lack action or emotion, and they can be easily read. It's always a good idea to choose a reasonable book, one that is positive and meaningful. The best books are those that tell us about life and how to succeed. You might come across a true - to - life book that you can get deeply involved in and even write an essay about. Magazines and movie - related books often have a lot of action and show what the characters do. Some people find non - action books boring and prefer action - packed ones for excitement. However, most action - filled books have more pictures than words. You should choose a book that provides useful knowledge because action books may not always be helpful. The more action - oriented and fun books you read may not be as good as those with a more substantial story. In conclusion, when choosing a book, we should focus on its meaning and usefulness rather than just the action.
596	3573	2	2	In contemporary society, there will always be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes. Items should not be removed from the shelves merely because someone is offended by them. Everyone has a book or movie they disagree with, but if items are removed for this reason alone, the available selection will be severely limited. Students might take advantage of this situation and have educational books removed. Removing items from the shelves means erasing history. Our history books tell stories of slavery and discrimination. If someone is offended by this content and has it removed, we lose a crucial part of our history that needs to be learned and taught to prevent similar events from recurring. Library items are there for you to choose whether to borrow or not. If you find an item offensive, you simply don't have to read it. What you consider offensive might inspire and encourage someone else. Whether you like or dislike an item is a matter of personal opinion, and decisions should not be based solely on one person's view. Think about it. If you have a favorite book, movie, or song, would you want it to be removed based on someone else's opinion? You have the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever you want. Your choices should not be restricted by someone else's opinion, as this would lead to arguments among people. Different people have different opinions about library items, which can result in disputes and even potential violence. There are numerous wonderful and inspiring books and movies, and there will always be someone who dislikes at least one of them. If items are removed based on personal opinions, the selection will be extremely limited. People read for enjoyment and knowledge, and they deserve a wide range of choices. In conclusion, in today's society, differences in opinion are inevitable. We should not base decisions on one person's dislike. If someone is offended, they have the right to ignore it. We need books and movies that teach us about the past so that we can avoid repeating the hardships our ancestors endured. Items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to them.
597	3574	2	2	The United States is regarded as one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free nation. In the 1800s, people migrated here to escape the control of their home - country governments. In the United States, we practice freedom of speech. Censoring materials such as books, music, and movies would undermine the very essence of the United States and its democratic values. Everyone has their own personality with unique likes and dislikes. Not everyone enjoys the same music or is interested in the same reading subjects. This is why the variety of everything is so wonderful. If we start banning or censoring certain things, how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative aspects as it teaches people lessons on what to do or not to do in certain situations. Censoring 'bad things' creates naive thinkers, which can lead to discrimination. I believe that for children, there should be warnings for materials that parents may find offensive. For example, movies have age - appropriate ratings, and books could adopt a similar system. Of course, it's up to the parents whether they follow these recommendations, but a complete ban is unnecessary. Personally, I've learned a lot from what I've seen on television. What's on TV can be considered 'street - smart' education, which is beneficial. In today's scary and violent society, being 'street - smart' is an advantage. If television were censored, people wouldn't know how to handle bad situations as they would have no prior exposure. If books, movies, magazines, music, etc., are removed from the shelves, the United States fails to practice what it preaches to the many people who come here in search of freedom. In conclusion, while we need to be cautious about children's exposure to inappropriate content, complete censorship goes against the principles of freedom and learning.
598	3575	2	2	Censorship should play a significant role in determining which books, movies, magazines, and CDs enter and leave the library. I think that if a book, movie, magazine, or CD is found offensive to at least ten children, it should definitely be removed from the shelves. It's unrealistic to expect librarians to read every book to ensure there is no inappropriate language or content that parents might object to. Therefore, libraries should have a specific section for books that librarians suspect may contain bad language, references to drugs or alcohol. I've come across books with graphic content that I believe is inappropriate for young children, but my only option was to bring it to the librarian's attention. Movies are another area that requires careful consideration. Just because a movie has an innocuous - sounding title doesn't mean it won't contain graphic images or inappropriate language. Since movies are easier to review and have ratings, it should be simpler to decide whether they belong on library shelves. However, if libraries want to include movies that are inappropriate for children, they should be placed in a locked room so that kids know not to enter. Music also needs close scrutiny. The language in CDs can vary from song to song. I think librarians should personally listen to CDs before putting them on the shelves. Personally, I believe libraries should not allow music at all because an artist's language in songs can change drastically from one album to the next. One album may be clean, while the next could be full of swear words. Another way to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content is to categorize books, magazines, CDs, and movies by age. As children grow older, they learn more about certain topics, so when they encounter such content in a book, it won't be as shocking to them or their parents. In today's world, it's almost impossible for a child to pick up something without reading about drugs or violence. If we removed every item that mentioned these topics, there would be nothing left on the shelves for kids to read or listen to. It's impossible to catch every movie, book, magazine, or CD that contains violence or alcohol use, but we can remove some of the materials with a high amount of such content. Removing some inappropriate materials for children will make a significant difference and may protect them from encountering such content. Game designers are increasingly creating games centered around violence. If we removed all violent games, there would be no games left for kids to play. All games have ratings, so an adult should check the rating before allowing a child to play a game. This way, we can somewhat control what children see without removing games that other kids might enjoy. In conclusion, those in charge of library materials, games, etc., should review them before putting them on the shelves. We don't need to censor everything, but there are definitely some items that should not be accessible to young children. Parents should also play a role in guiding their children's choices, and overall, a balanced approach to content management is necessary.
599	3576	2	2	Do I believe that some books should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Well, what's your opinion? I think it depends on the cause and the degree of offense. If there are books, movies, or music that contain insults, it matters who is being offended. If there is a racist book targeting all races such as Blacks, Asians, Mexicans, and other minorities, and these minorities find out about these insults and raise an issue, then the book should be removed from the shelves. If a confrontation occurs, it could turn violent. Moreover, if the book is not removed, the library could face lawsuits for racism or be publicly labeled as a racist institution, which would lead to a loss of business. To avoid fights, lawsuits, and humiliation for both the library and the minorities, if a situation is brought up, it's best to remove the offensive item from the shelves to ensure everyone's safety. Many minorities come here seeking an opportunity to start a new life, often leaving poverty - stricken towns or home countries. I am not a racist person. I believe that we are all equal, just unique individuals, and our differences are what make us who we are today. In conclusion, when dealing with offensive materials, especially those related to racism, it is important to consider the feelings and rights of the affected parties. Removing such materials can prevent conflicts and uphold the values of equality and respect.
600	3577	2	2	People have diverse thoughts and beliefs. Some may believe that a movie, song, or book should be removed, while others disagree. No one wants the things they enjoy to be taken away. If you find a book in a bookstore offensive and remove it, you are depriving someone who might enjoy it. If everyone removed things they disliked, there would be very little left to enjoy. For example, I love horror movies. The thrill and the element of surprise they offer are what I cherish. I'm certain there are people who think horror movies are inappropriate. If they could remove these movies permanently, I and many others would be extremely disappointed. I also have a deep passion for video games. They are an integral part of my life, and I know there are people who strongly object to some of the content in video games. If people could take away video games because they disagreed with them, I would be heart - broken. I understand that some people are concerned about their children accessing inappropriate movies, songs, or books. While parents want to supervise their children, removing these items is not the best solution. Movies and books can be easily censored. Many movies and songs have language filters, and some movie platforms now offer parental controls that allow parents to decide what their children can watch. Parents can also monitor their children when they download music on devices, and depending on where they are purchased, books and magazines may require parental consent. Video games also have ratings that require parental approval. We can't just go around removing everything we don't like because it's unfair to those who do. We live in a world full of different ideas, thoughts, and beliefs, and everyone should have equal rights to express and enjoy them. In conclusion, in a diverse world, we need to respect the choices of others. Instead of removing things we dislike, we should find ways to make them suitable for different audiences, such as through censorship and parental controls. This way, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to enjoy the things they love.
601	3578	2	2	In contemporary society, people hold diverse views on numerous matters, including religion, race, and upbringing. Libraries today house a wide variety of books that can appeal to different individuals. The question arises: is it right for a book to discriminate against someone? In my opinion, libraries should remain as they are for several reasons.  Firstly, individuals are unique, and what one person deems unacceptable may be appealing to another. If someone dislikes the content of a book, movie, or music, they have the choice not to engage with it. What may seem unappealing to one can be remarkable to another.  Secondly, such materials can serve a purpose. [LOCATION2] was not always an equal place. Books discussing racial discrimination offer a glimpse into history. Without this historical perspective, we would be unable to recognize the progress [LOCATION1] has made, from slave - states to all free states. It is crucial to preserve such materials for future reference.  Thirdly, a library is meant to contain various media, such as books, movies, and music. If we were to remove all offensive content, the library would lose its ability to provide a wide range of choices. It would likely become a dull place. A library's essence lies in its variety, where one can find anything from hair - styling guides to the history of [CAPS1] [CAPS2].  In conclusion, these reasons justify why libraries should stay unchanged. What may be offensive to one person can be different for another. Removing such content would also deprive us of historical knowledge and undermine the very nature of a library. These are valid reasons for leaving things as they are.
602	3579	2	2	Public libraries contain books related to slavery, drugs, gangs, prostitution, and violence. These materials carry the history of our past. As a society, we cannot forget our history because, as historians often say, history repeats itself. If we start censoring libraries, this valuable historical knowledge will be lost.  Libraries offer numerous benefits. They assist with school and business projects and enhance our personal knowledge. We cannot censor libraries simply because some individuals find certain books offensive. Even today in [DATE1], stories of slavery still cause offense. However, hiding these stories would lead us back to that dark past.  There are accounts of notorious gangsters like [CAPS1] [CAPS2], who committed heinous acts such as killing people, destroying shops, and dealing drugs. We need this history to acknowledge our nation's weaknesses. Instead of hiding from them, we should use this knowledge to improve our cities, police training, and most importantly, raise the next generation better.  In addition to books, public libraries also have movies and documentaries about our nation and [CAPS3]. Movies about [CAPS3] [CAPS4] [NUM1] and [CAPS3] [CAPS4] [NUM2] show the horror of [CAPS4] and the cruelty of humanity. During [CAPS3] [CAPS4] [NUM2], the [CAPS9] occurred, where six million Jews lost their lives due to the hatred of [PERSON2]. These movies serve to remind us of the devastation humans can cause, while others showcase amazing discoveries and places, like the achievements of [PERSON1], one of the greatest finds in [CAPS3].  Music can also be a self - improvement tool. If you play an instrument, the library is a great place to get free music. You don't have to spend [MONEY1] on a CD; you can use it and return it when done. With our advanced technology, you can even burn the CD onto your computer and transfer it to your iPod or [NUM4] player. The library is also a good place to discover new music.  So, should there be censorship in libraries? No. The main reason is that these materials represent history: the history of our country, [CAPS3], and difficult times. Instead of censoring the youth of [DATE1] from history, we should set age limits. Young people should only read certain books with a parent or guardian. This simple measure allows kids to access historical knowledge while protecting them from overly mature content. As historians always say, history repeats itself, and as a growing nation, we must learn from our history to improve ourselves.
603	3580	2	2	I believe that books that may offend people should not be on the shelves. Some books available in [MONTH1] can hurt people's feelings. However, I also think that people should have the freedom to read what they want. Most people would avoid books they find offensive.  There is a wide variety of books, not all of which are bad or offensive. But books inappropriate for young kids or teens should not be in school libraries. In public libraries, it is acceptable to have all types of books, but they should be organized into different sections, such as young adult, adult, and children's sections.  I think that certain books, like those of a sensitive nature, should be sold in specialized bookstores. Children's bookstores should not carry inappropriate books. Parents should monitor what their children read and help them understand the content.  There are many parents who don't seem to care about what their kids read. While that's their choice, in my opinion, they should not let their kids read whatever they want. Parents should accompany their children when they are choosing books. However, for teens [DATE1] and older, I believe they are mature enough to choose what to read. By that age, they can read and understand things more easily.  In conclusion, a balanced approach is needed. We should ensure that inappropriate materials are kept away from young children, while still respecting the reading freedom of individuals. Age - appropriate sections in libraries and parental guidance can help achieve this goal.
604	3581	2	2	Hi, I'm Henry. I firmly believe that offensive books, magazines, movies, and music in school and public libraries should be removed. I can't stand seeing people upset or angry because they've read an offensive book. I've personally read books that offended me or made fun of black people, and I have black friends.  If it were up to me, I'd remove all such books from libraries. Little kids don't need to read this kind of content, and neither do we. Nowadays, a lot of music on the radio contains cursing and racial slurs, and half the time, it's hard to understand. We need music that is clean and easy to understand, especially for kids.  As for magazines, I usually look at coon - hunting or four - wheeler magazines. But the bad ones, the ones with crime and inappropriate content, need to go. This would prevent kids from seeing such material and might even help reduce crime. People who read magazines with shooting and crime may be influenced to try these things, leading to trouble. Instead, we could create magazines with cartoons, comics, or those promoting good health for kids and teens.  Movies are also a major issue. Most movies are bad, although there are some good ones if you look hard enough. I'm not sure how we can change the movie industry, but it's clear that a lot of the content is inappropriate.  In conclusion, there should be no censorship in libraries because it's all about history. We should set age limits instead. Younger kids should only access certain materials with a parent or guardian. This way, we can protect our kids from overly mature content while still allowing them to learn from history. As historians say, history repeats itself, and we need to use our past to improve ourselves as a nation.
605	3582	2	2	"Why censor something that someone has worked hard on? Authors invest significant amounts of money and time in their work, yet some want to censor it. In reality, there is no need to censor library materials because libraries have sections tailored to different audiences. This entire discussion about censorship shouldn't even be taking place.  Some people are overly critical and can't handle certain content. For instance, I don't like the word ""nigger,"" but I can tolerate it and choose to remain silent. Those who are immature should either avoid reading offensive materials or stay away from the library.  Authors want their work to be on the shelves, not banned or constantly criticized. We should stop acting like children. Before making a decision, we should think about the consequences.  In conclusion, we should stop being immature. If you don't like something, don't read it. We should respect the hard work of authors and the role of libraries in providing a diverse range of materials. By considering these aspects, we can make more informed and reasonable decisions about library content."
606	3583	2	2	I firmly hold the view that certain materials like books, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Offensive books, movies, music, etc., should be removed because it essentially gives young children the idea that it's okay to watch inappropriate content. I wouldn't want my siblings to watch or see anything inappropriate. I recall when I was thirteen, my mom and step - dad at that time disagreed with me having @PERSON1, @CAPS1, or @NUM1 on my television. They thought I was too young to watch what was on @CAPS2 and that it was inappropriate. I disagreed; I believed I had the right to watch because I liked the shows and found them interesting. In my opinion, not everything on @CAPS2 was that bad. When I watched music videos on @CAPS1, every song was the edited version. I had to argue and prove why I should have @NUM2, @NUM1 on my @CAPS2. Parents have different opinions on what's good and bad for their children. In my case, my mom didn't want me to watch anything bad. She knew what it was like when she was young and worried that I might think what I saw on @CAPS2 wasn't a bad thing. I thought to myself that as a young person, I would eventually learn the difference between good and bad in the long run.
607	3584	2	2	Everyone reads a book at some point in their life. It is impossible for an author to filter out all offensive language, racial remarks, and slurs from an entire book. What is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. I firmly oppose the idea of removing books if they are found offensive to a specific group, person, or community. Most books are categorized by maturity and genre. Readers should understand their position within these categories to avoid being offended. Maturity is associated with understanding. Books are also sorted by genre, and often the @CAPS2 reflects the genre. The era in which the book is set is another crucial factor. When @CAPS2, an author must take this into account. For example, if a book is set in @NUM1 A.D., the author would not use present - day grammar. Readers should be informed about which books they may read before choosing one. Ultimately, it is up to the readers to take the @CAPS1 regarding what they read. Maturity comes with understanding. If a reader is mature enough to understand the @CAPS2, then the book is suitable for their age. This is why I strongly believe that books should not be removed from shelves just because they are offensive to a particular person, group, or community.
608	3585	2	2	Should we remove offensive books? I think we shouldn't. If we remove all offensive content from the shelves, there won't be anything left. If everyone could remove the books, movies, or music that offend them, there would be no media left on the shelves. First, there would be no war - related books, movies, or music. Hippies who dislike war would remove them, claiming they're offensive. But we should read about and watch war - related content as it helps us learn from our mistakes. If we don't learn from the mistakes of war, we'll keep losing and repeating the same errors. Second, all kinds of music, both good and bad, would be removed. Over - protective mothers would take down music with bad language and themes. But how can football players, soldiers, and fighters get pumped up for a fight without the songs they like? Finally, books like those from Star Wars and Forgotten Realms would be removed. Some people think they're unrealistic and offensive to their way of thinking. However, Star Wars is a great book and movie series, and Forgotten Realms is a well - known book - making company. In conclusion, I don't want this to happen. All the good music, books, and movies would disappear, and the people who enjoy them would be angry.
609	3586	2	2	Everyone can think of something they don't like or want to see. If you're offended by something, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned? What if you like a particular choice in a place, but someone else doesn't? Should they be able to take it away just because they don't approve? Imagine @NUM1 people enter a library with @NUM2 books, magazines, music, and movies. @NUM3 of them don't like anything in the library and want everything removed, even though @NUM4 others love what they see. Is it fair that just because some people don't approve, they get to decide? I don't think it's fair for one person to have that right. If something is offensive to many people, they should be mature enough to ignore it and find what they like. If someone doesn't like your house and says they don't want to see it, should they be able to demolish it? The world would be in constant chaos if people had too much power to change things, and it would only get worse. I've seen disputes between people about whether to throw something out or keep it. One solution could be to move the item to a different area. That way, people who want to look at it can, and the room can be divided into different sections for different preferences. If you think about the various options to get along and not worry about offending people, you'll realize that no one person should be able to take away something you enjoy and that makes you happy.
610	3587	2	2	I believe that books containing derogatory terms such as racial slurs, which disrespect any human race, should be removed. However, the situation with music is more complex. Kids hearing songs with cussing, drug - related talk, and other bad content shouldn't necessarily lead to the removal of such music. In my view, everyone will learn about these things eventually. When kids hear the same words in multiple songs, they may start to know them. At that point, parents can step in and teach them that drugs and bad words are not good. If kids are old enough to pick up a book and read it, they should be able to tell right from wrong. Clearly, if a book uses bad language like the @CAPS1 word, they should know it's wrong. If they continue to engage with such content, that's their choice. In conclusion, while offensive books should be removed, the approach to offensive music should be more about education and parental guidance.
611	3588	2	2	I believe that inappropriate books should be removed from the shelves to prevent children from getting improper ideas. This, I think, is the main reason for the high rate of teenage girls getting pregnant. If we were to remove such books and make it a law that one must reach a certain age to access them, it could potentially reduce the number of teenage pregnancies. I genuinely believe this measure could work as it would prevent children from being exposed to such content, thereby decreasing their desire to have children as teenagers. This is how I think things should have been done from the start, as it would have avoided many problems. Some might think it's not too difficult to raise a child at a young age, but if we don't have to see inappropriate things, it would be better. Overall, taking these inappropriate books off the shelves and setting an age limit is a worthwhile attempt that could bring about positive changes.
612	3589	2	2	"Censorship is an increasingly prominent issue in today's literary world. It often hinders authors from fully expressing their original ideas. Katherine Paterson once remarked that if we were all allowed to eliminate what we deemed wrong, there would be nothing left to be right about. Censorship leads to an ignorant, opinion - less, and clueless society.  In the novel ""Fahrenheit 451"", censorship is a central theme. Bradbury portrays book - burning as a means to eliminate all controversial opinions. Guy Montag realizes that book - burning has made the society he lives in oblivious to the world around them. The government has tried to eradicate all sources of controversy in the hope of creating a happier society. However, in reality, the people are unhappy and seem to lack the ability to be happy. Montag decides to learn, but he struggles as the brain, like a muscle, becomes weak and useless if not exercised properly. When he tries to memorize a part of the Bible, he can't retain the information, much like trying to fill a sieve with sand.  The members of this society are largely opinion - less. They accept what they see on TV as fact and spend their days passively consuming it. In school, children are fed facts without being encouraged to question. In a normal society, learning leads to questioning, but here, there is only acceptance, which ultimately leads to unhappiness.  The society in ""Fahrenheit 451"" is oblivious in many ways; death is not a significant concern. Mildred's friend Clarisse was killed by a speeding car, and Mildred wasn't even shocked. When Montag was running from the police, a group of rowdy teenagers tried to run him over for no good reason. At the end of the novel, the city is bombed, and the people had no idea the war was even happening. A clueless society is a useless one, and in the end, it was destroyed. In conclusion, censorship, as shown in this novel, has disastrous consequences for society."
613	3590	2	2	I firmly believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves simply because someone finds them offensive. If everyone were to remove what they considered offensive, we would have nothing to watch, listen to, or read. People use these forms of media to entertain themselves. Just as children use their imagination to stay entertained, adults rely on books, music, and movies.  If we take away these forms of entertainment, we would be lost. Children use their imagination to learn and grow. Similarly, adults use media not only for entertainment but also to learn about the world and survive in daily life.  If people thought carefully about the consequences of removing something from the shelves, they would realize it was a foolish decision. Taking something off the shelves just because one person finds it offensive is wrong. We should first understand what the content is about and see if it can be a learning opportunity. Reading something before judging it is important. In conclusion, people should think twice before removing items from the shelves based on one person's opinion.
614	3591	2	2	The question of what is offensive in literature, movies, and music is a complex one. While there are clearly some works that mock or taunt people's religious or lifestyle views, is a book about a wizarding world truly offensive?  I once had a religious friend whose parents wouldn't let her read the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling. At the time, I didn't understand, but now I realize that her parents adhered strictly to their religious beliefs and considered make - believe and imagination inappropriate for their child. However, for many families, the Harry Potter series is a way to escape the real world.  My family loves the Harry Potter books and movies, but some families don't. That's their lifestyle and opinion. If we removed everything that could offend someone, the world would be a very dull place. Movies would be boring, stories would lose their charm, and there would be no music.  Music is a form of self - expression. Different generations have different musical preferences. If we based our world on others' opinions to make everyone happy, we would have no music. Everyone is offended by something. I'm offended by rape scenes in movies, while some think they enhance a movie. My friend's family is offended by the Harry Potter world, but I believe in the possibility of a wizarding world.  People have diverse beliefs and likes. Since everyone is an individual, if the things we like were removed from the shelves, our lives would be boring. In conclusion, while some offensive materials may need to be restricted in certain cases, we shouldn't remove popular and beloved works just because some are offended.
615	3592	2	2	If everyone removed books they found offensive, libraries would have a severely limited collection, making them almost useless. While some materials may not be suitable for young children, they can offer advanced knowledge. Therefore, libraries should maintain their existing categorization.  Some materials may seem too advanced for some, but they are essential for academic growth. For example, some may think schools shouldn't read Mark Twain's works due to the portrayal of racism in the South, but it is a part of history, and there should be no restrictions on such literature. Restricting access to such works would mean schools would miss out on some of the best historical literature.  Just as movies have age ratings (e.g., PG - 13 for 13 and up, R for 17 and up), libraries already have sections for young adults, adults, and youth. These categorizations are mainly to separate materials that may contain offensive content like drugs, sex, and alcohol. There is no need to further break up these sections.  Most public media is censored, which benefits the youth. However, the public should also realize that over - sheltering the youth can stunt their academic development. In conclusion, libraries should keep their current categorization system to balance the need for protecting the youth and promoting academic growth.
616	3593	2	2	There's a question of whether the books and other materials in libraries are offensive to some people. What makes them offensive and how they cause offense are also important inquiries. And what should be done about the offensive books, movies, and magazines?  In my view, there are indeed books that can be offensive to others for specific reasons. These may include racial slurs, inappropriate comments within the book, the author's writing style, and the intended audience. Some people find certain books, music, magazines, and movies offensive due to the language used. They may take it personally, thinking that the content is directed at them.  Music can be offensive because of the vulgar language it contains. Parents may be concerned when their children listen to such music, as kids tend to imitate what they hear. Movies can be offensive due to language, violence, and the way characters are treated. For example, the movie @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 has violence, bad language, and harmful treatment of people, but it also educates viewers about war and the struggles that shaped our country. Magazines can be offensive with slang, cursing, and violent words, as well as nude pictures, which most parents don't want their children to access.  Overall, I believe that these materials can be offensive to some, but they shouldn't be removed from the library shelves just because they offend a few. If we look at it this way, almost everything in the library could potentially offend someone. Removing all offensive items would mean emptying the library. So, it's not right to take away materials just because some people don't like them. If something offends you, simply don't read, listen to, or look at it. No one is forcing you, and it's your choice. Therefore, removing these items from the shelves is unjust.
617	3594	2	2	Censorship is the act of blocking certain things from being accessible in a particular place. The question is whether it's wrong for libraries to censor materials. In my opinion, libraries should have the right to censor books, music, movies, and magazines.  One reason is the protection of children. Young kids might come across inappropriate content such as pornography or gruesome images in magazines and movies. If these materials are in libraries, children could share them with others, which is not a good situation. Parents may blame the library staff for not supervising the children properly. Also, young children shouldn't be exposed to violent or disturbing movies at a young age, as it can have a negative impact on them.  Music can also be a concern. Nowadays, many songs contain offensive lyrics. Children who listen to such music may repeat the vulgar words without understanding their meaning. If they say these words to an adult, the adult may hold the library owners responsible.  Movies can show inappropriate content that is not suitable for certain age groups. Libraries should censor movies to prevent young children from watching such content.  Books in libraries are generally great, but some books, such as those about certain religions or containing gruesome details, may be offensive to some people. These books should be subject to censorship.  In conclusion, libraries have valid reasons to censor books, music, movies, and magazines. By doing so, they can protect children from inappropriate content and avoid potential blame from parents. Censorship is a necessary measure to ensure a safe and appropriate environment for library users.
618	3595	2	2	"Libraries serve people of all ages, and because everyone has different views, beliefs, and reading preferences, it's difficult for libraries to satisfy everyone. People enjoy various genres, like romance, comedy, action, and mysteries.  Today's libraries have sections dedicated to different types of materials, including kids' books, fiction, informational resources, and areas for movies and magazines. When there are materials meant for specific age groups, libraries should put warning signs in those areas.  It's a good idea to put ratings on the back of books and magazines, just like movies have ratings. This way, people can know what to expect before reading and decide if they want to read the material. Ratings would also help determine the appropriate age for the content.  One time, when I was at the library, there was a man in the checkout line in front of me. He was returning a book he had just read and checking out a new one. When it was his turn, he approached the counter and told the kind old lady at the front desk what he wanted to do. As she was processing his request, she asked, ""Did you like your book?"" He replied, ""It wasn't what I expected. It was completely inappropriate."" As they talked more, it turned out that the book was full of curse words. This shows that people often don't know what to expect when they read a book.  I don't think libraries should remove materials that people have complained about. Instead, they should inform people about what to expect. Some people may not mind a few curse words in a book, while others may find it outrageous. Libraries spend money to provide these materials for the community. So, they should just let people know what they're getting into."
619	3596	2	2	The question of whether certain music, books, movies, and other materials should be removed from the shelves is a controversial one. Some people think young children shouldn't be exposed to such content, but children have their own ideas. In my opinion, these materials shouldn't be removed.  One reason is that children need to learn the difference between good and bad. Trying to keep everything away from them will only make them more curious. For example, some music contains screaming and cursing, but in real life, kids often hear their parents arguing. So, they should have the choice to listen to similar content if they want.  However, there are also drawbacks to leaving these materials freely available. As a mother and a teenager, I know that I have the right to decide what my daughter can and can't access. If parents have a problem with certain materials, they should prevent their children from getting them. I, as a parent, would never let my daughter access some of the content I consume. Parents have the authority to control what their children do.  There should be age limits on certain materials. Books with sex scenes, murder, and excessive curse words shouldn't be available to young children. Teenagers may think they know everything, but they still shouldn't be allowed to read adult - oriented content. Parents should choose appropriate books for their children to learn about sensitive topics. Libraries should place sexual and offensive books in a restricted area accessible only to adults. Just like video games have age limits, books should too. The reason this hasn't been done is that not enough parents are concerned.  In conclusion, parents need to step in and take control. They should demand that libraries implement age limits on materials. This way, children won't be exposed to inappropriate content without their parents' knowledge. It's time for parents to make a change and ensure a proper environment for their children.
620	3597	2	2	There's a debate about whether offensive books should be removed from library shelves. Some people think they should, while others, like me, believe they shouldn't.  If we start removing every offensive book, there won't be any books left in the library. Once one person starts removing books they find offensive, others may follow, and within a short time, the library will be empty.  Reading books is beneficial for our eyes. If there are no books in the library, people will have fewer opportunities to read, which can be bad for their eyesight. People who don't like the books in the library should simply choose not to go there.  In conclusion, removing offensive books from the shelves is a bad idea. It will lead to an empty library and limit people's reading choices. We should respect the diversity of books in the library and let individuals decide what they want to read. So, offensive books should remain on the shelves.
621	3598	2	2	Reading is a source of joy for some and a source of pain for others. When considering whether objects in the library with offensive details should be cleaned up or removed from the shelves, it's clear that there are items that could be censored, while others would lose their value if censored. Indeed, there are library items that warrant censorship. Here's why certain items should be censored and what specifically should fall under censorship.  There are types of library items that should not be removed. Historical documentaries and historical books are prime examples, as there is no other effective way to convey the necessary information to readers or viewers. However, there are also other library items that could be censored. Some magazines and movies contain uncensored scenes or pages that are unnecessary, even if there is a message to be conveyed. A movie, book, or magazine should only remain uncensored if it is attempting to make a valid point. If an uncensored item fails to do so, it has no place in the library.  As can be seen, there are situations where an uncensored book, movie, or magazine is highly useful for information dissemination. Yet, there are more instances where library items do not require uncensored details as they are simply offensive. When asked if censorship is important in libraries, the answer is both yes and no, as the reasons provided above illustrate. The next time you're in the library looking for a book, ask yourself whether it's so offensive that it loses its value.
622	3599	2	2	Have you ever thought about going to the library, picking up a magazine from the shelf, and finding it offensive with no way to do anything about it? Well, now you can voice your concerns. Katherine Paterson and I went to a library together. We picked a magazine from the shelf, and it had a lot of offensive content that we didn't like. We approached the lady at the front desk, and she didn't even know those magazines were there. She got really angry and went back to the shelf. There were many magazines with offensive writing, pictures, and even comments. We gathered all those magazines and threw them away.  In my opinion, offensive things like movies, music, and magazines should be removed. They should be removed because they have a bad influence on the youth. They plant ideas in young minds, which the youth might act on later, either in public or at home. These offensive materials are getting many people into trouble, especially kids, who are becoming more violent towards their schoolmates, friends, and even their mothers.  We need to remove all these offensive materials because they are everywhere and easy to find. For example, in movies, it's reaching a point where you see naked girls in almost every film. Parents also need to take action because they are the ones buying these materials and leaving them around the house, making it easy for children to access them.  We should be more careful about what we buy or read because if it's offensive and our kids read it, they might get the wrong idea. So, the next time you find something offensive, talk to the manager or supervisor about removing it. That's why I think offensive materials should be removed.
623	3600	2	2	I believe parents should inform their children about what they are allowed to read at different ages. This is the starting point of my opinion, and I'll explain why I hold this view and why I disagree with the idea that parents should restrict access to certain books.  I firmly believe that anyone should be able to read the books they like. The library is a place where people can access a wide range of books. Just because some parents don't want their children to read a particular book doesn't mean the book shouldn't be available in the library. Parents should explain to their children why they don't want them to read a certain book. When parents provide explanations, kids are more likely to understand why a book might not be suitable for them.  Some books are more appealing to older people and are quite interesting. If people understand the content of a book and it doesn't bother them, they are old enough to read it. Young kids who shouldn't be reading such books should be accompanied by an adult or guardian, who can prevent them from reading inappropriate material.  Another issue is that people are being denied access to books just because some parents don't like them. This is taking away our rights, and we shouldn't have to buy a book just to read it once. If these books are so terrible, why do people still write them? If they haven't caused significant problems so far, there's no reason for people to suddenly dislike them. People should be able to do what they enjoy without having those activities taken away.  This is my opinion on the matter. Many people may not agree, but I hope to make them see my point. By doing so, we can prevent people from taking away things that bring happiness to the community. I also hope people can retain their rights and not let a few individuals deprive them of those rights.
624	3601	2	2	Television, news, drama, life, and controversy are among the many themes that books explore. Some subjects are deemed vulgar and inappropriate for young audiences. While many people believe their children have the right to learn about all that books can offer, one must question whether this is truly a good idea. Books have long been an essential tool for students. However, not all books are suitable for every audience. Stories about knights and princesses are ideal for young people, but stories about the darker aspects of life are typically kept away from children.  Books are censored for various reasons. Some of these reasons are trivial and should not prevent a book from reaching its full potential. There is a line that should not be crossed, and some books cross this line and are therefore banned. However, some books that do not cross the line are banned regardless. Careful consideration should be given before deciding to ban a book or keep it on the shelves.  If a well - known author writes a book with only minor obscenities and the book is banned, the author may not face significant pressure as the banning will attract attention, and consumers may still buy the book out of curiosity. However, if a relatively unknown author writes a well - crafted piece with a few somewhat vulgar references and the book is banned, the author is in serious trouble. This author loses the opportunity to have their book in libraries, which is crucial for their work to be recognized. Banning books is preventing authors from establishing themselves in the literary world.  Books that are extremely vulgar should definitely be banned. No child should be reading a book intended solely for adults. Book banning protects children from such inappropriate material. If a child wants to read a banned book, they can ask their parents to buy it, assuming the parents believe it's appropriate for their children.  If a book can stimulate good discussion in a classroom and is mostly clean, it should be available to everyone. Just because a book contains a few inappropriate references doesn't mean students shouldn't read it. If the educational value of a book outweighs its potential negative effects on students, the book should be accessible to them. However, it's difficult to compare the learning material a book offers with its negative impacts.  In conclusion, it's challenging to determine whether minor issues in a book justify banning it. Many books should have restricted access, but creating a new system to identify such books would be difficult. Maintaining the current system makes more sense. Ultimately, a system that protects children while still allowing access to valuable literature is the best approach.
625	3602	2	2	I firmly believe that there should be no censorship in libraries. If someone needs to read a book on a particular topic and the library doesn't have it because the library staff doesn't believe in or like what the book says, the reader is deprived of the opportunity to gain accurate knowledge.  Firstly, many students visit libraries to study for their papers. If the library fails to provide the books they need, it fails in its primary purpose of serving the educational needs of its patrons. Secondly, just because the person in charge of the library doesn't like a book doesn't mean others can't read it. Books are meant for everyone to access and enjoy. Thirdly, a library is supposed to have a wide range of books so that people can read them. If the library owner removes a book and someone needs that specific book to obtain information, the library is not fulfilling its core function. Fourthly, many people read books to learn about different things. The fact that someone doesn't like what a book says doesn't give them the right to remove it from the library.  These are the main reasons why I think libraries should not have censorship. Library owners should stock as many books as possible and not exclude a book simply because they don't agree with its content. By maintaining an uncensored library, we ensure that everyone has equal access to knowledge and the opportunity to explore different ideas.
626	3603	2	2	I remain neutral on this matter. Whether new books, movies, music CDs, or magazines are added to or removed from the library's shelves is of no consequence to me. Additionally, it makes no difference if I have to pay for the items I borrow from the library or if I incur a late fee for overdue books. I am also indifferent to the noises in the library, the types of books it holds, how it is managed, the requirement to be quiet, the duration of my stay, the mode of transportation I use to get there, the library's policies, or if I am expelled and have to go to another library. Finally, it does not matter to me if I borrow ten books or movies from the library. Thoma.
627	3604	2	2	I firmly believe that books should not be removed. People know what they are reading, and if they do not like a book, they can simply put it aside. There is no valid reason for anyone to remove a book because many people have diverse preferences in reading material. If books are removed, it will upset a large number of people who may have loved a particular book and wanted others to read it. Some books may have been in a family for generations, and family members wish to share the enjoyment of those books. Moreover, removing a book is not a good idea because new books need to be purchased, which incurs costs and wastes paper. Another drawback is that if a new book replaces an old one, readers may not like the new book, causing the bookstore to lose money. In conclusion, removing books is not a prudent decision as it will result in financial losses for the bookstore and deny readers access to good books.
628	3605	2	2	"Censorship in libraries is a significant issue in contemporary society. Many individuals become irate at libraries and markets due to the items on display for the general public. Suppose a consumer enters a library in search of a book and comes across one from the early @DATE1's. During that era, certain words were used that are now considered ""harmful."" However, most people fail to understand that these words had different meanings in that historical context. When someone encounters such ""harmful"" or inappropriate words in a book, they often form a wrong impression. A small group of people who dislike a particular piece of literature then oppose the majority who understand the literary work, its emotions, and dialect. I will now explain to this small group some important points to consider before removing a book from the shelf.  When people visit a store or library and encounter a piece of literature they do not fully agree with, they should simply put it back and move on. No one is forcing them to read the book, so there is no need to make a fuss. The main reason some people object to certain word usage is that they do not understand the book's dialect or the time period in which it was written. If they do not fully comprehend the literature, they should not create a scene or attempt to revoke the author's right to have the work published and available on the shelf.  Authors have the same rights as everyone else. When they write a poem, novel, or short story, they have the right to have it published and placed on the shelf. Similarly, if we disagree with some of the literature in our schools, stores, and homes, we can express our views through writing a novel, newspaper article, or creating a website. We can also use web polls and other methods to gather opinions. This is a more indirect way to address the issue of removing a piece of literature. By using polls and obtaining multiple opinions, we increase our chances of winning an argument to have a book removed from the shelves, while causing less chaos and drawing less attention to ourselves and others.  Another reason against allowing people to choose what is on library shelves is that researchers are constantly working on various theories and laws. If we remove an important book, such as one written in the @DATE2's about evolution, we may miss out on crucial information when we need it in the future. Scientists may require that piece of literature to test a theory, and its removal could deprive us of valuable knowledge. Therefore, the more information we remove from the shelves, the less we will have to solve our problems in the future.  In conclusion, I hope that after sharing my opinions on this topic, you will have a better understanding of library censorship. Ideally, all books and literary works should remain on the shelves for readers to enjoy."
629	3606	2	2	Curse words, alcohol, drugs, and pornographic pictures are things that we do not want our children to engage with. These exist in the real world, but just because someone witnesses others doing these things does not mean they will follow suit. People should not be shielded from the realities of life. If children are shielded, they may not know how to respond when faced with the opportunity to do drugs or drink. They may even be unsure of what is right or wrong. Children of a certain age need to be aware of what awaits them in the real world as they grow up and start their own lives. While not everyone will encounter these situations, it is essential for them to have this knowledge.  Parents play a crucial role in teaching their children the difference between right and wrong. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the negative aspects of life. Exposure to such content in books, movies, and magazines can have an impact on their lives. It is the parents' responsibility to guide them on the right path.  One way parents can help is through restrictions on certain materials. Movies have age restrictions, which limit access to those within a specific age range. However, for other materials like books, music, and magazines, there is no easy way to deny access. Parents need to be vigilant and monitor their children's activities.  Censorship can be a double - edged sword. It can be beneficial for those who are more vulnerable to negative influences, as it shows them that certain behaviors are wrong. However, people should also have the right to access information. While it is an ongoing debate, in my opinion, censorship should not be implemented. Everyone has the right to access and view the things they desire.
630	3607	2	2	Libraries and bookstores around the world stock books with a wide range of subject matter, from the odd or inappropriate to the serious or violent. These books are written to evoke various emotions in readers, such as excitement, humor, horror, and empathy. However, it is sometimes unclear whether a book is suitable for young or mature readers. Although some books may seem unappealing or offensive, it is unjust to censor them without the unanimous disapproval of everyone. There should be no censorship of novels and literary works because writers deserve the freedoms of speech and press, new ideas are worth exploring, and target audiences deserve books that interest them regardless of others' approval.  Firstly, writers have the right to the freedoms of speech and press. They can express their opinions and write about the topics they are passionate about. Even when they use highly provocative or inappropriate subject matter, they have the legal right to do so. Preventing them from writing their opinionated stories is similar to the book - burning and writer - execution practices in Nazi @LOCATION1. Despite the fact that some books are not suitable for all ages, they still have potential readers.  Secondly, books and stories are meant to break new ground and explore uncharted topics. The variety of literature is what makes it so popular. For thousands of years, written text has been a means to understand and connect with different cultures and people. Just because a story may not be appropriate for a child does not mean it should not be written or read. Instead, its use should be monitored to ensure that only those who can understand and accept its message have access.  Finally, censorship is unjust because it limits the ability to discuss and present stories that appeal to a wide range of people. What may be horrific to a parent could be a preferred form of literature for another group. Limiting literary subjects is similar to limiting people's freedom of opinion. It is unreasonable to restrict literature to a single category with a few message variations for a select group. Variety is what makes each person's opinion unique.  In conclusion, censorship of literature should not be enforced. Writing topics should be open to all, as every book has a purpose, regardless of whether it is offensive. Since writers have the right to express their ideas through literature, there should be no limit to these rights. Therefore, censorship should never be used to remove a piece of literature from the shelves.
631	3608	2	2	Do you believe that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? Who can determine what is offensive to everyone? Who can tell you whether something you think is offensive or not? How can you maintain your individuality if others make decisions for you regarding the books you read, the movies you watch, and the music you listen to? I will explain why I think certain materials such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should not be removed from library shelves just because someone finds them offensive.  Who can be the ultimate judge in deciding if something is offensive to everyone? Everyone has their own definition of offensive. Different people find different things offensive. How can you claim that something offensive to one person is also offensive to another? I believe that if one person finds something offensive, that is their opinion. However, the next person who encounters the so - called offensive material might love it. You should not make decisions for others about whether they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, or listen to offensive music. That is their choice, not yours.  If every person removed a book from the shelves that they considered offensive, there would soon be no books left. Some people think certain music, books, and movies are offensive, while others find them cool and interesting. So, what should be done? Over the years, I have learned that not everyone will agree with your opinions, and vice versa. But everyone is entitled to decide what they like and dislike, and to choose what books to read, movies to watch, and music to listen to. So, why should we let anyone prevent us from being ourselves?  You can never say that anything is offensive to everyone because no single person represents everyone. You cannot speak for others as everyone has their own voice. So, do you think every book, movie, and piece of music you engage with is offensive? You might not, but somewhere, someone is trying to remove certain items from libraries because they have a negative opinion. Is that fair? In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and keep these materials in libraries to allow individuals to make their own choices.
632	3609	2	2	"Imagine your child or a very close person who is around @NUM1 years old, just beginning to learn how to be an adult and take on responsibilities. This young person wants to try new things. They hear their friends talking about drinking alcohol and how much fun it is. They think it sounds amazing to drink without knowing whether it is bad or not because no one has ever told them. So, they start drinking and later die of alcohol poisoning.  Surely, you don't want this to happen to someone close to you. If people are too afraid to talk about the negative aspects of life, such as sex, drugs, etc., then there should be books and movies to show how bad these things are. There should not be censorship in libraries. Some might say, ""They're too young; they can't handle these things yet."" However, you should consider their maturity level. They can learn from other people's mistakes, and it would be an educational experience.  How can you assess someone's maturity level? There are multiple ways. If you talk to someone about sex and they start laughing and making jokes, they may not be very mature. But you can't assume that every @NUM2 - year - old is immature. Many people take these topics seriously, while others may not, but they will still be able to view them in their own way. Implementing censorship in libraries is not a good idea.  Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc., may contain inappropriate content such as sex, drugs, drinking, and bad language. Should all these things be removed from libraries and their shelves? It's a difficult question to answer. What we can say is that it would allow people to learn from mistakes. For example, if there is a movie where a guy does drugs and later dies, people can infer that drugs are deadly. It's harder to show how offensive words are bad, but when people hear or read about such things, they can ask questions, and we can explain that saying or doing such things can be offensive.  Can you educate someone by letting them listen, read, or watch something offensive? It depends on the person, but you can educate them about the subject matter regardless of how offensive the topic is. We should teach people about these things. If we don't, history is likely to repeat itself. For instance, if we censor the Holocaust because it is horrifying, no one will know about it, and we may repeat such a tragedy. Censoring certain things in a library is not a good idea.  Certain people can handle talking about certain subjects. It's not always beneficial to censor offensive subjects. We need to educate people about these things so that they can learn and avoid repeating mistakes. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not advisable as it hinders the learning process and the ability to understand the real world."
633	3610	2	2	Offensive books should have a place in the library, but they should be placed in a separate area away from children. If everyone were to choose a book they didn't want in the library and have it removed, there would be no books left. Since everyone has different opinions on what is offensive, it's difficult to decide what can and cannot be in the library.  When I was a child, my grandma would take me to the library almost every @DATE1. I noticed that she tried to steer me away from certain books while being okay with others. My @CAPS1 did the same, but they had different views on what was appropriate for me to read. Grandma wanted me to get religious books, and @CAPS1 was fine with that and other books like '@CAPS2 the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5' and '@PERSON1'.  Even at home, opinions vary greatly. For example, when it comes to music, @CAPS1 likes country, @CAPS7 likes metal, my brother likes alternative music, my uncle likes rock, and I enjoy a combination of all these genres.  This shows that people have diverse opinions, with some being more strict than others. If we relied on people's opinions to keep libraries free of offensive materials, libraries would be empty. In conclusion, we should accept the diversity of opinions and find a way to accommodate different types of materials in libraries to meet the needs of all users.
634	3611	2	2	Taking any of these books off the shelves would be like taking away a part of our childhood. That wouldn't be a nice thing to do. If some books were removed, what would we show our children when they ask about our favorite childhood books? We'd have to tell them that the library doesn't have those books anymore because they had to make room for other books.  Think about it. Our parents got to read all their favorite childhood books. How would you feel if you couldn't share that experience with your kids? I'd be really upset because my parents told me about those books, and I went to the library to get them and loved them.  So, please, if you can, leave the books alone. In conclusion, these books are an important part of our heritage and should be preserved in libraries for future generations to enjoy.
635	3612	2	2	What is a library? A library is a place where one can access books, movies, music, magazines, etc., for research or entertainment purposes. The question is, should there be censorship in libraries?  In my opinion, there should be very limited censorship in a library. If every time there was a complaint about something offensive in the library and it was removed from the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. Many people go to the library to relax, have some quiet time, and let their minds wander, imagine, and dream. They don't worry about being offended by a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 book.  However, censorship in a library can be beneficial if used carefully. For example, moving adult - oriented books to a section where children won't access them can prevent children from having nightmares about disturbing images. What I'm suggesting is to have censorship at a very low level. If a library had high - level censorship and everything was removed from the shelves, there would be no point in going to the library; it would just be an empty room.  If someone is offended by something in the library, appropriate measures should be taken based on the severity of the offense. For instance, if something offends someone unintentionally, it can be left where it is. But if something intentionally offends someone based on their race, ethnicity, etc., it should be removed from the shelf.  Having low - level censorship in libraries is a good idea. There would be a sufficient quantity of materials for research, and a wider range of topics to stimulate imagination. At the same time, people wouldn't have to worry about being severely offended. In conclusion, a balanced approach with low - level censorship is the best way to maintain the functionality and value of a library.
636	3613	2	2	Censorship in libraries involves the act of removing items that some individuals dislike from the shelves, which implies disregarding the opinions of others. The decision to remove an item should depend on the nature of the product, such as books, magazines, music albums, or movies. In most stores, products are categorized not according to personal preferences but by genre or age - suitability. For instance, if a person ventures outside their typical section, the products in the new section may not align with their taste.  A local community library offers a wide range of reading materials, including baby books, kids' sections, teenage sections, and adult sections. As an individual, I used to frequent the kids' section, but now I'm more inclined towards the teenage section. However, just because I no longer have an interest in kids' books doesn't mean they should be removed, as the next generation will likely enjoy them.  Music presents a different situation. People have diverse musical preferences, like country or alternative. Libraries provide various music albums for patrons to sample before renting. If I don't like an album, I simply return it, and the librarian doesn't discard it based on my opinion, as it may appeal to others.  Regarding movies, while I believe anyone can watch different types of films, not all parents allow their 12 - year - olds to watch certain rated movies. In libraries, age restrictions are in place for some movies, but this doesn't mean these movies should be removed, as younger patrons may develop an interest as they get older.  In conclusion, an individual's opinion is important to them, but other opinions matter as well. Library products are for everyone to access, not to be judged. If everyone were to judge and remove items, there would be little left in the library.
637	3614	2	2	I firmly believe that it is unjust to ban any type of materials from the library. Withholding information from children is simply wrong because they will discover such information sooner or later. It is far better for them to learn from books, magazines, movies, or CDs, as they can then turn to their parents with questions. This way, they can gain accurate knowledge and understand the difference between right and wrong, rather than getting misinformation from peers.  For example, if a child reads about sex or an affair in a magazine, it is beneficial for parents to be involved in the child's learning process. Parents can guide the child, helping them distinguish between truth and falsehood and preventing unnecessary confusion or worry.  Moreover, the information children can find in magazines or movies is readily available on the internet. The internet often contains more graphic content and false information, and a child's curiosity may lead them to inappropriate websites.  When I was a child, my parents tried to shelter me from certain topics. However, in second grade, high - schoolers on the bus introduced me to topics like sex, showed me pictures, and shared information that I would have preferred to learn in a more appropriate setting. I felt unable to discuss these things with my parents, fearing their lack of understanding.  It is understandable that there are some materials that children should not access. But it is unfair to deny them the opportunity to learn and ask questions. If a child gets hold of inappropriate materials, it may be due to a lack of proper supervision. Parents should engage with their children when they read, listen, or watch something that seems inappropriate. They should explain things clearly, ensuring that children can tell the difference between good and bad. Taking away materials without proper explanation is truly unjust.
638	3615	2	2	Banning books from library shelves is not a good idea because people have diverse reading preferences. Books are valuable as they help improve reading skills and expose readers to new knowledge. When I was in middle school, I was fond of reading books by @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. However, when I asked the librarian if they had those books, the answer was no. The librarian thought that middle - schoolers shouldn't read books with cuss words and violence. But I believe it shouldn't matter what kids read because you can't force a child to read something they're not interested in. Everyone has different tastes, and there are various types of books, such as mystery, fiction, non - fiction, and historical books. Classroom textbooks are also books, but they are not the kind we read for pleasure every day.  I think parents should take their children to the public library. When I was in elementary and junior high, we had reading tests on the computer. In seventh and eighth grade, we had reading sessions in class, and there was even a reading challenge among schools, which was part of our English grade. Reading was never a problem for me as I loved it.  That being said, there are some books that libraries should remove from the shelves, especially those with nudity or excessive violence, and this is mainly for children under 13. Currently, there are more adult books than children's books.  In conclusion, parents should monitor what their children read but not prevent them from reading. If a child doesn't like reading, parents should encourage them to try. When children see their relatives reading, they are more likely to follow suit. Reading is beneficial for people of all ages, regardless of the type of book.
639	3616	2	2	In this persuasive essay, I aim to discuss whether offensive materials should be removed from library shelves, and I firmly believe that we should not do so.  Firstly, what one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. Removing materials based on individual opinions can harm those who want to access such materials. Some movies and books that are considered offensive may actually be beneficial for kids' future development.  Secondly, if we remove all offensive materials, the library would be left with only a few inoffensive movies and books like Bambi and Scooby - Doo. In fact, almost all materials in libraries can be considered offensive in some way by different people. I have yet to find an offensive movie or book in any library. If we remove all offensive materials, the library would be nearly empty, with only about @NUM1 movies and books in the entire building. In that case, having a library would hardly make sense.  People encounter cuss words in their daily lives, at school or at home. The words and actions in movies are often not as bad as those in real - life situations. We should view movies and books as just forms of entertainment. Scary movies and some books are fictional, and although there are inappropriate elements like sex in movies, age restrictions are in place.  In summary, removing materials from library shelves is not advisable as it can harm others and serves no real purpose. We should keep the library as a place where people can freely access a wide range of materials.
640	3617	2	2	When I visit a library to search for a book, I hope not to come across inappropriate books, movies, or magazines. The thought of a child seeing such content concerns me deeply. I want a library where my child can visit without my having to worry about what they might encounter.  To address this issue, libraries can take several measures. One option is to censor the materials placed on the shelves. By locating the adult - book section near the checkout area, library employees can easily spot young children who might wander into that section. If this solution doesn't work, libraries can rate the sections, similar to movie ratings. Group books and movies according to different levels of suitability, such as @CAPS2, @CAPS2 - @DATE1, @CAPS4 - @CAPS5, and so on.  I had a personal experience when I took my baby brother to the library. He brought me an adult book with a nude woman on the cover and asked to check it out. I was shocked and embarrassed. I never expected such an incident to happen in a public library.  I believe that everyone should have the freedom to choose the books or movies they want. Therefore, I don't advocate for the removal of inappropriate materials but rather for better organization. By arranging the materials properly, we can ensure that children are less likely to be exposed to inappropriate content. In conclusion, libraries should take steps to manage their collections to create a safe and suitable environment for all patrons.
641	3618	2	2	Should libraries censor the books on their shelves? I firmly believe they should. There are numerous offensive materials on the shelves. I wouldn't want my child or anyone else's child to read offensive books. Therefore, we should either eliminate all the inappropriate content or at least filter it. Any book, movie, or magazine containing a significant amount of profanity or inappropriate pictures should be removed or restricted to a certain age group. If libraries wish to keep these materials on the shelves, they should require readers to be in high school and have a permission slip to access them. Completely removing these materials would cause too much trouble. Instead, we should ensure that children are of a certain age and have permission. I wouldn't want my [@NUM1] - year - old child to read a book with bad language. Children pick up on such things quickly and may start imitating the language, which is not a good outcome. There are already many negative influences in society that can harm children. They don't need to read about criminal activities. I think the prevalence of such issues today is because people are exposed to these ideas at a young age and may want to emulate them later. They don't need books and movies that make the situation worse by making them think bad things are acceptable. If we don't filter what children are exposed to at a young age, they may become unruly and out of control, believing that actions shown in books or movies are okay for them to do, when in fact, they are not. I advocate for setting an age limit on access to such materials to improve society and help our children become better adults. We need to filter out the bad and provide better content for our younger generation. If we don't, we can't predict how they will turn out, and the world could deteriorate. So, let's start the filtering process to save the world and our children's future.
642	3619	2	2	"In my view, offensive literary works should be removable from libraries. If a piece of [@CAPS1] is extremely offensive, it should not be on display. From my own experience, controversy is the main reason books are removed from libraries. All my experiences, observations, and reading have led me to one conclusion: offensive literary pieces are taken away. When I encounter books that cause controversy, I usually don't like them. As someone who isn't particularly fond of reading, coming across offensive content makes me lose interest in reading altogether. All my experiences suggest avoiding books that cause distress or controversy. My observations also align with my experiences. I've noticed classmates and others who lose interest in reading because they feel offended by a novel. Although my observations [@MONTH1] may seem one - sided, I've seen more cases of reduced reading due to controversy than increased reading. All my observations support the removal of 'banned books'. The most prominent book I've read on this topic is [@CAPS2] [@NUM1]. In this novel, society has banned all books. While the story seems to support those who want to read controversial novels, we can draw a lesson from it. The people in the story lived happily without controversial books, although not all of them did, due to certain factors. Stories like ""The Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf"" show how poorly the concept of controversy is handled. For example, I was shocked when I first heard it and never wanted to hear it again because I thought it was not politically correct. Offensive literary pieces should be removed. If someone is not interested in reading a book because of its content, the book should be removed from public access to maintain peace. I wholeheartedly support the removal of controversial books from public places."
643	3620	2	2	Nowadays, people often seem eager to find something offensive. The [@ORGANIZATION1] often feels pressured to please these individuals. The reality is that in a country with a large population, there will be a wide range of ideas, preferences, and dislikes. Libraries are repositories of knowledge, housing various books, magazines, and movies to cater to different tastes. Most people can quickly determine whether they like a book or not, so books rarely offend readers. Magazines are similar to books in that people know what they want. They usually flip through the pages until they find an article they're interested in and then move on. Music has accompanied humanity since ancient times. It has a soothing effect on the human body and is constantly evolving. Initially, music was just vocal, but over the centuries, it has become more complex. It would be ideal if there were a single type of music that everyone liked, but that's not the case. There are so many music genres that it's difficult to find someone who likes all of them. Some people resist change and stick to their favorite music types. If everyone changed with time, there would be only a few music genres. Since there are many, there will always be someone who objects to a particular song. Movies have advanced significantly in the last century. They used to have simple plots that everyone enjoyed. However, many people want movies to evolve with technology. Today's movies often feature special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, and fighting. Directors try to create engaging movies by including just enough of each element, but if they overdo it, someone is likely to find it offensive. Movies are meant to be entertaining, not a source of offense. Fortunately, the movie industry has established a rating system to warn audiences. Whether it's a book, magazine, music, or movie, there will always be someone who doesn't like it or is offended by it. This is an inevitable part of diversity, and we can't do much about it. It simply shows that everyone in the world is different. We should conclude that just because one person dislikes something doesn't mean others will.
644	3621	2	2	"In my opinion, books and similar materials should not be removed from library shelves just because they are considered offensive. If there is content in a book that is potentially offensive to children, it should be placed in an adult - only section. Most libraries I've visited have separate areas for different age groups. If a book contains racially unacceptable content, it should be in the adult section, away from children. When determining whether a book is offensive, all possible ways in which someone [@MONTH1] might interpret the story should be considered to gauge their reaction. There are many genres of books, music, magazines, etc., so there is always a suitable place for each item. Most concerns about books revolve around language. For example, in [@CAPS1], the book ""[@CAPS2] of [@ORGANIZATION1]"" has been questioned about its suitability for school reading because of the 'n - word'. Although it is a harsh word, it is relevant to the story's setting and background. When unsure about a book's acceptability, one should consider the story's context and whether the word is necessary. In many cases, the seemingly unacceptable elements are integral to the story. If one book is questioned for something wrong, should all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be questioned? If something is not allowed in one item, it should not be allowed in others. The appropriateness of a book depends on the audience. I've read books with certain words that don't bother me, but others may be offended. Some parents don't want their children exposed to foul language or inappropriate content in music. It all comes down to the individual reader or listener. Katherine Paterson makes a valid point: if we start removing books from the shelves, eventually, there will be no books left. Just because a book contains a bad word or phrase doesn't mean it should be taken away from people's enjoyment."
645	3622	2	2	"If you grew up with caring parents, you've probably heard them say, ""No, you can't play that game, listen to that music, or watch that movie."" When you asked why, the answer was always, ""You're not old enough."" If you had the nerve to ask again, they might have said, ""[@CAPS2] If I wanted you to know, I'd let you find out on your own!"" and that didn't get you far. Now, think about those things you weren't allowed to do as a child and how you can do them now that you're older. What if those movies, [@CAPS3]'s, or games had been removed from the shelves before you could access them? What would you and your friends have done if you couldn't watch ""[@CAPS4] [@CAPS5] [@CAPS6] [@CAPS7] [@CAPS8]"" because someone found it offensive? Also, think about your future or current child. Would you want your [@NUM2] - year - old to be exposed to movies like ""[@DATE1] The [@NUM1]"" or ""[@CAPS9] and [@CAPS10]"" at that age? Most likely not. But what if these movies were removed because they were considered offensive? Then your child would never see them, and some might think that's the right thing. However, movies with sexual themes, drug use, or foul language are still being made. ""[@DATE1] The [@NUM1]"" has been remade and is even more graphic. There are countless other movies with such content, and they're becoming more popular. There are [@CAPS11] movies with sexual references, cigarettes, or bad words. You might be able to remove a few, but it's impossible to rid the shelves of all of them. Even if you could, what would be left to watch? If all offensive movies were removed, your kids would have limited options, maybe just [@CAPS12] the [@CAPS13] and [@CAPS14 - @CAPS15]. And what about you? You'd have nothing to watch either. All the things you like in a movie but don't want your child to see would be gone. My advice is not to discard everything that [@MONTH1] be offensive or that you don't want your child to see. Instead of taking extreme measures to shield your child, simply don't let them watch those movies or listen to that music. This is what our parents did, and it has worked so far, so there's no need to change it."
646	3623	2	2	I firmly believe that library censorship, as it stands, is appropriate for several reasons. Firstly, almost all the materials in libraries are for people to learn from, whether through reading books or watching movies. Secondly, if all offensive or disliked materials were removed, there would be far less information available for people to learn from in libraries.  I concur with Katherine Paterson's quote. It implies that if we removed every book that someone found offensive, there would be no books left. Everyone has different sensitivities, and it's impossible to eliminate everything offensive from libraries. For instance, if someone wants to learn about a historical war, but another person is offended by it due to losing a loved - one, should the related writing be removed? Libraries are places for learning. They contain a wealth of information on various subjects, even if some of it may be offensive to certain individuals. If someone dislikes or finds something offensive, they should simply leave it on the shelf, as someone else might gain valuable knowledge from it.  In life, people need to be exposed to and informed about various things, even if they're not always pleasant. Libraries are where people are introduced to such information. If these materials are removed, people will have nowhere to turn for this knowledge.  In conclusion, while there are offensive materials in libraries, others can learn from them. It would be unfair to deprive everyone of this information. Libraries are for learning about different things and should always offer a wide range of information. Many people have learned life - changing things from libraries and will continue to do so as long as they have access to diverse sources of information.
647	3624	2	2	"The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, consisting of seven books, is frequently censored in school libraries across the United States. The main reason is the positive portrayal of witchcraft, which is thought to harm innocent children. Many books, like Catcher in the Rye and Harry Potter, have been banned from school libraries because a group of people deems their content inappropriate without considering the broader meaning of these works. Public - accessible works should not be removed from library shelves just because they're considered offensive.  Under the First Amendment to the Constitution, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press, and religion. Censoring authors' speech denies their rights. Authors have the right to express what they think is necessary, and it shouldn't be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit this right.  Banning books like Harry Potter or Catcher in the Rye disregards their greater meaning. Many conservative Christian groups have advocated for Harry Potter's ban in schools due to its portrayal of witchcraft (and thus satanism) and the fact that J.K. Rowling stated that Dumbledore (the headmaster in the series) is homosexual. However, the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently, this isn't a message worth teaching American youth.  Even if every school in the country removed Harry Potter from the shelves, it shouldn't stop children from reading these books. Since Catcher in the Rye became part of many schools' curriculums in the 1950s, it has been at the top of the most - censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter about a prostitute. Yet, millions of teenagers have read this novel, which is a rite of passage for most young adults. Being one of the most - challenged books in the last fifty years only adds to its allure and popularity among the very people the censorship boards are trying to ""protect"".  If a parent doesn't want their child to read such a novel, it's up to the parent to censor their child's reading. Just because one parent doesn't want their child to read Harry Potter doesn't mean every child should be denied the opportunity. Censorship should be a private matter, not a public one.  In conclusion, books and other works should not be censored in libraries. Censorship violates an author's freedom of speech and disregards the greater meaning of the works. Although some groups advocate protecting children from offensive works, children will still find ways to access them."
648	3625	2	2	Censorship in libraries isn't always necessary. It's the parents' responsibility to control what their kids access, not the library's job to dictate people's choices. However, there are certain situations where censorship may be needed.  Parents are in charge of raising their kids and teaching them right from wrong. They should be the ones to guide their children, not the library. Otherwise, parents are shirking their duties.  Libraries have the right to acquire books as long as they don't contain extremely harmful content. It's understandable if they remove materials for adults, but if there's just one offensive word, people should get over it.  Some people want to change classic books like Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn because certain groups find them offensive. This is wrong. They're trying to rewrite history and sugar - coat the truth. Books are like the real world; people aren't always nice. The world is full of flaws.  There shouldn't be an issue with one or two bad words in great works of literature. In real life, people may curse, while in books, the offensive language is limited. We shouldn't change great books just because a minority finds them offensive. Libraries shouldn't decide what we can and can't read, and they shouldn't censor their books.  In conclusion, libraries should focus on providing a wide range of materials and let parents take the lead in guiding their children's reading choices. Censorship should be used sparingly, and the value of literature should be respected.
649	3626	2	2	A young boy enters the local library. He looks around and finds a movie recommended by a friend. He checks it out and goes home to watch it. Later, when his parents return, they notice their son acting strangely. He starts making rude comments, being violent, and using profanity. Who's to blame? The friend who recommended the movie or the library for having it on the shelves and allowing the young boy to check it out?  Today, many libraries offer a variety of books, movies, music, and magazines. Some even provide computers for people of all ages, which can be used for business, personal email, or kids' games.  But are all libraries meeting their standards? Some people find many books, movies, music, magazines, and websites threatening. Libraries have movies with ratings like R, PG - 13, etc., and music with explicit lyrics. Some libraries fail to meet their requirements, which is why they have less business than others.  In my opinion, if a library has offensive materials like books, music, movies, magazines, and websites, they should be removed from the shelves. If librarians let young kids check out explicit music and R - rated movies, they might need to be fired. From my own experience, I've never had problems with libraries and their materials. I've never been to a library with explicit music, the computers have blocked bad websites, and the magazines are suitable for all ages.  In conclusion, libraries should respect both people and the materials they offer. They need to ensure that the books, movies, music, and magazines are appropriate. Censorship is necessary for every library, and I believe most libraries are meeting their requirements.
650	3627	2	2	I firmly oppose the censorship of library - checked - out materials. While some library - goers may not seek offensive language or themes, others believe that un - censored content, when used appropriately, is better than censorship. For example, a book about a particular person might contain offensive elements, but for someone writing a report on that person, having as much information as possible is crucial.  However, I do make one concession: when it comes to music with offensive language, libraries should provide both clean and explicit versions of the albums.  Censorship has its pros and cons. Some people are offended by bad language and themes, while others see it as a form of artistic or authorial freedom. In my view, allowing both good and bad forms of content without censorship is better than complete censorship.  In conclusion, libraries should strike a balance. They should respect the diverse needs and preferences of their patrons while also providing access to a wide range of materials. By offering options like clean and explicit music versions and not over - censoring materials, libraries can better serve their communities.
651	3628	2	2	"In contemporary society, a significant number of children are exposed to harmful influences and engage in undesirable behaviors. There are certain materials that are inappropriate for children, which is why I firmly believe that libraries should implement censorship. Censorship in libraries serves multiple crucial purposes: guiding children towards positive paths, alleviating some of the burdens on parents, and addressing the issue of offensive content.  Censorship can effectively guide children in the right direction. When a child sees their role - model depicted on a movie case smoking, it is highly likely to pique their curiosity about smoking. I have witnessed this phenomenon firsthand. I once saw a kid I admired drinking, and I almost followed suit. Fortunately, the influence of my positive peers steered me away from this path. Children are greatly influenced by the actions of their role - models. By censoring such content, libraries can prevent children from being exposed to potentially harmful behaviors.  Parents are constantly worried about their children getting involved in legal troubles. Some movies available in libraries feature actors engaging in illegal activities. A child may perceive these actions as ""cool"" and attempt to imitate them. I have watched numerous movies that made me want to replicate the actions on screen. It may seem far - fetched, but there have been real - life cases where children have committed serious crimes after being influenced by movies. For example, a six - year - old boy shot his father in the head because he thought playing with guns was safe, as he had seen it in movies.  Censorship can also relieve some of the stress on parents. Parents are constantly concerned about their children's whereabouts, activities, and companions. If libraries censor inappropriate music and movies, parents can be more at ease, knowing that their children are less likely to be influenced by negative content. This gives parents confidence in their children's well - being.  Finally, offensive movies can cause harm to children, parents, or the target audience. Based on my personal experience, I know that offensive content in movies can create a hostile environment. In many movies, smart kids are often portrayed as being bullied, while athletes receive all the attention. As someone considered a ""smart kid,"" I have felt the negative impact of such portrayals. My peers, after watching these movies, seem to think it is acceptable to pick on me, creating a sense of hatred. This situation could have been avoided with proper censorship.  In conclusion, it is evident that censorship in libraries is necessary. It helps guide children, eases parental concerns, and mitigates the negative effects of offensive content. Censorship is beneficial not only for children but also for parents. In my view, it is an essential measure for the well - being of the community."
652	3629	2	2	"People around the world hold diverse opinions. When someone dislikes something, they have the option to ignore it. Therefore, I firmly believe that when one finds something offensive in a library, they should not have the right to remove it.  One of the primary reasons for this stance is that not everyone shares the same perception of what is offensive. People have their own unique viewpoints on all things. If someone removes a book or other materials from the library because they consider it inappropriate, others who enjoy such content will be deprived of the opportunity to access it.  Another reason is that removing offensive materials can lead to dissatisfaction among some people. Many individuals enjoy the so - called ""offensive"" elements in books, movies, and other media. From my perspective, I appreciate having a bit of the unconventional in my life. Whether it's through reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or reading a magazine, I want to be able to visit a library and freely choose what I like without worrying about its availability.  In my opinion, offensive remarks and words often contribute to the humor in books and other forms of media. Just because something seems rude or inappropriate doesn't mean it lacks value. These elements can make a book or other content more interesting and engaging.  Although some offensive materials in libraries may appear inappropriate, if they are present, it indicates that they are not overly harmful. They should not be removed simply because one person believes they do not belong in a library. Everyone has their own opinions in life, and sometimes it is best to keep them to oneself. In conclusion, offensive materials should remain in libraries to respect the diverse interests and opinions of the public."
653	3630	2	2	There are numerous books and movies that are considered inappropriate for younger audiences. Rating movies and designating specific age - groups for books help in categorizing these materials.  In public libraries, all books and movies are made available for everyone to borrow. There is an ongoing debate about whether these inappropriate materials should be accessible to all. If a child borrows a book or movie rated @CAPS1, parents may be upset with the library for allowing the child to access such content. On the other hand, there are also cases where parents want their children to borrow a @CAPS1 - rated movie, and the library may face harassment for denying the request.  The question of whether public libraries should allow certain age groups to borrow inappropriate materials logically leads to a negative answer. If a child is not permitted to watch a rated @CAPS1 movie at the theater, there is no reason for them to freely borrow such movies from the library. Public libraries should take measures to prevent underage children from borrowing inappropriate materials. A simple solution is to include the age of the library card holder on the card, which would resolve many misunderstandings.  By adjusting their censorship policies, public libraries can enhance their reputation and provide a safer environment for children to access materials. Taking control of the content available in libraries is a responsible step that benefits both the library and the community. In conclusion, public libraries should implement effective age - based censorship to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate materials.
654	3631	2	2	It would be extremely beneficial for libraries to adopt a more flexible censorship policy, allowing a wider variety of books. In my view, this would be advantageous for students, parents, and teachers seeking information on different topics. Many students may need to write papers on unfamiliar subjects, and having access to a diverse range of books would greatly assist them.  A library is a place where people can go to gather information, enjoy a good read, or simply relax. When researching an unknown topic, it is highly desirable to find a comprehensive book on the subject. This is particularly helpful for students working on reports and for anyone seeking additional knowledge.  If someone does not want a certain type of book in the library, they should simply ignore it. I believe that books that are beneficial to others should not be removed just because they may be offensive to some. Even if a book covers topics such as drugs, sex, or violence, it can still educate those who are not well - informed about these inappropriate or offensive subjects.  In conclusion, it would be a mistake to censor libraries by removing books. This practice deprives many people of the opportunity to gain knowledge on various topics, whether for educational or professional purposes. A diverse collection of books in libraries is essential for the intellectual growth and development of the community.
655	3632	2	2	No, books should not be banned from libraries. If we start banning books based on the fact that they might offend someone, then almost every book could be at risk. If a person thinks a book is bad, they simply shouldn't read it.  First of all, a book is just a form of media. There is no valid reason to ban it just because some people don't like it. If a child reads an adult - oriented book, it can actually be beneficial as they get to learn big words. Even if they come across a naked picture, it's not the end of the world. It's likely not the first time they'll encounter such content, and it won't be the last.  Secondly, some people try to ban books just to create drama. They know that banning a book will cause a stir, especially with the author. This kind of behavior is unjust and goes against the principle of free access to knowledge.  Finally, if we ban books because they are considered offensive, there won't be many books left in the library. Almost anything can be considered offensive by someone. In conclusion, no single book should be banned from the library. Libraries should provide a wide range of reading materials to meet the diverse interests of the public.
656	3633	2	2	In libraries, some shelf - stored materials may offend certain individuals, and I've witnessed such materials myself. The question is whether libraries should remove them. Offensiveness is subjective; what one person finds offensive, another may not. Libraries can't satisfy everyone. In my view, libraries shouldn't remove these materials because what one person dislikes could be another's preference. However, there are solutions for those who want the materials removed. For example, 'offensive materials' can be placed on taller shelves or in a separate room so that children or those who object don't have to see them. This way, both parties' concerns are addressed. If this solution fails, libraries can replace extremely offensive materials with more suitable ones. Overall, I believe libraries shouldn't remove these materials. Instead, efforts should be made to satisfy both those who are offended and those who aren't, thus resolving the issue.
657	3634	2	2	I firmly believe that if library materials are offensive, they should be removed. A library is a place where people go to gain better understanding of unknown things. If someone visits a library and finds something inappropriate, it should be taken off the shelf. I wouldn't want anyone to be dissatisfied with the library's books, movies, music, etc., especially when children are involved. A public library should be a place that meets people's expectations and is suitable for children to learn. It is a learning environment that should inspire education, growth, and development. The primary goal of a library is learning, so offensive materials should be removed. Children should be able to visit a library and be content with its offerings. In conclusion, offensive materials have no place in a library as it undermines the library's purpose of providing a positive learning experience.
658	3635	2	2	Should library materials be censored? I don't think so. If a material is offensive to someone, they simply don't have to look at it. People should have the right to access whatever they want from the library. If someone doesn't like the available materials, that's their problem. Regarding the concern about kids getting inappropriate materials, libraries won't let kids check out inappropriate items. Also, parents should monitor what their kids get. I visit the library often and have never seen anything inappropriate, and I know no one who has reported finding offensive materials. Libraries generally understand what people want. It's not right to remove materials just because a few people dislike them, as there are likely others who like them. Only extremely offensive materials that everyone agrees are bad should be removed. Removing materials every time someone complains would leave the library nearly empty. In conclusion, materials shouldn't be removed just because some people find them offensive, as many others may not be offended, and taking them away would be unfair.
659	3636	2	2	I think that books in libraries that children aren't allowed to read should be placed in areas where kids can't access them. There should be sections for specific age - groups. In some libraries, many books not suitable for children are accessible to them, and this should not be allowed. The same principle applies in stores. In some stores, the magazine section has inappropriate content for kids. At the grocery store I go to, there are inappropriate images and words. I once saw a little kid reading a magazine with bad words and pictures. So, magazines should be placed in an area restricted to certain ages. In the same store, the music section is often filled with children. While the music isn't always bad, kids can take the music home to listen to, and it's the parents' fault if they buy it for their kids. Music for different age - groups should be separated. The same goes for movies. There are movies rated for different audiences, and many movies rated for older audiences have content that children shouldn't see. They're often just sitting on store shelves. The reason for all these measures is to prevent children from getting hold of inappropriate materials. If kids listen to bad music or watch inappropriate movies, they may start using bad words and get in trouble. In conclusion, children should not have access to inappropriate books, magazines, music, and movies.
660	3637	2	2	Should we have the right to remove offensive materials from shelves? I believe we shouldn't. If we had this right, there would be few materials left for future generations. Many materials may contain content related to discrimination or offensive words, or they may not be to our liking. But we should never have the right to remove them. There are books that either discriminate against certain races or inform us about past discrimination. If we could remove these materials, they would eventually disappear. Future children would either be unaware of these events or have inaccurate information. If someone finds a single offensive word in a book or movie, they shouldn't be able to remove it from others' access. Many good books and movies would vanish because of one person's dislike of a word. Some people may think certain materials are a waste of space and remove them, but there are others who enjoy them. Judging a book by its size or word - size is not valid. I think no one should have the right to remove books, movies, music, or magazines from the shelf. We should preserve these materials for future generations. In the past, people destroyed materials they disliked, and we now have no knowledge of them. There's no reason to remove materials based on one person's or a group's opinion. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of materials in libraries and other media sources for the sake of future learning and understanding.
661	3638	2	2	Removing offensive materials from library shelves is not the right approach. Despite how offensive some materials like books, music, movies, and magazines may seem, there are alternative solutions. Everyone has different views on what is offensive. For example, some people prefer comedies, while others like horror movies. People have their own preferences for what they read, listen to, or watch, so why take away things they enjoy? A better solution is to separate certain materials in the library. If something is considered offensive, it can be grouped with similar items. This way, materials don't need to be completely removed. Mothers often worry about their children accessing offensive materials in the library. Separating these materials can address this concern. In conclusion, there's no need to remove materials from libraries because people have diverse interests. Offensive materials should not be removed from libraries.
662	3639	2	2	I'm currently quite ill with a throbbing headache as I write this paper, so I hope you'll be lenient. Every literary work is a product of someone's imagination, shaped in the direction the creator desires. If writing, an art form, were censored, it would be no more than worthless trash floating in the streets. It's similar to watching TV. If a horror movie with nudity is too scary and inappropriate for your kids, don't let them watch it. In a library, a mother can't always pre - read books for her child. So, one has to take responsibility and decide whether to read a book based on what their mother might think. The idea of library censorship is absurd. I wouldn't want to see certain explicit content in the children's section, but it's just a matter of proper book placement. Keep explicit books on one side and non - explicit on the other. Most library users are old enough to choose their own books, and if not, they're accompanied by their mothers. In conclusion, library censorship is unnecessary. We should rely on proper categorization and individual responsibility.
663	3640	2	2	Libraries and stores across the country are filled with various types of books, music, movies, and magazines. Consumers often pick these items without fully realizing what they're buying, and parents may not be aware of what their children purchase. Some materials can be offensive and have a negative influence, but if parents are more cautious, there's no need to remove these items from the shelves. One key reason not to remove these items is that consumers have the right to choose what to buy or borrow. People should make their own decisions. If they don't like something, they can go to another shelf or store. Taking away items is like taking away people's right to choose. It's the adults' responsibility to prevent their children from accessing mature - content movies. Parents can restrict certain things until their children are old enough to decide for themselves. Just because some people are bothered by offensive items doesn't mean they should be removed. It's difficult to remove all such items from libraries and stores due to the media's reach. Younger children will likely always be exposed to such materials through TV commercials, music videos, and magazines. If people removed all the items they didn't approve of, library shelves would be empty. Taking away one book could mean taking away someone's favorite. We separate children's and adult sections for a reason. In my experience, kids usually prefer the children's section. In conclusion, offensive materials should remain on the shelves. It's the parents' responsibility to monitor their children, and people can't remove items just because they're offensive to some.
664	3641	2	2	I think that if you're in a library, movie store, or anywhere else and you find books, movies, magazines, or CDs offensive, they should probably be removed from the shelves. I've had the experience of walking into a store and seeing something inappropriate for kids, which made me feel embarrassed. That's why I believe such items should be removed from the store or at least from the shelves. I often wonder how my grandparents would feel if they knew the kind of music most teens listen to today. There's so much bad language, talk of violence, and other inappropriate content that it's not suitable for anyone to hear. I know some people have different views on this, and some take it too seriously. But everyone is entitled to their opinion. In conclusion, offensive materials should be removed from public shelves to avoid discomfort and inappropriate exposure.
665	3642	2	2	I'm conflicted about whether certain books should be removed from library shelves. On one hand, I believe some books should be removed. Public libraries are frequented by under - age children. Although they can't check out certain books, they can still read them in the library. Also, some books may be offensive to certain people. For example, a book that makes offensive jokes about a particular race could be hurtful to someone of that race. On the other hand, I don't think any book should be removed from a library. Libraries are meant to cater to a wide range of interests. It's unfair to remove books just because some people find them inappropriate. People should be able to freely browse books without having to search for ones that interest them but have been removed due to others' sensitivities. In conclusion, the decision to remove books from libraries is complex. We should try to see from different perspectives and not hastily remove books based on individual sensitivities.
666	3643	2	2	When one visits various places, there will always be something that they dislike, as not everyone likes everything. A library is perhaps the worst place in this regard. Censorship in libraries is worsening day by day, encompassing books, movies, music, and magazines. Should such materials remain on the shelves? Everyone who reads this will have different thoughts about library censorship. There are many items on the shelves with bad language and inappropriate pictures. Young children can easily pull these books off the shelves and see things that their parents don't want them to see. Censorship exists not only in libraries. The materials in libraries need to be improved and made less objectionable. If there is a demand for such content, a special store should be established for it. In conclusion, a balance must be struck to ensure that libraries remain a suitable environment for all, especially young readers.
667	3644	2	2	Censorship in school libraries is a significant issue. Sometimes, students may want to read a particular book but cannot access it in their school library. Many excellent educational books have been removed from library shelves because they contain either excessive violence or inappropriate language. If children or parents are offended by such books, they simply don't need to borrow them. There should be no censorship of books in schools. Many books that teachers consider educational have been taken off library shelves, books that teachers would like to assign to their classes. There should be no problem with students reading a book that has a few swear words or violent scenes. Some of the banned books could resonate with readers and have a profound impact on them. The practice of banning books in libraries needs to change. People should have the right to read what they want, even if it's from a school library. For instance, '@CAPS1 for @PERSON1' was banned in public schools for some reason. This is one of my top - five favorite books, yet I couldn't borrow it from the library because it was banned. Such restrictions should be lifted regardless of the reader's age. In conclusion, library censorship must be eliminated so that people can freely access the literature that may enrich their lives.
668	3645	2	2	I firmly believe that certain offensive materials should either be removed from the general shelves or placed in restricted areas where young children or those with religious objections cannot easily access them. For example, there are books, music, movies, and magazines that contain offensive images or language, which are offensive not just to me but to many others as well. Offensive content includes inappropriate images, videos, and bad words that are not suitable for everyone to see or hear. One must be cautious when judging something as offensive because everyone has different opinions. We have the right to express our thoughts through speech, reading, and writing. I'm not advocating for the prohibition of certain books or music; rather, I think there is an appropriate time for everything. As young people, we are striving for a better future, and the older generation, with their experience, should provide us with the best guidance. In a free country, people should voice their opinions. It's important to stand up against offensive words or images and not let others force us to do something offensive to someone else. In conclusion, while respecting freedom of expression, we should also take measures to protect the well - being of all, especially the younger generation.
669	3646	2	2	In today's world, there is an abundance of content around children. If we tried to remove all potentially harmful materials, we would end up taking away most of the entertainment available. Many adults note that the world has changed significantly since their youth. Instead of complaining, we should take action. Adults can limit the amount of content children bring home. Nowadays, in any store, one can find something that they wouldn't want their children to consume. People are doing their best to separate inappropriate materials from family - friendly ones, but it's often not enough. Children are getting addicted to certain content at a young age and sharing it with their friends. Many movies and music convey negative ideas that children don't need to learn. Content related to drugs, parties, and drinking should not be on radio stations or TV channels accessible to young children. Adults need to understand that this kind of content is harmful to children and should keep them away from it as much as possible. As the author said, if everyone removed something from the shelves, there would be nothing left. While we can't eliminate all such content, we can start by reducing the amount. The remaining content can be kept in places where children don't usually go. Our towns and cities can do a better job of protecting children from @CAPS1 rated movies, negative songs, and books about 'adult things'. Since children are the future of the world, exposing them to such negative content bodes ill for the future. By keeping children away from these materials, we can create a better world. In conclusion, it is our collective responsibility to safeguard children from harmful content.
670	3647	2	2	There are numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that some people find offensive, and some advocate for their removal from the shelves. However, I do not believe they should be completely removed. Not everyone finds these materials offensive, and they should not be taken off the shelves just because a few people object. Firstly, people have diverse views on what is offensive. Just because one person is offended by a movie or book doesn't mean everyone wants it removed. If someone found my favorite book offensive, I wouldn't want it taken off the shelves. Secondly, if every offensive item were removed, there would be very little left. As author Katherine Paterson said, if everyone has the right to remove a book they abhor, then there will be no books left for anyone. People find different things offensive, and if we act on every objection, there will be nothing for anyone to enjoy. Finally, if someone finds a book offensive, they don't have to read it. Instead of removing it, they can simply avoid it. Taking offensive materials off the shelves could upset many people who don't find them offensive. In conclusion, while some may be offended by certain content, we should respect the rights of others to access it and find alternative ways to deal with offensive materials rather than complete removal.
671	3648	2	2	Everyone has things that can offend them, whether they admit it or not. Books, music, movies, and other materials can all potentially offend different people. Even books used in school classrooms can cause offense. Reading is important, and readers will inevitably encounter something that offends them. In my view, we have the right to have these potentially offensive things. There are numerous books that offend people, music and movies already have censorship options, and if someone is offended, they can simply ignore it.  First, we have the right to these kinds of books. In life, there are things we don't like, but we deal with them. The same goes for books. Even though some people don't like certain books, those books are often well - liked and become famous. I once read a book that some wanted to ban, and it was one of the best I've ever read. If we removed every book that one person didn't like, there would be very few left.  Second, music and movies have censorship. We can choose whether to have it or not. Movies indicate appropriate age groups, and music can block offensive words. If people don't want to be exposed to offensive content, they don't have to listen or watch. We all have things we love and hate, and we can't eliminate all the hated things.  Last, if people don't want to be exposed to something, they don't have to. Music and movies are options. It's all a matter of opinion, and there's no right or wrong. I know people who don't have @CAPS1's or don't listen to the radio, and that's fine. They don't need to complain if they don't pay attention to it.  In conclusion, there are many books that offend people, music and movies have censorship, and those who are offended can avoid the content. These books, magazines, music, etc., are well - liked by many. Why get rid of them for the few who are offended? We all have things we like and dislike that we can't change. As Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
672	3649	2	2	I was wandering through the library, looking for the perfect books to check out. I came across a book that seemed incredibly interesting. Its cover showed a depressed girl with a look of hope on her face, and the back had a summary that made me eager to read it. The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who overcame troubled times. All kinds of stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape find their way onto library shelves, and it's our job to discover them. Whether the literature is about love and heartbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on library shelves.  Everyone has opinions that conflict with others. Our world is full of different viewpoints, and literature and music should reflect these opposing sides. Literature is an escape for many. It allows readers to experience the world through the characters they read about. If we remove books that might be offensive to some, we're taking away this opportunity for others. In my opinion, removing potentially offensive material from libraries is like sheltering our world.  No matter how hard we try, children and teenagers will eventually be exposed to offensive material. Instead of hiding the real world from them, we should let them experience it in a safe way, like through reading or listening to music. If someone finds material offensive, it's the parents' responsibility to decide whether their child reads or listens to it. Removing the potentially offensive material won't help.  In conclusion, offensive material shouldn't be removed from libraries. Instead, it should be regulated by parents or elders. Regulating what's on library shelves isn't the most effective approach. If any material has the potential to be offensive, it's not the library's job to decide whether it's displayed to the public.
673	3650	2	2	Library censorship should remain as it is. There are several reasons for this: parents should control what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have a wide variety of books on different subjects.  Parents should be in charge of their children's reading. If parents tell their children not to read a certain book, the children will likely comply. If parents don't want their children in a particular section, they can simply tell them to stay away. Even if a child might stray from their parents, it's unlikely that the parents won't notice. So, parents should be responsible for what their children read.  Not all people agree on censorship. Some people think religion is important regardless of what a book shows, while others find parts of religious books (such as nudity or swear words) inappropriate. Some believe that books like @CAPS1 mythology books are inappropriate and need to be censored, while others see them as part of past culture and want them to remain in libraries. Most children find these books too big to read and won't even look at them. There are few people who agree on censorship, and many who disagree.  Libraries have books on different subjects, so people can choose to read something other than inappropriate books. It's unlikely that a child will pick the dirtiest book and say they want to read it. Children usually prefer books related to television shows or movies. So, people can easily ignore inappropriate books.  In conclusion, library books should keep the current censorship level. Parents should control their children's reading, there is no consensus on censorship, and libraries offer diverse reading options. Some people think the current censorship is fine, while others disagree. But children probably won't be interested in inappropriate books anyway.
674	3651	2	2	I once saw an old lady looking at a book in the library. The book was about medical marijuana. She seemed offended, but I firmly believe that if a book is on the library shelf, it should stay there.  I'm trying to convince librarians, readers, and everyone else that if they're offended by a book, magazine, movie, or any item in a @CAPS1 library, they should keep quiet. A library has multiple functions. First, it's @CAPS1, open to everyone. Second, with a library card, people can borrow books, movies, music, etc. Third, if someone needs a place to go while on the road, they can use the library.  My point is that nothing should be removed from library shelves. Of course, there are times when we need to take action, but we can have an adolescent - only room or something similar. Removing an item from a library shelf is like taking away a part of its essence. Suppose there are @NUM1 @CAPS1 libraries in a town. One library has an item that the others don't. If someone protests and gets it removed from the shelf, it may be hard to find it elsewhere, unless you buy it online, which can be expensive when you could get it for free at the library.  I understand why some people want to remove certain materials. For example, if a @NUM2 - year - old kid walks up with a sex - related book, it can be a problem. Parents want to keep their kids in a safe environment, and they may complain about such books in a @CAPS1 library.  After such incidents, people often blame librarians for having inappropriate books, movies, and music. But it's not the librarians' fault. Different people like different books, which is why libraries offer a wide range of choices.  Then the idea of having separate rooms for different books comes up. It sounds good, but who will pay for it? Libraries rely on donations. They are profitable to some extent but also a non - profitable resource. Libraries have been around for a long time, starting small and growing big. They make money by selling donated books they don't need. Only then can they start creating separate rooms.  This solution may seem crazy, but it won't cause a riot. People, librarians, and readers will be happy. You can easily find the book you want in a specific room, check it out, and enjoy reading. It's easier than looking up the Dewey Decimal number.  In conclusion, we shouldn't remove anything from library shelves because an item may be the only one in town, state, or even the whole country. You never know. As I said, 'It's better to keep a book, than to forget a book.'
675	3652	2	2	Imagine stepping out of your home and seeing a massive bonfire right in the middle of the street. You notice men going into a library empty - handed and coming out carrying armfuls of books, magazines, movies, and other media. They then throw these items into the raging fire, watching them burn and be lost forever. This is what will happen if library censorship occurs.  We must not allow library censorship because it violates a constitutional right, gradually makes our society more ignorant, and shifts our nation from a democratic one to one where a small group controls the beliefs and ideals of the people.  Allowing library censorship clearly violates a basic constitutional right. The @ORGANIZATION1 explicitly states freedom of the press. By discarding certain literary works, this right is undermined. Once one constitutional right is violated, what's next? Will our freedom of speech or assembly be next to go? As citizens of @LOCATION1, we can't let this happen to our great nation.  If certain books and essays are removed from libraries, people's knowledge base will shrink significantly. For example, @PERSON1's theory of evolution is a sensitive topic among people of the @CAPS1 faith. If all his related works are removed, valuable information for biologists will be lost, and they won't be able to build on existing knowledge. This would lead to a decline in our civilization's intellect and an increase in ignorance across many fields.  Recall @CAPS2 in @DATE1. Hitler's @ORGANIZATION2 took power and systematically destroyed all materials they considered subversive, only allowing materials that matched their beliefs in libraries. Allowing library censorship would be the same. A small group would control the censorship, forcing their beliefs and ideals on the people and shaping the masses' views.  In conclusion, library censorship would dismantle the basic structure of our society by violating a constitutional right, making society more ignorant, and putting the people's beliefs in the hands of a few. Our @CAPS3 @CAPS4 did not envision @LOCATION2 to become like this, and they were right. Allowing censorship in public libraries is simply wrong.
676	3653	2	2	In my view, to a certain extent, I don't think books should be removed. Some books, magazines, and other materials can be informative. They can assist with specific questions. Although they may not always provide the exact answers needed, they allow us to reflect on the nature of our generation.  However, there are also materials that can be offensive to others. Some people take this aspect to an extreme and get hurt. I believe that certain books and magazines should be removed as they can cause harm and hurt people. In such cases, one can ask the store to remove the offensive items. But a store shouldn't remove a book just because one person is offended by it.  If all offensive books are removed from the shelves, we won't learn from the mistakes reflected in other people's lives. Some might think it's a good idea to take books off the shelves, but younger adults won't learn about mature topics that parents may not want to teach. They might think they're doing the right thing by not exposing people to sexually offensive content. We may not want kids or others to see such content and witness the current state of the world.  I can understand why people would want to remove certain materials from the shelves. They may not like what they see and find it offensive, especially content related to sexuality and mental illness. However, certain books, like anatomy books, should stay on the shelves. Anatomy books show the human body without hiding it, and we should have knowledge about the human body. So, anatomy books and magazines should remain available. If one wants to look at explicit and provocative content, they should go to a sex - store. Public books should not display the sexual side of human beings.  Anatomy magazines are for learning, not for entertainment. One can go to other stores for entertainment. But if we remove all offensive materials, we would also have to remove anatomy items. Some people might be offended by not looking like the people in the magazine, but we shouldn't remove anatomy books as they are for learning, not for causing offense. This also applies to sexual magazines. While sex is a natural part of life, we shouldn't teach it to younger kids through magazines. We should teach them about sexual intercourse in an appropriate way. Anatomy books and tapes may encourage an understanding of sex, but they are mainly targeted at adults.  Regarding music and tapes, I don't think they should be removed. They are for enjoyment, and people like to relax to this kind of content. I may not buy certain types of music, but others do and enjoy it. If we remove them, then what else would be available? We need to consider the younger generations. The older generations had a happy and non - violent life, but teenagers today in some places have a tough time. They need something to listen to. Although some music may be offensive, there is offensive music in every era.  Music is an important part of people's lives. People make a living by listening to and creating music. It is what makes the world go around. Removing music and newspapers from stores and stands would be a great disappointment as it would mean losing a wonderful thing just because it might hurt some people.  If we look back to the [NUM1]'s, music was also about drugs, and no one had a problem with it. Maybe it's because people grew up around it. Just as we have grown up with rap and sexual music. We were once teenagers too, and we know we wouldn't have listened to music that didn't touch on various real - life topics.  Generations change, and so does the environment, but we can't change the way we grew up. We can try to make it better, but it will require a lot of willpower. The current generations are tough and won't give in easily. We shouldn't try to take away the things we grew up with. No one tried to take away the music of the older generations, so why should we take away the music of the younger ones? It's not something to be removed but rather something to look back on and see how much our generations have changed.
677	3654	2	2	In my opinion, all types of materials should be allowed in libraries. If someone is offended by a particular topic or section, they don't have to read it. Libraries shouldn't limit themselves to certain genres, themes, or magazines. Everyone is different, with different personalities and preferences. I think libraries should actually expand their variety of books.  Libraries that don't meet people's desires and interests won't attract visitors. Libraries should be filled with a wide range of subjects to appeal to everyone, just like having separate adult and children sections. Everyone should feel like they belong in a library, even if some people may get offended. Offense can occur anywhere, not just from a particular magazine or music style.  Of course, there should be a line of respect. No material should cross the line to the point where a large number of consumers complain about the same topic. We can tell when a certain section or material is inappropriate. Each section should present the truth in a respectful manner.  During my visits to the library, there have been things I don't agree with. But then I see people really enjoying their time there. Whenever I go, I always find music that suits my taste. There are always choices, different options, and new things to learn.  Keeping all materials like books, music, movies, etc., in libraries is a way to appeal to everyone. People should have the right to their opinions and the choice to read what they like. There will always be movies or books that some people don't care for, but others might. If everyone were to dictate what should be in the library based on their likes and dislikes, there would be no variety. What books would be left? Everyone has their own thoughts on what they like, and if there's a topic one doesn't like, they probably know little about it. The library is a great place to search for information on anything.  In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection of materials to meet the needs and interests of all visitors, while also respecting the boundaries of appropriate content.
678	3655	2	2	This essay discusses whether certain offensive materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves. I don't believe materials should be removed just because they offend someone. What is offensive to one person may not be offensive to others. If someone is offended by the materials on display, there are ways to avoid seeing them. They can avoid the shelves where the offensive items are, ask for assistance to get what they need, or search for information on the internet.  When I visit the library, I usually know what I'm going to get, so I've never found anything offensive. If I did find something offensive, I would complain. If the library didn't take any action, I would stop going there and instead do my research online or go to another library that meets my needs.  The libraries I go to have sections separated by age groups: children, teens, and adults. I've visited the library many times and have never heard anyone complain about offensive materials. If there were something offensive in the library, I might not even notice since I usually stay in the teen section, looking at magazines and books.  I think that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves, they should either avoid or ignore it. Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what isn't. In conclusion, libraries should not remove materials based on the offense of a single individual, as it is important to maintain a diverse collection for all patrons.
679	3656	2	2	I think we shouldn't take things off the shelf because what might be offensive to you may not be offensive to me. Something that I find fun or beneficial may not be the same for you, and vice versa. If something is offensive to someone, they should just walk away or ignore it. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and not let individual sensitivities lead to the removal of materials that others may value.
680	3657	2	2	I believe the current system of censoring and removing materials in libraries is effective and should continue. As Katherine Paterson said, while everyone may dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can't remove every book that an individual dislikes. When a book becomes so controversial that the majority of people disapprove of it, it is usually removed from the shelves.  The likelihood of children seeing offensive material is low. Most public libraries don't place offensive materials near children's books. At my local library, there is a section for more offensive or obscene books. To access these books, one needs parental permission or to be [NUM1] years old. So, it's very unlikely that a child would come across such materials.  People who find certain materials offensive should also consider the time and place when the story was written. For example, [PERSON3] [PERSON2] may have had racial slurs, but in the context of the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal. We can't be frustrated with a novel written [NUM2] years ago just because it contains something offensive by today's standards.  While I think libraries, for the most part, shouldn't censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions to keep extremely harmful materials out. For example, libraries shouldn't have pornographic magazines or movies on their shelves. If a large majority of people want a particular material banned, it's hard to ignore their wishes. When a book is so vulgar that people start to protest, there are valid questions about whether it should remain on the library shelves. When a high percentage of people support the ban, the material should be removed.  Censoring or removing materials from libraries is a hot - topic today. I believe the current system does its job well and should continue. If only a few people dislike a particular material, the book usually remains uncensored on the shelves. When many people protest against a material, it is likely to be banned. This process ensures that not every book with a racial slur or a questionable scene is removed, while the truly offensive ones are. In conclusion, the current balance in the library's censorship and removal process is appropriate and should be maintained.
681	3658	2	2	Have you ever been in the library and pondered questions like who reads certain materials, why they are there, whether kids are engaging with them, or if kids check them out? Or perhaps you've thought or said things such as not wanting your kids to read a particular item, finding it offensive and against your morals, and feeling that the place seems strange and wanting to leave. Have you ever considered which books get banned from the library and who makes those decisions?  I believe that for materials to be removed from the shelves, they should be extremely offensive. Instead of removing them completely, they could be placed in a specific area of the library with an age restriction for borrowing. I don't think books with curse words are overly offensive because in the real world, people will inevitably encounter and learn these words. Whether they choose to use them is up to them.  For books to be banned or moved to a different category, they should be sexist, racist, contain excessive sexual content, or be extremely gruesome. These could be placed in the adult section upstairs, along with romantic and Western - themed materials. There should be a staircase near the circulation desk, and library staff should periodically check if there are young children in the adult area.  The top level or a designated area should be the adult section, housing materials with excessive sex, racism, sexism, or gruesome content, as well as adult magazines. It's similar to what you might see in a market aisle with revealing images. These items should be kept away from young children as they could be scarred by the content.  The main level should be for teen books, including vampire novels, superhero stories, and other fictional works, along with appropriate magazines and movies. The bottom level should be for children, with games, puppets, movies, and easy - to - read books.  I don't think just anyone should have the power to ban a book. There should be a large meeting involving the mayor, teachers from different levels, parents, and librarians. The person requesting the ban should explain their reasons. As Author Katherine Paterson said, if everyone has the right to remove a book, then there will be no books left for anyone.
682	3659	2	2	The topic of censorship in libraries raises the question of whether we should remove movies, magazines, and books from the shelves. There are various arguments surrounding this issue.  I firmly believe that if these materials are placed on the library shelves, they should be accessible to children and others. It is crucial for the youth to learn about all aspects of the world. If they don't gain this knowledge at a young age, they may never fully understand it as they grow older.  Some people claim that children are too young to engage with certain materials, but in my view, the earlier they are exposed to different ideas, the better equipped they will be to handle them in the future.  In conclusion, I think it is beneficial for children to start learning about diverse materials at a young age, as it helps them develop a broader understanding of the world.
683	3660	2	2	I am of the opinion that certain materials should not be removed just because a few individuals dislike the content of a book, movie, or music. If we were to listen to every person's request and remove the materials they don't like, there would be nothing left for others to enjoy.  For instance, if a man comes to the library and asks for a book about murder and violence to be removed, there might be another regular patron who enjoys reading such books. Another example is when a parent with children in the library wants a movie about gangs, drugs, and violence to be removed. Instead of trying to remove these popular materials, parents should discipline their children and teach them appropriate behavior. If a child is caught watching inappropriate movies, the parent should take action.  To prevent children from accessing inappropriate books and movies, the library could set up a special area where these materials are monitored. Many people enjoy movies and books with elements of drugs and violence, and these should not be removed based on the opinions of a few.  If someone doesn't like the language or images in a book or movie, they simply shouldn't engage with it. If they claim that their children access such materials without permission, it is the parents' responsibility to be more aware of their children's activities. Sometimes, offensive language in books and movies is used to depict real - world situations, aiming to make the content more realistic.  In conclusion, rather than removing materials due to the objections of a few, parents should take responsibility for their children's media consumption, and libraries should implement appropriate access controls.
684	3661	2	2	Censorship, the act of removing offensive materials from public access, is a controversial topic. Is it the right thing to do? Should society limit the variety of available materials? Should our current and future generations be deprived of experiencing and understanding what previous generations have? I firmly believe that censorship, in its extreme form, is wrong. However, I also think that materials that are offensive or inappropriate for certain age groups can and should be controlled.  Movie theaters, video stores, and television already use ratings and age - control mechanisms for their viewers. Although implementing such controls can be challenging and may not always be effective if not managed properly, libraries can adopt a similar system. For example, they could check identification before allowing patrons to borrow books with a certain rating, similar to how restaurants and bars verify age. Different sections of the library could be restricted to specific age groups.  Some may argue that this approach restricts the freedoms that libraries typically offer. However, the alternative is to expose children to violence and other inappropriate materials. It's similar to the situation in a movie theater, where age - appropriate content is controlled. Would you want your six - year - old daughter to pick up an adult movie with violence or sexual content, or a magazine with cursing? The library should not provide materials that parents would find objectionable for their children.  I believe the library should be a place of learning and freedom, but the learning should be age - appropriate. Our society is exposing young children to mature content too quickly, and the library should not contribute to this. School libraries usually don't stock inappropriate materials because they understand their audience. Public libraries should follow the same principle.  Media is everywhere, and it often exposes children to inappropriate content at a young age. However, this does not make it acceptable. We should not start children off with violence, sex, and inappropriate materials at a young age. I don't think we should remove these materials from libraries completely, as everyone has different opinions. But we do need to implement controls for the well - being of our children. In conclusion, while censorship is often overrated, the control of certain library materials is underrated and necessary.
685	3662	2	2	Everyone has a favorite book, and for some of us, once we start reading, we can't put it down. But then, the library may remove the book, claiming it's offensive to many readers. Why should so many people be deprived of a good read just because a few individuals are offended? We often try to accommodate everyone's wishes to avoid conflict, but is this the right approach? Many people quickly label a book as offensive and demand its removal, but they rarely explain why.  Everyone has the right to read what they choose. Libraries should not cave in to the demands of a minority regarding an allegedly “offensive” book. Who are we to decide what is suitable for everyone? Books are written to share the author's ideas, not to corrupt society. The excuse that a book could make a child rebel is baseless. Parents should teach their children to distinguish between right and wrong. If they use this excuse, it shows a lack of confidence in their children's ability or in their own parenting.  It's not just the readers who are affected; the authors are also deeply hurt. Imagine spending a year or two writing a great book, only to have it banned from multiple libraries. Authors have the right to write whatever they want, whether it's about dragons and princesses or scientific phenomena. No one should be able to stop the creation of great books or prevent people from reading them. If someone is offended by a book, they simply shouldn't read it.  Parents want to protect their children and raise them as good citizens of [LOCATION1]. However, over - controlling a child's life by preventing them from seeing, hearing, or reading anything “bad” is counterproductive. It will only lead to more rebellion as the child grows older. Parents should teach their children right from wrong and allow them to make choices about what they read or watch.  In conclusion, books, movies, and music are important sources of information and creativity. We should not remove them based on the objections of a few. Instead, parents should focus on teaching their children to make good choices, and people who are offended by certain materials should simply avoid them.
686	3663	2	2	I firmly believe there should be no censorship. Good books and music should not be removed simply because one person finds them offensive. People's opinions vary; what one person deems offensive, another may not. In my view, music is the most heavily censored. Fewer people are offended by books, but music censorship, in my opinion, is ruining it. Music is an artist's form of expression. If people don't want to listen to what artists are saying, they can simply choose not to. The same goes for books. A book is a writer's opinion and expression. It's like telling someone they can't voice their opinions on topics like racism or use curse words if they wish. We should respect the diversity of artistic and literary expression, and refrain from censorship based on individual sensitivities.
687	3664	2	2	To [Recipients]: I am writing to you today regarding censorship in libraries. Throughout my life, I have encountered several instances where a book or magazine might seem offensive to some, but not to others. However, I have my own perspective on this issue. I believe it is my duty to inform you that I think offensive books, magazines, etc., should be removed from library shelves. Everyone has grown up with different values and morals, and while they stand by their own beliefs, they also respect that others may have different views. In today's world, even the smallest things can trigger violence. Placing offensive books on public library shelves can easily lead to outbursts and debates among people with opposing opinions. Making such materials available to the public is likely to result in negative consequences. I suggest removing these offensive books. This will create a safe and pleasant environment for all library visitors and other public - place users. It will reduce arguments among adults and set a good example for children. Children often imitate their parents' behavior. If they see their parents reacting negatively to offensive books, it won't teach them how to act responsibly in similar situations. As a student, I aspire to grow up in a world where people are respectful, happy, and responsible, and where everyone gets along. Removing offensive books from shelves will, to some extent, contribute to the peaceful world I envision. Violence can stem from many sources, and offensive books should not be added to that list. Without these offensive materials, the environment for today's people will be much better.
688	3665	2	2	When someone finds a book offensive, should all similar books be removed from the shelves? No. Even if some people find certain content in books offensive, the books should not be removed. When I was in sixth grade, my teacher asked me to read and summarize 'A [Book Title]'. I searched the entire school library for the book and then had to ask for help. I learned that the privilege of reading the book in elementary schools had been revoked. Parents had found the book offensive after seeing what their children were reading, and after multiple complaints, the book was removed from the school library. To complete my teacher's assignment, I had to go to a public library to get the book. If you find a book offensive, keep your opinion to yourself and don't read it. Books shouldn't be removed just because of personal opinions. Many people love different types of books, regardless of whether they are considered offensive. I believe everyone has the right to read whatever they want. Books are meant to be read. If books are constantly removed, fewer books will be read. The more books are read and understood, the more books will be written and published. The same principle applies to music, movies, magazines, etc. They all serve a purpose and should be accessible. Reading, listening, and reviewing, even offensive materials, can teach us valuable lessons.
689	3666	2	2	When you go to the library, you'd expect it to be a family - friendly environment, right? I always think of libraries as places free from offensive material that could upset anyone. However, surprisingly, many libraries do have such content, and I don't think they should, especially since libraries are not just for adults. Children love going to the library to check out books and other things they enjoy. A five - year - old doesn't need to see movies, books, or any other materials that discriminate against a gender or a race. These offensive materials should not be on the shelves, regardless of what the writers say. If library owners or writers wouldn't let their own children read such materials, why should other children be exposed to them? I'm sure there are millions of people like me who wouldn't want their loved ones to come across and read these offensive things. The information young children see or hear at a young age will stay with them throughout their lives. We don't know how it will influence them as they grow up. Libraries are supposed to be family places where people can get information, not places where they are exposed to violence, drugs, racism, and other negative subjects. It's not just young kids who shouldn't read such corrupted materials; teenagers and adults are more likely to understand and take these subjects to heart. I'm pleading with library owners to remove these offensive materials from their branches. Not only are small children at risk of seeing them, but adults also don't need to read, listen to, or watch such things. If you wouldn't want your child to be exposed to them, why would anyone else?
690	3667	2	2	I think they should leave [the content] on the shelves. This issue isn't just limited to libraries; it also happens on television. Not everything in the library will offend everyone. Some people get offended when they see something against their religion, culture, or country, while others don't care about the same things. I say, if you visit the library and find something offensive, don't make a fuss. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean others won't. There's no point in wasting time trying to get it removed from the shelves when you might be the only one concerned. It doesn't make sense for people to throw a fit just because a certain material offended them. For example, there was a pastor on TV talking about how bad hell is, as some people don't think it will be that bad. A lady got offended and had him taken off TV. But she didn't have to watch him; she could have chosen to watch something else. As the author of a newspaper said, 'If I have the right to remove a book I abhor from the shelf, then you and everyone else have the same right.' So, if you want something removed from the shelf, think about the other people who actually want to use it, rather than just considering your own feelings.
691	3668	2	2	Libraries are highly beneficial for numerous reasons. If one needs to conduct research, meet with a tutor, find an engaging book to read, locate a particular song, or select a movie to rent for the evening, a library is the ideal place to go. However, libraries do have limitations regarding what they offer and what patrons can access. Censorship in libraries is a topic that surfaces periodically, and people often debate whether it is a positive or negative practice.  Personally, I believe that censorship can be quite inconvenient for some. For instance, when I was in ninth grade, I was assigned to write a research paper on @ORGANIZATION1. This proved to be a challenging task as the libraries I visited had few books or resources on the topic because it was considered 'inappropriate' or 'offensive'. Moreover, the librarians refused to let me check out some of the books due to my age. They thought I was too young to read that information, thus hindering my research.  I think that if something is happening in the world, it should be accessible to the public. If individuals do not wish to encounter certain topics, they should take the initiative to avoid them rather than having the content removed entirely. The same principle applies to all forms of media. If you dislike a TV show, simply don't watch it. If you don't like a song, don't listen to it. It's that straightforward, and I do this all the time. People need to understand their own limits and apply this awareness to their daily lives.  When it comes to children, it is the responsibility of their guardians to determine what is appropriate for them to see and hear. Guardians should establish clear rules and ensure that their children understand them.  In conclusion, the primary purpose of a library is to provide information. Any information. People visit libraries to find the information they need from the wide range of materials available. Libraries should not feel obligated to censor items that might be offensive. Their job is simply to offer information.
692	3669	2	2	I firmly believe that books should not be censored from library shelves. Katherine is right in many aspects. If everyone removed the books they disliked, there would be no books left, and the world would lose a vast amount of valuable information. I am writing this to explain my stance against book censorship.  Books should not be removed just because they are offensive to some people. Sometimes, such books can help individuals recognize their mistakes. For example, a book that glorifies the way white men and women treated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 men and women could make racist readers realize the error of their ways. Music is a form of free speech. Some artists see themselves as 'liberators', 'idols', or 'love spreaders'. While there are songs that may seem offensive, we can't judge their potential without giving them a chance. Take the song '@CAPS4' by @CAPS5 @CAPS6. Catholic churches are outraged, assuming that the artist is disrespecting @CAPS8. In reality, the song has a different message.  People learn important life lessons from things and situations that are shunned by society, and this may always be the case. We can't predict the future, but we can change our actions in the present to create a better future.
693	3670	2	2	I believe libraries are places where people should have access to the books they want. There should be no restrictions on reading. I firmly oppose the practice of removing books from library shelves.  Libraries are supposed to be a source of knowledge and a place where people can freely explore different ideas. Everyone has the right to read whatever they choose. We should not limit people's access to information just because some might find certain books offensive.  For example, a book that might seem offensive to some could actually be an eye - opener for others. It could help them see the world from a different perspective and understand the mistakes of the past.  In conclusion, libraries should not censor books. Their role is to provide a wide range of reading materials so that people can expand their knowledge and understanding.
694	3671	2	2	I don't think books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves just because they are considered offensive. All one has to do is ignore them or not pay attention, and they won't cause much trouble.  Many people find certain things interesting, like recent news stories published in newspapers or on the internet. For example, the @LOCATION1 story that has been in the news for the past week. Some people think it's great that @LOCATION1 was finally found and killed. Those who find it offensive might just be unaware of what @LOCATION1 did.  If offensive materials were removed, there would be little interesting content to read. If someone finds a racist movie, they can simply put it back and choose a romance or comedy instead. Everyone could use a laugh now and then. When it comes to music, if a friend recommends something, check it on the internet first. If it's offensive, tell your friend, and a true friend will understand.  Magazines usually don't have much offensive content. They mainly contain pictures, gossip, facts, and stories that might catch your interest. Books might have some offensive elements, but if you like a book, you might as well finish it. Check it online to see what it's about before making a decision. I've read many books and haven't found any offensive ones.  Newspapers are interesting to read and rarely have offensive remarks. Some might touch on sensitive topics related to certain ethnic groups, but I haven't encountered such cases yet. There might be some comics or gags in newspapers that could be more offensive, but if you find something offensive, just ignore it instead of getting angry.  In conclusion, when we come across offensive content in various media, we should take the initiative to deal with it ourselves rather than demanding its removal.
695	3672	2	2	These days, people find many things offensive in various places such as magazines, books, movies, cell phones, the internet, and even in some song lyrics. Some individuals believe that they should be able to remove these offensive materials from the shelves.  A major concern for parents is the possibility of their children accessing such content. They worry that it might ruin their children's childhood. However, if parents don't want their young children to be exposed to certain things, they should avoid taking them to places where such content is available. In case children do come across it, parents should sit down with them and explain why it's inappropriate.  If everyone removed the things they found inappropriate, there would be nothing left to read, listen to, or watch. What one person finds funny can be extremely offensive to another. For example, @PERSON1 might enjoy something that @PERSON2 finds highly offensive. This would lead to numerous arguments within communities.  Another reason why removing offensive content is not a good idea is that it would give kids the wrong impression of the world. The world is harsh, and kids learn a lot about this through the media. As long as there are positive role models to explain to kids that some media content is wrong and they should not participate in such behavior, there is no need to remove it.  If people were allowed to remove offensive content, communities would experience more crime due to anger, there would be no content left to consume, and kids would grow up confused about what to expect from the media. So, I ask you, what's your opinion on this matter?
696	3673	2	2	In my opinion, if materials like books are offensive to a reader, the reader should simply leave the book alone. This is because other readers may still want to read it. The same goes for music, movies, magazines, or anything else. Just because you find something offensive, it's not right to deprive thousands of other people of it. Also, if something is offensive to more than one person, it shouldn't be immediately removed. Instead, we as a society should step up, hold a vote, or discuss the problem. It wouldn't be fair to us or the rest of the world. Consider the amount of work the author put into the creation. I've never written a book, but I know it's not an easy task. For instance, one time my family and I wanted to go out for dinner, but we couldn't decide where to go. Everyone was thinking about pizza, but my big brother didn't want to, so we didn't go out that night because of one person's preference. That's not fair, is it? So, in conclusion, I don't think it's right to remove something just because someone finds it offensive. We have to consider the rest of the world because it wouldn't be fair to the rest of us.
697	3674	2	2	Libraries should contain a wide variety of materials, even if some individuals find certain materials offensive. Just because someone deems a material offensive, should we ignore the subject entirely? Some subjects can be uncomfortable to discuss, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should avoid them. One such subject is sexually transmitted diseases. In libraries, you often see people strolling through the aisles, occasionally opening a book to check its contents. However, when they reach the section on sexually transmitted diseases, they usually walk past, too uncomfortable to be seen in that area. It's not a topic people typically read for pleasure, but everyone should be informed about it. There are numerous similar subjects that people should be aware of, even if they think it doesn't affect them. Another reason to keep all books in the library is to learn about history. Some historical events can be gruesome and astonishing, but we should be aware of them and not forget. Take the Holocaust as an example. It was a very dark period in history. Over six million people died because one person disliked their beliefs. It can be difficult to read about, but we should be aware of what happened in the past, no matter how depressing it is. Being informed can prevent similar events from occurring in the future. People's musical preferences vary widely. There are numerous types and styles of music. Some music may be offensive to certain individuals, but does that mean we should remove it from the library? Libraries should always offer a large selection of different music. Many people want to expand their musical knowledge, and the library is an ideal place to do so. Everyone is unique, and we don't all like the same things. Removing materials from the library to avoid a subject won't stop people from obtaining that information. If people can't find the information they need in the library, they'll likely find other ways to get it. A diverse collection of books, music, movies, and magazines is what makes a library a place for learning new things, regardless of the subject.
698	3675	2	2	You and your friend are watching a movie on TV that you've both seen in theaters. You both love the movie, but just as it approaches the best part, the TV skips over it because some people consider that scene inappropriate. Censorship has its merits, but it can be overly strict when it comes to movies, music, and books. Many popular movies end up on TV for viewers' entertainment. However, some movies have scenes that are slightly inappropriate. Even if they're not highly offensive, TV companies will cut those scenes out. Moreover, if there's bad language in the movie, they'll remove the offensive word and replace it with one that doesn't fit the context of the movie. Censorship often ruins the movies that most people enjoy. TV companies even censor historical movies. Historical movies shouldn't be censored because it distorts the true story. Music is also frequently censored. When there's a bad word in a song, it's either skipped over or bleeped out, making the song sound odd. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to them. I don't think music should be censored just for the sake of young children. If parents don't want their kids to hear certain words, they should prevent them from listening to that kind of music. Books are often censored and even banned in schools. Fewer children read books these days, so if they do decide to read, we should let them choose what they want because reading benefits the mind. Some schools ban books due to inappropriate language. This is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of the language. Additionally, some books are censored because they're too detailed in certain scenes related to sex and crime. Some books are simply too good to be banned. In this world, a lot of things are censored. We do need censorship, but it shouldn't be so strict when it comes to movies, music, and books.
699	3676	2	2	Libraries are meant to house a wide range of materials across different genres and types. Many people visit libraries with a specific purpose in mind, rather than just browsing. Although some materials that people need for research may be considered inappropriate for certain audiences, they still serve as valuable resources for others. This could include gathering information for a research paper, renting a movie for school, or finding a particular book to read. Removing certain books, music, movies, or magazines from library shelves limits the borrowing options for people. In many schools, students are required to write research papers. The topics considered valid for high - school research papers may include information that isn't suitable for everyone. For example, a student might choose to write a research paper on the effects of a certain drug on an individual. Just because a student selects this topic doesn't mean they support it. Some adults may argue that information on drugs shouldn't be available in libraries because it may contain graphic material. However, students view this material as a resource for educational purposes. During my freshman year, we read [Book 1] and [Book 2]. We also watched the movie adaptation to better understand the differences between our time and the story's setting. The movie contains death, violence, and a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work, in its movie form, inappropriate. However, the movie helped us visualize how things were in the past. We were mature enough to look beyond the graphic scenes and appreciate the movie for what it was. If this movie were removed from the library shelves, some people wouldn't fully understand the story because they couldn't form a mental picture. Sometimes, all we want is a good book to read. Many teenagers are drawn to the young - adult section because it contains age - appropriate material. Some books in this section may have dark or graphic themes with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we censor and remove these books, we'll end up with even fewer teenage readers. Certain books offer an escape for some teens and may even help them deal with problems in their own lives. If libraries start censoring books, the number of readers will likely decline over the years. Instead of censoring books, we should focus on censoring the readers. If parents don't want their younger children to read about certain topics, they should keep them away from that material. Libraries can mark books with age - appropriate labels to restrict access to certain age groups. Authors shouldn't be penalized for their choice of topics by having their books removed from libraries. No matter what a person's reading purpose is, they should have the right to choose the type of material they read.
700	3677	2	2	Libraries hold thousands of books, some of which may be considered inappropriate and some not. Libraries are places for learning, whether it's for pleasure reading, checking the newsletter, or seeking random information. We turn to libraries to learn about historical events, animals, and various other subjects. All books in a library have a purpose; they help us learn about the past, make us more intelligent, and contribute to our growth. I firmly believe that all library books have a purpose. They may be offensive, but they teach us a great deal. For example, there are books about the Holocaust. For some, this is a sensitive topic, and they may take offense. However, if we didn't have these books, we might repeat the mistakes of the past. Books can teach us more about history than any other source in the world. I also think that all books, whether fiction or non - fiction, have a purpose. You might wonder how fiction books have a purpose. Well, fiction books stimulate our imagination. Many of them make us realize that the struggles of fictional characters can mirror those of real - life people. Most importantly, fiction books attract both our attention and that of our children. They are often the first books children learn to read, laying the foundation for their reading skills. My final reason for not supporting the removal of 'offensive' books from library shelves is that all books make us more intelligent. We gain a wealth of information from various types of books. For instance, medical books might be considered 'offensive' by some, but without them, we wouldn't have well - informed doctors. Another reason is that if we remove books that aren't suitable for everyone, someone who wants to learn something new might be unable to do so because the topic could be offensive to others. In essence, we'd be telling that person they can't learn because of others' sensitivities. Every person has a different view on what is offensive. But why should we remove books, magazines, movies, etc. from shelves just because we don't like them? Everyone has different tastes, and we'll never agree on everything. Removing books from shelves is unfair to everyone. Yes, some books may not be suitable for everyone, but when we don't like something, we usually move on to something we do like. So, we should do the same with books.
701	3678	2	2	I firmly oppose the removal of certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, from the shelves if they are deemed offensive. Firstly, if one encounters offensive content while reading, listening, or watching, they can simply skip that part. If something truly offends an individual, there is no need to continue engaging with it. The onus of being offended lies with the person consuming the material.  In recent times, it's rare for people to deliberately write offensive content. As @CAPS1 states, some suggest getting rid of anything that offends. However, I am writing to put an end to such actions that ruin others' enjoyment. If one decides to take away the pleasure of reading, watching, or listening to these materials, they should consider what they are depriving those who enjoy them. Removing entertaining books would leave the shelves bare for everyone.  I have previously written in the newspaper advocating for leaving these materials alone. Taking away the simple things people like to read means taking away from those who engage with them. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of preferences and not let a few offended individuals dictate what others can access.
702	3679	2	2	I'd like to begin by stating that I don't think libraries should remove books just because they are offensive. For example, in schools, we watch movies depicting the era when @LOCATION1 had slaves. While I personally don't find it fair to show such movies in school, a book that merely describes the situation without showing explicit content is even less harmful. Movies can present more detailed and potentially offensive imagery compared to books, so I believe books should remain on the shelves.  We shouldn't try to silence an author just because we don't like what they've written. There might be deeper meaning in the book that we can't immediately perceive. We should keep an open mind and not judge a book by its cover.  Just because someone hates a book doesn't mean it should be removed. There could be others who love it. In life, we encounter many things we don't like, but we shouldn't try to change everything. For instance, if a musician in a band says something offensive, we can't stop selling their CDs just because some people are offended. Similarly, if we see an offensive book in a bookstore, we should simply look away instead of trying to get it banned.  Since I don't read many books, I can't say for sure how I'd react if I found one offensive. But even so, I'd just put the book down and not touch it again. In conclusion, libraries should not remove books based on the sensitivities of a few individuals.
703	3680	2	2	I will discuss whether books, music, or magazines should be removed from libraries if they are considered offensive. In my view, these materials should not be removed from the shelves just because they might offend some people. After all, people have diverse interests.  Items in the library should not be removed simply because some individuals are offended by them. For example, an explicit @CAPS1 might be appealing to some people who would buy it, while others who are offended would want it off the shelves.  Take a book as another example. If a person is offended by what they read, they may return the book and not recommend it. However, another person might pick up the same book and enjoy it, even recommending it to a friend. The same goes for magazines. If someone is offended by an advertisement, it doesn't mean the magazine should stop being sold.  In conclusion, library items should not stop being available just because one person is offended. People should think twice before engaging with content that might upset them.
704	3681	2	2	"Books and magazines are valuable sources of information. We read them to learn about the past, present, and future. They are created so that people can read and relax during their free time.  In life, we encounter both good and bad things in books and magazines. If parents don't want their children to read certain materials, they can restrict their reading. But as children grow older, they will inevitably learn about the real world. Schools play a significant role in children's learning, with history classes teaching about slavery and other unpleasant aspects of the past. Although children may get in trouble for talking about these topics outside the classroom, history classes are still beneficial as they teach about wars, invasions, and help with map - reading skills.  Removing books and magazines from the shelves is unjust. Authors spend a lot of time and effort creating these materials, and they are published for the public to access. If someone writes something that some consider ""bad,"" there's no real harm in it. In conclusion, we should not deprive others of the opportunity to read and learn from these materials."
705	3682	2	2	For as long as people can recall, books have been banned for various reasons, whether during times of war or due to religious restrictions. This has always been seen as a negative practice, and it should remain so today. Books, movies, music, and magazines should not be removed from library shelves based on someone else's opinion. People have the right to access the information these materials offer, and censorship in public libraries is unacceptable.  Some may argue that certain materials are offensive to specific groups. However, it's impossible to judge how others feel. Authors write to express their feelings and knowledge, exercising their freedom of speech. The public is responsible for how they use the information they receive. These materials are also a part of history, recorded for a reason.  Religion is often a contentious issue in censorship. But freedom of religion, as enshrined in the constitution, allows for different interpretations and studies. People have the right to access religious books, music, and cultural expressions.  There are rare cases where age - based restrictions may be necessary. This doesn't censor the public but gives parents the power to control what their children can access. For example, sexual content, vulgar images, or disturbing content unsuitable for children can have age limits. This way, information is never completely censored.  It's wrong to restrict what people can know. Our country is built on the principle of free information sharing. Censorship of these materials is not and will never be the solution. While age restrictions can be a reasonable measure for younger citizens, the public should always have access to information. Whether it's called book - banning or censorship, it's a negative practice that has no place in public library systems.
706	3683	2	2	The question of whether there should be censorship in libraries is a contentious one, with people holding varying views. In my opinion, there should not be censorship for several reasons. Firstly, individuals have their own preferences, and they should have the freedom to access the books they desire. Secondly, libraries should have the autonomy to curate their collections and place whatever books they choose on the shelves. Thirdly, if someone does not like the content of a book, they simply have the option not to borrow it.  Libraries offer a wide range of books, allowing patrons to select the ones they wish to check out. Censorship would restrict people from getting the books they want, which could lead to dissatisfaction. Everyone has different tastes in books and music, and there are various genres available, some of which may contain stronger language. Just as some people prefer uncensored music, they should be able to access it. It is the libraries and entertainment stores that purchase books and music, not the consumers.  Libraries have the freedom to acquire and display the books they want. If one dislikes the content of certain books or music, they can choose something else. There is no rule dictating that one must select a particular type of music. For example, the rap genre may contain strong language, but it is an individual's choice whether to listen to it. Stores put products on the shelves to make a profit, not to cause offense. Shelves are often labeled to indicate the genre, which can help people identify uncensored sections and avoid them if they find the content offensive.  In conclusion, libraries should not be required to censor their books, and entertainment stores should not need to censor all music and movies. It is up to the individual to make choices, and people can avoid the areas they find offensive. Everyone should have the right to obtain what they want, even if it may offend others.
707	3684	2	2	Have you ever watched a movie with scenes you didn't want your kids to see? When this issue keeps arising, what should you do? Do you tell your kids to close their eyes and cover their ears? Well, I truly believe this shouldn't happen to you.  As a parent or adult, you should be warned about certain behaviors in movies that you don't want your child to watch, even when you're present. It's simply unacceptable. Therefore, I think there should be an additional warning indicating that inappropriate behaviors are shown in movies. Parents should know whether the content their kids are about to watch is suitable for their age.  To sum it up, there should be some kind of label on movies, as well as on items like books and magazines, indicating that there might be content that parents find inappropriate for their children to watch or read. If the producers of these products do this, it will be much easier for parents to make the right decisions for their kids.
708	3685	2	2	In my view, a library should be dedicated to books because that's its primary purpose. If we start adding movies to libraries, then the purpose of having books in libraries becomes unclear. I believe it should be one or the other. If movies were in libraries, I think people would borrow more movies than books. And if we also added music to libraries, it would further change the nature of the library. I do consider magazines to be a form of book.  Movies should remain in movie stores or at movie theaters, not in libraries. Music should be available on the radio or in music stores, not in libraries. If movies and music were introduced into libraries, people would lose interest in books. I'm against the idea of incorporating technology into libraries.  If music and movies were available in libraries, there would be no need for books, and people would stop buying them. Books are the oldest and most accurate way to express oneself or tell a story. However, now people seem to prefer movies or music.  In conclusion, libraries should focus on books and avoid adding movies and music. This way, the essence of libraries as a place for book - related activities can be maintained, and the importance of books in our culture can be preserved.
709	3686	2	2	Today, I'm going to discuss the topic of censorship. Do you think censorship is a good or a bad thing? I'll list several reasons why I think it's both bad and good.  First, let's talk about why it's bad. Censorship can easily offend people. While some people can tolerate a lot of offensive content, many others cannot. In my opinion, it's okay to have some content that offends people because that's how many people find humor. For example, political cartoons often make fun of politicians and other public figures, but we rarely see them complaining. If you don't like such content, simply don't read it, and it won't bother you.  On the other hand, I understand how some people can be offended. Some content in books and movies can be very mean. I think there should be a line between what is acceptable and what goes too far. Most people can handle it, but some cannot. For instance, there is a significant amount of [content related to @CAPS2] in [@LOCATION1], especially in this time period. It seems to be everywhere.  In conclusion, people need to come together and establish a boundary. Some of the existing content that crosses the line should be removed from the shelves, but not everything. This way, we can balance the freedom of expression and the need to avoid excessive offense.
710	3687	2	2	Books, movies, magazines, music, and life in general – we all know the difference between right and wrong.  Schools vary in their approach to books. Some schools set limits based on age. For example, it would be inappropriate for a two - year - old to read a book like the ones by @PERSON1, and a sixteen - year - old reading a @PERSON2 book would also be inappropriate for their age. You wouldn't expect a forty - three - year - old person on the streets to read '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1' by @PERSON2. They would likely choose a mystery book or something suitable for their age, not for a five - year - old. Books shouldn't be banned just because an elementary school mother doesn't want her seven - year - old to read '@CAPS4'. Parents should be more vigilant about what their kids are reading instead of having books banned for all children.  Music is an important part of life. Not everyone has to listen to rap or opera. There are many musicians who depend on music. Rap shouldn't be banned just because it may talk about killing, drugs, and drinking. If you don't like it, simply don't listen. I love all kinds of music, and in my opinion, nothing should be banned. Even though I personally dislike Christian songs because I find them too slow and overly focused on @CAPS5, I wouldn't want to ruin it for others. Everyone has different musical tastes, and music helps us get through life, so it shouldn't be restricted.  Movies and video games are popular forms of entertainment. We all enjoy watching movies together, but not all movies are suitable for everyone. Movies and video games have ratings. These ratings show what is appropriate for different age groups. For example, adults might play rated @CAPS6 games and watch rated @CAPS7 movies, while six - year - olds would play rated @CAPS8 games and watch rated @CAPS9 movies. Rated @CAPS7 movies often contain gore, sexual themes, and strong language, which are inappropriate for kids. However, they shouldn't be banned; instead, they can be blocked at home.  In my opinion, movies, books, music, video games, etc., shouldn't be banned. Instead, we should carefully monitor who has access to this content. We should be responsible enough to ensure that the material reaches the appropriate hands and eyes. As long as we are vigilant, there's no need to ban these forms of entertainment.
711	3688	2	2	Censorship in libraries presents a complex issue with both positive and negative aspects. Is it truly a significant problem for children to encounter inappropriate content in books? And will authors withdraw their works from libraries? In reality, library censorship is not as necessary as most people assume. Nowadays, children are well - informed and intelligent about various subjects. While it's understandable that parents don't want their children exposed to books about drugs, [@CAPS1], sex, etc., children will inevitably learn about these things in life. They might as well start learning earlier. Moreover, young children are often not interested in such books. If all libraries censor books, some students working on projects that require these materials will face difficulties. For example, if I need a book on [@CAPS1] for a project in my [@CAPS2] class, and the books are censored, I'll have no sources for information. On the other hand, it's easy to understand why adults advocate for book censorship. No parent wants their child coming home discussing sex or drugs they read about in a school book. If I were a parent, I'd be concerned too. However, if adults are so bothered by this, what will they do when their children are exposed to even worse content on TV, like condom commercials or drug - related advertisements? At least books can educate children about the dangers of drugs. If one author removes their book from the library because they don't want children to read it, it might set a precedent for other authors to do the same. This could result in empty library shelves. Books are essential for learning. All books, regardless of their explicitness, should be kept in libraries. Parents who don't want their children to read certain books should have a conversation with them. It's true that some people pick up such books and make jokes, but that's just immaturity, which is common among children. These books, no matter how controversial, are informational and crucial for learning.
712	3689	2	2	I firmly believe that books, music, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves if they are considered offensive. Books are beneficial in multiple ways. They expand one's knowledge, enabling a better understanding of the world. They also enhance vocabulary and improve focus. When reading, if one doesn't understand a passage, they'll look deeper to comprehend the words, which leads to greater learning than expected. Music is also highly valuable. After a long and stressful day at work, school, or elsewhere, music can soothe the mind. It stimulates creativity, inspiring people to dance, sing, or paint. When I'm tired after a long day, I like to go home, lie down, and listen to music to feel relaxed. Magazines offer a wealth of information. Suppose you're looking for a recipe without access to a computer. You can find recipes in magazines, along with details about their effectiveness and the author. Magazines also allow you to order various items, such as shoes, clothes, and household goods. I often use magazines to order shoes or compare prices. In conclusion, books, music, and magazines are extremely helpful. Books are useful for essays, music relaxes us after a long day, and magazines provide information on various topics. When you have questions or concerns, you can visit your local library, borrow a book, read a magazine, or listen to music. All these resources offer free information that we should take advantage of.
713	3690	2	2	There are individuals who are easily offended by different things. In my opinion, having books that some people dislike is a positive aspect of our world. It shows whether people are concerned about what others write or say and whether they are engaged with the world. However, when creating movies or writing articles in newspapers, some people go too far with their content. I believe there should be a limit to what can be written in a book, and it should be determined by the author's best judgment. Some people complain about everything because they know the truth being spoken is accurate, and they don't want others to know about their past, especially if it's tragic. If someone communicates with them, they might not get as angry about the truth being made public. In conclusion, this is my view on people getting angry at others for speaking the truth. I believe in the freedom of speech in our country, but we should also be aware of the boundaries in expressing ourselves.
714	3691	2	2	At first glance, censorship might seem like a good idea as it allows parents to indirectly monitor their children. However, library censorship could potentially lead to the removal of every book from library shelves worldwide. There are several flaws in this concept. It causes disputes due to differences in opinions and can deeply offend authors. Censorship is a disgrace and should not be imposed in libraries. People have different standards for what is offensive. For instance, a 50 - year - old [@CAPS1] female might find a violent book with curse words and sexual content offensive, while a 21 - year - old carefree male might enjoy it. This difference in opinion poses a significant challenge to library censorship. Removing books that some audiences would enjoy is unfair. Rather than completely banning books, libraries could categorize them. Offensive books could be placed in a separate section, which could be as simple as a separate shelf or as elaborate as a curtained - off room. In any case, discarding books based on their content is a bad idea. Censorship can also cause financial losses for authors. They spend countless hours and a great deal of effort writing books, and some take years to perfect their works. Magazines and movies also require a large investment of time and money. If their products are removed from the shelves, it's offensive to them and could lead to a decrease in sales and revenue. This is simply unfair. Librarians have the right to choose what to display. Forcing them to remove materials they consider appropriate is absurd. In my opinion, censorship is a terrible idea. If anything should be banned from libraries, it's censorship itself.
715	3692	2	2	We've all seen people espousing odd theories. Everyone has different beliefs, and it's okay to have these differences. However, it doesn't mean we shouldn't try to understand others. I believe that library censorship is important, but people also need to be more understanding, less stubborn, and more open - minded to get along better. Libraries contain a variety of materials, and some are more censored than others. Often, books and magazines are censored because they present strong ideas and theories. People have the right to free speech and should be able to share their beliefs, but they must ensure that their expression doesn't harm others. Explicit movies and music are often lacking in understanding. Although they have rating systems, they can still be insensitive to others. Many people misinterpret the ideas of others because they struggle to see things from different perspectives, which can lead to conflicts. If people were more understanding, these conflicts would be less common. By considering different perspectives, people can become more knowledgeable about various opinions. Some individuals are just stubborn. They only believe their own ideas and refuse to listen to others. Stubbornness is the opposite of seeking understanding. If people were less stubborn, they could see more viewpoints and better understand how others feel. Stubbornness makes it difficult for people to interact and get along. In conclusion, while censorship is important, the reasons behind it are equally significant. If people were more understanding, we could censor content that truly bothers others and be more lenient with those trying to spread ideas. By seeking understanding, looking at different perspectives, and being less stubborn, people would get along much better.
716	3693	2	2	I recognize that some individuals may be offended by certain content they watch or read. However, this does not justify preventing others from accessing such information simply because one person finds it objectionable. The determination of what is offensive is often a matter of personal opinion. I have never encountered content that was entirely inappropriate. Most movies and music albums come with ratings, indicating the appropriate audience. If a movie contains offensive elements, the rating will note the presence of rude language or other such content. Therefore, if someone fails to notice these warnings and is offended, it should not result in others being denied access to the movie. Personally, I do not consider books to be the most engaging medium, but I acknowledge that some books or magazines may contain offensive material, though it is not always extreme. If someone deems a book inappropriate for certain readers, they can inform the library staff, who can restrict access based on the content. Removing a book from the shelf due to the objections of one or two individuals is unnecessary. In my view, movies, books, magazines, and other media should not be removed from the shelves. This is because the majority of these items have been rated or approved for public sale. People can read the product details to determine if the content will offend them before making a purchase. If a new CD or movie I want to see or listen to is removed from the shelves due to complaints, I would be disappointed, as it may not offend me at all. In conclusion, I firmly oppose the idea of halting the sale of movies, books, or music simply because a few people are offended by their content.
717	3694	2	2	I firmly believe that materials such as books, music, and movies should not be removed from the library if they are considered offensive. The library is divided into different sections to cater to various age groups. The young adult or teen section offers books and music typically enjoyed by teenagers. For instance, it may include the Twilight soundtrack, which contains no explicit language. Teens visiting the library appreciate the selection of materials available to them, and there is nothing offensive in this section that warrants removal. The children's section, also known as the easy or picture book section, is designed for younger children, including those not yet in school or in the early grades. The books, music, and movies in this section feature cartoons and animals, which are appealing to children. Examples of movies in this section include Strawberry Shortcake, Arthur, and Lilo and Stitch. Everything in this section is suitable for children, and neither children nor parents should find anything offensive. The library also has a section for adults. The adult section is distinct from the teen and children's sections and is located at the opposite end of the library. Adults who find something offensive have the right to speak with library staff. However, most adults do not have issues with the items in this section, as it contains materials that adults are interested in and would not appeal to young children. The library's division into different sections makes it easy for children and adults to find appropriate materials. While I have only mentioned a few sections, every age group has a dedicated area in the library. If something is considered offensive, it may simply be in the wrong section. The library takes great care in censoring its materials. In conclusion, offensive materials should not be removed from the library, as they can be appropriately placed in the correct sections to ensure that each age group has access to suitable content.
718	3695	2	2	"When people think of libraries, they often envision a cold, quiet place with an old woman shushing them or a room filled with books. However, modern libraries have evolved to offer a wide range of materials, including music, movies, and magazines. When I was young, I didn't like libraries because I found them boring. As a result, I wasn't a good reader until I discovered the library's cool features in the sixth grade. Libraries now provide various activities, such as looking up books, checking out music and movies, and even borrowing magazines. Some people dislike the new additions to libraries, such as music and movies, because they are accustomed to the traditional quiet environment and are not used to seeing kids and teens in large numbers. Those who visit the library regularly may take offense to these changes. This situation reminds me of the book ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" which was considered offensive because it depicted how African Americans were treated in the past. In the book, a young girl helps to resolve the differences and understand what is right and wrong. Similarly, instead of banning or removing new materials from the library, we should engage in discussions to reach an agreement on how to incorporate these new ideas. We could create a separate section for these new materials to avoid offending library patrons. In conclusion, by having open discussions and creating dedicated sections, we can ensure that libraries continue to evolve and provide diverse materials while respecting the preferences of all users."
719	3696	2	2	"In today's world, people are often restricted from accessing certain things, whether it is to protect their safety, purity, or happiness. Just as criminals are imprisoned to keep them away from society, libraries are increasingly removing books with questionable content. However, I strongly oppose this practice. Books are a valuable source of knowledge and allow people to experience things they may not encounter in real life. Individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read, and if a book offends them, they can decide to stop reading it. I have personally learned valuable lessons from books that may not have been age-appropriate. For example, when I was ten years old, I read a book about a teenage girl who engaged in sexual relations, became pregnant, and had her life ruined. This experience taught me the importance of abstaining from adult relationships until marriage. Libraries should be organized into different categories, such as children's, young adult, adult, and ""Read at Your Own Risk"" sections. The same categorization should apply to magazines and music. This way, people can visit a specific section and know what to expect. Similar to movie ratings, which help parents determine if a movie is suitable for their children, library categorization can provide guidance to readers. For instance, a mother can pick up a movie rated PG and know that it is generally acceptable for her nine-year-old, with perhaps a few curse words that children may hear in their daily lives. In conclusion, I firmly believe that literature should not be censored. Instead, it should be categorized to help people make informed decisions about what they read. Everyone has the right to choose their own reading material, and valuable lessons can be learned from all types of books, depending on how they are interpreted."
720	3697	2	2	I am of the opinion that certain materials should not be removed from circulation simply because they are considered offensive. The world is filled with both positive and negative aspects, and it is crucial for children to learn about and understand the realities of life, regardless of whether they are good or bad. It is inevitable that children will encounter these things at some point, so it is better for them to learn about them at a young age when they can receive guidance from adults. However, there should be age limits in place to ensure that children are not exposed to overly explicit or inappropriate content. Children need to be aware that there are bad people in the world and that they should take precautions to protect themselves. For example, if children are not taught about the dangers around them, they may be more likely to put themselves in harm's way. When I was a child, I was taught to interact with people from different races and religions and to distinguish between good and bad choices. This early education helped me avoid many difficult situations later in life. On the other hand, it is also important to teach children the difference between reality and fiction. For instance, when purchasing a video game for a child, parents should explain that the actions depicted in the game are not appropriate in the real world. This lack of understanding between reality and fiction is one of the reasons why some children today have difficulty controlling their behavior. In today's media, there is a lot of pressure on people, especially children, to act in a certain way to gain attention. The media often publicizes sexual and inappropriate content that is not suitable for children, but it is important for them to be aware that these things exist and that they are not acceptable. Magazines also distort the bodies of famous people, which can make children feel inadequate. Children should be taught that not everything they see, hear, or read in the media is true or right. They need to learn to think critically and make rational decisions on their own. Peer pressure is another factor that can influence children's behavior. Children may be pressured by their friends to do things that they know are wrong. In these situations, it is important for children to have the self-control to say no and to make the right choices. In conclusion, children who are exposed to offensive materials should understand the meaning behind them and learn how to handle these situations appropriately. They should also be taught to distinguish between right and wrong and to make independent decisions. By providing children with the necessary knowledge and skills, we can help them grow into responsible adults who are able to navigate the challenges of the world.
721	3698	2	2	In my view, censorship is not a good approach. I firmly believe that there should be no form of censorship for books, music, and movies. When it comes to children, it is the parents' responsibility to decide what their children should read, watch, or listen to. Removing books, movies, and music from the shelves is unfair to those who wish to access them, as well as to the authors, directors, and musicians. People should have the freedom to express themselves through writing. Readers may not agree with or enjoy what the author says, but the author has the right to say it. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of expression and let parents take charge of guiding their children's media consumption.
722	3699	2	2	Katherine Paterson once stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. While I understand her point, I do not fully concur. I am of the opinion that in many cases, things like books, music, magazines, etc., should be subject to censorship. One reason for this is the influence on minors. Children tend to imitate what they see, such as adult trends on TV. Not all adult - related content is suitable for young eyes, so the content broadcast should be censored as children are affected by what they see, read, and listen to. Another reason is the explicit content in today's movies, books, magazines, and music. Violence is a prevalent topic in newspapers, with front - page stories often about wars and hostility. Disrespectful acts, cussing, and rude gestures are not conducive to creating a positive environment. Since libraries are public, we must be cautious about what is available on their shelves. Censoring is the right thing to do. If we don't censor, where will it lead? We don't want our society to be negatively influenced by profanity, violent slogans, or jargon. We should strive for respect and courtesy and avoid promoting inappropriate materials in public libraries. In conclusion, it is clear that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should have some form of censorship.
723	3700	2	2	Regarding censorship, if someone dislikes the content of a book, magazine, movie, etc., they should simply put it back and not make a fuss. However, there are people who overreact to such things, and in my opinion, most of them are immature. Implementing censorship in libraries would deprive people of historical readings. Many old plays are sexual and offensive to some, but there is no way to completely avoid inappropriate materials. There are also those who are interested in studying such subjects, and removing relevant books from the shelves would upset them as they would lose research materials. Today's music often contains inappropriate words and sayings that offend most people. Teens and young adults like this kind of music for its beat rather than the lyrics. Older people generally hate it and want it banned. But they don't realize that removing it from libraries would cause more dissatisfaction. Magazines and movies today are full of inappropriate advertisements and pictures, yet this is what most people like. In short, it's difficult to remove anything from a library because it will upset a large number of people. Removing materials would likely reduce library visitors as the things they are interested in would no longer be available. So, taking offensive books, magazines, movies, music, etc., off the shelves is not a good idea.
724	3701	2	2	Based on my life experience, I believe that materials should not be removed from library shelves just because of their content. Instead, libraries should keep offensive items on the shelves but separate them from the rest. It's already a problem that many people get offended by the slightest thing, making it hard for others to enjoy the content. I think censorship is unnecessary as it makes people more curious about why something was censored in the first place. In my opinion, censorship is useless because it ruins the experience for everyone just because one person is offended. I like the saying 'Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt', which implies that if you're offended, you should get over it. One person's opinion shouldn't represent everyone's. Also, if someone really wants to access certain content, they will find a way, so censorship is rather pointless. Moreover, censorship makes people less resilient as they are not exposed to real - world content, and they will be shocked when they enter the real world. In conclusion, offensive materials should be separated and placed in another section of the library. A rating system like the one for video games could also be developed to inform people about the content. These simple measures can satisfy everyone as those who are offended don't have to see what they dislike.
725	3702	2	2	In @DATE1, there was an abundance of rap/hip - hop artists. Their songs typically revolved around gangs, narcotics, alcohol, and using women for favors. This kind of content is not suitable for young children. Many children know the lyrics of these rap songs, and the parenting skills of some parents play a role in whether children learn these words. While it's true that children need to be exposed to certain aspects of life and other music genres also deal with similar topics, I don't think it's right for young children to be exposed to such content. For example, it would be uncomfortable if a child asked what drugs or alcohol are. We should let children have a taste of the real world, but there should be a limit. Beyond that limit, they are learning too much at a young age. In my opinion, we can let children listen to edited versions of songs or choose a different genre. For me, country music is peaceful and realistic. I understand that rap music can also be realistic, but everyone has different views on what music children should listen to. I sometimes listen to rap music, but I would never let my kids listen to the uncensored version. Magazines also contribute to children being 'street - smart'. They often spread false information and use revealing pictures on the cover to attract attention, which children see. Being young and naive, children tend to imitate what they see. Movies in the @DATE1 world can show whatever they want. Inappropriate movies are usually rated, but children may still find a way to access them. There are also many harmful advertisements on the internet that children may accidentally click on. In conclusion, we need to monitor what our children listen to and watch as best we can, even though we can't watch their every move.
726	3703	2	2	I firmly believe that neither libraries nor anyone else should have the power to censor books, movies, music, magazines, and so on. Authors who invest their time and effort in expressing their thoughts and ideas through their works should not have their creations removed from the shelves. They have the right to freedom of speech and the freedom to write and say what they wish.  I've read books that I found offensive or didn't like, but I don't think they should be excluded from libraries. These materials exist because there are people who appreciate them. There's no reason to remove what some people like from the shared library environment. If we start censoring, there would be little left in libraries since almost anything can be considered offensive by someone.  Take @ORGANIZATION1 as an example. People claim that his lyrics and music contain a lot of inappropriate content, but most of his work is about his own life. He has the right to write and publish his music for the world to see and hear. His music is a reflection of his life experiences.  In history, @CAPS2 is a controversial figure because of his actions. Should we remove information about him because some people, like Jews in @MONTH1, find it offensive? While it may be offensive to some, it allows people to learn about history. If we censor such information, history may repeat itself, as the saying goes.  In conclusion, I believe that people have the right to freedom of speech, and their works should be available in libraries for people to learn, be educated, and entertained. Just because something offends one person doesn't mean it will offend everyone.
727	3704	2	2	The question of whether to censor books, music, movies, magazines, and other media materials in libraries is a significant one. Why should information and knowledge be withheld from people? Learning is not only beneficial for the individual but also for the entire human race.  There are two sides to the argument about library censorship. I am firmly against censorship in libraries. In the @ORGANIZATION1, every individual is granted the right to free speech. Removing someone's work because it is considered 'unorthodox' or 'offensive' violates their rights. Moreover, people visit libraries to seek knowledge. Restricting their access to information can be detrimental to society as a whole. Once one piece of content is censored, it often leads to a chain reaction, and soon, a large portion of the material may be deemed 'offensive' or 'unorthodox,' thereby limiting humanity's learning capacity.  On the other hand, there are valid reasons for censoring minor offenses, such as inappropriate language in various forms of media and obscene graphic material in movies and magazines. However, these are minor issues that can be addressed through simple adjustments. Censors can create clean versions of the content without completely removing it from the shelves.  In conclusion, there is no need to remove media from library shelves. The issues are not severe enough to warrant such drastic measures. Minor adjustments can be made to ensure that people can still access and enjoy the content while maintaining a certain level of appropriateness. A library should serve the learning needs of the people, and removing access to information is a serious matter.
728	3705	2	2	In my opinion, it's not right to remove music, books, or movies. People usually express their true feelings through reading, singing, or creating these works. Taking away these forms of expression means taking away people's talents. Those who have worked hard to do what they love shouldn't have their creations removed just because of what they say or write.  If you don't like something, you can simply choose not to listen, read, or watch it. You don't need to make a big deal out of it and ruin other people's chances to pursue their passions. Removing these materials won't just affect one aspect of their lives; it will have a broader impact and may even stop them from doing what they love completely.  In conclusion, we should respect people's choices and allow them to express themselves. If you don't agree with something, just move on to something else instead of trying to censor it and disrupt other people's lives.
729	3706	2	2	When I come across a book that I don't particularly like, I simply put it aside. I don't think it's necessary to deal with all the books that might be offensive to an individual or a group.  Every time I visit the library, I may find a few books that are slightly inappropriate. But when I see such books, I don't make a fuss. I just put them down and continue my search. If we were to remove all the books that people might find offensive, the book selection in libraries would be extremely limited.  There are also many people who find The @CAPS3 offensive. If we were to remove all @CAPS4 - related text from libraries, it would be difficult to spread the word of @CAPS5 to those who don't have access to such literature.  I may not fully agree with the ideas of many theorists, but I don't think their works should be banned from public libraries. For example, I don't like @PERSON1's book on evolution, but due to the freedom of speech, he has the right to write about his discoveries and beliefs.  In conclusion, while I'm not claiming to be completely open - minded about everyone's thoughts and beliefs, when it comes to literature and art, I believe that diversity makes us unique. If everyone consumed the same media, our culture would be very boring, which goes against the values on which this great country was founded.
730	3707	2	2	Dear @CAPS1,  There are numerous books, music, and magazines that contain offensive words or obscene themes. However, the presence of a single foul word in a book or song does not justify hiding it from the public. There are several reasons why we should not censor public media.  Firstly, we cannot ignore the wrongdoings in our world. Just as a bystander cannot pretend that a person being abused in a hallway or alley never happened, the world cannot turn a blind eye to crime and terror. Books and movies can be a way to raise awareness about these issues. Sometimes, they are like a cry for help. I often learn about events through movies or books, and I prefer to know the honest story rather than a sanitized version. For instance, if the language in books about slavery were not so vivid, people might not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.  Secondly, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech. We are allowed to express our opinions on any topic and describe it in any way we choose. While we should have a sense of right and wrong, people should be trusted to use their own conscience. Removing someone's ability to express themselves violates this fundamental right.  Another reason is that if we start censoring books and other media, people may start to judge almost every word as offensive. As Katherine Paterson said, we may end up with 'no books left on the shelf.' Once the door to censorship is opened, people will look for words with negative connotations, and many words will be removed.  It's true that some media, especially songs and movies, may contain nasty themes and foul language. But we have the choice. We can change the radio station if we don't like what we're hearing. We cannot simply remove the words from someone's mouth, no matter how bad they may seem. We cannot live in a fantasy world where everything is perfect. If we learn about wrongdoings in the world, we need to take action, and we can only do so if we know the full extent of the problem.  Sincerely, @PERSON2
731	3708	2	2	Everyone has a penchant for watching movies, listening to music, and getting engrossed in an interesting book. Consequently, individuals should have the freedom to read, watch, or listen to whatever they desire, just as others do. There are instances where one might need to look up or view certain materials for a project. Moreover, some people simply find entertainment in specific pieces of literature or music. In light of this, why censor items that people are interested in or that are useful for research in libraries? Many individuals enjoy violent literature or gory movies, and reading such content amuses them. So, why deprive them of what they like? If a library removes certain books from its shelves, it may be taking away a genre of literature that people are interested in. For example, if a book that twenty people enjoy reading is removed, those twenty people may lose interest in reading altogether. People vary in their interests, including the types of things they like to read. Since humans have diverse characteristics, they do not all enjoy the same things. Some articles, magazines, or movies may not be suitable for schools or libraries. However, if they pertain to a topic that people like or are needed for a project, there is no reason to discard them. Some books often offend certain groups or races of people, but their uniqueness lies in what they convey. Some books were written during times of racism. This should not make a book worthy of criticism because that was the language and mindset of that era. It allows the book to evoke a sense of living in the time it is set in. On the other hand, some magazines cover horrible events and wars, yet people find entertainment in reading about what is happening in the world. They want to know the real - life situations both overseas and at home. If no one allows them to read these magazines, they cannot stay informed. Authors write these works to entertain those who want to read them. Due to the wide range of interests people have, there is a great variety of writings. It is unfair to remove someone's favorite book from the shelves just because another person may find it offensive. Libraries should stock the materials that authors create so that others can enjoy them.
732	3709	2	2	When one goes to a library, they expect it to be a place with a positive influence. Parents don't anticipate that there will be inappropriate content when they send their children there. Most people visit the library to study or use the computers. But what about the other issues? I once went to the library and saw racist books. Most adults, especially African - Americans, would find these offensive. However, the purpose of these books is not to offend but to provide information. Some books are highly informative, and people need to study and learn about the past to prevent history from repeating itself. Another common problem is adult books. Parents definitely do not want their children looking at or checking out these books. But when there is no one to stop children from accessing these books, there is little that can be done. I firmly believe that libraries should implement an age limit for checking out certain books. The music available in libraries also poses a problem. It often contains bad language, and kids can easily check it out without much effort. Most parents try to shield their children from using dirty language. When children can go to a community place like the library and listen to such music, it creates an issue. In my opinion, this gives the library a bad reputation and results in less business. As a parent, one would not want their children to access racist, adult books, and music with bad language. I think there should be a vote to decide whether these books and music should be removed from the library or at least placed in an adult - only section. In conclusion, I believe that either there should be a voting system for what goes into the library or the library should start censoring the books and music it makes available to the community. Doing so would attract more customers, which means more revenue for the government.
733	3710	2	2	There are many books out there that I would like to see removed from library shelves, and one such book is 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. When I read it, I found that it contained a lot of offensive language and graphic content, which was also present in the movie adaptation. In my view, both the book and the movie were not very good. The only redeeming quality of the movie was a few dramatic scenes. Another annoyance was the author's repeated use of the same offensive language. It seemed as if the author was fond of using repetition. Despite these flaws, the book has won awards and is a must - read for high school students. Overall, the story was okay, but the offensive content was a major drawback. Books like this should not be on the shelves without proper consideration. If they are to be stocked, the offensive language should be removed. Clearly, people must have liked the book, or it wouldn't have received awards. In conclusion, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a good story, but it can offend a lot of people. I heard people still talking about it even though I read it last year. Therefore, I firmly believe that there should be censorship in libraries.
734	3711	2	2	I have mixed feelings about the issue of allowing unrestricted access to books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries. On one hand, I think it's good that everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to read, listen to, or watch. On the other hand, I believe it's not entirely okay. The reason for my agreement is that some materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, may not be suitable for young children. They may contain profanity, explicit images, or deal with topics that children are not ready to be exposed to at their age. Nowadays, a lot of music and movies use bad language and show sexual content or people in inappropriate clothing. Additionally, adults may misuse these materials, causing problems for the library. So, I think offensive materials should be removed from the shelves. However, I also think that libraries should keep most of these materials available. If children are not exposed to the consequences of using bad language, going out inappropriately dressed, or watching adult movies at a certain age, they may not learn what is wrong. It would be better if libraries had a separate section for these materials instead of removing them permanently. In conclusion, this issue has two sides. Offensive books, movies, music, and magazines should be moved to a specific area in the library to ensure that everyone's needs are met while also protecting the well - being of younger patrons.
735	3712	2	2	I am writing to express my concerns about the censorship in libraries. First, the music played and available in libraries can be quite graphic. Some of this music can be offensive and undermine the feelings of others. Music should have positive meaning and focus on the better aspects of life rather than violence and killing. Second, regarding the books in libraries, if they want to stock adult - oriented material, there should be a dedicated adult section. Reading should be about personal interests, but it should also be appropriate for the reader's age and maturity. Next, there are inappropriate magazines in some libraries. These magazines often show too much and are more suitable for adults and teenagers above a certain age. I believe libraries should create sections for different age groups to ensure that the content is age - appropriate. Finally, the movie selection in libraries is a problem. There are graphic movies that are easily accessible to young children. Children do not need to be exposed to such content at all. Libraries need to be more aware of their collections and the potential impact on their patrons. In conclusion, everyone has the right to use a library, but not all the materials in libraries should be freely accessible to everyone. Bad influences can corrupt young minds, and we need to rise above these negative impacts. Libraries need to change their practices and selections to be more successful in serving the community.
736	3713	2	2	"Katherine Paterson once said, ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf."" Books serve to entertain and educate readers in various aspects of life. While not all books are offensive, some are. Offensive books, especially those in school libraries, should be removed from the shelves. There is a risk that children may act out the offensive or violent content in these books. Moreover, they may show the books to their peers. Additionally, such books can cause offense to children.  In today's world, children are influenced by various media, including television shows, video games, and music. News reports have indicated that children have been influenced to engage in dangerous behaviors such as using guns or attempting self - harm. Books should entertain readers in a positive way, not teach them to become violent. Readers who encounter offensive or violent content may turn the words into actions, which can lead to trouble for the students.  Children have a tendency to show off to their friends. If a student comes across offensive or violent content in a book, they are likely to share it with their peers because they think it is cool. Having one person exposed to such content can be a problem, and if an entire group sees it, it can lead to significant issues for the children, their parents, and the school. The new ideas learned from these books may become part of the children's daily lives and gain popularity, potentially damaging the school's image.  School is not only an educational institution but also a social place. Every school has different groups of students with diverse backgrounds in terms of color, religion, style, and personality. Children are easily hurt. Offensive books can cause harm to those who read them. Books are meant to entertain, not to cause pain. It is unclear why authors would include offensive content, perhaps in an attempt to add interest or suspense, but not all readers can accept it easily.  In conclusion, offensive books on the shelves can lead children to act out the content, share it with others, and cause harm. Children already face many challenges; there is no need to make their situation worse. Books should focus on entertainment, so offensive books should be removed to avoid problems."
737	3714	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason is that some children should not be exposed to certain content. Parents do not always accompany their children to the library and guide them on what they can and cannot borrow. School libraries generally have pre - approved, appropriate materials. However, public libraries offer a wider range of content compared to school libraries.  In conclusion, considering the potential negative impact on children and the lack of constant parental supervision, it is reasonable to remove offensive materials from the shelves.
738	3715	2	2	"Censorship is a topic that often arises in our daily lives. We frequently encounter content that we believe is inappropriate and should be removed. However, we must question whether we have the right to remove such items from the shelves to prevent their spread. Additionally, we need to consider whether it is beneficial for children's future to shield them from this kind of material in stores, libraries, and bookstores.  Most cartoons contain violence. In fact, almost all cartoons resolve conflicts through violence. Young children watch these cartoons without fully understanding the inappropriateness of the violent behavior they see. Similarly, some shows and movies are not suitable for kids.  Books also present a similar issue. Nowadays, children are attracted to new books based on popular movies, such as the ""Twilight"" series. These books contain violent content. If parents were to censor their children's reading materials, many of these books would be removed from the shelves, especially for young readers.  Newspapers also report on violence. For the safety of children, it is concerning that they may be curious to see if the reported violence is still ongoing. Children's safety is of utmost importance, and we should be cautious about what they read, view, or hear from books, TV, movies, and newspapers.  In conclusion, these reasons justify giving parents the power to censor what their children read, hear, and view on a daily basis. While children can enjoy cartoons with violence, they should not imitate the violent behavior or repeat the inappropriate language."
739	3716	2	2	Should libraries remove offensive reading material? In my opinion, certain reading materials should not be removed from libraries just because some people find them offensive. Offensive material exists everywhere. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. If someone finds something offensive, they should simply avoid looking at or reading it.  A few months ago, I was at the library looking for a book for an essay. I overheard two girls arguing. One girl asked about a book, and the other described it as being about two people in love and the man's search for a new partner after his first love died. The first girl then asked if it was about sex, and the second girl said it was only slightly about sex. The first girl refused to read the book, claiming that it sent the wrong message to teens.  After the girls left, I picked up the book and started reading it. It turned out to be a very good book. It was mainly about the love between the two characters and the man's struggles after his love passed away, not primarily about sex.  This incident made me think about whether certain reading materials should be removed because they discuss topics like sex, drugs, or murder, or because someone finds them offensive. The answer is no. Offensive material exists in real life and is not being removed, so there is no reason to remove it from libraries. There will always be something that offends someone; that is just a fact of life.
740	3717	2	2	The question of whether books, music, etc. should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive is a complex one. People have the right to access and consume the content they desire. Some individuals believe it is wrong to have offensive materials openly available on the shelves, while others think it is acceptable. It ultimately depends on personal feelings.  Imagine being in a library and coming across something offensive. The world doesn't stop and remove the item just to please one person. If you don't like it, you should simply look away. I would focus on more important issues, such as war or personal life challenges, rather than getting worked up over offensive items on the bookshelves.  The world is vast and will continue to be so. There will always be offensive things in life that we don't want to see or hear. My advice is to get over it.  The other day, I was at a bait shop and heard a word I hate. I didn't confront the grown man who said it; I just rolled my eyes and continued with my business.  In conclusion, as I've been saying, in life, there will always be offensive things. It may not be easy to overlook them, but life itself isn't easy. We need to learn to deal with offensive content instead of demanding its removal.
741	3718	2	2	If I discover a book that offends me, I would remove it from the shelf because I believe that if I find a book offensive, others might share the same view. I acknowledge that some books can be offensive to certain individuals while not to others, and it's unfair to those who have such sensitivities. One of the main reasons for removing a book from the shelf is to prevent young children from reading it. Parents generally do not want their children exposed to content about violence and murder. Most of the books I would take off the shelf involve themes of racism, people killing others, and sexual activities. People should refrain from reading such material as it can plant ideas in their minds and sometimes lead them to think in the same way as the author. If children read books about violence and sexual actions, they might think it's acceptable to engage in such behaviors, which could get them into trouble with the law and their parents. Children need to be kept away from these kinds of books until they are older and can distinguish right from wrong. Some books contain a lot of cursing, and children tend to pick up these words and start using them frequently until it becomes a habit. Even if some books are based on real people, they should still be removed from the shelves if they contain offensive content. In some of these books, there is a significant amount of violence, and children should not be exposed to such material. Books can sometimes do more harm than good. However, if everyone were to remove books that offended them whenever they wanted, there would be no books left on the shelves.
742	3719	2	2	If people find books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials offensive to others, they may choose to remove them from the shelves. I personally wish they wouldn't, but they feel compelled to do so. They believe that if someone encounters offensive content, they might think it's acceptable to say or do the things they read or hear. However, it's common sense not to imitate such actions. Authors write to entertain and educate us about what was considered acceptable in the time period of the story. Nowadays, most people take things too seriously, mainly due to lawsuits and discrimination. If someone can find something to complain about, they will. For example, if there's a book about the era when [group] had slaves and uses derogatory terms, someone might complain, claiming it's racist. This could lead to a dispute, and the author would likely have to change the offensive word. People often underestimate how frequently this occurs, especially with books. Movies are a different matter. The content in movies can sometimes avoid strict scrutiny because of financial resources. That's why there are different ratings such as [rating for children under a certain age], [rating with more leeway], and [rating for more mature content]. [Rating for children under a certain age] is for young children, and there are specific limitations on the content. [Rating with more leeway] allows for more intense and sometimes sexual content, but not in a fully explicit way. It can also include villains and some mild swearing. [Rating for more mature content] has even fewer restrictions and can be more graphic. Sometimes, determining the appropriate rating depends on the level of graphicness. Music also varies depending on the genre. Genres like [genre 1], [genre 2], etc., often discuss sex, violence, drugs, and other controversial topics. If parents don't want their children listening to such music, they can try to prevent it, but there are ways for children to access the uncut versions. For instance, radio stations may censor swearing, but the uncut versions can be found on other platforms. In conclusion, while some people may want to remove offensive materials, it's important to consider the context and the purpose of the content. We should also be aware of the potential influence on different age groups and find a balance between freedom of expression and protecting the well - being of others.
743	3720	2	2	From [person's] perspective, books should not be removed from the shelves just because they are offensive to one person. Sometimes, books that are offensive to some can actually help others. Everyone in a library should have the right to read any book they want. The idea of removing a book from the shelf is a poor one because there are people who want to read such books. If some individuals have an issue with a particular type of book, they should advise others not to read it instead of removing it. At most, these books could be placed in a separate area rather than being completely taken off the shelves. When people are in need of help, they often turn to books. So, if an offensive book can assist someone with their problems, it shouldn't be moved. There are valid reasons for people to read offensive books, even if we don't know all of them. Similarly, if a movie is extremely inappropriate or horrifying, it should be placed where it won't be easily accessible. Both children and adults should not be exposed to truly bad movies. Usually, when someone takes offense to something, they may be guilty of something themselves but are reluctant to admit it. People often assume that authors write offensive content deliberately, but this isn't always the case. Sometimes, the reader may misinterpret the text or be unable to come to terms with something in the story. Different people have different reactions to the same book. One person may find a book offensive, while another may find it funny. The problem sometimes lies in the reader's ability to comprehend the text. I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves just because they are offensive. Instead, if necessary, they should be moved to a different area. Only when a large number of people find a book offensive should it be removed from the shelves.
744	3721	2	2	Whether inappropriate materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves depends on the context. If someone wants to access such resources, they must be mature enough to handle them. In a library, the placement of the material matters a great deal. If the material is in the children's section, it should be removed as children are not ready to process such information. In the teen section, teens should either be mature enough to handle inappropriate content or simply leave it alone. In the adult section, there should be no debate as adults are expected to be fully mature to engage with such materials. For example, comic books like [comic 1] and [comic 2] contain inappropriate and disturbing events. These comics are placed in the teen section, where teenagers around [age range] usually spend their time. Some teens may be horrified by these books, while others may be fascinated. It all depends on the individual and the context of the material's distribution. Another example is related to movies. Once, a young teenage girl checked out a movie she had never seen before. When she watched it with her parents, they noticed some uncomfortable scenes. If she had been more mature, it might not have been a problem, but since she was young, the situation became worse. In conclusion, whether inappropriate material should be removed from the shelves depends on how and where it is distributed. One person's reaction can change the situation, and the decision should always be based on the specific circumstances.
745	3722	2	2	We've all enjoyed our favorite books, music, movies, and magazines, but much of this content may be inappropriate for younger children. Parents are increasingly concerned about their children's upbringing and are eager to shield them from inappropriate materials. Content with violence, gore, offensive language, and sexual scenes is something parents want to censor from their children's view. There are several valid reasons for this. Firstly, exposure to certain materials can influence a child's personal values. If a child reads about a life filled with hatred or violence and it sounds appealing, they may be tempted to live the same way. While children should have fun, it should be within a safe and appropriate limit. Secondly, such materials can affect a person's emotions. A positive song or movie can make us happy, but the opposite is also true. Dark songs can make a person feel depressed, and scary movies can leave a person with new fears or nightmares. Some children have even been left traumatized for life after seeing violent and gory scenes. Parents want to protect their children from these negative emotional impacts. Finally, children's behavior can be easily influenced. If a child sees a character in a movie as cool and wants to imitate them, especially if the character is involved in violent or bad - influenced behavior, the child may start disobeying their parents. In conclusion, certain materials should be removed from the public eye to protect the community, especially children. We are all easily influenced by information, songs, and stories. It is our responsibility to ensure that the content we are exposed to, and that our children are exposed to, is positive and safe. We need to be cautious about what is available in the world and prioritize keeping harmful influences away from those who are vulnerable to negative impacts.
746	3723	2	2	Newspaper staff and those it concerns: Reading materials in libraries are highly valuable and informative to the world, with virtually no limit to what can be found in printed form. Imposing restrictions on books, whether they are considered offensive or not, will only lead to tension, impact the economy, and result in illegal activities. Ironically, offensive books may be written and sold covertly. In today's world, it is nearly impossible to find a book that is completely inoffensive. Almost everyone has some issue with something in the current world, making it difficult to come across original and unoffensive material. Removing offensive material from libraries will devastate authors, not only emotionally but also financially, as they may lose their jobs and income. Since it is extremely difficult to write a non - offensive book, authors will become frustrated, given their passion for their work. Moreover, as almost all reading materials are offensive in some way, library shelves will be nearly empty. This situation could potentially lead to violent protests that might undermine even the most prosperous nations. However, the negative consequences of removing offensive reading materials from libraries are not limited to physical destruction. Books involve costs in production and purchase. The paper industry will experience a significant decline in the market, with few customers. When a major sector like the paper industry collapses, it will drag down other industries as well, given the complexity of the nation's market where most major companies rely on paper. This will ruin the economy. Some may claim that this means the people will be more environmentally friendly. However, throughout history, when economics and the environment are compared, economics has always been the priority. Clearly, removing offensive materials will do more harm than good. People always have priorities, and most do not like having something they are fond of taken away. People generally desire what they cannot have. A prime example is illegal drugs; the drug market is very successful despite being illegal. If drugs were legalized, the drug market's success would likely decline. The opposite is true for books. We currently have access to them, but if they are removed, our desire for them will increase. Book - readers are often passionate about literature and intelligent. It only takes one group to grow in numbers and a talented speaker to persuade others to engage in a potentially violent revolt to regain the right to write and publish so - called 'offensive' books. Removing other materials in libraries, such as music and movies, will have similar effects. To avoid such problems, it is advisable to keep all materials on library shelves. Removing them, especially for being offensive, is problematic when there are few books that the general public finds inoffensive. If keeping the materials in libraries means some individuals may be offended for various reasons, let it be an organized chaos. This is how people function, and keeping the materials on the shelves is what pleases and motivates them.
747	3724	2	2	To begin my persuasive argument, it is truly unacceptable! How can such a decision be made without our say? We definitely should have a voice in this matter. This is my view on this issue. I firmly believe that if books, movies, music, magazines, or any other materials are offensive, they should not be placed in libraries. It is not right, and it is cruel. People should not put such materials there if they are insulting or hurtful to others. I have had a personal experience in this regard. When I was @NUM1 years old at the @ORGANIZATION1, my parents and I were there for a movie. While looking at the books, we came across a book titled '@CAPS4 in @LOCATION1'. This book was offensive to me because @CAPS5 was the region where I was raised. It discussed feelings about faith in a way that made me uncomfortable. As someone who regularly attends church and reads the @CAPS6 - I - @CAPS6 - @CAPS8 - @CAPS9, and who was raised with a strong faith, reading that book made me question everything I believed in. In conclusion, I think offensive books should not be available for people to read. There are plenty of other books that can be placed in libraries instead. I sincerely hope that you will consider my persuasive letter and share your thoughts and ideas as well.
748	3725	2	2	My name is @PERSON1. On @DATE1 at @TIME1, a friend and I were in the library looking at books. Later that day at school, my friend @CAPS1 came up to me in the hallway. She said that her book was offensive and that she was going to report it. After school, when she got home, she told her parents about the offensive book. Her parents advised her to tell the librarian. On our way to the library, @CAPS1 and I stopped at a store to buy drinks. While there, she picked up a newspaper. She noticed an article about the school, which mentioned that some books needed to be removed from the library shelves. When we entered the library, the librarian was sitting at her desk. She asked if we needed help. @CAPS1 said no, but that she needed to talk about a book. The librarian said she was already aware of the issue as she had received complaints and was in the process of removing the offensive books from the shelves and moving them to the back closet. About a week later, @CAPS1 and her mother were reading the newspaper. It reported that all offensive books were being removed from the library shelves and would be replaced with newer and better ones. Some people thought this decision was wrong, believing that it shouldn't be done just because one person found the books offensive. Nevertheless, the change was being implemented. In the end, this incident shows that the library is taking steps to address the issue of offensive books, although not everyone agrees with the approach.
749	3726	2	2	Censorship serves the purpose of preventing certain age groups from being exposed to disturbing images, sounds, or ideas. However, in the context of libraries, if censorship is applied, all books would have to be removed from the shelves. And if library books are removed, books in stores would also likely be discarded. Books are an essential part of life. They are a medium through which great ideas and thoughts are expressed. Those who advocate for the censorship of library books are misguided. While their intention to protect their children and themselves is understandable, their decision has negative consequences. Authors are affected because their creative works are being censored. Readers who enjoy the books targeted for censorship will no longer have access to them. It is ultimately an individual's choice to avoid books they find offensive. Instead of going to great lengths to censor books, they should simply refrain from reading them. Otherwise, it may lead to a situation where everyone starts to think that there are books that need to be censored, resulting in empty library shelves. The government may take notice and ban these books or, in a worst - case scenario, remove all books, similar to what happened in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Overall, books are a positive force. They inspire us and help us navigate through life with the thoughts they contain. It is up to each individual to avoid books that upset them, rather than being influenced by others' opinions.
750	3727	2	2	Do I think certain materials like books, music, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are considered offensive? Absolutely not. The reason is that what is offensive to me may not be offensive to others. I personally love reading comic books with superheroes; they excite me. If people find a book offensive, they simply don't have to pick it up. If I know a book will be offensive to me, I won't read it. Some may ask, 'What if they don't know it will be offensive?' That's a valid question. But in that case, they should just put the book back and not complain. The writer was just creating a book they thought was good; they couldn't have predicted that someone would take it the wrong way. It's not the writer's fault. Removing books from library shelves just because some people get offended is a bad idea. It will ruin the experience for those who think the books are good or amazing. So, let's not let a few people's sensitivities ruin it for everyone. We should move on and enjoy our lives. Thank you for this discussion.
751	3728	2	2	Society constantly grapples with the distinction between what is appropriate and what is not. Such issues are witnessed daily, often involuntarily. It is a classic dispute between two sides trying to prove the other wrong regarding what is acceptable and what is not. We should exert every effort to keep inappropriate books off our shelves and out of the hands of the youth. People can be influenced to do almost anything, and there are countless such instances. Intriguingly, individuals can be affected indirectly, whether through television, music, or books. They can be shaped into something based on what they are conditioned to believe. The influences one encounters can be either positive or negative. As someone who desires the best for society, I am certain that movies featuring criminal acts or explicit images do not contribute to making better - citizens. The same holds true for books. Books with politically incorrect messages are no better than movies with similar content. I am not opposed to reading; in fact, I am quite the opposite. Reading is beneficial for mental and social health as it allows us to explore inner aspects that are often neglected in our fast - paced world. However, if one is constantly exposed to books that go against human nature, these books should be removed for the well - being of those around. If someone cannot find an appropriate book to read, they need to reflect on themselves. There are millions of books that are not only exciting and stimulating but also have a positive influence. As members of @ORGANIZATION1, we already face enough financial troubles. We do not need to add to our problems by allowing the public access to obscene books that only make people rebellious towards society. If something makes the people in our community more unruly, it should be immediately censored or removed from society. Believe it or not, it is possible to have fun and convey a good message simultaneously.
752	3729	2	2	Dear Newspaper, In libraries, I don't think it's necessary to remove materials that some people might find offensive. After all, if it offends you, just don't look at it. You're an independent person and can make your own decisions. If a so - called offensive material isn't offensive to someone, why should that person be punished because others make a big deal out of it? Just because you don't like it doesn't mean I won't. If someone finds a book offensive, don't read it. If there's an offensive magazine, skip it. It's that simple. People are smart enough to know what's good and bad for them. There's no reason why they can't choose what they want and where to get it. I've seen many times when someone found another person's music offensive but didn't say anything. They just ignored it. The world needs more people like that, who stand up for their beliefs and don't judge others for theirs. It seems like the world is filled with people who care too much about what others are doing. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but everyone will be offended by something at some point. It's your choice whether to let it bother you for the rest of your life. Listen to whatever music, read whatever books or magazines you want. If someone finds them offensive, that's their problem. You're your own person, and that won't change. Do what makes you happy.
753	3730	2	2	Why censor things? There will always be someone who wants to read a book or magazine that others think should be censored. If this cycle continues, we'll have no books left to read. There are many things that some people don't like, but that doesn't give them the right to remove them from the shelves. Taking a book off the shelf just because they think it's inappropriate will leave someone with nothing to read. If books and magazines start being removed from the shelves, we'll have fewer ways to research or learn certain things. Just because there might be graphic pictures or writing in them doesn't make them inappropriate. They should be labeled to indicate such content. If you see the label and don't want to look, you don't have to. We need to categorize books by age. Parents would be happy if their children could only read age - appropriate books. With parental permission, children could read books meant for older kids or adults. Even though I'm not a big reader, I sometimes pick up a book to learn about engines. I don't think people should be able to restrict and remove things from the shelves. Everyone has the right to read a book or watch a movie. However, children are different as they don't need to learn certain things at a young age. Parents can choose what their children read, but as an adult, you should be able to read, listen, or watch whatever you want.
754	3731	2	2	There are many things in the world that children should not be exposed to, as they can poison the minds of people of all ages. The things people encounter these days can be harmful and should not be seen by anyone. These things should be eliminated so that our minds and the minds of future generations remain pure. I believe that no one, regardless of age, should be exposed to such bad things. If kids shouldn't know about them, then grown - ups who were once kids shouldn't either. But if such things are in libraries, the question is, who should decide what is right and wrong? Given the large world population and the diverse opinions of people, it's impossible for one person to go through all materials and distinguish between good and bad. That's why it's up to the head of the family to address this issue. By taking responsibility, families can help safeguard the mental well - being of their members and contribute to a healthier social environment.
755	3732	2	2	I firmly believe that some materials should not be on the regular shelves but should not be removed from the library. There should be a room where all potentially offensive items, such as certain books, music, movies, and magazines, are stored. I once saw a little kid pull an adult book off the shelf, and the mother was very angry with the library for having it at a low level. I understand that some adult books should be in the library, but they should be placed on higher shelves so that kids can't reach them. The library should have a dedicated room for kids and teenagers, filled with age - appropriate books, magazines, music, and movies. Kids should not be allowed in areas of the library that contain violent or sexual content. There should also be a locked room for adult movies and books, along with the kids' room. If the library can't afford to create these rooms, at least all adult materials should be placed on the top or higher shelves. Some materials shouldn't be on the shelves but shouldn't be removed from the library because someone might need them for school or job research. Removing them could also erase a part of history from the library. There's a reason these books, movies, magazines, or music were created. Parents can also assist the library by keeping a closer eye on their kids, watching what they pick off the shelves. They can even ask a friend or neighbor to watch the children while they go to the library so that kids don't see inappropriate things. I'm convinced that what I've written here is the right way to manage a public library. Adult materials should be placed higher up. If parents don't like it, they can leave their kids at home or choose another library.
756	3733	2	2	Libraries house a vast array of books, music, movies, and magazines. Given the diverse interests of people worldwide, certain individuals may find specific books, songs, movies, or magazines offensive, while others may not. For instance, a religious book presenting a particular view might conflict with some people's beliefs. However, such books should not be removed, as libraries also contain materials that align with various beliefs.  The extensive variety of subjects in libraries is a valuable asset. Removing an item just because one person is offended is unwise. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if one person can decide to remove a book, others could follow suit, leading to a lack of variety in library collections. This would severely limit people's reading choices and reduce their access to information. Libraries serve as important sources of knowledge for teachers, students, researchers, writers, and hobbyist readers. Depriving people of this resource would make them less informed about the world.  In [CAPS2], freedom, including freedom of speech and the right to hold personal opinions and interests, is highly valued. Therefore, public institutions like libraries should not remove items due to individual sensitivities. Those who find an item offensive should simply ignore it rather than advocating for its removal.
757	3734	2	2	It doesn't really matter to me. We all have the right to our own likes and dislikes. Some people may think movies with blood should not be allowed, while others believe movies with adult content should be banned. If you don't like something but someone else does, why should you get your way and not them?  If we start removing one movie, book, magazine, or type of music from the market, why not remove them all? Then there would be no argument about what is suitable to watch or not. If you don't like something or have young children and don't want them to access certain content, simply don't buy it. If you do have such items, make sure they are out of your children's reach. In conclusion, respecting individual preferences and taking personal responsibility for what we expose ourselves and our children to is the key. We should not try to impose our likes and dislikes on others by removing content from the market.
758	3735	2	2	Books, music, movies, and magazines containing violence should be removed from the shelves to protect young children. Exposure to violence in these media can have detrimental effects on children's development. Violent movies, for example, can influence children to imitate aggressive behavior. They may see older kids fighting in movies and want to try it themselves, contributing to the already high rate of teen violence. Moreover, movies can also lead children to become bullies, as they may not fully understand the consequences of their actions.  Music can also be a negative influence on kids. Some of the music they listen to contains references to killing, drugs, and alcohol. When children are exposed to such content, they may be more likely to get involved in these harmful activities, which can ruin their lives. For instance, screamo music can give the impression of violence and aggression.  Magazines are also a concern. They often feature inappropriate images that can lead teens and children to imitate the behavior or appearance of the people in the pictures.  In conclusion, due to the negative impact of violence, drugs, and alcohol references in books, movies, music, and magazines, these items should be removed from the shelves. This is necessary to safeguard the well - being and development of young people and to reduce the influence of harmful content on them.
759	3736	2	2	How much harm can books, popular music, movies, or magazines cause? Studies show that [CAPS1] citizens may take offense more easily than it seems from the content of these media. Sometimes, they may overreact to the information spread by these updated articles in [LOCATION1], but is this really justified?  In [LOCATION1], with its diverse racial population, we should strive to accept different cultural backgrounds. However, I've noticed that in a predominantly white school, many people judge other races, making fun of their appearance or speech. We should recognize that we are all human beings and treat each other with respect.  Regarding racial content in media, I believe that while some materials about historical events like slavery and the Holocaust are important for learning about our history, truly offensive materials that make fun of different races should be removed. For example, books with Mexican or black jokes and comedy movies mocking different races should be taken off the shelves. These types of content can be hurtful to different races and undermine their cultural backgrounds.  When it comes to music, most of it these days sings about love, physical and mental pain. Generally, music doesn't seem to be a major source of racial conflict, unless it is deliberately created to mock people. Magazines usually don't pose a significant threat to different races either.  In conclusion, while we should preserve materials that contribute to our understanding of history, we must also be vigilant about removing content that is truly offensive and disrespectful to different races. This is crucial for promoting a more inclusive and harmonious society.
760	3737	2	2	The question of whether offensive books should be removed from library shelves is a complex one. Some people find certain books offensive, while others do not. In my opinion, these books should not be removed.  First, just because a book is offensive to some people does not mean it should be taken off the shelf. If someone finds a book offensive, they should simply ignore it. Removing the book would be unfair to those who want to read it. The author's opinion in the book may not be directed at any specific individual, and we should not let personal sensitivities dictate what others can read.  Second, everyone has different opinions. In this argument about whether to remove offensive books, it is clear that the books should stay on the shelves. One person may find a book offensive, but another may not. There are also people who may never even read the offensive book. Taking it off the shelf would be unjust to those who are interested in it.  Finally, people have different preferences for book themes. If you don't like a book's theme or find it offensive, you should choose another book. You shouldn't prevent others from reading a book they like just because you are offended. In conclusion, it is not fair to remove offensive books from library shelves. We should respect the diversity of opinions and preferences and allow everyone the opportunity to access the books they want to read.
761	3738	2	2	Have you ever come across a book that you considered offensive? Have you ever read a book that you didn't want others to read? I concur with Katherine Paterson. If we can remove one book from the shelves, we can remove all of them. Katherine Paterson posits that if an individual has the right to take off the shelf a book they detest, then everyone else could do the same, leaving us with no books to read in libraries. This is precisely why I side with Katherine on this matter. Books are written for us to read, not to be censored just because some overly - proper parent doesn't want their child to read a book that many others enjoy. Regarding magazines that some people find offensive, they should be placed in a separate area so that children can't access them. The same principle applies to movies. Some movies are not intended for kids, but that doesn't mean we should remove them from the shelves. One solution is to keep the more explicit movies behind the counter, and have the librarian retrieve them when someone wants to watch. As for books, libraries can set aside a section for those that kids shouldn't read, such as romance, horror, adult, or some action books. Music is another aspect that some parents struggle with due to offensive lyrics. However, since some people like that kind of music, we can't deprive them of it just because we don't like it. Is that fair? Now, do some of those so - called offensive books seem a bit less of a problem? While we don't want our kids reading graphic books about killing, romance, or serial killers, some people enjoy such novels. This is the reason I support Katherine's view.
762	3739	2	2	I'm writing a persuasive essay about my stance on certain books and magazines that some people find offensive. I firmly believe that just because a book or magazine is offensive to someone, it shouldn't be removed from the shelf. People have diverse perspectives on these materials. If someone doesn't like what's in a book, they should simply choose not to read it. After all, others might find it interesting. People need to stop being so self - centered and start considering others. For instance, the author of a book or magazine might have created it because they could relate to the content and hoped others would too. Therefore, people should stop arguing about removing books from the shelves and start thinking about the broader picture. To those reading this, please understand that different people like different books. Don't start removing books just because a few individuals find them offensive. That's my take on those trying to get offensive books removed from the shelves.
763	3740	2	2	"In libraries, there are numerous books, magazines, music, and movies that some may find offensive, yet they could be appealing to others. Hence, we must preserve all these materials, regardless of how vulgar they may seem. These library resources are part of the world's past, each with a complex and far - reaching backstory. If we begin removing books, and everyone follows suit, we'll be left with nothing to learn from. This would lead to a less intelligent world, and we'd start to forget and lose our history. That's why we should never remove any books, movies, music, or magazines from library shelves. What might be special to one person could be crude to another, but in the end, they all contain unique historical elements. A world without so - called inappropriate materials would be less vulgar, but it would also deprive people of valuable knowledge. If everyone removed a book, there would be none left, and the essence and charm of these books would fade away. Some books may contain references to segregation, which is a significant part of America's past. The word ""negro"" is offensive to some, but removing all books with this word would mean losing [NUM1] years of American history that must not be forgotten. Documents about wars, leaders, and the rise and fall of empires would be discarded because the violence is considered too offensive. Many historical moments would be lost forever. Rather than getting rid of offensive books, we could place them in a separate section of the library so that children can't access them. If someone finds many books offensive, they might choose not to visit the library, as no books will be discarded due to their historical value. If we start removing books, movies and magazines will soon follow. I believe that if children can't reach the section with offensive books, we don't need to worry about them being exposed to such materials. We can't sacrifice the world's history by getting rid of offensive books."
764	3741	2	2	I think censorship in libraries has its merits. Some people believe that children shouldn't be exposed to certain content, and this is valid as there are things that even adults may not want to see. In such cases, library owners could create a separate section for these materials. However, people should have the right to access any material they want in the library. While censorship can protect children from inappropriate content, it shouldn't infringe on the rights of others to freely explore the library's resources. Striking a balance between protecting the young and maintaining the freedom of access is crucial. In conclusion, libraries should consider both the need for some form of censorship and the importance of individual rights to read and view what they choose.
765	3742	2	2	Libraries are spaces where readers can access books on any topic of their choice. This right should remain in the hands of the readers, not the library staff. Every individual has the freedom to read about the subjects they're interested in, and library employees should not influence their reading choices. Censorship of books is entirely unnecessary. If a person wants to read about a particular topic, they have every right to do so. Reading an offensive book is a personal choice; no one forces the reader to pick it up. When a reader encounters an offensive book, they can decide not to read it. Just because one reader finds a book offensive doesn't mean another person will, and that other person has the right to read it if they wish. The perception of a book being offensive is merely an opinion, lacking factual basis. So, who has the authority to determine whether a book is offensive? Just because a library staff member believes a book is offensive or inappropriate doesn't mean it should be removed from the shelf. There is no single person who can objectively decide a book's offensiveness. Other media like music, movies, and magazines also shouldn't be censored, although some already are. Movies are rated, giving viewers the option to choose the level of content they're comfortable with. A viewer shouldn't expect to check out a rated [CAPS1] movie and not encounter foul language, violence, or other 'offensive' elements. By choosing a higher - rated movie, the viewer is making their own decision, and librarians shouldn't take it upon themselves to remove these films. It's not their responsibility. Music is also rated and may have parental warning labels indicating explicit content. Similar to books and movies, everyone has the right to listen to the music they like and shouldn't have to look elsewhere because a librarian deems it inappropriate. Magazines may not be rated, but libraries shouldn't unilaterally rate them and discard the ones they consider 'offensive'. As emphasized, it's the reader's choice to access materials, not the librarian's. In conclusion, whether it's books, music, movies, or magazines, consumers have the right to read, listen to, or view whatever they want, free from the influence of librarians. Each person has the autonomy to decide what media they consume, and no one else should interfere with that right.
766	3743	2	2	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that there should be no censorship. Every individual has the right to access and engage with content that brings them joy. The fact that some may find certain materials offensive does not justify their removal. For instance, removing books or movies from the shelves would likely offend the creators.  There are multiple reasons against implementing censorship in libraries. Firstly, freedom of speech is a fundamental right. People should be able to express and consume ideas as they see fit. Just because content might offend some does not mean it should be withheld from those who are not offended. Everyone should have the full right to read and write without unnecessary restrictions.  Secondly, censorship can have a detrimental impact on literature. When offensive books are removed, they become inaccessible to readers, which means fewer opportunities for learning.  Another important consideration is the financial aspect for authors. Many times, when a reader discovers a book they like in the library, they may purchase it. By removing these books from the shelves, authors lose the chance to make money and convey their intended messages.  In conclusion, censorship is a bad idea. It violates the principle of freedom of speech, can harm literature, and takes away from authors' livelihoods and ability to share their perspectives. These are the compelling reasons why I do not support censorship.
767	3744	2	2	I don't think music, magazines, books, or movies should be removed from the shelves. Just because some people don't like them doesn't mean others won't find them entertaining. If parents don't want their children to be exposed to certain content, they should take responsibility and restrict their access.  I believe children should have the right to know about some things, as everyone has the right to be informed about what's going on in the world, past and present. Information is out there to be seen, not hidden, even if some people might misinterpret it.  I'd rather my children be aware of everything so they can distinguish between right and wrong. There is indeed some inappropriate content in books, magazines, etc., but people consume it regardless. Schools teach children about a wide range of topics; does that mean schools should be shut down? Of course not!  Some people homeschool their kids to avoid certain content, but they don't consider what their children might encounter in public. There's no valid reason for people to be overly offended by what they read or listen to.  There's no need to remove content from the shelves just because some people don't like it. Others may enjoy it and even purchase it. People need to realize that there's inappropriate content everywhere, and children are likely to be exposed to it anyway. That's just the nature of our society today.
768	3745	2	2	Yes, I firmly believe in the value of books, music, and magazines. Books are a rich source of information. When I listen to music, it fills me with a sense of sweetness and happiness. Reading magazines allows me to learn about the world, including people and animals.  I believe music is wonderful for listening. When you listen to music regularly, you start to understand its meaning. At first, when I listened to American music, I was in a state of excitement. Now, I've learned how to truly appreciate it.  I also believe magazines are great for reading. When I first came to America, I was sad because I didn't know anyone and couldn't read magazines. But two months later, I made new friends who taught me to speak [language]. They also taught me how to read magazines. Years later, I've made many friends at school. My teacher told me not to worry about learning to speak [language]; if I came to school every day, I'd become proficient. So, I studied hard every day, and now I can speak [language] very well. I'm grateful to all my teachers for teaching me. In conclusion, these forms of media have played an important role in my life and learning.
769	3746	2	2	In today's world, there is a growing desire to make things more private. When we encounter something we don't like, we may feel the urge to shield others from it. Throughout history, including in modern writing, there have been books that go against our moral values. However, just because a group of people deems a book wrong, is it necessary to completely remove it from circulation?  The answer is no. Every written work has a purpose. If there were no purpose, there would be nothing to read. Admittedly, some books and magazines can be too graphic and inappropriate for younger audiences. But that's precisely why they are intended for older readers.  I'm a big fan of books about [events]. I find them fascinating and enjoy imagining how my life might have been different if the outcomes of those [events] had changed. Many of these books contain realistic and sometimes disturbing content that even some adults struggle to handle. However, this is not a reason to eliminate them. These books represent an important part of human history that many people need to know. Without them, these [events] may fade into obscurity.  There are also many books with mature themes, such as detailed sex scenes. These books are clearly not suitable for younger children. But they were created for older, more mature readers. If parents are concerned about what their children are exposed to, they should take responsibility and control the type of books their children read.  While protecting children from inappropriate content is important, we also need to consider the potential for people to gain new ideas from reading more intense books. For example, a person who reads a political book and discovers a new perspective may be motivated to share it with others. This could lead to a large - scale discussion or even an uproar. But in a free society, this is part of the process.  Overall, imposing restrictions on what we read and see is morally wrong. Limiting the nation's access to information is likely to cause more unrest than simply dealing with different viewpoints. People may perceive such restrictions as the government trying to control knowledge, which goes against the principles of a free society.
770	3747	2	2	I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should generally remain on library shelves. However, I have one exception: any material that promotes racism should be removed.  People have the option to access content in libraries or on the internet. Everyone has their own definition of what is offensive. Many people have families and don't want their children to be exposed to inappropriate content. Parents are usually aware of the materials available in libraries. If they are concerned, they can choose to go to a different library or a more censored bookstore.  Most individuals can decide whether or not to visit a place with potentially offensive materials. Sometimes, local, state, or federal governments have a say in what gets placed on library shelves or the internet. There may be people who actually enjoy these types of materials and don't want them removed. Even though searching for such content on the internet might seem odd, it's their choice.  In conclusion, while censorship in libraries is a complex issue, I believe that with the exception of racist materials, people should have the freedom to access and choose the content they want. Parents should take responsibility for guiding their children's exposure to appropriate materials, and society should respect individual choices in this regard.
771	3748	2	2	Should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The answer is yes. Children should not be exposed to certain inappropriate content. Some books and magazines are too explicit for children of certain ages. Children should read books that are suitable for their age group. If they read inappropriate books, they may start to imitate the behavior in those books. Parents should attempt to remove all offensive books for their children as this can have a negative impact on them. Children at a specific age should read books that are at their level and appropriate for them. Currently, certain books, magazines, music, and movies are too explicit for kids. It is believed that they should all be blocked and kept out of children's reach. If children listen to inappropriate music and read offensive books, it may affect their behavior. Children should not be exposed to things that could potentially influence their thinking. Considering the world we live in today, one can only imagine the impact it would have on kids if they read horrible books and listen to bad music. Parents should do their best to keep certain inappropriate things away from their children. They should protest and call meetings to ensure that libraries remove inappropriate items from the shelves for kids. By doing so, they are fulfilling their role as good parents. Sometimes, kids may not always agree with what their parents say, but they need to understand that it is in their best interest. Parents should not always strive to be their child's friend because, at times, kids may take advantage. This is based on personal experience as sometimes people can mistake kindness for weakness. As a parent, one should be prepared for such situations. In conclusion, explicit magazines, books, and music should be removed from the reach of kids. Exposure to such content may not always be beneficial for them.
772	3749	2	2	If I had the right to remove offensive books, music, magazines, or other materials from a library, I would not do so. Everyone has the right to read, listen to, and view whatever they desire. If people truly do not want to see offensive materials, they should not seek them out in the first place. Some parents believe that offensive books should not be available as they may affect their children, but this would bring about a change in children's education. Everyone has the freedom to read whatever they like. There are diverse people with different reading preferences. If books were to be removed from the library, it could lead to a situation where all books are taken out. In any case, everyone will encounter offensive books at some point in their lives. Parents who are concerned about what their children read in the library should educate themselves about their children's reading materials and prohibit them from accessing inappropriate ones. In my opinion, if parents take the time to explain the good and bad aspects of life to their children, the content may not seem as offensive to them. Another reason for not removing books from the library is that it would impact the education of many children. Removing books means taking away historical knowledge. In history, there are many painters who have depicted nude women, which some people find offensive. However, this history should not be removed as children are learning about their heritage. Books, music, magazines, and other materials should not be removed from libraries. These items are important for everyone, regardless of whether they read or not. Removing them would cause chaos. Libraries should remain as they are, and everyone should have the right to read, listen to, and view whatever they want.
773	3750	2	2	Should offensive material be removed from library shelves? Many people find materials such as books, movies, music, and magazines in libraries offensive, but does this mean they should be removed? Along with many others, I believe that libraries should not censor offensive materials. Censoring libraries would neglect parental responsibilities, harm the profitable media industry, and be unconstitutional. Parents are responsible for their children, not only in providing food and shelter but also in controlling their exposure to inappropriate or offensive content. If parents do not want their children to be exposed to vulgar shows, texts, or music, they should prevent it. For example, if a child is listening to a sexual song on their iPod, parents have the right to take it away as it is a privilege, not a right. In addition to neglecting parental responsibilities, censoring offensive material would have a significant economic impact on the media. Most media attracts audiences because of the inappropriate content in shows, books, and music. If this content is censored, fewer movie tickets will be sold, fewer books will be purchased, and less music will be listened to. In a time when the economy is emerging from a recession, it is more beneficial to generate as much income as possible rather than eliminating profit - making opportunities. Both of these points are valid, but most importantly, censoring libraries would be unconstitutional. The preamble of the constitution grants us the rights to freedom of speech and press, which includes offensive materials. Although amendments can be added to define appropriate speech and press, it would be difficult for officers to monitor. Moreover, a large amount of jail space would be needed to detain those smuggling inappropriate materials. In brief, censoring libraries is a bad idea in terms of parental responsibilities, media economics, and constitutional rights. The negative consequences of censoring far outweigh the benefits. Clearly, censoring is not the solution to dealing with offensive material.
774	3751	2	2	Imagine yourself in a place of peace and tranquility, a world of endless possibilities. You are in a library where on either side, there is a vast collection of diverse adventures and stories. Each book holds the key to a world of knowledge and adventure. As you search for an adventure of your own, drifting through each section, you suddenly turn a corner and see some books and magazines with provocative and inappropriate pictures openly displayed. You quickly avert your eyes, disturbed by the offensive images, and rush down the hallway to another section, thinking about how unnecessary those images were and how they are now imprinted in your mind. Libraries typically offer a wide range of materials. Since libraries are used by people of all ages, races, and genders, some form of censorship should be implemented. Due to the diverse group of people in the world with different views, opinions, and morals, some content in libraries should be censored. This censorship is not limited to inappropriate images but also includes religious, political, and cultural innuendos. Censorship should be applied throughout the library. However, I do not think that certain books should be removed from the shelves because it violates the right to speech, which encompasses written speech. Instead, they should be sectioned off and clearly marked to warn those who do not wish to be exposed to the content. Libraries are one of the primary resources for research, reading, and gaining knowledge. Most people have used, are using, or will use a library in their lifetime, including children and families. Children do not need to be exposed to some of the content found in libraries. I do not think the books should be removed from the shelves but should be placed in a location where children cannot easily find them. Children's minds are rapidly developing, and they are often influenced by the images they see. A child is more likely to remember an image for a longer time than an adult. Therefore, it is not good for children to see offensive things. Moving the books to a new location where children are less likely to stumble upon them is the best option. Another reason for not completely removing the books is that everyone has the right to express their opinions and feelings about a subject, and others have the right to respond. Just because someone finds something offensive does not mean they can take it away from others. If a person wants to read such materials, they have the right to do so. At the same time, those who do not want to see them should have the option to avoid them. This is why the books should not be openly accessible to all but should be moved to a secluded section. In conclusion, the best way to deal with offensive material in libraries is not to remove it completely but to section it off. This way, everyone has the choice to access or avoid certain materials, and the library can become a better environment for all users.
775	3752	2	2	"I do not believe that any materials should be removed from a library just because someone finds them offensive. People have the right to read what they want, and authors have the right to write what they want. One of the fundamental principles is the freedom of speech, which gives people the right to express themselves through words, including written words. Libraries are designed to store various materials such as books, magazines, music, and movies. If people start removing these items, the purpose of a library will be defeated. If all materials are removed, there will be no reason for people to visit libraries. The concept of freedom of speech means that people can write whatever they want. If others find it offensive, they can simply choose not to read it. Freedom of expression also allows people to engage with such materials if they wish. I have a personal experience related to this. I love music, as do my two best friends. One of them went to the library to find music, and we all listened to it. He discovered some bands that I had never heard of, and I really liked them. If someone had considered these bands ""offensive"" and removed their music from the library, I would never have had the chance to enjoy them. This is why I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries. Removing them not only deprives others of potentially enjoyable experiences but also destroys historical and cultural records. Libraries have been around for a long time and store a vast amount of information. It would be a great loss to deny future generations the opportunity to read these wonderful works that authors have put a lot of effort into creating."
776	3753	2	2	Libraries offer a wide range of materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines, for public access. The issue of library censorship is complex as people hold diverse views. Materials deemed offensive by some should not necessarily be removed from library shelves. A library serves the general public, and individuals who encounter offensive materials should simply look elsewhere. However, libraries do have the right to censor offensive materials if the community strongly supports it. Conversely, if the community opposes the censorship of a particular material, their opinion should be considered. While some library materials may be offensive to certain groups, this does not justify their removal, as in @LOCATION1, the right to free speech is protected. Even though @LOCATION1 has banned books offensive to @CAPS1, other countries in @LOCATION2 may have these books in their libraries. Determining whether a material is offensive is a subjective matter. An individual's opinion should not be the sole basis for removal, but if the entire community deems a book offensive, then action can be taken. Libraries and the community can choose to remove offensive books from the shelves if they are offensive to everyone. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a difficult topic that requires careful consideration of different perspectives.
777	3754	2	2	I don't think magazines should be taken off the shelves. Some people find everything offensive, while others, like me, find some of the so - called offensive stuff humorous. I understand that people with different sexualities or ethnicities may be more easily offended. But aside from that, there should be no censorship. Censorship makes the place implementing it seem overly strict, which may discourage people from visiting. Also, you never know if the thing you want will be censored. I get that parents want to protect their kids from bad influences. But as children grow older, they will be exposed to adult - type material. Parents should be more lenient and not punish their kids too harshly when this happens. I understand that some parents are strict about censorship, but eventually, children need to learn about certain things. Allowing them to access such content around the age of @NUM1 seems reasonable. Some people's poor judgment in deciding what to censor can affect everyone. In conclusion, censorship should be minimized to respect individual choices and the natural process of a child's growth.
778	3755	2	2	Picture a sunny day, sitting under a tree, engrossed in one of your favorite books, feeling the wind in your hair and immersed in the story. You read at home and at school. But what if you couldn't read that book because it offended someone at school? It would be unfair to ban a book just because of one person's opinion. At my school, teachers encourage us to read more. However, most teenagers are busy with after - school activities like band, sports, theater, and choir, so they rarely have time to read. I was shocked when I heard about the debate on removing offensive books and magazines. I don't think it's a good decision. Kids should have the freedom to read what they like. Not all kids are the same. Just as not all kids like corn, not all kids like the same types of books. I enjoy romantic and mystery novels, while others may prefer different genres. Some novels have graphic content, like @CAPS1, which has a lot of fighting. Should we remove all @CAPS1 - related materials just because a mother doesn't want her son exposed to fighting? Similarly, some parents don't want their kids reading about vampires and werewolves in the @CAPS3 series. Should we ban these movies and books? I don't think so. Also, not everyone is offended by the same thing. For example, @ORGANIZATION2. In my family, my brother and I believed in @LOCATION1, but my cousins don't teach their kids about it. If their kids are offended when I read @ORGANIZATION1 to them, should we get rid of it? No. In conclusion, offensive novels should not be removed from shelves. Kids should have choices, not everyone has the same sensibilities, and if we removed all offensive books, there would be little left to read.
779	3756	2	2	There are numerous books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that are offensive to people. Whether they should be removed depends. If something is extremely inappropriate, it might be removed. When I encounter an offensive book, I simply ignore it. Just because I'm not allowed to read it doesn't mean I should take it off the shelf. It's a pity that we have to worry about such things. I think movies are the most offensive medium. Many movies have inappropriate scenes, bad language, and scary parts. Some movies are also mis - rated. For example, a @NUM1 - rated movie was extremely scary; I watched it as a sophomore and was frightened. Even some children's movies have hidden inappropriate content. Video games are also a problem. Some kids who play a lot think only about killing, guns, and war, and some even start to think it's cool to point weapons at others. Magazines in grocery stores or gas stations often have inappropriate content that children shouldn't see. Different music genres can also send bad messages. Some radio stations bleep out words like drugs and alcohol but keep curse words. It's hard to understand this double - standard. These offensive things are a concern, but what can we do? We can voice our opinions, but we don't always get what we want. In conclusion, while these offensive elements in various media are a problem, there isn't an easy solution due to different opinions and lack of consensus.
780	3757	2	2	I believe people have the right to know and learn about various things, even if they are offensive. Just because one person finds something offensive doesn't mean others will. If someone thinks an educational film from the late @NUM1's about @ORGANIZATION1 is racist, they should be more open - minded. Similarly, just because a book has vulgar language doesn't mean it should be removed from library shelves, as most books have something controversial. I once read a book in my freshman year of high school that deeply offended me. It described members of the @PERSON2 planning to lynch a black person, which was extremely hurtful as I have a black family member. Katherine Paterson's quote about removing books is insightful. If we start removing books based on offensive content, there will be no books left on the shelves. This would lead to an uprising as many people rely on books for daily reading. In conclusion, it's impossible to get rid of books with vulgar language or offensive content because doing so would mean removing almost all books, and people would lose the opportunity to learn.
781	3758	2	2	In my view, censorship in libraries due to offensive material is unnecessary. People will inevitably encounter offensive content in what they read, see, and hear, and it's impossible to control everything that offends us. While freedom of speech exists, it isn't absolute. We should stop over - reacting to things said in the past. For instance, some @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are still upset about slavery, which occurred over a @NUM1 @DATE1 @DATE1 ago. Censoring certain materials means people won't learn from past mistakes. We need to end the over - protection in libraries. Children should know about the past to shape a better future. I question the motives of those who want to censor library materials. Are they protecting their children or acting out of self - interest? In conclusion, material shouldn't be censored just because it offends someone. I've been offended by what I've read but haven't tried to get it censored. Sometimes, we just have to tolerate things we don't like.
782	3759	2	2	I firmly believe that if the sole purpose of an item is for reading, it should be available in a library. Magazines, comics, books, music, and movies should be fully accessible in libraries. This is because people learn in diverse ways. Visual learners understand better by observing, auditory learners prefer having content read to them, and readers can do both and also read independently. I'm aware that not everyone is literate, but occasional library visits could help. However, for this to be effective, libraries must offer more than just reading materials, as illiterate citizens need to gradually learn to read. My goal is to ensure everyone has the opportunity to learn to read, as it unlocks numerous possibilities. Many people haven't reached the reading stage yet, so a calm and relaxing township library is an ideal place to start learning.
783	3760	2	2	"There are numerous reasons why removing books, movies, or other items from library shelves is wrong. If an item is violent or sexual, there may be a case for its removal. But if a reader simply dislikes a book or movie, they should choose something else instead of trying to have it removed. If everyone removed the books they didn't like, there would be little left to read, as everyone has books they dislike or find offensive. No book can be perfect for every individual, and everyone has their own views on literature. If a book isn't what you're looking for, put it back and stop reading. Many people say, ""If you don't like it, then don't listen to it,"" and they're absolutely right. Forcing yourself to consume content you can't stand will only make you angry, and then you'll complain about it being on the shelves. This is what starts the claims of offensiveness. People know their preferences, so they should avoid what they don't like. It all boils down to common sense. We all have it and should start using it. For example, if you like country music, don't listen to hard rock or rap. If we all focus on what we like and ignore the rest, everything will be fine."
784	3761	2	2	History has a tendency to repeat itself, so we must seize this opportunity to safeguard the future of @LOCATION2. Censoring certain items in libraries is like a mother keeping a child out of the kitchen to prevent burns. It's a way to protect young minds, which are like sponges, absorbing everything they see and hear. The potential negative effects of unrestricted access are far worse than the minor inconvenience of adults having to reach a bit higher for a book. By limiting the material available to children and teenagers, we can prevent the recurrence of past problems such as racism, poverty, assassinations, and religious protests. The @ORGANIZATION1 emphasizes that children are the future, so we should make an effort to shield them from inappropriate content. I recall a story from my past. There was a 13 - year - old girl in my class who got pregnant because she read a book that explained what guys wanted. The book belonged to her mother, who left it on the table and forgot to return it to the library. The girl shared the book's content with her friends, and it influenced her actions. This incident makes me support the idea of placing books on different or higher shelves. My two younger sisters already face challenges like being picked on at school due to their clothes, religion, or music preferences. They shouldn't have to worry about the potentially harmful books they might pick up at the library. My siblings inspire me to make the world a better place. Censoring what children read and listen to allows them to be children. When they consume media, they make decisions that can have lifelong consequences. For example, some new songs have inappropriate lyrics that are easily accessible on YouTube. These can lead children to make poor choices like early pregnancy or drug use. Our country is facing an economic low, partly because the youth don't take life seriously. By focusing on censorship, we can achieve something significant. We should be proud to help children learn better, act better, and fulfill their dreams. If more students read books like '@LOCATION1' or 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2,' it shows that they can be inspired by positive content. Many young women in my sophomore class loved 'the @CAPS3 series,' which led them to read other vampire books. This shows that there is good, stimulating material out there. We have a say in the future, so we should make it easier for children by eliminating inappropriate content. In my opinion, children and adults should have separate access to television shows, magazines, and books. Censorship in libraries can reduce the impact of false information on children. Just as we wouldn't tell a five - year - old everything we know, we should protect children from maturing too quickly.
785	3762	2	2	In my opinion, censorship should be allowed in libraries, but not based on personal dislike. People have different preferences regarding the types of books they like and should read. Removing books or other materials just because someone doesn't like them is not a good idea. Many people believe that exploring different materials helps them find the right information. Limiting the books in libraries would reduce the available resources for obtaining information. It can be difficult for people when the information they need is not available in local libraries. Libraries should provide access to all the books, music, movies, and magazines that people want and need. Instead of removing books from the shelves, more materials should be added to ensure that all necessary information is accessible. In conclusion, we should maintain a diverse collection in libraries to meet the various information - seeking needs of people.
786	3763	2	2	Books and movies serve as avenues for numerous individuals to exercise their imagination and creativity. Removing certain books from the shelves in @MONTH1 can have a detrimental impact on people. Certain books, music, movies, and magazines are not always as objectionable as some people perceive. People hold diverse views on what constitutes good and bad, so it is not feasible to remove certain books. As Katherine Paterson aptly stated, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' It is essential to keep every book on the shelves. Through my personal observations, reading, and experiences, I will demonstrate that these books belong on our shelves.  First, I have witnessed younger children selecting numerous books from the shelves, some of which may not be entirely suitable for them. From my observations, I believe that this exposure aids in their growth. Young children are naturally curious and should have the opportunity to explore a wide range of materials. Honestly, if the content is truly inappropriate, they are likely to forget about it the next day. Personally, I think that exposing them to what we consider 'bad things' can deter them from seeking similar content in the future and help them distinguish between right and wrong.  Second, I have encountered many magazines, read numerous books, and watched several movies that I probably should not have. However, I believe that these experiences have made me a better person by discouraging me from engaging in the 'bad things' depicted. For instance, reading books about slavery and war has inspired me to strive for a better world. While the thought of younger children being exposed to such negativity in the world may give me pause, I also believe that they have the ability to discern between right and wrong.  Finally, I have witnessed children and young adults misusing the library by accessing movies that are not appropriate for their age. This may lead some people to advocate for the removal of certain books from the shelves. While it is necessary to restrict access to certain books for young children, it is not advisable to deny access to everyone. As older and more experienced adults, we need to recognize that not all content is bad. What may be inappropriate for our young ones may be suitable for others. For example, a family member who is a photographer uses nude magazines and movies as a source of inspiration for their work. Not all nude movies and magazines are misused, and we should all be aware of this.  In conclusion, I understand the reasons for removing some books, magazines, and movies, but I do not believe it is the right approach. I do not think that a particular book is offensive to everyone; it may only be offensive to certain individuals. Different people have different needs for books and movies, and not all of them are used for negative purposes. We need to work together to ensure that certain books are kept out of the reach of young people to prevent misuse. Hopefully, everyone will keep every book on the shelves. As Katherine Paterson said, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' if we remove them.
787	3764	2	2	In this article, I will discuss the way libraries censor their books. I will share my thoughts on this subject and express my perspective on the books available on library shelves. Additionally, I will suggest how libraries should handle this issue by pre - censoring the books on the shelves. I will provide details on whether certain books should be removed from the shelves or not.  I believe that certain materials should not pose a problem if librarians closely monitor what children are reading. The issue can be mitigated by checking book reviews to determine if a book is suitable for a child. However, exposing children to inappropriate material can be problematic. Some children may misinterpret the content of mature books. Therefore, it is crucial to supervise their reading.  The methods used to address this problem can sometimes be extreme. Removing a book from the shelf can deprive older readers of the opportunity to access it. Moreover, what if another person wants the book but cannot obtain it? A better solution is to create a special section for such books, so that young children cannot access them. I think this approach can help solve the problem.  I also believe that libraries could pre - censor books. This would help present the content in an understandable way and improve people's perception of the books. Additionally, libraries could print two versions of a book: one for a more mature audience and one for a younger audience. This would enable younger children to process the information more maturely and recognize that it does not represent real life.  In conclusion, I have a neutral stance on this subject. I think it is not ideal to have inappropriate books on library shelves. However, I believe that libraries can prevent this issue by closely monitoring younger readers and pre - censoring books to make them more suitable for a younger audience.
788	3765	2	2	Libraries offer a wide variety of entertainment options to the community, including romance movies, adventurous novels, dramatic music, comical magazines, and more. However, some of these materials contain inappropriate content. I firmly believe that any library materials with inappropriate content should be censored or removed from public access. This action would benefit children's moral beliefs, enhance the library's family - friendly image, and save money for more valuable resources.  Our children are our most precious asset. They are the future leaders of our country and the world. From a young age, we teach them our moral values. However, if they are exposed to inappropriate content in the library, their moral views may be negatively influenced. They may assume that such content is acceptable in society because it is available in a library.  The library is regarded as one of the most educational institutions. If it contains inappropriate materials, its image will be tarnished. To maintain a positive self - image, the library needs to censor such content. Many parents will be reluctant to take their children to the library if they know that there are magazines depicting death and murder on the shelves.  Censoring library materials can also result in significant cost savings. Many pornographic materials and uncensored movies are expensive. By purchasing appropriate materials instead, the library can save money and use it to buy better books at a lower cost.  The library plays a vital role in the community. We need libraries in our lives and those of our children. However, parents will not take their children to the library if they believe the materials are unsuitable. Therefore, libraries should censor inappropriate content to make parents feel safe when bringing their children. The library is a fun place, and it would be even better if all the materials were of high quality.
789	3766	2	2	Certain books, magazines, and music have a mature or graphic nature. Similar to movies, music often has ratings. These materials generally do not need to be removed from libraries, except in elementary school libraries. Language arts materials in libraries are usually organized in an orderly manner, allowing younger children to access age - appropriate books or materials of their choice.  Music comes with ratings as a warning. Children should not be allowed to purchase mature - level books. Books, movies, and music are all created for specific audiences. For example, if a movie is rated @CAPS1, it is intended for an eighteen - and - above audience. Libraries are arranged to cater to children, adults, and teens. Children should stay within their age - appropriate sections.  If there are mature or graphic books in a children's library, it can cause conflicts, and any parent would agree with this. The only way to share these mature materials without conflict is through public libraries that are divided to accommodate all age groups.
790	3767	2	2	Every year, an increasing number of books that are significant to literature are being removed from the shelves of local libraries and classrooms. Although these books @MONTH1 may contain some offensive writing, they have still had a profound impact on @CAPS1 culture. Along with books, many movies and magazines are also being removed from the shelves due to offensive material. Just because some materials @MONTH1 contain offensive content does not give people the right to make them inaccessible and deprive the public of what they enjoy.  Is it right to remove offensive material from libraries? Definitely not. Many people enjoy books, magazines, and movies of this nature. In fact, removing such materials is more likely to harm the library's business. This type of content is an integral part of @CAPS1 culture. People are more interested in reading about what's happening in @LOCATION1 and the latest trends than about the local animal shelter. Removing these materials will only reduce the library's popularity and the number of customers it attracts.  Artists write about what they love and how they feel. How can someone tell an author that their writing is too graphic or offensive? That is the author's choice of subject matter and a way of self - expression. By criticizing books, magazines, or songs with offensive content, officials undermine the creativity and uniqueness of authors. If an author or artist has a great, original idea for a new song or book but is concerned that libraries will not carry it because it is slightly offensive, they are likely to abandon the idea. By removing offensive books, songs, and movies, the public is being deprived of creative and imaginative writing.  In conclusion, the removal of offensive books, magazines, movies, and songs is harmful to the public and the libraries themselves. Future generations @MONTH1 may never even hear of 'The @CAPS2 of @PERSON1' just because it uses racial terms. So, if you were in this situation, would you keep or remove?
791	3768	2	2	In this persuasive essay, the central topic is whether offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves. Different people will hold opposing views on this matter. While it's inevitable that this essay may not resonate with some readers, there are circumstances where the audience can understand both perspectives.  Regarding the question of removing offensive media from libraries, it's not advisable to remove all such content. Although there are exceptions, banning all materials is illogical. In my opinion, completely removing materials is an extreme measure. A more practical approach is to place such content in less - accessible areas rather than permanent removal. In today's era, offensive media is often seen as comical and not taken seriously. For example, the show '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' is highly offensive, but people view it as entertainment. This show has a warning label indicating it's suitable for viewers @NUM1 and older, and parents are responsible for monitoring what their children watch. Content creators use their work to express their lives, experiences, and challenges, or simply to make people laugh. It may be offensive to some, but it's a form of self - expression for others.  Secondly, it's illogical to ban everything that might offend. Take religion as an example. One person's religion might offend another, but that doesn't mean it should be banned. People should embrace differences and co - exist. Similarly, when you express yourself through a book, song, or movie, there will always be those who disagree. The @CAPS3 series, for instance, offends some people, and there can be disagreements among viewers. However, we don't remove the entire series because of such differences.  Finally, some offensive media can teach lessons. The show '@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12' (queen of the south) shows the consequences of certain actions. It can prevent people from making regrettable decisions. In conclusion, life is full of things that may offend us, but we should accept them. Libraries should not censor content, as everyone has the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or listen to, and also the freedom to stop.
792	3769	2	2	I believe that just because certain material is offensive to someone, it shouldn't be removed from the shelves. If the material is explicit, permission from a parent or guardian should be required. For example, in stores selling CDs, games, etc., there are age restrictions for purchasing certain items, and the same principle should apply to books.  If a book has a controversial name like '@CAPS1', it shouldn't be removed based on the title alone. We shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Instead, one should pick up the book, read the back, and understand its actual content. If there are concerns, one can talk to the relevant person and explain the problem.  Having an adult - only section in stores or libraries can be very helpful. There are many books with content inappropriate for children, such as love books that discuss passion in an improper way. This section can keep such content out of children's reach, and parents won't have to worry about their children accessing inappropriate materials. Next time you're in a library and see something you don't want your children to see, keep this solution in mind.
793	3770	2	2	Censorship is a highly sensitive issue. Everyone is affected by censorship, either directly or indirectly. Throughout history, there have been numerous complaints and disputes involving the government regarding censorship. If censorship were to be uniformly applied, there would be little left uncensored in the world.  Censorship is a significant concern in the fields of books, newspaper articles, movies, and other literary works. Writers and directors need to create engaging content while ensuring it is appropriate for most audiences. If everyone were to censor every piece of literature or film that offended them, everything in life would be subject to censorship. Inevitably, there will always be situations that offend someone.  Censorship is particularly wrong in the @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 citizens are granted the freedoms of speech and press. Given these fundamental rights, censorship seems to be against the law as it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms. There should be no censorship of books, movies, and newspaper articles, as they are closely related to the freedoms of speech and press. If censorship expands, everything we know today may become censored simply because one person finds it offensive.  Some citizens argue that censorship is beneficial as it protects the nation's youth from inappropriate and offensive content. However, from a teenager's perspective, children will eventually learn about such things. Hiding the truth is pointless. To preserve the five basic freedoms granted by the First Amendment, we should oppose censorship and eliminate it from our society.
794	3771	2	2	Libraries may have books, music, magazines, or movies that some readers find offensive. Personally, I haven't come across an offensive book yet. There are debates about whether such media should be removed from library shelves, and I'm against their removal. It would take more than one person to make such a change.  Library music is valuable because it often includes old music from the @DATE1's that may not be available in music stores. If someone is offended by a particular type of music, like hip - hop, they can look up its history in the library. Understanding the origin of the music may reduce their offense.  Magazines in libraries are great for media enthusiasts. They contain interesting facts about past and future events. For example, @ORGANIZATION1 provides the latest news and big events. Additionally, advertisements in magazines are crucial for businesses to earn money and for people to discover products.  Library movies are useful for teachers to show students. Many of the items in the library can also be found at Blockbuster or Walmart, but libraries often have old movies and historical events. They may even have movies related to the books in the library, which can be helpful for visual learners.  Overall, I hope that music, magazines, and movies remain on library shelves. Some books may already have been removed due to complaints, but it's too late to change that. It will take more than one person to oppose the current situation, and this is my view on keeping these media in libraries.
795	3772	2	2	I believe that everyone has their own opinions on what is appropriate and what isn't. We can't simply ask a few people for their opinions because everyone is different. We all have the right to access books and understand what the author intended to convey. If you don't want your @CAPS1 to read a certain book, explain the reasons to them instead of making other @CAPS1s suffer.  Some parents seem to forget that in the past, people weren't even allowed to have dreams and thoughts. We shouldn't let our @CAPS1s go through the same restrictions. Everyone should have the right to read, listen, and engage with what makes them happy. Just because a book has vulgar language doesn't mean it should be removed. You can tell your @CAPS1 that it's bad language.  Imagine if someone told you that your life story was poorly written and they didn't like the way you worded things. That's your way of expressing yourself because it's your life. We should let our children learn about both the good and bad aspects of life. By exposing them to different things, they can stay away from the negative and appreciate the positive. Let children read whatever they want. If they come across curse words, teach them that it's bad language. Don't get rid of good books, movies, and music just because the author has a different view of life than yours. Open your mind and don't be so narrow - minded.
796	3773	2	2	When sitting in the library, engrossed in homework and preparing for an upcoming test, one would not welcome any disturbances. This essay will discuss the aspects within libraries that should and should not be present. In a library, an environment conducive to study, free from noise and other distractions, is essential.  In today's world, there are numerous offensive elements, including certain individuals and occurrences in our communities. Regarding libraries, some aspects need modification, while others should remain unchanged. There are books that may not be suitable for young children, yet they are appreciated by other patrons. Instead of removing these books from the shelves, they should be relocated to areas less accessible to younger children. It would be unfair to remove books simply because some consider them inappropriate for children; they should be placed where older children can access them.  Personally, listening to music aids concentration and relaxation during study. However, when others play music too loudly, it becomes a nuisance, and this is an issue that libraries need to address. Additionally, some movies are highly offensive and should be removed from the library's collection. Magazines also require scrutiny as they come in various types with diverse content. Any offensive materials should be removed from the shelves.  People should be more considerate of others. In a world full of potentially offensive elements, over - sensitivity can lead to misunderstandings and negative consequences. In conclusion, libraries should strike a balance between providing a wide range of materials and ensuring a suitable environment for all patrons, especially those seeking a quiet place to study.
797	3774	2	2	I oppose the removal of offensive materials such as books, movies, or magazines from library shelves. There are several reasons for this stance. First, inappropriate materials should be placed in sections where children are less likely to access them. Second, when a child checks out a book, the library should verify the child's age to ensure the material is appropriate. Third, adults have a need for certain materials that may be considered inappropriate for children, and these materials should remain on the shelves in the adult section of the library.  Libraries should not have inappropriate materials readily accessible to children. Parents should not have to worry about their children being exposed to unsuitable content. Some libraries currently allow children to check out books, magazines, or music without proper age verification, which is a problem. Just as movies are rated to inform parents about the content, libraries should also take steps to ensure that children access only age - appropriate materials.  Parents should monitor what their children read and see. Inappropriate materials can be useful for adults in certain situations, as there is material that adults may need for personal growth or knowledge. In conclusion, libraries should prevent children from accessing inappropriate materials, implement age - verification for such materials, and continue to provide adults with access to these resources.
798	3775	2	2	If you were an author, would you find it fair for your creation to be removed from the shelves because it offended someone? In my view, while there are some materials, including movies, books, music, and magazines, that may be considered inappropriate, no one should have the right to remove them from the shelves simply because they are offended.  If everyone could remove something from a shelf due to personal offense, there would be nothing left. Virtually everything has the potential to offend someone. For example, I once read a book that stereotyped cheerleaders. As a lifelong cheerleader, I was a bit offended because the description did not match my experience. However, it was my choice to read the book, and I would not demand its removal from the market just because I, as an individual, did not like it.  My approach is to ignore things I don't like or refrain from purchasing offensive items. I understand that the intended audience of some books or movies may not be the only ones who encounter them. For instance, a child may come across a movie with inappropriate language or scenes. In such cases, one should simply move on and focus on materials suitable for them. Parents should also censor what their children see, hear, and read.  It is unfair to remove an artist's work, whether it is music, a book, a magazine, or a movie, from display. These creators have put in a great deal of effort. Just because a work is not suitable for one person does not mean it won't be appreciated by others. In conclusion, it is unjust to remove items from the market because they do not please a few individuals. Artists have invested time and hard work, and there are likely people who will enjoy these works. Everyone should learn to deal with potentially offensive materials or simply ignore them.
799	3776	2	2	Without books, our knowledge would be severely limited. It is as crucial as the heart is to the body. Books, along with music, movies, and magazines, offer real - life insights and help us understand various aspects of the world. They are created for a purpose and are valuable learning tools.  I understand the concerns of parents, guardians, and caregivers. However, they need to recognize that what they consider inappropriate for society may actually be beneficial to others. Different people have different perspectives. Not all books, movies, music, or magazines are bad. Many of them are suitable for different age groups and can enhance our understanding of various subjects.  For example, movies often have age ratings such as '@NUM1, @CAPS1', which help parents make informed decisions. Music can be checked for inappropriate content by looking at the song details. Magazines come in a wide range of topics suitable for all ages, allowing individuals to choose what is appropriate for themselves or their children.  Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what is right for their children or themselves. One should not blame others for their opinions. These materials exist for a reason, and they contribute to our growth and learning. Without them, the world would be a less - informed place. We should accept and make the best use of these resources. In conclusion, we should recognize the value of these materials and use them appropriately to enrich our lives and the lives of those around us.
800	3777	2	2	In my opinion, offensive materials should not be removed from the shelves. People who are offended by certain materials should simply ignore them. If everyone focused on offensive entertainment, they would be constantly upset. Most offensive things may be just jokes or attempts to gain attention.  Think about the television shows we watch daily; many of them have at least one offensive moment. For instance, I watch a show that makes racial remarks about @CAPS1 - @CAPS2. I don't pay attention to it because I know it's a ploy to increase ratings, and I'll still watch the show the next night.  If historical figures had taken every negative comment to heart, our black culture and history would not be as '@CAPS3' as it is today. We should not take everything too seriously, as everyone has a sense of humor.  If we removed all offensive materials, many of our favorite actors and singers would not be as famous as they are today. Award shows and the music industry would be completely different. There are various music genres, and some of the lyrics may be offensive, but they are still released because they are just words.  In conclusion, anyone and anything can be offensive or offended. People should not take everything seriously, as it may just be a joke or the act of an attention - seeker. As my mother used to say, 'Sticks and stones may break your bones but words only make you'. We should not take the media too seriously, as it is often a source of entertainment with a wide range of content.
801	3778	2	2	The current learning content for young people needs to be reformed as it would be beneficial to society. Regarding books, they vary widely. Some may contain offensive language. When encountering such language, one doesn't have to read it aloud. Instead, alternative words can be used, or the offensive parts can be skipped. Some books may have sexual content that could offend a particular race or gender. If a book is inappropriate for one's age group, it's advisable to choose a different one. However, it could always be worse.  Music also requires censorship. When listening to the radio, CDs, or iPods, it's not always possible to censor the content oneself. Radio companies should do a better job of censoring offensive language in songs. Many young teens think using vulgar language is cool.  Movies have different ratings for different age groups. No one would let a two - year - old watch a rated @CAPS2 movie as it would likely give the child nightmares. Censorship would assist parents in choosing the right movie for family nights.  Magazines are often full of gossip, either highlighting people's good or bad aspects. Since they are discussing someone's life, there should be some form of censorship.  It's well - known that kids are like sponges, repeating what they hear and see. So, what they read or watch can have a significant impact. Some degree of censorship is necessary. Without it, it's hard to imagine what the world would be like. The world would be filled with unmotivated people. However, removing too much would leave the world with nothing to do. I recall when I was a child, hearing something on the radio and thinking it was cool to say, which left my parents at a loss. As an adult, I don't want my kids to learn such things at a young age.
802	3779	2	2	I don't think that should happen; it would be a bad idea, and I'm certain many people will disagree. One reason is that adults like such things. If this is being done because kids keep accessing them, then create a room marked for @NUM1 and older and install cameras. If kids' parents complain, at least one can say it's all in one room and no kids are allowed.  This shouldn't be a big deal. Kids will have to face such things as they grow up, so they might as well get used to it. It's a problem if they're cursing all the time, but most kids know better. When I was growing up, I was exposed to all that, and I turned out fine. In conclusion, we should accept that kids will be exposed to these things and focus on guiding them rather than trying to completely shield them.
803	3780	2	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3, I'm a student from @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. I firmly believe that offensive materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves. Some students read books daily, and reading keeps them out of trouble. If a student finds an interesting book, they might share it with younger siblings to steer them away from bad behavior.  Offensive books can also teach students valuable lessons. They show the consequences of bad actions, allowing students to learn from others' mistakes and understand what to do or avoid to prevent paying the price for wrongdoings.  Music can be offensive due to the cursing in some songs. However, music can also be a source of motivation and happiness. Some calm music can keep one motivated, while other music with bad vibes can lead to bad behavior. Music is a reflection of life, which is full of offensive things, and one needs to be self - centered to understand its true meaning.  Movies can be offensive because of their actions and titles. But this doesn't mean the movie is a bad story. Movies are enjoyable and relatable, and their actions and drama can make them very interesting.  Magazines can be offensive too, depending on their content. However, some magazines show appropriate things for children and adults, and they offer activities for families and friends. The quality of a magazine depends on its cover and the creator.  In conclusion, while there are offensive elements in these materials, we need to learn to separate ourselves from the negative. We have the ability to think independently and shouldn't blindly follow the information in these materials. That's why I believe offensive materials should be removed from the shelves. Sincerely, @ORGANIZATION1
804	3781	2	2	Removing literature from the shelves just based on personal opinion is unjust. People have diverse views on what is appropriate. If one doesn't like a certain book or doesn't want their children to read it, they can simply avoid the library.  In a public library, one must be old enough to obtain a library card. So, it's unlikely that a card - holder will find a book that is inappropriate for their age, though they might find a book immature. Public libraries are places for learning. If someone wants to learn about offensive topics, they should have the right to do so. It's unfair if one person's disapproval prevents others from accessing knowledge.  In school libraries, different rules should apply based on the school level. In elementary schools, children are required to read for academic purposes but are too young to be interested in offensive content, so such books are unnecessary. In junior high schools, there should be a limit on offensive materials, but students still have the right to know about the world around them. In senior high schools, students should have the freedom to read whatever they want.  Magazines are a different matter. Many magazines contain advertisements for smoking products or alcoholic beverages, and these should not be available in school libraries. In public libraries, people should have the right to read what they choose.  In conclusion, adults and teens should have the right to learn about what they like, while children should be protected while they are young. We can't completely shield kids from the world, but we should prevent what we can and support their healthy growth without overly limiting it.
805	3782	2	2	People worldwide have different views on music, books, and movies. Some believe that books and music should have ratings, while others think there's no need. Rating systems prevent young kids from buying materials they are not mature enough for and help parents monitor what their children access.  If anyone could remove books or magazines, there would be no materials left. That's why we have maturity levels, like '@CAPS1' for mature, which warns parents about possible sexual content in videos or songs. This gives parents some control over what their kids watch and hear.  Stores don't allow kids under @NUM1 to buy rated @CAPS4 movies. Rated @CAPS4 indicates sexual acts, offensive language, blood, and sometimes drugs. I'm glad my nine - year - old can't buy such movies, but the law allowing @NUM1 - year - olds to watch them implies they are considered mature enough.  We should be thankful for having some control over our children's media consumption. However, getting rid of all bad books and movies is impossible as new ones will be created over time, and old copies can be found online. We can't protect our kids forever; they will grow up and decide for themselves if they are mature enough to watch or listen to certain things. Our role is to raise them as well as we can.
806	3783	2	2	In today's literary landscape, it's easy to find a topic that piques one's interest. Science fiction, thriller, romance, and even guides on building a car with household materials are all available at your local bookstore or library. Given this wide range of topics, it's not surprising that some authors choose to challenge societal norms and write controversial books. These books often end up on a 'burn list' or censorship list and are removed from local library shelves to shield library patrons from their ideas. While some argue that this is a way to keep society pure, the censorship of literary works is likely one of the most significant mistakes a civilization can make.  Removing books from library shelves is a form of censorship, which clearly violates the @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION1, every individual has certain inalienable rights, outlined in the first ten amendments of the @CAPS1. One of these rights is the freedom of speech, the right to express one's opinion. By removing a book from a library shelf, the author's voice is silenced, and their freedom of speech is taken away. This blatant violation of the @CAPS1 is unconstitutional and illegal in the @LOCATION1. Openly disregarding the @CAPS1 sets a dangerous precedent, allowing for other rights to be violated. It could lead to the president becoming a dictator, the country turning communist, and many other undesirable scenarios, rendering the @CAPS1 meaningless. Without the @CAPS1, the @LOCATION1 would be directionless, similar to any other country, and this would trigger a downward spiral in society.  Silencing authors also stifles the introduction of new ideas into society. Each year, thousands of new books are introduced to the @CAPS8 public, many of which contain novel ideas that shape the future of society. If these books are removed from shelves and out of the public's hands, all change driven by new ideas in society comes to a halt. Society would remain stagnant at the level it was when censorship began, with no room for improvement.  Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel '@CAPS9 @NUM1' by @PERSON1, book censorship has reached an extreme where all great literary works are banned. Those caught reading a 'thought-provoking' book are imprisoned or killed. The main character, a fireman, is tasked with burning books that encourage critical thinking. In this society, people do nothing but sit at home and watch television all day. While some argue that pornography should be censored, the problem is that once censorship starts, it's difficult to determine where to stop. Censoring pornography could lead to the censorship of romance novels, then magic books, and so on, until even @CAPS10 @CAPS11 or the @CAPS12 are censored. By censoring books and movies that stimulate thinking, society quickly loses interest in higher learning, which can rapidly lead to its collapse.  Although censorship may seem like a good idea, it is one of the most significant mistakes a society can make. It silences voices of change, causing society to stagnate. Not only is it detrimental to society, but it also clearly violates the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1. Let's hope that while we may consider the idea of censorship, we never embark on that dangerous path.
807	3784	2	2	I firmly believe that everything should be available. This includes all magazines, books, and @CAPS1 service. For magazines, there should be a wide variety, such as those focused on cars, trucks, ATVs, MTVs, UTVs, ESPN, golf, Game Informer, and WWE.  Regarding books, all types, including @CAPS2 - @CAPS3, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7 books, should be permitted. Lastly, the @CAPS1 service should be accessible for schoolwork, playing games on any website, and using YouTube on any computer.  All of these should be available because some kids don't have access to certain things at home. By providing them in this setting, it ensures that all children have equal opportunities to explore and learn.
808	3785	2	2	The question 'Book or no Book?' has been a subject of discussion, especially considering that people around the world have diverse interests, whether it's cars, boats, toys, or animals. I strongly believe that a library should offer a wide range of books. Just because one person may not agree with a particular book doesn't mean others shouldn't have the opportunity to read and learn from it.  This is an ongoing national debate, and a decision needs to be made promptly. There are too many conflicts arising over this issue. I was asked to share my opinion, and I believe that people should be allowed to check out any book they want. If someone disagrees with the availability of certain books, they don't have to engage with them.  There are several solutions to this problem. Libraries could create different sections for various types of books, sorting them by class or hobbies. Age limits could also be implemented to prevent children from accessing inappropriate materials. This way, those who disagree with certain books won't even have to see them.  I'm eager to see the outcome of this debate. I hope the right decision is made. While my opinion is just one perspective, I believe it's important to consider the diverse needs and interests of library users. No matter the decision, there will be those who are unhappy and those who are pleased. Thank you, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, for allowing me to share my thoughts.
809	3786	2	2	I'm of the opinion that books deemed offensive or sexual shouldn't be completely removed from library shelves. Instead, they should be placed in a specific section of the library restricted to adults. Kids are naturally curious, and if they see something that interests them and they think they can learn from it, they'll pick it up unless someone intervenes.  I don't think kids should be exposed to such content, as some children are already being exposed to things they shouldn't be. These types of books could exacerbate the problem. Some books convey bad messages, and they're meant for adult readers, so they should be kept away from children. Exposure to such content could cause kids to live in a fantasy world, develop a split personality, or have other negative effects.  If a child wants to check out such a book, they should either present an ID or be accompanied by a parent who confirms their permission. While I wouldn't want my kids exposed to this kind of material until they're @NUM1 years old, I know some parents aren't as concerned.  In conclusion, the best solution to this problem is to keep these books out of children's reach or set a specific age limit. This way, we can balance the availability of diverse reading materials with the need to protect children from inappropriate content.
810	3787	2	2	Does censorship truly benefit or hinder our libraries? Does it attempt to conceal what might be happening in the world, or does it aim to make us feel content in this often dreadful place we call home? One person may find a book offensive, while their neighbor might perceive it in an entirely different, positive light. It all boils down to perspective.  Personally, I believe that removing so - called 'offensive' books from libraries could be a disaster. This year, in my @CAPS1 class, we read the book '@CAPS2 @NUM1'. It was about a dystopia where books that didn't convey the 'right' message to society were burned. People in that world were emotionally numb, and this could be the consequence of censorship in libraries across the @LOCATION1. Libraries are places that ignite the imagination of people of all ages. If we censor content, how can that spark of imagination be kindled?  Looking back at books that were labeled 'offensive', removed from library shelves, and banned from @CAPS1 classes in schools, many were about women's rights and @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Some contained profanity, while others were set in dystopian worlds. If we were to remove all books related to these topics, how many would remain? My best friend is an @CAPS3 @CAPS6 girl, and we both have equal rights and jobs. So, what's the big deal with dwelling in the past? Moreover, cursing is inevitable in our daily lives, on the streets, in schools, and sometimes even in church. If we encounter it in real life, why can't we read about it?  When those in favor of library censorship say things like 'What about the children? I don't want them reading a book I find offensive,' my response is that they should censor their own children. How you raise your kids is your choice, but other parents believe in fostering imagination through a diverse range of reading materials. Having a variety of books to read enriches the mind and doesn't limit our thinking.  In conclusion, I think those who advocate for book censorship are misguided. It could easily get out of control and lead to a dystopian society. Children should have a realistic understanding of the world. The next time you think a book might cause tension, consider whether you're taking away others' rights.
811	3788	2	2	Throughout my life, I've encountered numerous books that strike me as offensive. Nevertheless, these books should not be censored solely because they seem offensive to some. I firmly hold the view that books deemed offensive should remain uncensored. The perception of offensiveness is subjective. What one person finds offensive, another may not. Since classifying something as offensive is a matter of opinion, a book should only be censored if everyone in the world deems it offensive. Otherwise, it should be accessible to the public. In our society, we are granted the right to free self - expression. Censoring offensive books would violate this fundamental right, which is unfair to both the authors and the readers who appreciate these works. If we were to censor every book that someone found offensive, we would be left with no books to read. Different people have different tastes, and a book that some love may be offensive to others. For instance, if a few people adore the @ORGANIZATION1 series, but one reader later finds it offensive and has it censored, the fans of the series might retaliate by censoring the books the other person likes. This cycle would lead to a lack of reading materials. Moreover, offensive books can serve as a reminder of past mistakes. If all books related to the world wars were censored, people would eventually forget the atrocities that occurred, and history might repeat itself. As long as having offensive books is less harmful than the repetition of dreaded events, these books should not be censored. In conclusion, offensive books should not be censored. Doing so would violate the right to free expression and cause us to forget the lessons of history. Without these books, we would have nothing to read.
812	3789	2	2	Eventually, people will come to accept the presence of certain materials. I believe there's no justification for censoring a library. Instead of full - scale censorship, a reasonable approach could be to section off the so - called 'offensive' books, perhaps placing them at the back of the library. We also need to consider the publishers' perspective. They have the right to sell and promote their products. Libraries should not remove books from their shelves just because someone stumbles upon something they consider offensive. We're all aware that libraries and bookstores, like @ORGANIZATION1, may contain content that some find offensive, such as inappropriate pictures, references to drugs, or firearms. However, I believe this content is already adequately censored. Many 'offensive' magazines are placed at the back of the store or sectioned off to prevent people, especially children, from being exposed to them. Some materials are even encased in plastic sleeves, requiring purchase before reading. If an author decides to write and publish a book, they should have the same right as others to have it placed on library shelves and promoted. It's unfair in @LOCATION1 for libraries to censor a book simply because someone else finds it offensive. In conclusion, libraries should refrain from censoring any materials. Whether offensive or not, publishers and authors have the right to publish and promote their works, and the public has the right to access them.
813	3790	2	2	I don't think books should be publicly exploited if they offend certain individuals. However, since I personally don't get offended easily, my opinion may differ from others. If a library receives continuous complaints about a particular book, I can understand their desire to remove it. What I'm suggesting is that if a book only offends a small number of people and doesn't cause a widespread problem, it should be kept in the library. The library can simply inform the offended parties that the book will be kept out of sight, thus resolving the issue. I don't believe librarians intentionally display books that offend the public. They stock books for the purpose of reading and knowledge acquisition. During my many visits to the public library, I've never encountered anything that offended or made me uncomfortable. Books are essential for public reading and the growth of knowledge. Without them, our nation as a whole would suffer because knowledge is crucial for various aspects of life, and the more knowledge we have, the better our lives will be. In conclusion, libraries should retain all books unless a particular book causes a significant problem and people constantly bring up the issue.
814	3791	2	2	Everyone has different views on various matters, and I firmly believe that censorship of books or movies based on individual offense goes against the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of religion and speech. If someone disagrees with a book or movie, they can simply ignore it. People these days tend to over - react with their opinions. They should mind their own business and stop assuming the world revolves around them. In the @LOCATION1, with billions of people, each person perceives things differently. This diversity should be considered when people get angry about a book or movie on a library shelf. For example, I enjoy comedies and the occasional scary movie, while girls may prefer dramas. Just because our preferences differ doesn't mean libraries should only stock a certain type of book or movie. There are movies that I dislike because they conflict with my religious beliefs. However, I don't try to stop others from watching them. Just because I don't believe in something doesn't mean I should judge others. Some people think everyone should see things their way, but this is an unrealistic expectation. In conclusion, people should mind their own business and allow others to read, listen to, and watch whatever they want. Everyone should try to understand each other's viewpoints instead of ignoring them. We should respect the diversity of opinions and not let personal offense lead to censorship.
815	3792	2	2	I believe that what one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. Libraries offer a wide range of materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines. Some of these may seem offensive to some individuals, while others enjoy them. Therefore, these materials should not be taken away from those who appreciate them. Adult novels and explicit music are often considered offensive. However, some people genuinely enjoy consuming this type of content. Taking it away from them is unjust because everyone has different preferences. When people visit a library, they should be able to find something that suits their interests. If the materials people like are removed due to the objections of others, it limits their choices and restricts their access to things they enjoy. Those who find certain materials offensive are entitled to their opinion, but so are those who find them valuable. There should be a diverse range of books, music, and other materials in libraries to appeal to different personalities. Everyone has the right to express their dislike for something. But just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean others won't. Taking away things that people enjoy is unfair. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a variety of materials. People should respect each other's preferences, and censorship based on individual offense should be avoided.
816	3793	2	2	Across the globe, millions of libraries house a vast array of books that can bring about significant and life - changing experiences. A crucial question arises: should libraries discard books of lesser importance and those that are offensive to many? In my view, there are certain books gathering dust on library shelves that need to be removed. Libraries should identify problem - causing books, especially those related to race or religion.  Katherine Paterson strongly opposes removing books from library shelves, but I firmly disagree. I believe libraries should get rid of materials that create tension or are simply taking up space. Race is a highly significant topic today, and books that discriminate against specific ethnicities should be promptly removed from libraries. However, there are exceptions. For example, books about the Civil War and the Underground Railroad should be retained as they document important historical events. In contrast, there are race - related books of little value that offend people, and libraries should address this by removing such offensive books.  Secondly, libraries need to be extremely careful about the music they make available. It's vital to teach children the difference between right and wrong from a young age. If kids are exposed to derogatory music in libraries, they may lose their sense of morality. As Katherine Paterson said, “All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.” This quote also applies to library - displayed music. By exposing children to derogatory music, libraries are creating risks for children and their families. Removing such music would greatly benefit society.  Lastly, Katherine Paterson claims that removing offensive books will leave no books on the shelves. This is a naive and exaggerated statement. With millions of libraries worldwide, each holding thousands of items, it would be beneficial to society to dispose of items causing the most tension. A simple and effective way is to have a sheet at the library checkout asking customers if they found a book offensive. If an item frequently appears on the list, it should be removed. This would benefit everyone as offensive items would no longer be on the shelves with minimal effort from all involved.  In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's stance and believe libraries should immediately remove offensive materials. Race is a controversial topic, and non - historical offensive books should be removed. Derogatory and offensive music in libraries should also go. A public list to identify offensive books is an efficient solution. Libraries must take action to dispose of offensive materials that threaten society.
817	3794	2	2	The question of whether offensive materials should be removed from library shelves is complex, with many people holding different views. To find the true answer, one must consider various races, customs, and beliefs. Some materials are offensive, but should they be removed from our libraries?  Libraries contain thousands of books, and hundreds are published each year, covering genres like romance, action, and horror. Nowadays, many books are being deemed offensive to society. I've read numerous books and rarely found any offensive. However, other materials such as music, movies, and magazines can be offensive.  I remember times when I disliked listening to music, watching movies, or reading magazines. Some contemporary music is extremely poor, with foul language and misinterpreted words. Movies can be offensive in multiple ways, including scary, gory, and sexually explicit scenes. These can teach younger kids about right and wrong and make them aware of life.  I believe all these materials should remain on library shelves. Learning from books, music, movies, and magazines has its merits. Although many things in the world are offensive, it can strengthen society by helping us understand different viewpoints. While it can lead to negative outcomes, there are ways to guide people to understand right from wrong and strive for the best.  Despite the presence of offensive materials on the shelves, I think it's right to keep them. People may get angry or upset when engaging with these materials, but this is part of what shapes us. There will always be offensive content, but how we handle it shows that it's possible to change our views and see the positive side.
818	3795	2	2	In a quote, @PERSON1 discusses the idea of removing provocative books from library shelves to protect children. This is a thought - provoking statement. In daily life, there are things in movies, music, and magazines that children should not be exposed to.  Some movies can be overly provocative. Directors may try to disguise this, but the intent is clear. Some scenes can get out of control, and people wish they could avoid them. Parents try to shield their children from such scenes, as they don't want their kids to get bad ideas. Children may imitate the actors and actresses in movies and end up getting hurt.  Music is particularly problematic. Most songs today contain language, drug references, or sexual content. Parents don't want their children exposed to this too early, as it may lead them down the wrong path. Mothers don't want to have to bail their children out of jail for actions inspired by the songs they like.  Many magazines try to expose women to increase sales, which is unethical. For example, a while back, a magazine took inappropriate pictures of a girl. Parents don't want their children to get the wrong idea from such content. When girls see models in magazines, they may try to imitate them, leading to being underweight, sick, or even using drugs. Parents should take away magazines they don't approve of.  Some parents are too lenient with their children. They should censor what their kids are exposed to. However, some kids may try to bypass these restrictions. People have different views on what is provocative. What one person finds offensive, another may not. It depends on society's perception of the situation. If we start removing movies or music based on offensive content, there will be little left on the shelves.
819	3796	2	2	Libraries are an invaluable global resource, housing a diverse range of books in various styles and genres. However, there is a debate about whether some books are too offensive to be on library shelves. I firmly believe that no book should be denied this right.  Most children who visit libraries know what they want to read and are usually accompanied by an adult. Libraries typically have a children's section, and offensive books are more likely to be found in the teenager or adult sections. It's unlikely that children would seek out these 'offensive' books, and even in today's world where children are exposed to explicit topics, they may not want to read about them.  When a child approaches the checkout desk, the librarian should inform the parent or guardian if a book is unsuitable for the child's age. Since children usually visit libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times. If parents are concerned about what their children read, they can easily decide what is offensive.  Authors should not be penalized for writing what they believe in or enjoy. They invest a great deal of effort in writing and publishing their novels and should be able to showcase their work. If librarians remove books for being offensive to some adults, a large number of books will disappear from the shelves. As the quote for this essay elaborates, people should have the freedom to read whatever they want, whether offensive or not. Whether children can do so depends on their parents.  It's highly unlikely that a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without the guardian's knowledge. While some parents may not care about what their children read, this doesn't mean a revolt is necessary. Parents who are concerned should be more strict about what their children read. Some of the so - called 'offensive' books are actually the best to read.
820	3797	2	2	In today's world, censorship has become a prominent part of the media, encompassing books, movies, songs, and television shows. The government aims to protect children in @DATE1 from corruption, but children will eventually learn about censored content from their friends and peers. I believe censorship is a waste of the government's time, as children in @DATE1's society are exposed to mature information earlier than they should.  Censorship should be more focused on the media that children and young teens consume. It should not be applied to more mature movies and music, such as those with adult content and rap, which are intended for grown - ups and teenagers. If parents allow their children to engage with such media, they presumably believe their children are mature enough to handle it. Moreover, censorship undermines the quality of books, music, and movies.  Certain words are essential for people to express themselves and their views. When they can't use the words they feel best describe them, the quality of their self - expression suffers. People can't be true to themselves when they have to censor their language and are judged for their word choices. I am very open with my language, including inappropriate and vulgar words, as they are part of my nature and help me express myself. While there may be more appropriate words for public use, I would feel inauthentic if I used them. I think censorship is harming our society.  The government is attempting to control us through censorship. I'm not a paranoid person who thinks the government is out to get me, but this is my opinion on censorship. We should eliminate it, as it is changing the way people behave and express themselves. It makes communication and self - expression more difficult. Censorship must be stopped before it ruins the quality of all media.
821	3798	2	2	In today's society, a vast array of movies, books, and music are available, making it impossible for anyone to consume them all. These forms of media come in diverse styles and convey various ideas. Since individuals worldwide have distinct tastes, it would be unjust to remove books or movies from the shelves simply because some people dislike them. The wide variety of media is a reflection of our different beliefs, including religion, social class, and culture.  Music encompasses numerous genres such as rock, rap, hip - hop, country, and jazz. If we were to remove music from the shelves just because someone somewhere found it offensive, we would be left with little to no music at all. While I personally don't get offended easily, I've seen shows that some might find offensive, yet others consider them funny.  Books also have multiple genres. Just like music, if a book contains a bad word or a rude anecdote, some people may not like it. However, books are essential for learning and teaching. For instance, The @CAPS1 is one of the most widely read books globally. If it were removed from the shelves because some people don't believe in it, many aspects of religion and society would change significantly.  Most people do take offense at the idea of removing media they don't like. My view is that if people don't like something, they don't have to read, watch, or listen to it. All businesses in the media industry involve taking risks. It all boils down to one's perspective on books, movies, music, etc.  In conclusion, removing media from the shelves would be a poor decision. We have the freedom to make choices, whether good or bad, right or wrong. Although we may not often think about it, such issues do occur somewhere in the world.
822	3799	2	2	I firmly believe that books should not be removed from library shelves. Without books, we would lack the knowledge necessary to survive in life. Books and other forms of media enable the human race to empathize with one another and learn from past events, preventing us from repeating history. Some books are created for entertainment, while others serve an educational purpose, helping children understand historical events.  Taking books off the shelves in schools and libraries is unjust, especially for children who rely on these resources. In some poor countries, schools may have limited access to books, and these children have few alternatives for learning other than what they are taught in the classroom.   Offensive books should be removed, but books that are meaningful and can help people succeed in life should remain. While some books may seem nonsensical, their existence still has value.  In conclusion, books are of utmost importance. Removing them from shelves would cause a great deal of upheaval as people around the world need to access information about past events and the people involved.
823	3800	2	2	I am deeply concerned about the current state of media and its impact on children. There are certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, that I find offensive to children.  Books can contain unsafe materials. Children may come across @CAPS1 books and other inappropriate content. Music, including music videos, often contains a significant amount of profanity. Movies, like @CAPS1 movies, can have a negative influence on children, as they may imitate what they see on TV. Magazines also sometimes feature inappropriate pictures.  Due to these reasons, I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves. This is to protect children from being exposed to harmful content that can have a detrimental impact on their development.  In conclusion, safeguarding children from inappropriate media is crucial. By removing such materials from public access, we can create a healthier environment for their growth and learning.
824	3801	2	2	Imagine being compelled to enjoy only the same things as everyone else. If your choices were restricted to a limited set of subjects because all other options were discarded, you would likely feel trapped. Given that every individual in the world is unique, I firmly believe that each person should have the unrestricted right to read any book they desire. This opinion is based on personal values, unique interests, and the principle that people should be able to read their preferred books without facing judgment from others.  Regarding personal values, a person in a position of authority may consider a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate according to their values and beliefs. If this person is the library owner, they could remove all related books and movies. This would be unfair to those who enjoy these topics.  Each person has their own unique interests. If someone starts discarding books they are not interested in, the library will lose visitors who find those topics enjoyable. This can lead to problems for the library and disappointment for those who use reading as a way to pass time. People should not be forced to read only what is selected by others.  People also have the right to read the books they like without being judged. I know from personal experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. If everyone conformed to the same actions, our world would never achieve anything extraordinary. Many people find inspiration in books and movies, and limiting these to specific subjects would make people feel pressured to be the same.  In conclusion, the choice of books should be up to the individual. A wide range of books and movies allows people to learn about different things and develop an open - minded perspective. Everyone in the world should have the right to read, watch, and enjoy what makes them happy, free from the constraints of others' values and interests.
825	3802	2	2	How would you react if your child saw a naked picture or was constantly exposed to vulgar language from a song available in the library? A library is supposed to be a learning center, not a place filled with inappropriate content. In today's world, many things are changing for the worse, including television, books, and music, which are becoming increasingly unwholesome.  We must take action to prevent this inappropriate content from reaching our children. Some people are attracted to media with bad behavior, often because of the catchy beats or because their friends like it. People seem to be more inclined to follow rather than lead. As people grow up, their idols, whether singers, writers, or actors, often change for the worse, getting involved in drugs or being consumed by fame.  Libraries are for people of all ages. If a child discovers something inappropriate in a library and tells their friends or parents, it will damage the library's reputation and lead to a loss of business. Young children are being exposed to far more inappropriate things than they should be. It is truly disturbing to hear young children talk about having boyfriends or girlfriends and using bad words at a very young age. This may be due to parents or the friends they choose, but in my opinion, the current media environment is a significant factor.  Movies, music, books, and other forms of media are no longer what they were in the 1950s or even the 1980s. The language in songs, the content in movies, and the images in magazines have become excessive. There should be a section in libraries and other media outlets that is restricted to those aged 18 and above, containing all the inappropriate content. People should be required to show identification to access this section. While this measure may not be completely effective, it is worth a try.  The world has become a less happy place, filled with violence, sex, and drugs. Some parents do not care about what their children do, say, or see, and this often depends on the family's values. People should strive to make a difference in the world and stay away from bad influences such as inappropriate pictures, vulgar language, and violent movies. We should not be followers; instead, we should take a stand and ensure that everything we do counts.
826	3803	2	2	In my view, certain materials in books, music, magazines, or movies should be removed or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their children to behave politely, refrain from using foul language, and avoid inappropriate displays of affection. However, our society promotes such behavior, which is unacceptable.  In bookstores and libraries, there are books on the shelves that can be deemed inappropriate. We encourage children to read, but we can't simply tell them to pick any book. These books may contain foul language, gang - related violence, or sexual gestures that I wouldn't even give to a young relative.  There is a wide variety of music in the world. Everyone has their favorite and least - favorite music. Since it's impossible to please everyone, we can just ignore the music we don't like. There are different formats like CDs, cassette tapes, or records for sale. While some music content is inappropriate, we can change the radio station, choose not to buy the CD, or even drive without music.  Magazines can sometimes present unseemly content, whether it's a well - known person with an odd appearance on the front page or certain reality - show - related features. Although I don't mind seeing such things, strict parents may not want their children exposed to such actions. Magazines can cover topics like drug use, alcohol, or lottery wins. We need to choose what we and our children look at carefully.  People can act inappropriately in writing, singing, or pictures. This is reality, and there's not much we can do about it. If we don't want to hear or see something, we can simply avoid it. It's that simple.
827	3804	2	2	Regarding the issue of censorship in libraries, the question of whether certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are considered offensive is a complex one. In my opinion, they should not be removed. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. People have different thoughts and opinions, which is why there is a wide variety of books, music, and movies available. If we remove the so - called 'offensive' things, it may cause offense to others.  People need to stop being selfish and understand that everyone is different and has different interests. We should respect the diversity of opinions and preferences, and let the materials remain on the shelves for those who may appreciate them.
828	3805	2	2	Many individuals, after engaging with a book, song, movie, or magazine, may find themselves upset or disturbed by the content and advocate for its removal from the library or media center. In my view, since the definitions of offensive and disturbing vary from person to person, libraries and media centers should separate such materials from the mainstream collection.  Not everyone will find the same things disturbing or offensive. It depends on a person's background, religion, and personal beliefs. Books, magazines, and other media should not be banned from library shelves just because one person finds them offensive. If someone is disturbed by a particular piece of material, they should stop reading, listening, or watching it.  One person should not have the power to decide whether a certain book or magazine stays on the shelf, as there is likely someone else who does not find it offensive. The purpose of creating a book or song is often to express an opinion. If the reader or listener does not agree, they should respect the author's or director's thoughts and move on.  Libraries and media centers with inappropriate materials should create special areas or shelves for adult or mature audiences. These materials should also be labeled to indicate their offensive or explicit content.  If someone finds a song, book, or magazine article offensive or disturbing, they do not have the right to have it removed from the public. There are other ways to keep such materials away from those who may be unaware of their offensive nature. By taking these measures, we can ensure that all readers, viewers, and listeners are satisfied.
829	3806	2	2	People have diverse views on what is acceptable or offensive because everyone is unique. What is highly offensive to one individual may not be offensive to another, as it depends on values and beliefs. Libraries house a wide range of materials on various topics, some of which may not be suitable for everyone.  I don't think materials should be removed from library shelves just because one person or a group finds them offensive. The offended group isn't forced to read the book, listen to the music, or watch the movie. Library materials are for the public to enjoy, not just to satisfy specific people.  However, I believe that materials in libraries should be clearly sorted. When they are well - organized, people are less likely to accidentally pick up something offensive and can avoid the books, movies, magazines, and music they don't want to engage with. This can also protect children from inappropriate content.  In conclusion, offensive materials should not be removed from library shelves. What one person finds offensive, another may enjoy. It's impossible to please everyone due to different views, but careful organization can prevent potential issues. If we removed everything that some people found offensive, libraries would be left with very little.
830	3807	2	2	Should books and media be removed because they are offensive? I firmly believe they should not. In this essay, I will explain my reasoning.  The term 'offensive' is controversial. It's unclear whether it's kissing, curse words, or fighting that makes books and media offensive, as different people have different perceptions.  Today's youth often read books that older generations consider 'offensive'. This is because societal standards have changed. Children now have more freedom in their actions and speech, which has redefined the meaning of 'offensive'.  If a book, song, or video is offensive, it's the parents' responsibility to address it with their children. What is offensive to some may be acceptable to others. Just because such content exists doesn't mean we have to be exposed to it.  In conclusion, books and media should not be removed from the shelves for being offensive. The concept of 'offensive' is constantly changing and varies from person to person.
831	3808	2	2	I firmly oppose the removal of so - called “offensive” books from public libraries. In the case of school libraries, it is somewhat understandable to be more cautious, as the explicit content in some books may not be suitable for children. However, these materials can offer valuable insights into different perspectives on various subjects. What some might label as offensive could be an integral part of someone else's culture and way of life.  Imagine a world where every book deemed offensive is removed from library shelves. Many of the most fascinating books I've ever read have been controversial. The opportunity to learn about others' lives and daily struggles through these books is truly remarkable. Making decisions based on a single person's opinion would lead to chaos.  If all these “offensive” books were removed, what would be left to read? I seek literature that captures my interest and compels me to keep reading. Without these books, such an experience would be hard to come by. Therefore, these books should remain on library shelves to offer diverse reading experiences.
832	3809	2	2	I am of the opinion that censorship is seldom justifiable, especially in libraries, whether they are in schools or other settings. Censorship acts as a barrier to knowledge acquisition, fostering ignorance and intolerance. Libraries and schools are intended to be havens for free - thinking, exploration, and learning, yet censorship stifles these very ideals.  When people are restricted from reading what they choose, a significant number will simply stop reading. Not all children and teenagers are naturally drawn to books. If a reluctant reader shows interest in a particular book, it makes no sense to take it away just because someone finds it offensive or disagrees with its views. These are not valid grounds for censorship.  Most justifications for censorship do not stand the test of time. Many books that were challenged in the past are now regarded as classics or important works, like “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “1984,” “The Catcher in the Rye,” and “The Great Gatsby.” “To Kill a Mockingbird” and its author were censored due to the use of racist language. However, this language is crucial for setting the historical context of the novel. The book is about a lawyer defending a wrongly - accused black man in the American South, and the racist antagonist does not represent the book as a whole.  Censorship for such reasons differs from protecting young children from violent content. Deciding whether a child can watch a rated - R movie or read certain materials is a separate matter. I define censorship as preventing access to information based on personal views rather than the well - being of the person being shielded. It is essential to allow children to gradually expand their reading as they grow and mature.  If a person spends their life only reading and watching what others choose for them, they will struggle to develop their own identity. A sheltered upbringing can have negative consequences in adulthood, leaving individuals without their own perspectives and largely ignorant of the world. As John Milton said, “He who destroys a good book, kills reason itself.” This is precisely what happens to those raised in a censored environment. Censorship does not shape people for the better. In contrast, those who are free to read and watch what they want can form their own views and values, promoting tolerance and understanding.  Censorship should not be the norm. Libraries and schools should enable children and teenagers to learn and grow, which is the very purpose of education. Thus, censorship should not even be considered, and students' freedom to read as they wish should be the standard in all educational institutions.
833	3810	2	2	I believe that libraries should retain a wide range of materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines. People have diverse reading preferences, and libraries should accommodate this diversity. I often visit the library to borrow books, browse magazines, and check out movies and music. There is a vast selection of movies available for borrowing, and the same goes for music. If there are materials that kids and teens like, libraries should make them accessible. It's certain that libraries also have educational materials in these categories.  However, if materials contain offensive content, they should be removed from the shelves. Having offensive movies, music, magazines, or books on display can make people wonder why libraries would offer such items. It's inappropriate and can cause discomfort.  If offensive materials are removed, it will attract more people to the library. The public will have more respect for the library staff, and parents won't have to worry about their children being exposed to inappropriate content. In conclusion, I sincerely hope that library staff make the right decision and remove offensive materials, creating a more suitable and welcoming environment for all.
834	3811	2	2	Almost everyone has either seen, heard, written, or said something that offended someone else. Some people intentionally use offensive content in their music, books, or movies, while others may accidentally offend due to poor word - choice. When someone finds something offensive in a library, they have several options: they can request the relocation of the offensive material, call for a vote on its removal, or remain silent until they know others share their concerns.  When a person is offended by something in a library, they should ask for the offensive material to be relocated. This way, others can still access and enjoy the book, magazine, movie, or music. Just because one person finds something offensive doesn't mean everyone will.  If a book, magazine, song, or movie is offensive to many people, a vote should be held to decide whether it should stay or be removed from the library. This gives the material a chance to remain available in the future. In some cases, music or movies can be removed and replaced with censored versions to accommodate those who were not offended.  There are also situations where only one person is offended. In such cases, that person can choose to wait until someone else is also offended before speaking up about the material's offensiveness.  In summary, when faced with offensive material in a library, individuals should consider getting it relocated, having it voted on, or waiting for others to share their concerns. Relocation ensures the material remains accessible, voting allows for a democratic decision, and waiting can prevent hasty actions.
835	3812	2	2	If I find something offensive in a library, I firmly believe it should be removed from the bookshelves. The library is a public space for everyone, not just a select group. If something offends me, I wouldn't want others of the same race, religion, or family to be exposed to it and also be offended. While we have the right to freedom of speech, there should be limits.  People have a breaking point. For example, if someone writes that all black people are dumb simply because of their race, it's obvious that the black community won't remain silent. Constantly using derogatory language and picking on others can have long - lasting negative effects on their communication skills and self - esteem. In extreme cases, it can even lead to self - harm or harm to others.  If I see an offensive book in a public library, I would definitely want it removed to prevent others from being offended. Hurting someone's feelings is not worth ruining their life or causing them to harm themselves.  If something offends you, would you just let it happen or use your rights to make things right and protect others? If you could fix a situation but choose not to, and the offensive content continues to harm people, you share some of the blame. In conclusion, offensive materials should be removed from libraries to create a safe and inclusive environment for all.
836	3813	2	2	Should offensive items or materials be removed from a public library? In my view, the answer is no. In today's society, many people themselves exhibit offensive behavior. Books are intended to depict fictional or real - life scenarios. When something is censored, people will often strive to find an uncensored version. Art books also should not be censored. Artists are not being perverse or offensive; they are merely expressing their artistic vision in a way they believe people will appreciate as art. Censorship has its importance, but one must have an open mind, as what one finds offensive may not be so later in life. We shouldn't censor something just because it might offend some, as there are many who may not take offense, whether it's books, music, videos, video games, writing, or movies. We should have a democratic approach to determine what is appropriate. So, should we censor a book based on its content or let the public decide? I think censorship has a moral aspect, but it would also be immoral to deprive a reader of a book they might find interesting. Therefore, we should not censor books in public libraries. We need books that contain facts or fiction and tell great stories. My suggestion is to let readers decide whether to censor or keep the material as it is.
837	3814	2	2	I believe that if there are books in libraries that are potentially harmful, one should be at least @NUM1 years old to check them out. The reason for choosing @NUM1 is that at this age, individuals should have a sense of right and wrong and be able to handle inappropriate content. If one knows a book is wrong, there is no compulsion to read it. Some people enjoy reading different types of books. Just because a book may be inappropriate or harmful to some does not mean it is the same for everyone. It might even be helpful to others. If we start removing books based on potential harm, there will be no books left in libraries, as every book could potentially offend someone if forced upon them. If you have an issue with this view, you can contact me at @NUM3 and ask for @PERSON1. We can discuss it, and perhaps you can change my mind, or after reading this, you may share my opinion. The reason I hold this view is that, as mentioned before, every book has elements that could harm someone, so a minimum age of @NUM1 for certain books is reasonable. If you are being hurt by many books, I suggest you stop reading. A book is not meant to cause harm. There are many people interested in books and research. What I disagree with is kids leaving class to go to the library to play games and do puzzles. Some claim to have work but don't. This leads to a situation where when others need to use the computers, there are none available due to kids playing games. However, regarding the book - related part of the library, I have no problem. In conclusion, if a book hurts you, don't read it, as others like having them available.
838	3815	2	2	Many libraries offer a wide range of materials, including books, movies, and magazines. Some of these items may be considered inappropriate for certain age groups. In my opinion, library customers should have the right to choose what they read or watch. When it comes to books, there is a vast variety, from scientific literature on human anatomy to fantasy books about dragons and vampires. As a child, parents help select appropriate books. As one matures, they start making these choices independently. It is up to the individual to decide whether to read a particular book. Movie - selection guidelines follow a similar pattern. Parents assist in choosing appropriate movies during childhood. As adults, people learn to read about movies, check ratings, and decide based on factors like violence or inappropriateness. Sometimes, offensive material can be found in books or movies. If one strongly disapproves, they can approach the librarian. They can discuss why they think the item is inappropriate and offer solutions such as removing it from the shelf, writing an extra review, or contacting the author or director. However, the simplest option is to ignore the offensive item. If it offends you, return it to the library and warn your friends. Others may still enjoy it. There are numerous books, movies, and magazines in the world. Some may be inappropriate or offensive, but there are also many suitable options. So, if you don't like a particular item, return it and find something you do like.
839	3816	2	2	Should offensive books, music, movies, and magazines be removed from libraries? I firmly believe they should be put to a vote for all library - goers to decide. The library staff may consider certain items morally incorrect or offensive, but the customers who check out these materials may have different views. After all, it is the customers who read the books, not the staff. People have different beliefs, and what is offensive to one may not be so to another. If a library removes a book for the wrong reason, it may lose its patrons. Every book teaches a lesson about life. For example, if a library decides to remove the Bible and romance novels, it will lose a large number of customers, and its business may decline. Also, different cultures have different acceptances of certain materials. A book that is acceptable in one culture may be removed from the library, causing people from that culture to miss out on library resources. Moreover, the library staff should not have the sole power to decide which books are allowed, as they may have a financial interest if someone has a fine. In conclusion, we should put the decision to a vote, considering that people have different sensitivities and beliefs. No two people think exactly the same way, and a democratic approach is the most appropriate.
840	3817	2	2	Dear editor, I firmly believe that we should not remove movies, books, and music from the shelves. Doing so will likely lead to conflicts and even legal suits. I have witnessed the consequences of removing a book from the shelf. People who don't find it offensive start yelling and may even threaten to sue. Taking a book off the shelf can be costly as it may lead to legal proceedings. I've also seen what happens when music is removed. Initially, people yell, and then the situation can turn violent. A mob of people may damage the store because music has been taken down. This is why we should keep all these materials available. You can interpret this as you wish, but I hope you learn from these potential problems before it's too late. I hope you will publish this in the paper. Sincerely, @PERSON1.
841	3818	2	2	I firmly believe that no material should be removed from library shelves. The decision to read offensive material lies with the individual. Young children are unlikely to seek out inappropriate materials as they have no interest in them, just as adults are not likely to search for children's books. There is a maturity barrier that determines the reading interests of different age - groups. Removing material from libraries serves no purpose. Children, who are the main group that might be offended, are already exposed to violent video - games that glorify war and violence. One cannot simply remove material deemed offensive. If offensive material were removed from libraries, one would also have to shut down the internet, as a child can easily find offensive content with a click of a button. Moreover, libraries have age - level restrictions on cards to prevent children from checking out offensive material. Some people may enjoy offensive material. Removing such material would upset many library users, leading to numerous complaints and problems, and some may stop visiting the library due to limited content. Therefore, libraries should be allowed to have whatever material they choose. This approach will satisfy and make most people happy.
842	3819	2	2	Author Katherine Paterson makes a valid point when she says there are books on the shelves that people don't want their kids or themselves to read. However, if we were to remove every book someone found offensive, there would be hardly any books left in the world. There will always be someone who dislikes a book because of the author's tone or the language used. People have their own views on how to live and how to raise their children. Removing books from the shelves just because some people don't like them would result in empty shelves. I believe that books about kids facing negative consequences from drinking can deter other kids from trying it. Books about rape victims who initially don't tell due to fear but later do after getting pregnant or injured can offer relief to those who have or may experience similar situations, encouraging them to speak up. Such books should not be removed because of one person's dislike. If they are removed, some people may get hurt or not know what to do, and it could be the fault of that one person. For example, Marilyn @CAPS1 is a good author who shows how seemingly good things can turn bad. Her books focus on girls' safety. I have a friend whose parents made her remove certain music from her iPod. But she still listens to those songs on the radio while driving. This shows that people will always find a way to access what they want. There will always be music that people dislike, whether due to religion or the lyrics. Even if radio stations stop playing certain songs, people can get them from the internet. Trying to remove offensive songs or books from the public's reach will only make some people, especially kids and adults, more eager to access them. In the end, it's a bad idea to remove books from shelves and music from the radio. Young people need to learn about the consequences of bad decisions from these materials. For instance, a kid who reads about a peer getting kidnapped will better understand the importance of not talking to strangers. So, I think it's a very bad idea to remove books just because a few parents think they're not suitable for their children. Let kids and grandchildren learn about the dangers on their own through reading rather than just being told. As a teenage girl, I prefer reading about these things to hearing my parents repeat the same warnings. So, keep the books on the shelves and the radio playing, but stay safe.
843	3820	2	2	"The question of whether books, magazines, music, and movies should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive is complex. In my view, the answer depends on the number of people offended. If a large number of people are offended, then the answer is yes. Offensive things can lead to more serious issues, similar to how racial segregation led to fights. Just as people would find segregation unfair and upsetting, those offended by the media may feel the same. However, if only a few people are offended, the answer is no. Such media can help younger generations distinguish between right and wrong by presenting different choices. Without anything that offends, it would be difficult for younger generations to learn how to make these distinctions. There are pros and cons either way. Removing all offensive material would make it harder to teach younger generations to make independent moral judgments, as there would be only one so - called ""perfect"" point of view, which doesn't exist. This would result in a lack of diverse media. On the other hand, if no offensive material is removed, serious problems like fights or even wars could occur, depending on the number of offended people. Since our society doesn't need more fighting, the answer to removing offensive things is both yes and no."
844	3821	2	2	Everyone has the right to make their own decisions. If someone decides not to let their children read certain books, that's their choice, but they shouldn't impose this decision on others. People have different opinions about the modesty of books. However, removing books from libraries fails to consider the needs of others. If there are books that offend a particular ethnicity or religion, one should simply ignore them. There's no reason to remove such books, as they may be useful for research. Removing books from libraries deprives the youth of contemporary literature, which is crucial for the future. For example, The @CAPS1 was initially opposed by many when it was published because it was non - traditional. Now, it's used in classrooms to teach literary techniques. There are many such books being removed from libraries that future writers could deeply appreciate. Katherine Paterson, like many authors, believes that removing offensive books will lead to a lack of available literature. It's unfair to hard - working writers to have their books banned from libraries just because some parents don't approve. If parents don't like a book, they should tell their children not to read it. A library is a place for enjoying a wide variety of literature and should not be restricted. It is a place of discovery, not limitation.
845	3822	2	2	Libraries are generally regarded as places that protect children and maintain an educational atmosphere. However, children can access a large amount of information with a simple library card, some of which may teach lessons parents don't want them to learn. Since parents can't constantly monitor their children, strict censorship is the solution. Books contain a vast amount of powerful information. Although most parents assume publishing companies would prevent children from reading easily - misunderstood books, it's actually up to the library to decide what can be checked out. Adults are more likely to understand the content of books because of their greater life experiences. Some believe that separating library collections for different age - groups would solve the problem. But in reality, even if an adult checks out media from the older section, younger children may still be exposed to inappropriate content at home, such as videos or magazines. The only way to address this issue is to prevent offensive and easily - misunderstood media from entering libraries and censor it before it reaches the wrong hands. Libraries are great for research and school projects, but inappropriate books and magazines have no place in an educational environment. Censorship must be enforced to maintain the educational atmosphere of libraries and protect children from offensive material.
846	3823	2	2	I hold the view that certain materials should not be removed simply because they might offend some individuals. If someone finds a particular piece of content offensive, they have the option to disengage and do something else. Admittedly, I'm not easily offended, so my opinion might not fully resonate with everyone. It's understandable that different people can be offended by various things. However, when someone encounters offensive content, they can either voice their reasons for finding it offensive or choose to ignore it.  In libraries, if the staff deems a story offensive, it's within their right to remove it from the shelves as they are responsible for the library's operations. Personally, I'd be more lenient. If someone requests the removal of a material, I might consider it. Nowadays, many people seem overly sensitive and take offense at almost everything. But a material should only be removed from library shelves if the staff or the manager finds it truly offensive. In such cases, their decision is understandable.
847	3824	2	2	Censorship in libraries is a complex issue. Picture this: you enter a library, approach a large, disorganized bookshelf, and spot a book that seems promising. You're excited to read it, but when you check the summary, you feel alienated by its writing style. Do you then want to remove it from the shelf? I often have this urge. However, if everyone removes books that make them uncomfortable, there will be very few, if any, books left to read.  Books related to certain topics like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 can be a problem as they tend to segregate people. When you visit the different sections of your local library, which one do you head to first? The adult section offers a wide range of book genres. But what if you come across a book about @CAPS4? If you belong to a specific faith and find a book mocking your beliefs, what should you do? Due to freedom of speech, there's not much you can do. You might be uncomfortable seeing such a book available worldwide, but remember, someone else could feel the same way about your favorite book. This is a topic that has been debated for years.  Imagine you notice a brightly - colored book on a somewhat isolated shelf that catches your attention. You pick it up and discover it's about @CAPS2. This can make anyone uncomfortable. I personally oppose making fun of people in this way. People are unique for a reason; it's not to humiliate them but to ensure we all have our own identities.  What would you do if you picked up a book that teases someone about their looks and @CAPS3? One joke might seem harmless, but when it targets an individual, it can be hurtful. People come in all shapes, sizes, and hair colors. Millions of people are constantly criticized and teased for being different. Everyone has been teased at some point, and it's not funny for the person on the receiving end.  Books about @CAPS4, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 can cause division. I'm writing to express my disapproval of some of the books and related materials in the market. However, if everyone shared this view, there would be no books left. So, I believe we shouldn't remove books from the shelves. Instead, we should accept that everyone is different, and this is not a matter for ridicule. If we held the same views on these topics as we did years ago, where would the world be today? We should leave the books on the shelves as they can serve as a reminder of the past.
848	3825	2	2	Some members of my community have informed me that the local library plans to remove certain materials, including books, movies, and music. I've confronted the relevant parties, but they haven't made any effort to reverse the censorship that has already occurred. I understand that some works may be offensive to certain audiences, but I firmly believe that all people should have access to the knowledge they desire.  The works that are being condemned and removed are products of passion and hard work. What I've observed is that the materials considered controversial are often the most passionate and heartfelt expressions. I firmly believe that this act of removal causes more harm than the so - called offensive content itself. It denies artists their right to freedom of expression and suppresses our basic right to express ourselves.  The human mind has limitless capabilities, yet those who showcase its functions are restricted. Knowledge is the key to a deeper understanding of the world around us. This censorship, in my opinion, highlights the limitations I try to expose in my exploration of the human mind. I believe that our literature has evolved significantly, and I would be extremely disappointed to see the inspiration for creation extinguished due to such short - sighted actions. Is it really worth it just because of a few hurt feelings or a lack of understanding? I think not.  In conclusion, I've clearly stated my stance and firmly oppose this censorship. Although I'm just one voice, I see this as a call to action. I believe that by working together, we can achieve great things. Let's spread the word and fight against this repression of expression.
849	3826	2	2	I've been informed by some community members that the local library plans to remove certain materials such as books, movies, and music. I've spoken to those involved, and they haven't taken any steps to correct the existing censorship. I understand that some works may be offensive to some audiences, but I believe everyone should have access to the knowledge they wish to acquire.  The works they want to ban are the result of passion and hard work. The materials they consider controversial are often the most powerful expressions of creativity. Removing these materials not only restricts the artists' freedom of expression but also suppresses our collective ability to express ourselves.  The human mind is capable of limitless thought, yet those who try to share these thoughts are often limited. Knowledge is essential for a broader understanding of the world. This censorship goes against the spirit of free thought and discovery. I believe our literature has come a long way, and it would be a great loss if the inspiration for creation were stifled.  In conclusion, I firmly oppose this censorship. I may be just one person, but I believe we can make a difference if we stand together. Let's raise awareness and fight against this suppression of expression.
850	3827	2	2	A library serves as a place where people can borrow books, music, movies, and other materials that they may not have at home. Some individuals visit the library to use the computers for projects or to check out various media. It's not necessarily a bad thing if the library has materials that some people find offensive. If people don't want to be exposed to offensive content, they can simply avoid the relevant areas of the library.  In my opinion, the presence of offensive materials in the library doesn't greatly affect me. However, there should be an age - restriction for borrowing or reading such materials. Not everyone should have unrestricted access to them. If a person under the specified age tries to check out offensive materials, they should be denied.  If someone is offended by certain materials, they have the option to bypass that section of the library or simply ignore the content. The library could set aside a specific area for these types of materials so that neither adults nor children are forced to see them.  Moreover, if a child wants to access offensive materials, they may find other ways to do so. They don't have to rely solely on the library. If a child is determined to see something, they will find a means to achieve it.  If parents are unhappy about the presence of offensive materials in the library, they should teach their children not to look at such content. If they catch their children looking at offensive materials, they should discipline them and explain why it's inappropriate. Libraries shouldn't be required to remove their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satisfy parents.  If libraries were to remove these materials from their shelves, they would likely lose business. Therefore, libraries should not be pressured to remove materials just to please parents. Instead, parents should take responsibility for guiding their children. Offensive materials should remain in libraries, but with appropriate rules in place.
851	3828	2	2	To start, a woman might read a book about wives and find it offensive. However, it was her decision to pick up and read the book. Should the book be removed from the shelf? Certainly not. Different individuals hold diverse perspectives on what they read, and not everyone will have the same reaction. The same principle applies to music, movies, magazines, and so on. For instance, someone might see a naked picture in a magazine and dislike it, but it was their choice to pick up the magazine. No one forced them to engage with the content.  @CAPS1, it doesn't make sense to remove a book or other media just because one person doesn't like it. There is still a large portion of the population who might love it, some who might simply like it, and others who are indifferent. We can't focus solely on that one individual; we must consider everyone else. If a person finds a particular item offensive, they should have made a more prudent choice in the first place, and it's their own responsibility.  In conclusion, offensive items should not be removed from the shelves. If someone doesn't like something, they can simply choose not to read or engage with it. Another person might enjoy it. Some people who find things offensive may be viewing the content from the wrong perspective. If we start removing items for being offensive, eventually, everything might be removed. Then, what will we have left to read or listen to?
852	3829	2	2	Censorship is prevalent in the world, affecting radio music, television shows, and the internet. In today's society, the library is often overlooked, creating a somewhat secluded environment. The library is a place where one's mind can freely explore and discover to its heart's content. It should not be a place with restricted discovery like television or the internet; censorship in libraries should not exist.  People learn from books, whether they have happy, sad, or gruesome endings. All types of books can offer valuable lessons to readers. Many believe that history repeats itself, which is why history is taught in schools to prevent the recurrence of past bad events. Similarly, the books on library shelves serve a similar purpose. When reading a book, readers can experience the lives of the characters as if they were living alongside them. Through these experiences, readers can observe the right and wrong actions of the characters without having to directly live through those situations. By the end of the book, readers will gain new perspectives on life and try to avoid making the same mistakes as the characters.  Parents are often concerned about inappropriate language or scenes in books. To be honest, there is foul language and inappropriate behavior in the real world. It is better for children to gradually discover these aspects through reading and some life experiences rather than having it all suddenly presented to them. Censorship on the radio and television is understandable, but when someone wants to improve themselves through reading, they should have the freedom to choose whatever they want to read.  A library is a place of wonderful learning, but censorship restricts that learning. Through reading, people can experience life without facing the consequences of those experiences. All books have something to teach, and they should all have the opportunity to be read and learned from.
853	3830	2	2	Have you ever felt that your reading options are decreasing? Censorship is taking away our freedom to read, watch, or listen to what we want. Who has the right to dictate what we can consume? As an avid reader of various types of literature, I cannot tolerate censorship. Today's kids need the freedom to read what they want to open their minds to new ideas and ways of life. Some of the so - called 'banned' books are among the best reads, and we should have the right to read them, regardless of whether they might be considered offensive.  I can understand setting age limits on certain books, but completely removing them from the shelves means we are losing a fundamental right as @CAPS2 citizens. Reading, watching, and listening to various media are excellent ways to learn about the world beyond our immediate surroundings.  I understand some level of censorship in music and television. I don't want my little brother or other young people to hear the '@CAPS3 bomb' or see anything obscene. However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to control what they watch or listen to because media is so easily accessible.  Many kids today have access to the internet, which has both positive and negative aspects. If parents don't want their kids to be exposed to obscene content, they can set up blocks on their computers. Kids mainly use the internet and @CAPS4 as their media sources, and those who want to read should have as many choices as possible, whether it's fiction, classics like 'The @CAPS5 snd The @CAPS6', or educational literature.  So, are our reading choices becoming scarce? I believe they are, and it's all due to censorship. We can't read some classics because they are labeled as 'racist' or 'pornographic', but we need to understand that in the context of when they were written, they were not. Everyone should be able to read what they want, when they want.
854	3831	2	2	When asked if certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, I firmly believe that just because one person finds something offensive doesn't mean everyone else will. Everyone has a unique opinion, and we all differ from one another. We need a wide variety of these materials. While censorship is understandable to some extent, without variety, people would have fewer choices.  Your opinions, decisions, and outlook on life are one - of - a - kind. It doesn't make sense to tell someone they can't listen to a particular song or read a specific book. If people didn't have options, there would be no entertainment. In my view, if someone has a problem with a certain topic, they should simply avoid it. The world is big, and there are many different opinions. We should be open - minded.  It's quite possible that someone else is writing an essay with the exact opposite view on this topic. This just shows that no one's opinion is absolutely right or wrong. Individuals should have the right to their individuality, and variety is essential for that. Disagreements are inevitable, but in questions like this, we should agree to disagree. In conclusion, we should maintain the variety of materials and respect different opinions instead of removing items based on the sensitivities of a few.
855	3832	2	2	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work i abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This statement addresses the tricky issue of book censorship in libraries. The topic is complex because it's impossible to satisfy everyone as all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., can be considered offensive to someone.  Regarding library books, libraries should have different sections, such as those for @CAPS3, children, families, activities, and romance. This would limit the books that children can access. For example, I once accidentally wandered into the @CAPS3 books section at @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. If it had been clearly marked, I wouldn't have entered.  Parents need to monitor what their children look at in the library and which sections they visit. If a child enters the romance section and sees those books, it's not the library's or the writer's fault. Parents can set boundaries, like telling their children not to leave a certain section. If my mom had given me such an instruction, I would have stayed around the children's books. Monitoring their children is an effective way for parents to solve this problem.  Libraries need to decide what types of books they will stock. If a library doesn't have the books that parents don't want their children to see, then the children won't be exposed to them. If a public library keeps such books in the open, parents can go to a town hall and inform the mayor, librarian, or other townspeople about the inappropriate books. By speaking up, others may also oppose these books.  If you're not satisfied with the library's book selection, you can suggest creating sections for the books, keep an eye on what your kids look at, or inform someone who can take action. Consider what you can do to improve your public library and prevent your kids from accessing books you don't want them to see.
856	3833	2	2	Censorship in libraries should not be enforced. Censorship should not obstruct the 'allegory' in some books, which is when an author presents a story within a story to the reader. Enforcing censorship would lead to a situation similar to that depicted in '@DATE1'. If censorship were in place, one could not grasp the true meaning of an art piece that the artist intends to convey, and thus, abstract art would not be possible.  The term 'allegory' refers to a story within a story, which is what the author aims to show the reader. For example, '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2' is an allegory that weaves multiple stories together. When @ORGANIZATION3 dies on the cliff - side by @CAPS3 after launching a huge rock overboard, it symbolizes the fall of man. In the @CAPS4, when @CAPS5 eats the apple from the tree, it explains the origin of sin. Such a remarkable book should not be censored. Many people might dislike it because it portrays young boys as savages who kill each other. However, one should consider both sides of the story and understand the true meaning behind it.  Art should not be censored at all. Art stimulates creativity. Artists create abstract works that may spark controversy. They also design utilitarian objects that we use daily without much thought. No one has the right to censor their masterpieces. For instance, @ORGANIZATION2 had a dark period in his work and painted demons in his paintings, which some might find overly graphic. But people should understand the circumstances of his life at that time that led him to create such works.  Censorship is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. This is similar to the situation in the book '@DATE1' by @PERSON1, where he depicts complete government @ORGANIZATION1. In the book, the people are classified as the '@CAPS6'. The @CAPS6 made up the majority of the population and were not very intelligent. They could not think independently because the @ORGANIZATION1 censored everything. The @ORGANIZATION1 did this to prevent anyone from rebelling and overthrowing them. They knew that the @CAPS6 had the potential to overthrow them, so they maintained strict censorship. If we were to censor everything, we would lose our individuality. We would not be able to express love as we do now.  Implementing censorship in libraries is not a good idea. Without access to uncensored materials, readers would not understand what an author is trying to convey, and artists would be unable to display their art. Censorship would lead to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, which is not feasible in our modern society. Therefore, censorship is not a wise choice.
857	3834	2	2	I firmly believe that inappropriate @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 should be removed. If you wouldn't say something to your parents' faces when you're young, you shouldn't listen to or read it. I don't want my young children exposed to content they know they can't say in front of me.  There are numerous things that children can encounter. For example, at @LOCATION1 or anywhere there are magazines, there are images of people in underwear, whether men or women. It's inappropriate to display such content where children can easily see it. These images will make children ask questions that may force parents to lie.  When children watch TV, there are cartoons with characters using curse words and talking about sex. If a child stumbles upon such a channel when parents aren't around, they'll hear this inappropriate content. Then they'll tell their friends, thinking it's cool, and more children will be exposed. It's easier to simply remove such channels from the TV.  I find it extremely unacceptable for people to sing about killing, raping children, and other heinous acts. I would never let my children listen to such music, regardless of their age. I believe that a lot of the bad behavior children pick up comes from the music they listen to. I'll do everything I can to prevent my children from listening to such music until they're old enough and their parents (including me) are okay with it. I now understand why my parents didn't want me to listen to such music when I was young, and I'll never allow my children to do so at a young age.  In conclusion, I hope I've made a valid point, and I hope you share my view. Allowing children to consume harmful content is not worth the long - term trouble.
858	3835	2	2	I am of the opinion that everyone should have the freedom to choose what they read, listen to, or watch. Publicly available content will be seen regardless. It should be an individual's decision whether to engage with material that is considered mature or @ORGANIZATION1. In the case of children, parents, not librarians, should make this decision.  Books, movies, and music are forms of entertainment. People read @ORGANIZATION1 material to amuse themselves, and there is nothing wrong with seeking entertainment. Everyone enjoys being entertained, and it is unfair to impose restrictions on it. If something is made public, it should be released with appropriate conditions regarding age and maturity. However, regardless of whether it's in a book, magazine, TV, or the internet, content that some people don't want to see will always surface.  The public library is a place where people go to learn. Removing a book from the shelf might deprive someone of an educational opportunity. A book is placed on the shelf to be read, and it could be beneficial for a child to access it and gain knowledge about the world. Hiding books from children only makes them more curious.  If a book is in a public library, it should be accessible. People and children should be free to read anything in the library, unless a parent gives other instructions. Publicly available content in books, magazines, or movies will also be found on the internet or TV. So, children will see what they want, whether elders approve or not. Nowadays, nudity, profanity, violence, and provocative material are everywhere, even in cartoons. It's impossible to shield children or people from such content as it is part of daily life. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of access to library materials and let individuals make their own choices.
859	3836	2	2	As @CAPS1 once said, “All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.” Many people advocate for banning certain books from schools, but the opposite is true. Students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, gain a deeper understanding of the past, and appreciate the unique style of an author.  Over the years, many well - written books have been on a 'censored list' because they are considered offensive. Examples include 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3'. These books have their own distinct styles and can teach different lessons to each reader. One reader might love a book and read it repeatedly, while another might not finish it. However, the principle of freedom of choice in reading is valid.  'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a well - known censored book. It contains foul language that some find offensive. But during the time the book was written, these words were not considered inappropriate. Such books could be more suitable for older readers. However, if a parent allows their child to read it at a young age, there's not much that can be done. In any case, removing the book from the library is not the right solution.  The saying “learn from past mistakes” holds true. Books are an excellent way to learn about the past in an engaging manner. They are a source of knowledge. Removing a book from a library is like discarding a wealth of information. Every book has a unique style that may appeal to some and not to others. Many books offer insights into the time period in which they were written.  '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a censored book from the start due to its dark and gloomy aspects at times. Many students at school carry '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books and claim they are their favorites. If the book were removed from the library, many students would miss the opportunity to read a well - written book with a unique style.  Throughout twelve years of school, students are taught to think independently and make their own decisions. By removing reading materials, we are undermining this educational goal. If we can't trust students to decide whether to read a book, we are teaching them poor life lessons. In conclusion, we should preserve the freedom to choose what to read in schools and libraries.
860	3837	2	2	Fifth Item I firmly believe that there should be no censorship in libraries. All offensive materials, even though more conservative patrons may dislike them, should remain in the library for everyone to access.  I have several reasons to support my view against removing materials that some find offensive. The most important reason is the educational value these materials offer. Most works, even the cruder ones, have some form of educational worth. Without materials that cover uncomfortable or gruesome aspects of life, people will only have a surreal understanding and won't know how less fortunate things operate or how to avoid them. Those who truly seek knowledge will explore various types of informational resources, regardless of the subject. Allowing this to happen is using the library as it was intended, as a knowledge resource.  All offensive items stored in a library should stay there for learning purposes. No one should be denied the opportunity to learn just because others want to shield them. In conclusion, maintaining an uncensored library environment is crucial for the pursuit of knowledge and personal growth.
861	3838	2	2	I am writing to the newspaper regarding the removal of certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more. I believe this should not be permitted as it would be unfair to others. I will present three reasons why people should not be allowed to remove such items from the shelves. Firstly, imagine having a child and wanting them to experience the same movie or book you enjoyed in your childhood, but it has been removed. This would be disappointing, as you would wish for them to have that same experience. As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Secondly, consider if you and your spouse had a favorite song that was removed from the shelves. This would be heart - breaking, especially if it was your wedding song. It would certainly be devastating for me in such a situation. Lastly, and my favorite reason, is that everyone has their own opinion. If you don't want to view or engage with certain materials, simply ignore them. It's that simple, and it's not your problem to worry about. These are the three reasons why people should not be allowed to remove items from the shelves. As Katherine Paterson also said, 'But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we allow this to happen, everyone will take advantage of it. That is why I am against letting people remove anything from the shelves.
862	3839	2	2	The question of whether we should censor books in libraries is a significant one. Katherine Paterson, a well - known author, once remarked, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This statement presents a very valid point. If we start removing books that we find offensive, we will eventually have no books left. Books are a source of information and offer insights into the lives of others. Removing a book would imply that the author's ideas are unimportant. The main reasons against censorship in libraries are the loss of insight, the depletion of books, and the stifling of personal creativity.  Books offer a window into the author's life. Historical events can influence an author's tone and style. For example, @ORGANIZATION1 lived in a time when @CAPS2 was ruled by kings. To be successful, he had to please the @LOCATION1, who also sponsored his plays. Another author affected by his era was @CAPS3. Living in the Middle Ages, he witnessed oppression like serfs. In his tales, he portrayed the upper - class as mean and the lower - class as humble, and he was not afraid to displease the @LOCATION1.  If we start removing offensive books from library shelves, as Katherine Paterson warned, there will soon be none left. What one person finds informative, another may find offensive, and vice versa. Every book could have someone claiming it is offensive, whether it's due to the context, tone, or the author. Sometimes, the most informative books are the ones that are considered offensive. However, offensive elements in books can be beneficial. They set the tone and mood of a story, create images, and teach us what not to do. These books often show the negative consequences of a vulgar or criminal life, imparting valuable life lessons. Just because I may find a book offensive doesn't mean others will. It would be unfair to remove a book that someone else has learned from.  Finally, removing books from libraries would teach children that it's okay to discard someone's creativity. It would also make them feel that their ideas don't matter and won't be appreciated. I, for one, am cautious not to offend others, and I can't imagine living in a society where this kind of censorship is the norm.  Books are essential. They educate us about past events, people, and the problems they faced. It's important to be aware of the world around us. I grew up unaware of many social issues because my parents tried to shield me. Reading books opened my eyes to reality. Taking books off library shelves would have hindered my growth. As Katherine Paterson's observation shows, once the process of removing books starts, it's hard to stop, and it's not fair.
863	3840	2	2	Books, movies, and music should not be removed from library shelves. For many years, people have visited libraries to access these materials. Some of these items may be vulgar and offensive, but instead of removal, an age - check - out law should be implemented, considering the modern context.  There are individuals who are drawn to the negative aspects of the content in these materials. Instead of removing offensive works, we should set age limits for different age groups. While it's true that some young children are exposed to inappropriate content, the responsibility lies with the parents.  Implementing an age limit for reading materials would solve the problem. Additionally, parents could be required to sign out a book, indicating that it's appropriate for their child. With these measures in place, there would be fewer issues, and the library would be better - controlled.  In conclusion, this approach is the way forward and represents the future of library management.
864	3841	2	2	In today's world, children and teenagers have access to almost everything. If you ask a teenager whether certain materials should be removed from the shelves, they'll probably say no. Adults, on the other hand, are more likely to say yes. The music and movies that surround young people aren't of the best quality. Just listen to it, and you'll be shocked. Since they have access, they'll borrow and consume these materials.  I think most of the music and movies on shelves should be removed. That's just my opinion. Even adults listen to and watch this stuff. I believe one reason why students are failing in school is because of this kind of content. Young people have too many rights that they shouldn't have.  Any offensive material should be removed from the shelves and replaced with educational content. Let's think about the past, when things started to change. Did you have access to all this when you were growing up? Probably not. But now, you can find almost anything anywhere, which is quite sad. Magazines are also becoming more like movies and music, with a lot of nudity and foul language.  Athletes often get in trouble for saying inappropriate things. They should be teaching kids not to use such language. By showing them what's right and wrong, starting with what they listen to and watch, we can help improve education. I'm not allowed to watch current shows, but I do it anyway because my parents didn't give me enough discipline when I was little.  If you let a child grow up listening and watching whatever they want, they're less likely to do well in school. One way to help is to spend time with children and teens, even if they don't want you to. Talk to them, have conversations, and teach them right from wrong. When you teach them this, their attitude towards school will improve.
865	3842	2	2	I believe there is a particular book that many of us have read and hope our children or other kids never pick up from the library shelf. I have such a book, '@CAPS1'. In my opinion, this book should be removed from library shelves because it is over - rated and contains excessive violence and sex.  When I was in seventh grade, I read '@CAPS1'. It was an impactful book but also very explicit. The story centered around a teen with a difficult childhood, struggling to get through high school while dealing with an abusive relationship, peer pressure, and addictions to sex and drugs. The book was highly detailed and revealing, which is why I strongly oppose other children reading it. I firmly believe that sex and violence should not be depicted in books or any form of media.  In conclusion, I advocate for the removal of offensive materials like books from library shelves. Books with a high amount of sex and violence should be restricted and only issued to those aged eighteen or older.
866	3843	2	2	When taking a young child to the library because they want a book, one might assume that there's nothing inappropriate there, as it's full of educational materials. One might also be okay with a child checking out a movie at the library, thinking there are no bad images or movies. However, a little girl with her mom in the adult section might see things that aren't suitable. Romance books often feature half - clothed girls and scantily - clad guys. A child could see this, not understand it, but the image would stay in their mind for a long time. Kids might also go to the movie section and pick out a scary movie with blood and guns. It's not just kids; teens might accidentally see inappropriate content about the opposite gender while looking at a book. A couple looking for a healthy, funny movie could find one that makes them uncomfortable. An older person searching for music from their era might get music about drugs, sex, or alcohol. Magazines are also an issue. Seventeen magazine and car magazines often have half - clothed girls. Even baby magazines may show a mom breastfeeding, which some may not want to see. The library is a valuable resource, but it has its drawbacks. I believe that music, magazines, movies, and books that discuss personal or inappropriate topics should be in a separate room. There should be an age limit to enter that room, and people should be informed about the content inside. I'm not saying the library is a bad place, but certain materials should be kept away from public view so that everyone can use the library comfortably.
867	3844	2	2	Libraries are filled with various reading materials like books, magazines, and catalogs. But are all these suitable for the diverse library - going crowd? My answer is no. However, these materials shouldn't be removed from libraries. Many adults visit libraries in search of good literature, so these materials should be available. When I was in seventh grade, I read a book titled @PERSON2 about a child who was sexually abused. I regret picking it up as it frightened me, but it also taught me a valuable lesson. I learned at a young age to avoid strangers. So, I think it's good to expose children to small doses of real - life situations. There is a wide range of literature, from @CAPS1 to the Bible, catering to different audiences. Libraries try to categorize books to prevent younger children from accessing inappropriate ones. Instead of removing these books completely, a system similar to that for mature - rated video games could be implemented, allowing only people over the age of @NUM1 to check out certain books. This would make it difficult for children to get hold of the wrong books. Another suggestion is to label inappropriate books and movies. This would make children think twice before opening a book labeled for mature audiences. This way, stories can be provided for all while protecting younger children. As Katherine Paterson said, we all have books we don't want children to pick up, but if we start removing books, there will be none left. We should provide all books and guide children to make the right choices when selecting literature from the library.
868	3845	2	2	I think if an issue only affects some people and not everyone, we should separate things into sections. This way, there won't be any problems. Why change something just because a few people don't like it? That would only lead to a big conflict. If we try to give everyone what they want, it won't work well. So, we should limit and section things off. In conclusion, separating items into sections is a practical solution that can avoid unnecessary conflicts and ensure that everyone's needs are considered to some extent.
869	3846	2	2	Censorship is a very sensitive topic. There are many things that people dislike, so they censor @CAPS2, hiding these ideas from those who are unaware. I personally strongly oppose censorship. I prefer a world where people are educated, even if it has minor dangers, rather than a world where everything is kept secret and seemingly safe. You might think that there are things we must censor because @CAPS2 can harm children's minds. But in reality, children will eventually learn about @CAPS2 in the real world. Drugs, alcohol, sex, rape, violence, and other censored topics are common things that kids will hear about. Most children first hear about @CAPS2 in elementary school, and if not, they will definitely learn about them in junior high. If they're going to find out anyway, isn't it better for them to learn in an easier way? You might also think that if children find out too young, @CAPS2 could traumatize them. That's a risk, but most teenagers are more likely to be traumatized when exposed to @CAPS2 without prior knowledge. If they know what they're dealing with, they'll know how to react. Otherwise, they could make a big mistake without realizing it. Again, isn't it better for them to learn from a trusted source or a book than the hard way? You might be thinking that children need to be protected, and this knowledge could put them in more danger. There's always a possibility that @CAPS2 could put them in more danger, but the world is full of possibilities. This knowledge that you hide from them might be what they need later on, and they won't know when they need it. What would they do if they see their friends doing drugs and don't know it's bad? Or if they're offered a drink and don't know they shouldn't take it? Or if a romantic situation goes too far and they don't know what to do? Anything could happen, and children need to be prepared. If they don't know about these things, they can't tell right from wrong. So, they should be informed so that they can face the real world better.
870	3847	2	2	As a young girl walking through @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1, I saw a @CAPS2 magazine. Being a fan of reading magazines, I opened it, only to find that it was something I wouldn't want to read. I was embarrassed and wondered why it wasn't clearly marked for censorship. I firmly believe that censorship in libraries and bookstores is a good thing. Kids do need to learn about relationships and intimacy, but that's the parents' job. A @NUM1 - year - old girl shouldn't be able to access inappropriate movies, magazines, or books freely. Censoring magazines allows children to discover themselves rather than conforming to the world's expectations. Magazines often put pressure on child stars to grow up quickly. Children see these stars and think they should dress and act like adults. The magazine industry is harmful in the long run. Sports @CAPS3 and Maxim feature scantily - clad models. Boys see these and form unrealistic ideas about girls. Letting young children see this makes them think they have to follow a certain style. There are many books about relationships and sex in libraries and bookstores. These books can make children and parents uncomfortable. Censoring these books can ease the situation and let kids grow up naturally. Movies also give a false impression of sex. They show it as carefree, but in reality, sex has consequences. In @LOCATION1, many young @CAPS8 are raped, but this isn't shown in movies. We shouldn't let pornography be so accessible. Censoring movies can help kids understand the real nature of sex. I strongly believe in censorship. My parents still ensure that the movies we choose are appropriate. By separating inappropriate materials, parents can have the opportunity to teach their kids, and kids can grow up in a more suitable environment.
871	3848	2	2	"Katherine Paterson once wrote, ""If I had the right to remove that book from the shelf, the work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else."" Having the right to do something is closely related to freedom of speech. It is about believing in the decisions or choices one has made. When reflecting on the issue of censorship in libraries, we all have the opportunity to state our opinions on what should not be included. There may be inappropriate books in libraries that we would not want younger siblings to read. However, we should ask ourselves: Should we deprive our children of the freedom and right to read, listen to, and access updated media and publications when we ourselves had such opportunities? Is it really necessary to censor libraries?  In my view, censoring a library is not necessary. A library is a repository of history. Libraries are organized systematically, with authors' names arranged alphabetically, non - fiction and fiction separated, CDs in one section, movies in another, magazines in a distinct area, and adult books and children's books placed in different sections. Across the world, it is possible that a child may choose an inappropriate book, but this is a common occurrence. Given the abundance of negative influences, peer pressure, violence, and sexual content in the media and the real world, a single book is unlikely to cause significant harm. It would be unfair to deny our children the chance to read and learn from books.  I firmly believe that we should not restrict our children's access to learning. As a child, I loved going to the library. It enhanced my vocabulary and spelling, and I learned many new words. The books I read as a child were not perfect, but I could relate to them. Therefore, we should not censor libraries. Libraries should be a place where children and adults can go for learning, fun, and comfort. Taking this away from our generation is simply unjust."
872	3849	2	2	The presence of offensive books and movies in libraries should not be permitted. If one person finds a book or any item in a library offensive, it is highly likely that others will too. By eliminating such offensive items before they are seen by the public, potential problems can be averted. In today's society, offensive materials are more prevalent in libraries, and people are more easily offended by minor things.  One of the reasons for implementing censorship in libraries is the concern for children. If one has a child, would they want their child to encounter derogatory writings and movies in a library? I would be extremely distressed if my child were exposed to such content. These offensive materials can teach children the wrong values and give them the impression that such behavior is acceptable in the community because it is available in a library. For example, if a library has books or movies about drug use or sexual content, children may look up to these and are more likely to engage in such harmful activities, which can endanger themselves and others.  If the government provides tax funding for libraries, the presence of offensive items on the shelves reflects poorly on the government. When we look to the government for support and guidance, it is disheartening if they show no judgment regarding offensive materials in libraries. This may lead to a sense of panic across the country and cause more problems than necessary. Censoring libraries would be a more straightforward solution.  If libraries were free from negative and offensive literature, there would be more space for materials of greater value. Libraries could stock educational books and movies that actually teach people useful knowledge, rather than leading them to make bad decisions. If someone really wants a particular book, there are many other sources available, not just the library. Moreover, if a library has offensive items, the variety is likely to be limited. It would be wiser to look for the desired materials elsewhere, where a larger selection can be found.  When I visit the library, I go in search of educational books, not those that teach kids inappropriate things like drug - related activities or sexual positions. I strongly oppose the inclusion of such offensive materials in libraries, as it has a negative impact on our society. By implementing censorship in libraries, we can not only alleviate recurring problems in our communities but also potentially eliminate them completely.
873	3850	2	2	There are a multitude of things that can be offensive to different people. If we start removing content from TV, books, and magazines, we would be constantly engaged in the process of censorship. Instead of removing offensive content, a more practical approach is to place graphic or inappropriate materials in the adult section. Censorship is not the answer. We should be more vigilant about our children's activities, which would reduce potential problems.  Adjusting the age limits on movies could be beneficial. If parents watch movies first, they can guide their children on what is appropriate and what is not. Libraries and media should also include more authentic historical content, making them more educational and engaging. This way, we can teach children more valuable knowledge.  Some music, especially rap music, should be subject to a certain degree of censorship. There is a significant amount of rap music that needs to be cleaned up to prevent young children from being exposed to inappropriate lyrics.  There may be better ways to control children's access to inappropriate content. Teachers can play a role in educating children about what is right and wrong. We also need to pay attention to new cartoons on TV, as some of them need to be improved. People have different preferences regarding content, and some may not care about offensive materials at all. Hopefully, in the future, we will find an effective way to manage this issue.
874	3851	2	2	"Many people believe that books are useless and should be removed from library shelves. However, I firmly believe that no book is useless, and no book should be removed from any library. All books have value, whether it is in terms of career development or learning new things.  Magazines may not be as helpful as books in many aspects, but they can provide entertainment. Music is not just for listening; it can also help people relax while reading a book. Movies can have a profound impact on individuals. While many people view movies as mere entertainment, they can also offer encouragement and insights into human behavior if one pays close attention.  No book, magazine, music, or movie should be removed from the shelves. These materials are not just for us to read, listen to, or watch; they are there to convey information about things that people may not know. People should re - evaluate how these forms of media can affect their lives. More books, magazines, music, and movies should be added to school libraries and public libraries. The more people engage with these materials, the better they will understand life.  I have noticed that some people go to the library just to relax by reading a book, but they often fail to understand the content. It is a pity that people do not delve deeper into what they are reading. This is why it is important to have more books on the shelves. As Katherine Paterson said, ""If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, the work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" If people truly understood the meaning of this quote, they would have a better appreciation of the value of books in life. We should be grateful for authors like Katherine Paterson, as they help us understand the significance of these wonderful books."
875	3852	2	2	A library is a public space accessible to people of all ages. It offers a wide variety of books for different purposes. There is a cozy area for children to select books and sit down to read. For adults, there are coffee tables, sofas, and other amenities while they read. Libraries should never be required to restrict access to certain materials based on the ages of the visitors.  Censoring a library is not an effective way to keep young children away from offensive materials. When children are in a library, they should go to the appropriate sections for their age group and be supervised. In general, most children are not attracted to books without many pictures or colors. Since libraries are public places for all ages, even though there are bookstores that sell adult - only books, movies, and magazines, these items should not be removed from libraries. Equal rights should be upheld in libraries.  The world is full of offensive things. When children are outside the library, whether at home or in public places, they may encounter the same offensive content as they would in a library book. Removing certain books, movies, and magazines from libraries will not solve the problem. I believe that if parents teach their children the difference between right and wrong, there is no issue with children being in a library that has adult materials.  If I owned a library, I would not mind having a selection of books that are appropriate to a certain extent. I have visited many libraries and have seen some content that I thought was inappropriate, but often I was not in the right section or was not doing what I was supposed to do. This issue does not bother me, and I do not think certain books should be removed just because children are in the library. Libraries should remain a place that caters to the diverse needs of all age groups.
876	3853	2	2	Censorship restricts our freedom, much like someone telling us what we can and cannot do. Recently, I and my friends wanted to watch a newly - released movie, but due to censorship, we were not old enough to see it without our parents. This kind of situation isn't ideal. Censorship violates our freedom to be different. It limits our access to music, movies, and books based on age. It's like a modern - day authority figure dictating our actions, clothing, and speech. History has shown that such an approach fails. Just like the victims of a certain ideology in the past, who were punished for being different, censorship classifies people and restricts their choices. The world is diverse because of different people. We should not let censorship make everyone the same.
877	3854	2	2	People hold diverse views on literary works, including books, magazines, movies, and music. If libraries were to remove these from their shelves, they would lose business, alienate children, and undermine the purpose of having such materials. By removing older works that might offend younger generations, libraries risk losing customers who appreciate such content. These older works, which may contain elements that seem harmful but are actually meant to show how life was in the past, like the era of slavery, serve an important educational function. For children using the library, removing such literature would give them a false sense that things have always been as they currently see. As they grow older, they may struggle to believe in the changes that have occurred over time because they lack the early exposure. Such literary works are written to educate, not to harm. Libraries should keep these pieces on their shelves to teach the younger generation about the world's history and their ancestors' lives.
878	3855	2	2	I firmly believe that there should be censorship in libraries. Children should not have unrestricted access to certain books if they are inappropriate for their age. This can prevent people from getting into trouble and reading the wrong content. There are already stores where age - restricted items are sold. In libraries, which are public spaces, if a material is suitable only for a certain age group, it should be subject to censorship. When children know there are off - limits materials, they may try to access them secretly. Censorship can prevent this. Censorship also ensures that everyone is treated equally and no one feels left out. There are bookstores and online platforms where age - restricted purchases can be made with a credit card. Similarly, libraries should implement censorship. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is necessary to protect the appropriate audience and maintain a proper environment.
879	3856	2	2	The library is a place where people can freely read according to their interests, either for enjoyment or information - seeking. Sometimes, the materials available may offend others, but due to freedom of speech, there's little we can do. For example, there may be books or magazines about homosexuality. While some may oppose their presence, others may find them valuable. Another debated topic is books about sex or drugs. Parents may be concerned about their children reading such books, but these can also show the negative impacts of these behaviors. I personally like reading such books as they illustrate how these things can ruin lives. However, I oppose materials related to racism, such as books, magazines, music, and movies. I also find movies depicting bullying of people with disabilities inappropriate. Some people write offensive materials, either unknowingly or deliberately. Since everyone has the right to free speech, we have to tolerate it. If there are inappropriate materials in the library that we don't like or don't want our children to see, we can simply avoid them.
880	3857	2	2	"I believe that materials with racist content or unsightly images should be removed from library shelves. However, this raises the issue of racism in classic books. For instance, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" uses a derogatory term for African - Americans, which was common when the book was published but is unacceptable today. Generally, most of the books I've read are not overly offensive. There are magazines like ""Playboy"" and ""Maxim"" that are offensive to women, but there are age - related purchase laws. During the Nazi era in Germany, many books were banned for religious or ideological reasons. Also, some of Mark Twain's works were briefly banned for using the same derogatory term, but it was part of the common language at that time. As a Catholic, there is a list of forbidden books, though I'm unaware of their content. Regarding music, I think music advocating violence against police or promoting racism, like that of the Aryan Brotherhood, should be banned. I don't think movies should be banned for violence, but pornographic movies should be prohibited, and libraries already have such a policy. I agree with Katherine Paterson that if we start banning based on personal offense, there will be no books left on the shelves. My view of what is offensive is relatively relaxed compared to others."
881	3858	2	2	"Have you ever encountered a book you thought was great, yet knew it might offend someone you know? In my view, materials that could be offensive in libraries should not be removed from the shelves. People should have the freedom to choose their own books, and no one has the right to dictate what others should read. My suggestion is that such materials be placed in a designated ""adult material"" section, including books, music, movies, etc.  I once couldn't borrow a movie called @CAPS2 @PERSON1 because of my age. It was just an action - adventure movie, and I found it very unfair that my youth prevented me from checking it out. This experience led me to believe that materials that might offend should not be removed.  Another reason is that people have diverse interests. No two individuals have the exact same preferences all the time. Removing materials only satisfies one person while depriving many of something they might be interested in. I understand that some people may be uncomfortable with offensive materials due to their past experiences. However, I think everyone can choose the materials they like and leave the rest for others.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that materials that may offend certain people should remain available. What might be offensive to one person could be highly interesting to another. As the saying from Ebony magazine goes, ""Another person's junk might be someone else's treasure,"" which perfectly sums up this situation."
882	3859	2	2	"I firmly believe that materials of this kind should not be removed from the shelves. Instead, they should be rated. This is a free country, and taking away such materials would infringe on people's freedom of speech. Countless individuals have fought for this fundamental right in the past.  If we rate the materials that are released, they are less likely to end up in the wrong hands. For example, if @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 had been removed from the market when it first came out because it contains violence, profanity, and guns, the company would have suffered significant financial losses. While it may be inappropriate for children, it is the responsibility of parents to be more discerning when purchasing such items for their children.  The creators should not be held accountable for how people react to the materials they produce. Buyers need to be more responsible and ensure proper supervision. The old saying ""Everything isn't made for everybody"" is very true. People have different tastes, and what is acceptable to one person may not be to another.  Certain books are inappropriate for young children as they contain sexual content and discuss topics that children should not be thinking about at that age. When children read such books, they may start to have inappropriate thoughts. It is the parents' responsibility to monitor what their children read, not the author's. The author may be writing for an older audience and exercising their freedom of speech.  Similarly, if parents find music inappropriate for their children, they should monitor their children's listening habits. Music can evoke different moods in people. Magazines also vary in their suitability, and adult magazines with certain imagery should be kept out of reach of children. The fault lies with the buyers who leave such materials accessible to children, not the creators who are simply trying to make a living by producing what people like."
883	3860	2	2	"We've all come across a book that we wish had never been written. As Katherine Paterson, an author, once said, ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.""  I think there should be a proper mechanism for dealing with such materials. For instance, if we can gather at least @NUM1 people to sign a petition, the book could be removed. This principle applies to music, movies, magazines, and even bibles in libraries.  I'm not advocating for a law that restricts access to something just because one person dislikes it. However, if a large number of the public agrees that a particular item should not be available, it might be best to remove it. We all worry about our children and constantly monitor them to ensure they don't access inappropriate things. The same concern applies to books, movies, music, magazines, and for some, even bibles.  It's true that when a child tries to check out an ""inappropriate"" book at a library, the checkout counter usually denies the request. But this doesn't prevent the child from reading the book in the library. Moreover, considering today's high crime rates, it's quite possible that a child could steal a book, magazine, or film.  To prevent such issues, libraries could have an adult section, not just for ""@CAPS1"" rated materials but for all content that is considered unsuitable for children. Additionally, we should have the option to petition to remove books that we believe are inappropriate for our children. This is my opinion on library censorship, and I hope it resonates with others."
884	3861	2	2	There's no need to be offended when visiting a library. Libraries are places where people can access what they like. Everyone has their own preferences, and you don't have to look at materials you don't like.  Books, movies, music, and magazines are created for people to consume. People have the right to choose what they want, and libraries are the perfect place to fulfill those choices. Others should not be offended by the preferences of others.  Most libraries are divided into sections for children, young adults, and adults. If you think a particular material doesn't belong in a certain section, you can request it to be moved to another. However, you shouldn't have a material removed just because you find it offensive. This is unfair to those who might enjoy it.  If you're offended by a material in a library section, it's acceptable to have it moved. Remember, someone else might like it. Libraries are for everyone, and we should respect each other's tastes. In conclusion, we should not be offended by what others like in a library.
885	3862	2	2	Libraries are inclusive spaces that cater to people of all ages, from young children to the elderly. When we visit a library, we expect to find a wide range of books to meet our personal interests and research needs. However, some libraries are considering removing this diversity.  Libraries house books on almost every subject to accommodate the individual differences of their patrons. For example, a person from an extremist religious group may visit the library to read about their religion. A strict @CAPS1 individual might be offended if they come across a book on that extreme religion, and the reverse could also be true. Due to our diverse beliefs and customs, we all have different views on literature.  Most libraries are large enough to be divided into sections such as young adult, mature adult, children, non - fiction, fiction, and science fiction. If a child wanders into the mature adult section and reads a book beyond their maturity level, it is the child's responsibility. Mature readers should not be penalized by having all adult - oriented books removed because a child didn't stay in their designated area.  Different cultural beliefs lead to different views on everyday things. A book that one reader strongly disagrees with may be highly recommended by another. One book can have a completely different meaning to different people. While it would be concerning if books about sex were placed next to children's books, this is not the case in most libraries. Libraries could even establish a restricted section to warn readers about the content of the books in that area.  Books in libraries are written for a wide variety of people. Factors such as age, gender, religion, maturity, race, and political beliefs all influence how we respond to a book. Whether a book appeals to us depends on our beliefs, values, and customs. So, why should a library remove books that only a certain percentage of people disagree with? Removing such books could upset those who like them and may even be relevant to their daily lives.  A library is a repository of knowledge, filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions. Removing access to certain books would be a violation of the author's freedom of speech. Just because a subject is controversial or mature doesn't mean people should be denied the right to read about it. If our reading choices are limited by someone else's decisions, where is our freedom?  In conclusion, a library is a place for everyone. It should have a wide range of books for all types of people. The library's layout can be arranged to ensure that young children don't encounter inappropriate books near their reading area. Removing books on controversial subjects is unfair to those who want to read them. A library should be a balanced space where people can access any knowledge they desire.
886	3863	2	2	I firmly believe that every individual has the right to express their own opinions on life. Censoring someone's books, music, or movies due to their perceived inappropriateness is akin to silencing a distinct opinion. If we suppress an author and their story or song, we lose the opportunity to view life from another person's perspective.  In the @ORGANIZATION1, we possess the freedoms of speech and press. These amendments enable individuals to voice their opinions without fear of being immediately dismissed. However, despite these amendments, there are still restrictions on what can be published. For instance, if we were to discover a diary written by @PERSON1, should we access his innermost thoughts? Or should we deem it too dark and depressing for the general public? Just because his ideas are different does not mean we should conceal them. On the contrary, we should share them to educate people about the diverse ways of viewing life.  I am of the opinion that, with the author's permission, anyone's ideas should be accessible for others to read and interpret in their own way. If someone wishes to learn about how to commit murder in a @CAPS1, they should be allowed to do so. The @CAPS1 is becoming obsolete as we enter the technology era, and there is little that can be found in a @CAPS1 that cannot be sourced online.  Although the @CAPS1 is a government - run institution, many people will seek alternative means to access censored media. It is true that allowing 'censored' material in a @CAPS1 could expose children to inappropriate content. However, similar to the internet, we can implement blocking mechanisms to protect children.  All voices, regardless of whether they are racist, sexist, biased, or seemingly insane, should be heard. These can offer insights into the perspectives and causes behind hate and war. If we can learn from different mindsets through books, music, and movies, then such access should be permitted. Nothing should be blocked from the public, as everyone has the right to express their opinions in their own way.
887	3864	2	2	I advocate for keeping all books in the library. If we start removing books, eventually, there will be none left. The only exception might be rated @CAPS2 movies, which could potentially be removed. However, just because a book might be offensive to one person does not mean it should be removed from the library. For example, an older woman might be offended by a magazine featuring a teenage girl taking drugs or being half - naked, while a teenager sitting beside her might enjoy such gossip.  Removing books would lead to a lack of variety in the library, leaving only one genre. A better approach would be to separate the books. Offensive books could be placed at the back, and children's books should be kept away from mystery and horror books.  Consider a student who goes to the library to work on a history report about slavery. If all books on slavery have been removed because someone thought they were offensive to African - Americans, the student will be at a loss.  I understand the reasons for removing some books due to sexual content, as children should not be exposed to such material. Similarly, books with religious content that might be considered inappropriate, like those about worshiping the devil, are sometimes removed.  The situation with movies is also complex. I wouldn't want my daughter to pick up a movie with sex scenes or drug content. But just because I want such movies removed doesn't mean everyone does. Removing all offensive movies would spell the end of the library's movie business.  In conclusion, no one should have the power to decide what should or should not be in the library. There should be a wide variety of materials to prevent people from getting bored with the same books over and over again. KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF.
888	3865	2	2	Author Katherine Paterson believed that if a book was not suitable for her children, it should be removed from library shelves. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want it removed? Personally, I would not. I believe that such a book could offer valuable learning experiences for others. In this essay, I will share my personal experience to explain why I disagree with Katherine Paterson.  In sixth grade, we learned how to find books in a public library using a specific system. As an assignment, we had to locate certain books in our school library. One of the books was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I found it easily because I knew its location and appearance. However, there was a classmate who had never seen a @CAPS2 before. After helping her find the book, she asked, '@CAPS5 is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I did my best to explain the life of @CAPS6 and why it was important to me. Soon, she became interested in learning more.  In some states, it is illegal to have a @CAPS2 in school due to various beliefs or non - beliefs. If the library did not have the @CAPS2 on its shelves, that girl would never have had the opportunity to learn something that is now important to her. A book may be offensive to some, but it can also change a person's life. Unfortunately, like Katherine Paterson, many others believe that certain books should be removed from libraries. But what if that one book that could change a person's life is not available in the library?
889	3866	2	2	I think a library should house any kind of book with diverse content. After all, a library is a place where people go to access information. If you don't want your children to read, watch, or listen to certain materials, you can restrict their access until they are old enough and mature enough to handle it. However, no book should be removed just because it offends someone, is too gory, or contains curse words.  Not everyone is offended by the same things. If you find a book or movie offensive, you can simply choose not to engage with it. But this does not mean it should be removed from the library. Libraries serve the entire community, not just one individual. There may be others who want to read or watch the very material that some find offensive.  This is my stance on the censorship of books, movies, music, magazines, etc. A library is bound to have a large amount of diverse material. If you come across something offensive, be mature about it, put it back, and find something else to read, watch, or listen to.
890	3867	2	2	The question of whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from library shelves if they are considered offensive is a complex one. Many people get upset when they encounter inappropriate materials in a library. Inappropriate materials typically include pictures and words that can offend people. Song lyrics can be offensive, especially when they talk about girls disrespectfully, which can upset both girls and other listeners. Pictures can also be offensive in terms of sex, race, and violence.  I believe that if a book, music, movie, or magazine upsets you, you should avoid that section or that particular material. In a library, kids usually stay in the children's section, and adults should be mature enough to ignore what bothers them. I have visited libraries several times in my life, and when I search for what I need, I simply ignore offensive or upsetting materials.  In conclusion, my answer to the question of whether offensive materials should be removed from library shelves is no. People should be mature enough to stay away from offensive materials in the library and not let them affect them.
891	3868	2	2	"Who can determine what is appropriate for whom? Who has the right to judge right and wrong for others? As with most things, it depends on one's perspective. Those who are overly protected must learn the truth one day. If children learn early, such as not to insert forks into electrical outlets, they will be less curious as they grow older. Over - protection is not always beneficial, and the censorship of what we read, watch, or listen to is absurd and disrespectful to authors.  In the matter of censorship, I find it utterly pointless. Censorship does not prevent children from learning; instead, it only makes them more curious and more likely to hide things from their parents. They may feel unable to ask questions or be honest with their parents. This causes children to act behind their parents' backs, and when in trouble, they may not consider their parents as the first place to seek help.  I firmly believe that libraries should not censor anything. It is an alteration of an author's work. Imagine how it would feel if you had written a piece, had it published, and then someone in the library decided to censor parts of it or restrict certain people from reading it. I contend that censorship should be illegal, not required.  Sheltering children from the real world prevents them from maturing and discovering reality. The idea of presenting a world free of evil or hiding the bad from children often leads them to rebel or leaves them ill - prepared for the future. It is better to help and teach children about the world rather than telling them everything is perfect and only ""bad people"" use certain language.  In conclusion, censorship is unjust, unfair, and truly wrong. It is not the profanity or violence that will one day be part of their lives that is the problem. In the real world, we cannot live with the mindset that everything is perfect or controlled. I believe censorship is merely a means of controlling minds through upbringing."
892	3869	2	2	I believe it is unnecessary to remove items from shelves for offensive reasons, and I have three main reasons for this view. Firstly, the item could be a book, movie, or magazine that someone intends to read. Removing it will disappoint the customer. People visit libraries to find materials that interest them for entertainment. Libraries should offer a wide variety of literature for all types of people because everyone has different tastes. Every time an item is removed from the shelf, there will be an unsatisfied customer.  Secondly, there are numerous solutions to try before removing an item. Libraries usually have some form of organization. To avoid offending anyone, items should be categorized and placed in separate sections. This approach can prevent people from encountering offensive content. If this does not work, librarians could post a sign at the front door indicating the types of materials inside so that everyone is aware before entering.  Lastly, customers must accept some decisions made by a business. A business should generally meet customers' needs and wants, but not when a customer tries to run the business as if it were their own. If a library selects certain items based on what it knows its readers like, others should not interfere. If I owned a library, I would be annoyed if a customer removed a book from the shelf as it would disrupt my business operations.  In conclusion, I believe it is unnecessary to remove items from shelves for three reasons. Firstly, it could be an item someone plans to read. Secondly, there are many solutions to try before removal. Thirdly, customers need to accept business decisions. I have fully expressed my opinion. Although some may disagree with me, I stand by my view. If items were removed for offensive reasons, there would likely be very few books left for anyone.
893	3870	2	2	I am writing to this newspaper company to share my views on why certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. I will draw on my own experiences and readings to present a convincing argument and reflect my stance on library censorship.  I think no book should be removed from library shelves simply because of people's thoughts on religion, race, or other potentially offensive topics. For example, regarding the topic of same - sex marriage, everyone's opinions should be respected. However, if the language used in a book is harsh and intended to be harmful, then it should be removed.  Another aspect is children taking books off shelves. Parents should accompany their children in the children's section and teach them what they should not do, such as taking down inappropriate items. In general, if a book uses negative words to harm others' feelings, it should be removed.  This letter is to convey my opinion on what should or should not be in a library. I have used examples and common sense to illustrate my point of view. I hope my arguments have convinced you about whether to remove a book from the shelf.  Sincerely, [ORGANIZATION1]
894	3871	2	2	"Are there books that are universally evil and should never be read? Is the distinction between good and bad no longer a matter of the readers' personal opinions? The answer is no. Censorship is a harmful practice that masquerades as a benefit. The right to read certain books should not be determined by a conservative minority because everyone has their own viewpoints. Every book has something we can learn from, and it is wrong to deprive people of that opportunity. Freedom of speech also plays a crucial role here, allowing authors' voices to be heard without interference from those who would control what we read.  Libraries have multiple sections for a reason. They need to cater to the diverse tastes of the public, regardless of what others may find offensive. If people were to go through the library and remove every book they disliked, there would be little left. If another person with different tastes did the same, the library would be empty. It is much better to leave all the books available so that everyone can find something to enjoy. In fact, there are likely people who share the author's opinions on almost any topic, so authors should be allowed to express them.  In terms of knowledge, what is offensive to one person may be exactly what another person wants or needs to read, whether for entertainment or educational purposes. We can learn a great deal about psychology and human nature from almost any piece of writing. A restricted section might be appropriate if there is a concern about corrupting innocent minds, but complete censorship is never necessary.  Finally, there is an amendment in the [CAPS1] of [CAPS2] that prohibits censorship. It is unconstitutional to restrict any form of expressive speech, including books, movies, music, and magazines. Banning an author's books is one of the most restrictive actions. The freedom of expression is what differentiates our country from a totalitarian regime. If we start restricting this freedom, what kind of country will we become?  In conclusion, censorship is a harmful practice that should be avoided. People have diverse opinions, all forms of media can be educational, and our freedom should not be restricted. Censorship itself is what should be removed from the ""shelves"" of our society."
895	3872	2	2	Dear [CAPS1], It's hard to draw a line on what kids should or should not see in the world. Should we shelter kids to make them behave better, or should we make them street - smart and aware of what's going on?  I think we can decide what we want our kids to do and say, but we don't have full control over them. I believe kids are being over - sheltered these days. With the rise of new technology, kids are growing up with computers, laptops, and gaming systems. They don't know what it's like to play outside. The world has so much to offer, but we often ignore it because of the new technological advances.  It's important for kids to be both book - smart and street - smart. If they focus too much on one thing, they'll end up lacking in the other. I'm confident that good grades will follow when they have a balanced approach.  Kids are over - sheltered because when they see something we don't want them to see, we restrict them. But who's to say they won't encounter the same thing in the real world when we're not around? That's why it's crucial to teach kids about the world and not keep them in the dark.  We're living in a new age where computers and laptops are the most commonly used devices. It's difficult for kids to understand the reality of life because so much is done online. Since everything is virtual, it's hard for them to grasp the realness of life.  As we get older, we rely more on information from the web. Kids may not learn practical skills like fixing cars or starting a lawnmower.  I think books should not be removed from the shelves. As time passes, kids are losing touch with reality more and more. It's very important what kids learn about everyday life because they are our future. If they have no idea what's going on in the world, it's a scary thought. We need to teach them as much as we can and hope they become the best versions of themselves.  Thank you for your [CAPS3]. Deven
896	3873	2	2	Censorship has been a long - standing issue in various forms of art. In many cases, censorship targets materials that are generally considered inappropriate for creation and consumption. However, there are also more serious instances where censors decide that certain content is unsuitable for a particular audience or an entire country. It begs the question: what gives a select few the right to ban imaginative creations, even those that might be somewhat lewd?  Censorship is a tool that many governments use to achieve a variety of goals, claiming to ensure the “safety” of people's minds and bodies. Some well - known examples of this oppressive control tactic come from countries such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3, @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2. In these places, materials deemed potentially harmful to the @ORGANIZATION2 are strictly monitored and often destroyed.  A notable example occurred in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would collect large quantities of books from the public and burn them in massive rallies. The people, under the influence of the @CAPS5 leadership, often voluntarily surrendered their books without resistance and, in some cases, even participated in the book - burning.  In @LOCATION5, internet censorship still exists. In @DATE1, the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to enter the country but quickly got into a dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 over the censorship of certain materials. After a few months of argument, the company briefly removed all bans, much to the dissatisfaction of the @ORGANIZATION2. During that period, it was reported that some of the main search topics were related to social reformers and religions other than the one sanctioned by the @ORGANIZATION2.  @LOCATION2 takes censorship to an extreme. Its @ORGANIZATION2 restricts and polices all technology in the country, and the common people live in a so - called “@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8”.  In our home country, @LOCATION1, we are promised rights to protect our freedom as citizens, including freedom of speech and press. Censoring our libraries would restrict these freedoms. If we don't stand up for our rights, who will? We are a @ORGANIZATION2 “for the people, by the people”. Why should we allow the censorship of our intellectual creations in a place meant to provide access to knowledge for the less fortunate? If we tolerate such blatant restrictions on our freedoms, we don't deserve them in the first place. Our country was founded and almost torn apart by those who fought for their freedoms. As descendants of these people, we should not squander what our forefathers earned through hard - fought battles.  The censors often pose the question “Is it really better off this way?” They point out that for every great work of art, there are more deviant and inappropriate ones. Pornography is their most common example, arguing that without restrictions, children accessing library resources and the internet would be exposed. While it's a reasonable concern, it's the responsibility of parents or guardians. Simply dropping a child off at the library and hoping they find something suitable is not enough. Parents should accompany their children on the journey of finding what they want.  As author Katherine Paterson said, “All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.”  Censorship has been around for a long time and is likely to persist in any functioning @ORGANIZATION2. This is an unfortunate inevitability. However, the extent of censorship in our daily lives depends on how much we are willing to fight for our freedom.
897	3874	2	2	Almost everyone in the world reads. Many people read on a daily basis, perhaps without even realizing it. Reading is an integral part of life. If you can't read, you're less likely to be successful. Even having basic reading skills is crucial; while knowing just a few simple words might be sufficient in some cases, people definitely need to be able to read.  I firmly believe that nothing should be removed from the shelves. Why would anyone take books off the shelves? If someone finds a book offensive, they can simply choose not to read it. Just because a book offends one person doesn't mean others won't find it interesting. If we start removing books because they offend someone, we have no idea how many books will remain. People can be offended very easily, and almost every book can potentially offend someone.  The same goes for movies. Movies can be just as offensive as books, and I think they might even be more likely to offend.  In conclusion, books, movies, and similar media should not be removed from the shelves just because they offend someone. Many people are too easily offended. One person might love a book while another hates it. Just because you dislike a book doesn't mean it should be taken off the shelves.
898	3875	2	2	Censorship is a significant global issue today. One camp argues that offensive materials are harmful to society and should not be tolerated. The other side contends that freedom of speech is a universal right encompassing all forms of human expression. The matter is further complicated by the question of what is appropriate for children. Are there materials suitable for adults but not for kids? These questions have troubled humanity for centuries, and there is no straightforward solution.  Currently, many view censorship negatively. However, the concept of censorship itself is not inherently bad. Problems arise when those in power abuse it by censoring materials that should not be restricted. For example, many countries restrict the sale and ownership of “@PERSON2,” a book written by @PERSON1 as a mission - statement for @LOCATION1. Although the ideas in the book are offensive, it should not be censored. People have the right to read and form their own opinions on @PERSON1's teachings; it's not the government's role to make that decision for them. While dictatorship and mass - murder are crimes, reading about them is not.  There are few materials that should be rightfully censored from adult access. If an adult can understand what they're reading and form an informed opinion, no one has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge or creating similar works. But the situation changes when considering children. Adults' choices to view pornography or read about extreme violence are their own business. However, these concepts are inappropriate for children, and responsible parents wouldn't want their kids exposed to such content. Children need a gradual and gentle introduction to these ideas to fully understand them. Thus, careful censorship is necessary for their healthy development.  In libraries, very few materials should be banned. Since libraries are places of learning, limiting the information they offer is unjust. However, this doesn't mean there should be no restrictions. Many libraries have a children's section with age - appropriate materials. It's the parents' responsibility to ensure their children stay in this section. When parents believe their child is ready, they can take them to the adult section. This system allows parents to protect their children without depriving adults of access to uncensored materials. Some may argue that unsupervised children could access inappropriate content, but this is a parental issue, not the library's. It's better for a few children to see something inappropriate than for all adults to read censored material.  In conclusion, censorship has its place in society but must be used with great care. When the aim is to protect people, especially children, from harmful content, it can be used sparingly. However, when those in power use it to suppress ideas they oppose, it becomes a form of oppression. Above all, people should be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves. If someone dislikes a piece of material, they can ignore it but should never try to remove it from others' access.
899	3876	2	2	Books can have a profound impact on readers, and sometimes this impact isn't appropriate. Books deemed inappropriate for children or teenagers should be reconsidered for removal from shelves accessible to them. I believe children shouldn't be exposed to inappropriate material until they are old enough and mature enough to understand it.  Books aren't the only concern; movies, music, magazines, and other media can also give children and teenagers wrong ideas. Inappropriate media and information should not be accessible to those who aren't ready or mature enough to handle it.  Children who read inappropriate books or watch inappropriate media can change their behavior. I've seen many movies that are extremely inappropriate for young children. Since children don't have the same level of understanding as adults, they may misinterpret what they see and form wrong ideas. Inappropriate books and media can have a negative impact on a child's childhood.  Children and teenagers need to be mature enough to be exposed to all books, movies, and magazines. If all age groups had access to higher - rated content, it wouldn't be responsible on the part of libraries or those providing the media. Society would be more difficult to control with such unrestricted access. Parents also wouldn't appreciate their children being exposed to content they deem inappropriate.  Many children do foolish things they've seen in movies or read in books, thinking it's cool or something to try. We already have issues with pre - teens and teenagers because they're exposed to inappropriate content at a young age, which affects their actions. I've witnessed or heard of many actions that are likely related to a book or movie and might not have occurred without that exposure.  In conclusion, children simply aren't ready or mature enough to be exposed to all books, movies, and magazines. Exposing them to such content would cause numerous problems for many people, and it's essential to ensure appropriate age - based access to media.
900	3877	2	2	Censorship has become a prominent issue regarding books, music, and movies. These forms of media are being censored to protect young kids, but what about adults? Removing books, music, and movies from library shelves due to censorship is unfair to adults.  Books are now being rewritten to remove offensive language. “To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2” is a prime example. Altering the offensive language in this book would ruin its essence, as it mainly depicts the racism faced by African - Americans. If libraries have censored books, they should have a separate shelf for them so that adults can still read them.  Music is also affected by censorship. Offensive language is being removed from songs, and some stores won't sell uncensored CDs. Some adults prefer the original, uncensored versions. Libraries should carry both explicit and clean versions of CDs to provide options for both kids and adults.  Movies are subject to censorship as well. They are rated @CAPS3 (suitable for all ages), @NUM1 (suitable for children @NUM2 and older), and @CAPS4 (suitable for people @NUM3 and older). These ratings are useful guidelines, but parents should make the final decision on whether their child can watch a particular movie. Libraries should have a wide range of movies on their shelves. A twelve - year - old should be able to watch a @NUM1 or @CAPS4 movie with parental consent.  In conclusion, censorship has its place, but it shouldn't be taken to extremes. Adults should be able to access censored books in libraries, and children should be allowed to watch age - restricted movies with parental approval. This way, both adults' rights and children's protection can be balanced.
901	3878	2	2	Censorship of adult shows is a misguided practice. While it is understandable to implement censorship on children's shows, applying it to good movies and songs is unjustifiable. Freedom of speech should not be compromised in this way. In conclusion, censorship on adult shows undermines the principle of free expression and should be re - evaluated.
902	3879	2	2	To the Newspaper: There should be censorship in libraries, but access to certain books should be age - restricted. Some people visit libraries precisely because of censorship. Nowadays, censorship can encourage children and students to pick up books. If parents believe that censored books are harmless to their children, it is acceptable. Libraries could create a section for readers @NUM1 and older, accessible only with @CAPS2, to address the age issue. However, removing censorship entirely would likely lead to financial losses for libraries and could cause them to go out of business. Therefore, libraries should maintain censorship. The question remains: do we really want to remove censorship from libraries?
903	3880	2	2	Censorship in public libraries is a grave error. Let's reflect on high school and the immersive experiences of classic literature, such as roaming under the opera house with the phantom, fighting for @PERSON2's freedom with @PERSON1, or getting into scrapes in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1. These literary works draw us into their worlds and offer a wealth of sensations. It's unjust to miss out on such literary treasures because the author is a @CAPS2, uses occasional profanity, or is a woman. History has shown the perils of censorship. During the @CAPS3, countless @CAPS4 people, homosexuals, and other minorities were killed due to religious differences, and the @ORGANIZATION1 burned millions of books by @CAPS4 authors. This act of censorship was morally wrong. Censoring books, movies, magazines, or songs for a curse word, a bit of skin, or a controversial idea is often unnecessary. Sometimes, these elements are crucial for emphasis. Giving up beautiful compositions due to controversy or hiding children from materials that can help them form their own opinions is unacceptable. I firmly oppose censorship and will continue to fight against it until it no longer silences great works. Censorship in public libraries is an unjust practice that must be eradicated.
904	3881	2	2	Public libraries are a treasure trove of excellent books, offering a wide variety of types. You can find books on any topic, whether it's to obtain facts or learn new skills. Just because a book presents an opinion doesn't mean it should be removed from the shelves, as everyone perceives things differently. Reading can be highly beneficial, allowing you to learn a great deal. Personally, I'm not fond of reading and don't learn much from it. I'm more of a hands - on person, and words often go in one ear and out the other. It's difficult for me to focus when reading, listening, or writing simultaneously. Despite my personal struggle, the value of diverse books in libraries should not be underestimated, and they should remain accessible to all.
905	3882	2	2	"Libraries should not remove certain types of books from their shelves. Just because some individuals find a book offensive does not mean it should be taken off. If you don't like a book, simply don't choose it; others may enjoy it as it is for entertainment. When searching for a book, if one seems inappropriate, just move on. There are numerous books in the library, so find an alternative rather than fixating on a single one. If there is a so - called ""bad"" book, go to a different section. There will always be more good books available. If other people like a book, the library should not remove it. A book that may be offensive to some could be appealing to others, and some people visit libraries specifically for such books. It might just be that a person is in the wrong section. A seemingly unappealing book could actually be interesting if given a chance. The purpose of books in the library is for entertainment, which is why there are multiple sections and selections. For example, if an adult believes a kids' book gives the wrong idea, they don't have to choose it for their child, but another parent might think it's suitable. Librarians should not remove books based on one person's opinion. Instead, people should remember that others may like the book and that books are there for readers' entertainment. In conclusion, libraries should keep a diverse collection of books on their shelves for all patrons to access."
906	3883	2	2	I would say no. Since all that belongs to history, for instance, if there was a KKK - related matter or anything similar. Suppose there was a waiting period but information was required for it. That information would include notes, dates, and other details. This shows that historical context and related information are significant and should be considered.
907	3884	2	2	I believe in censorship, but I think it's not as serious an issue as it's often made out to be. It's the parents' responsibility to block materials they consider inappropriate for their children. If the content is truly bad, parents have the right to ensure their kids don't access it. In my view, when it comes to restricting materials like books, music, movies, and magazines, some content isn't suitable for younger people unless they have parental approval. I think that if people find something offensive, they may want to get rid of it. If the content is seriously wrong, it should be censored. However, if it's a minor issue like a single word in a book, people should be more understanding and try to look past it or find an alternative approach. If you don't like something, don't read or listen to it, and keep your kids away from it. I've never read a book that was offensive or disturbing. I've come across books I didn't like, but I've never encountered something so bad that I'd want to ban it for everyone. If something is to be censored, it should be for a valid reason, not because of personal dislike or a disagreement with an idea. It should be due to content that's offensive to an entire race or too graphic for young people. In my opinion, this is the proper way to view censorship. When I have kids, I'll decide whether to block certain materials, and that's how it should be.
908	3885	2	2	If I were given the opportunity to decide whether offensive books at local libraries should be removed from the shelves, I don't think either removing them or leaving them as they are is entirely correct. I would definitely recommend holding a vote to determine what to do with these books. A vote is reasonable because people have diverse beliefs, and some may be offended by certain content. I would select at least ten individuals with different religions, backgrounds, etc., and have them vote on the fate of the offensive books. People have different beliefs, so it's difficult to satisfy everyone. That's why a vote with a diverse group of people would be effective for most. As my mom said, 'you will never make everyone happy.' There are so many things in society that can offend people, and what deeply offends one person may not affect another at all. This is the main reason why voting is challenging, as there's a wide range of people in the world. One should also consider how many times the book has been checked out previously, as it's possible that none of the voters share the same opinion as those who have borrowed the book. If the book is voted to stay in the library, it should be properly labeled. Since it may be offensive to some, labeling it can prevent someone, like a child, who is unaware, from accidentally coming across it. Voting is a common and effective practice in our society. It's not only used in elections but can also be applied in this situation. Voting is always important, and people should recognize its value. I believe voting could solve many problems in the world.
909	3886	2	2	Nowadays, a few negative comments rarely influence what people read. That's the trend in the current era. No one wants to read a boring article unless it's intended to be so. I'll share my opinions on whether certain materials like books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they're considered offensive. I base my opinions on my observations, experiences, and reading some so - called offensive articles. In my view, no one's work should be removed from the shelves because I'm sure they put a lot of effort into it to get it published. There's no valid reason to take it off. If my work was removed, I'd be shocked and upset. It can hurt people emotionally. However, there are times when we don't want certain content to be seen because it's too embarrassing. For example, if an athlete who was suspended for violations is interviewed in an article and is cursing and out of control, I'd put that article away to avoid public exposure. Everyone knows that some movies and music with explicit content or lyrics can't be publicly displayed. You have to request them, and someone will retrieve them from the back. Only G - rated movies should be on the shelves, while movies rated [rating] and above, as well as similar music, should be behind the counter. I'm sure this is clear to the audience. Now that I've shared my views on censorship in libraries, what are your thoughts on this topic after reading this persuasive essay? You've read my thoughts based on experience, observations, and common sense. If you had to write an essay on library censorship, how would you approach it?
910	3887	2	2	Materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines are for people's enjoyment. Adults and children can gain a lot of information from library reading materials. Books offer an alternative way to learn new things, rather than just in a classroom. If the reading materials are already in the library, they shouldn't be removed. People who visit the library must be responsible. Adults and young adults should know what is appropriate to read and what isn't. No one has the right to remove a book from the shelf just because they find it offensive. There are millions of books in the world that some people find offensive. There's no such thing as a perfect book that doesn't bother anyone. Every book that's published today has the right to be read. There are people out there looking for specific books, magazines, movies, and music. These materials can help solve problems, make the right decisions, and guide people in the right direction. [Religious book] is a source of understanding and knowledge. However, there are many people who think we shouldn't read it or even pick it up. But as [Religious book] says, we have free will. We have the freedom to choose the books we want to read. Books provide an additional way for people to learn new things, and library materials are a great source of information for both adults and kids. In conclusion, these materials should be accessible for people's enjoyment and learning.
911	3888	2	2	Should offensive material be censored? No, censoring books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media infringes upon the freedom of American citizens. Consider this: would the words 'hell' or 'damned' be removed from the Bible because they are considered offensive? I think not, as these words contribute to the power of the book. Books that are considered offensive offer insights into history and culture. Removing them would limit education, so they should not be censored.  A well - known and controversial case of censorship is the popular book '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1'. The book tells the story of a young white boy running away with an older black man, and the word 'nigger' is used frequently. Many people were offended by this word, so a new version was republished, replacing 'nigger' with 'slave'. Some were satisfied with the change, but others felt that it removed a crucial part of the story. I agree with the latter view. The story is set in a time when black people were slaves and commonly referred to as 'niggers'. While the word has a heavy connotation, that is precisely why the author used it, to give readers a sense of the era. For future generations who may not know about slavery or black oppression, the book provides an unfiltered view of a black man's life. The word symbolizes slavery, and without it, the book loses its impact.  Censorship is a complex issue, and everyone has a different threshold. The case of '@ORGANIZATION1' is just one example. On television, nudity and inappropriate language are censored. However, it should be the parents' responsibility to decide what their children read, watch, or buy. If a parent finds a book offensive, they should ensure their child does not read it, but the books should not be removed from the shelves as they can entertain and educate others. In conclusion, books should not be censored. If a person deems a book inappropriate, they can simply choose not to read it.
912	3889	2	2	Imagine you're in the library, looking for a book to read, when your child runs up to you holding a magazine of questionable content. What would you do? Libraries should not have inappropriate items on their shelves. Censoring libraries is a way to protect you and your family, ensuring that everyone can enjoy their time there.  One reason libraries should be censored is for the sake of children. Children are naturally curious and are drawn to colorful and unique things. For example, my little sister once preferred going to the zoo over the museum. She said, 'I want to see the animals, not a boring statue. I can see those anytime around town.' This shows that children are attracted to new and different things. If they see inappropriate material in the library for the first time, they'll be curious about it because it's novel.  Another reason is that sometimes library items are mis - shelved. Suppose you check out a movie that sounds great, only to find out it's not what you expected when you get home. What if you rented it for a party with guests? It would be embarrassing. Something similar happened to my cousin; she rented a '@LOCATION1' by mistake and was embarrassed for weeks. This embarrassment could have been avoided if libraries were censored.  Lastly, seeing certain material in a library can be offensive. I know I'd be offended, and I wouldn't want others to experience that either. When I was a kid, I went to the mall with my grandmother to buy jeans. I was offended when the salesperson said I 'looked fat' in the jeans I picked. People should consider others' feelings before causing offense.  Some people think inappropriate material is okay in libraries, but I believe they should find other places for it. Think about your family and the potential consequences of not having library censorship. Are you willing to be responsible for not taking action? We should work towards stricter laws on library censorship.
913	3890	2	2	Why should books that some people enjoy be removed from library shelves? It's absurd. There are many alternatives to completely removing certain books.  It's understandable that young children should not be exposed to inappropriate materials such as books, magazines, poems, movies, or songs. It's unnecessary for them to read explicit content, but we can prevent it.  One way libraries across the country can prevent this is by creating separate libraries for explicit materials or placing them on the opposite side of the library from children's materials. Although libraries usually have different corners for adult and children's materials, there should be stricter rules about children entering the adult section.  Another idea is to require parental permission on a child's library card. The permission should specify which areas of the library the child can access. For example, if a child's parents only allow them to get materials from the children's section, the child won't be able to borrow from other areas without their parents present to give permission.  When I was a child, I was upset when I couldn't do what my parents were doing. But now, I understand that they wanted me to stay a child for as long as possible. They knew that exposing me to inappropriate materials would make me grow up too fast.  In conclusion, we should keep inappropriate books and magazines away from young kids. I don't advocate banning these materials from libraries; instead, I want parents to take responsibility and prevent their children from being exposed to such content. It's not the library's fault if children are exposed to explicit material; it's the parents' for allowing it to happen.
914	3891	2	2	Should offensive materials be removed from shelves? Should the movies you loved as a child suddenly disappear?  Magazines have always been known for being offensive. They often distort the words of celebrities and people, presenting a completely different version of the truth. There are numerous movies that show violence, replay painful parts of people's lives, or say offensive things. Music, too, can be offensive. Songs are sometimes written about people's past actions that others may find offensive. I once saw a music video making fun of @PERSON1 for being in jail, but I don't think it should be removed from the internet because it's entertaining.  This world needs things to keep us entertained. Imagine a world without news reporters or paparazzi. We'd be completely unaware of what's happening around us. While I understand that celebrities may be offended by being constantly talked about, especially regarding their mistakes, that's just how the world works. Gossip and discussion are part of everyone's lives.  In my opinion, getting rid of offensive movies, music, magazines, and books is not a good idea. What would we have to entertain us if they were gone? In conclusion, we should accept that offensive materials are a part of our entertainment and not seek to eliminate them.
915	3892	2	2	In @LOCATION1, the constitution guarantees freedom of speech, allowing individuals to express their thoughts, opinions, and individuality. This freedom should also extend to books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of entertainment. However, with freedom of speech, there will always be people who take offense to others' ideas and opinions.  If someone finds a particular type of material offensive in a public library, they should simply avoid it. They shouldn't make a fuss over something that others enjoy. They need to understand and accept the concept of freedom of speech. What one person dislikes may be another person's favorite.  So, why should others' forms of enjoyment be censored and taken away just because one person is offended? It's unjust. Everyone has their own way of expressing themselves, which is a healthy way to release positive or negative energy. Whether it's writing books, posting articles, or creating music, it's a form of venting, and some people may appreciate that style. It's up to the offended person to decide whether to engage with such content.  Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. Implementing censorship would deprive people of the things they enjoy and violate the artists' and authors' freedom of speech and expression. There are books that have been banned from schools across the country, but just because some think it's right doesn't mean it is. While the intention may be to protect people from offensive content, it also shields them from the real world. We should let people experience the diverse forms of art in the world. In conclusion, libraries should uphold the principle of freedom of speech and refrain from censorship.
916	3893	2	2	I never thought I'd witness the day when there'd be talk of book censorship. However, this doesn't mean I approve of it. Just because I don't approve doesn't mean I oppose it either. I believe it's fair and necessary to consider both sides of the argument.  If one thing is censored, it sets a precedent to censor everything. Public media like televisions, radios, magazines, and books have become part of our imperfect world. There are indeed crimes and indecencies occurring, but can we truly say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children until early adulthood? It's possible, but also uncertain.  It's well - known that children are highly impressionable at a young age and can be shaped into who they'll become, at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions. For example, when I was young, my cousin, who was a few years older, liked a particular thing. After spending a lot of time with her, I became obsessed with it too. Later, my mother told me it wasn't really my interest but hers. I had simply modeled after her. Every child has had similar experiences. So, is it not reasonable to think they might imitate what they see in uncensored media?  On the other hand, it would be unfair to remove books that some consider improper. If we did so, nearly every book would be removed. Nowadays, the radio is full of references to sex, drugs, alcohol, and smoking. The internet is flooded with porn and crude ads. Books, too, have become more explicit.  The world has become rather chaotic. In the end, I stand by my view: if one thing is censored, all should be. It's only fair. Radios, televisions, movies, and other forms of media are already censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem. Therefore, libraries should censor their books or at least make an effort to do so. Libraries are places for learning and enjoyment, not for leaving mental scars from inappropriate reading material.
917	3894	2	2	I find library censorship laws unnecessary. People should have the freedom to borrow whatever they like. Those who create these laws should be glad that young people are interested in reading.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., all fall under censorship. Everyone perceives things differently, and some are more mature than others. If someone wants to engage with a particular product, they should be allowed to. The person who selects the item should know their own capabilities and whether they can handle the content. They should be held accountable for their actions, just like in the legal system.  Even if content is considered offensive, it shouldn't be removed from the shelves. What seems offensive to one person may be interesting to another. For instance, when a newspaper comments on an athlete, it may offend the athlete's fans, but non - fans might find it amusing. Should the post be removed just because some people don't like it? We shouldn't inconvenience those who like a particular book, music, movie, or magazine due to a few individuals.  Interests vary, and a teen might like the same type of books as an adult. Censorship laws prevent teens from reading what they like based on age, which is unfair. We're in a new era, and things have changed. Censorship laws should be abolished. If you find a book offensive, simply don't read it. There are countless books in libraries, and there's bound to be one you'll enjoy.  In conclusion, offensive material shouldn't be removed from library shelves as some people may like it. There should be no censorship laws in libraries as they're unfair and unjust. People of all ages should be able to borrow any book they want.
918	3895	2	2	If you find library materials offensive, you don't have to engage with them. It's a personal choice. The best approach is to keep these materials on the shelves because some people enjoy them. People generally don't pick up books or movies from the library that they know they won't like. If we removed everything that someone might find offensive, there would be no libraries left, as it's likely that any library item could be considered offensive by someone.  Some people find such content entertaining. Removing offensive books and movies hurts the creators, as they believe that's what the public wants to see. As long as it doesn't have a negative impact, people are okay with it. We see offensive content on TV daily, so if we can watch it on TV, there's no reason we can't read about it in a book. I see offensive content on TV regularly, and it doesn't bother me, so reading a book with similar content wouldn't be an issue either.  Ultimately, only you can decide whether to read or stop reading something. If you think it's offensive, you don't have to look at it. Since we're exposed to offensive content in our daily lives, it shouldn't be a problem for anyone. Some people even find it entertaining.
919	3896	2	2	Censorship involves editing or completely removing content. It can have both positive and negative aspects. The question is, does censorship truly benefit our society? Even with censorship in place, crimes like murder and rape still occur. To discuss this, I'll draw on my experiences, observations, and readings.  In terms of experiences with movies and TV shows, many movies offer both unrated and censored versions. Most people prefer the unrated version as it's often more engaging and shows more content. However, some choose the censored version, especially if they have children. On TV, many shows bleep out inappropriate words to prevent young children from learning them. That's why shows with such content are usually aired late at night.  My observations also pertain to movies and TV shows. I do watch shows with language and violent content, but I'm careful not to watch them around my eleven - year - old sister. I don't want her to pick up bad words or be exposed to overly graphic content. Some movies could reduce the violence, but they need to make money.  Regarding my readings, many books have been banned across the country because people were offended by them. Similarly, some song lyrics prevent songs from being played on the radio. Artists often create two versions of a song to make it more accessible. I've read books with inappropriate words, but I don't let it bother me. The same goes for songs; the artists likely have a reason for using certain words.  In conclusion, censorship can be good or bad, depending on one's perspective. My experiences, observations, and readings have made me realize that there are valid points on both sides of the censorship debate.
920	3897	2	2	I firmly believe that if a book is offensive to you, you should simply avoid reading it. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. We should not remove books from library shelves.  For example, a person of the Jewish religion might find a book about Hitler offensive. But if they remove it, future generations studying that era won't have access to relevant materials. Without these books, our world history could be forgotten.  Slavery is another difficult subject. It was a harsh time for Africans, but we shouldn't remove books about it because they're offensive. We can't deprive the next generation of the opportunity to learn from history.  If we remove books from library shelves, what about the Bible? Some people don't believe in God or heaven, while many others do. Removing it would cause numerous problems for public libraries and their patrons.  As a child, I encountered some unpleasant content in books, but I don't think we should take away books from those who like them. Taking away reading options from people with different interests is not only unfair but will also lead to problems in the future. We should preserve the diversity of reading materials in libraries to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn and explore different ideas.
921	3898	2	2	Older authors often pen gruesome stories about their pasts, whether in fiction or non - fiction. These books may end up in the wrong hands, being discarded or burned. Parents sometimes get angry at their children's behavior and speech, usually blaming television or schoolmates, without considering the broader situation. Any child can easily access inappropriate magazines, books, or movies in school or public libraries, and parents typically notice too late. There is a vast variety of books, and it's impossible to judge a book's inappropriateness just by its cover. Although books are for reading, they aren't suitable for all age groups. However, no book should be completely removed from a library. No matter how graphic, perverted, or inappropriate a book is, it has an audience with corresponding interests. Even books about drugs and murder should be available, though those about murder should not be read by children under twelve. Libraries can organize books by age groups to avoid problems. Authors should not be blamed for their writing as it reflects their personal thoughts and feelings. This rule also applies to magazines, music, and movies. If authors think their work is unsuitable for children, they can indicate an age limit. Adults who are angry about this should reflect on their own past actions, which might change their views on various media.
922	3899	2	2	When you enter a library to find a good book or magazine, you may come across some offensive materials. I, like some others, believe that such materials should be removed from the shelves. There are books, magazines, movies, etc., that contain bad language, racism, inappropriate religious content, and sexual themes. Reading such materials is bad for our minds and offensive to many. Most people dislike curse words; seeing them in a book can lead to negative thoughts about the library and put wrong ideas in their heads. Racist books are particularly hurtful, and religious people can be offended by content that goes against their beliefs. The library can handle these offensive materials in a few ways. Librarians can put up warning signs and separate these items into a dedicated section so that sensitive readers know where they are and can avoid them. Alternatively, a warning note can be placed inside the front cover. This would be very helpful to many. Not all books in a library are appropriate. While some inappropriate content is inevitable, extremely offensive books can be removed as too many people are offended while reading. We should put a stop to this. In conclusion, offensive materials are common in libraries. We can either remove them or at least warn readers, so that book - lovers won't be offended by what they read.
923	3900	2	2	I think certain movies, music, and other media bother parents. I wouldn't want my child listening to music that might teach them wrong things. I'd check the music my child listens to. There are movies that are too violent, but in a free country, people will watch them anyway. Some movies are for adults, yet many adults let their kids watch them. There are always people who don't like what they see or hear in media, or know someone who doesn't. My mom sometimes tells me to turn off the TV or music when she hears something she doesn't like. My friends listen to music that I think promotes negative things like gang activities, fights, shootings, and legal troubles. Some kids learn from what they see in action movies and try to imitate them to seem cool. There will always be things that people dislike. I learned this when I was young, like most kids. I think drama, action movies, and content that parents like sell the most, while baby - related media has less demand. I like most of what I see and hear, but I believe there's too much violence, drug - related content, and inappropriate imagery on national television, which shouldn't be used to teach the young. That's my opinion.
924	3901	2	2	Just as no two snowflakes are identical, no two human beings are exactly the same. Some people have a greater sense of curiosity and like to think outside the box. However, if these curious individuals face restrictions on what they can read or study, it's difficult for them to expand their knowledge. So, if a person is mature enough and wants to study or read about a certain topic in a library, with the permission of a guardian, they should be allowed to explore any topic of their choice. Unfortunately, a small group of people often spoil things for the rest. Libraries usually consider a child's age when determining what they can read, but this is unfair to mature children who can handle more adult - oriented content. If a person is legally eligible and has guardian permission, they should have unrestricted access to library materials. Who can say a ten - year - old is too young to learn about @PERSON1 and his plans for the @CAPS1? One is never too young or old to learn something new if they're curious and mature enough. Curiosity has driven mankind to make new discoveries and reach the current level of technology. The youth of today will be the leaders of tomorrow. If they're curious and want to gain more knowledge for positive reasons, we should let them.
925	3902	2	2	In most libraries in the @LOCATION1, there are books, movies, music, etc., that may be inappropriate for younger children. These materials can contain graphic content or offensive language. However, libraries in @LOCATION2 should not get rid of them. Adults in @LOCATION2 like to use these materials, children have likely already been exposed to such content, and many of these seemingly offensive materials are educational. When you think about your childhood, your @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 watched more mature movies because they found them more interesting than cartoons. Mature content should be kept in libraries for the mature audience. If removed, this group will have nothing suitable to read or watch in the library. Also, most children have already observed or heard offensive content. Parents may unknowingly use offensive language in front of their children, who then imitate them. Kids have also seen graphic content in movies and video games, so it's too late to shield them. Many movies and books with offensive language and graphic content are educational. For example, '@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5' is a great movie that details the search for a man during @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1, providing historical information. Overall, children in the @LOCATION1 have already been exposed to offensive content. There's no point in hiding it. We should keep these materials in libraries for the benefit of adults, children, and the country's history.
926	3903	2	2	Do you believe that @CAPS1 can prevent people from being offended? Removing items like books, music, movies, and magazines will not stop people from taking offense. The key questions are: who determines what is offensive, and how is it offensive? What makes something offensive? In conclusion, the issue of defining and dealing with offensive content is complex and requires careful consideration.
927	3904	2	2	In @LOCATION1, many people enjoy reading. Books, magazines, newspapers, and music are excellent ways to pass the time. I'm particularly fond of books about people with special powers, such as necromancers. If we were to remove books that might offend someone from libraries, what would remain? For example, I don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type that wouldn't offend anyone, barring a severe aversion to letters. Think about your own interests in music, art, and the types of books or magazines you enjoy. Now, imagine losing all of these from the library, your refuge from screaming children or annoying neighbors. You'd be bewildered as to why your beloved items have disappeared. That book about necromancers you love might be considered offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power to raise the dead. The song stuck in your head all day might no longer be available online due to certain words that offend those with'sensitive' ears. If I walked into a library and found that all 'offensive' works had been banned, I'd be shocked. Everyone finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks rap, hip - hop, or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I believe some of these songs have different meanings. If everything offensive were removed, there would be little left for teenagers or adults to read. Even @PERSON1's works are offensive to some, who think he was crazy. Moreover, as libraries contain fewer items, fewer people will visit. Eventually, libraries might close as everything is deemed offensive. We'd have to buy the books we want online, if that were still allowed. For book lovers, finding an engaging book is like discovering buried treasure. It's a life - changing experience. Removing offensive content is like losing a child; it can't be replaced. In conclusion, we should not remove so - called 'offensive' materials from libraries.
928	3905	2	2	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, this is a free country, and people have the right to express their feelings and thoughts. Everyone has their own opinions about what they like to read or watch. If something offends you, you can choose not to engage with it and find something else that you or your friends and family will enjoy. Secondly, you can learn from things that might offend you. For instance, I read a magazine about black males sagging their pants. Many white people had negative views about these young men just by looking at their appearance. They judged without knowing the person, as one of the black males was an honor student going to a white college. When the whites learned more, they questioned him about his dress, and he reminded them that this is a free country. The whites respected his assertiveness. In conclusion, it is not right to remove certain materials from the shelves based on their perceived offensiveness. I hope you enjoyed reading this essay. If you have any arguments or questions, you can contact me.
929	3906	2	2	Censorship should not occur in libraries. Many people enjoy reading interesting books, watching superb movies, or listening to appealing music that some may find offensive. There are several reasons why certain materials should not be removed from library shelves if they are considered offensive. Firstly, different people find different materials offensive. People have diverse opinions on books, movies, magazines, and music. Non - fiction books about different cultures may offend the people of that culture, but the public needs to be educated about different cultures. Students also use libraries for research. Books about racism and slavery may be offensive to the victimized race, but others may love them for their themes, symbolism, and word usage. It's difficult to determine who should judge if a material is offensive. If a person finds many materials offensive in a library, it could lead to the library closing. Secondly, people sometimes go to libraries specifically to find materials they can't find elsewhere. Libraries are a place to find unique books and movies. In my experience, I've often found books in libraries that I couldn't find elsewhere. Since there's no video store in my town, I rely on the library for movies. If offensive materials are removed, I might not visit the library as often. Thirdly, people don't have to read what they find offensive. They have the choice of what materials to borrow from the library, except for school - required reading. If a person hears that a book might be offensive, they can avoid it. If they accidentally borrow an offensive book or watch an offensive movie, they can stop. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not advisable because everyone has different opinions, libraries assume people can avoid offensive materials, and removing all offensive materials would leave little to read, watch, or listen to.
930	3907	2	2	I firmly believe that no books should be removed from libraries because they are considered 'offensive'. What is offensive to me may not be offensive to someone else. While I have the right to object to a book I find inappropriate, someone else may think it's completely acceptable. The main concerns people have with books are foul language, sex, and differences in opinion, which are all sensitive topics. Many library books, especially those in the young - adult section, contain foul language. Parents might be unhappy to know what their children are reading. In today's world, we're surrounded by images of sex and indecency, and books with such content are no different from TV or magazines. Romance novels can be very descriptive and may lead to awkward questions. Differences in opinion can also be a problem in libraries. Topics like religion, politics, and morals can spark heated debates. However, we sometimes have to agree to disagree. We need to ask ourselves: can teenagers handle explicit language and sexuality responsibly? Should books be removed just because we don't agree with their content? Should there be censorship in libraries? I don't think so. If you don't agree with a book, don't read it. Instead of blaming libraries for what children read, parents should examine their own parenting and ensure their children aren't reading inappropriate materials. In conclusion, no books should be taken off library shelves.
931	3908	2	2	"@CAPS1 - @CAPS2 or No?"" Katherine Paterson's statement regarding offensive books holds true, and I whole - heartedly concur with her. She posits that if everyone had the authority to remove books they found offensive from all shelves, the world would be devoid of books. It's highly likely that a book offensive to one person may not be so to another. If almost all books were taken off the shelves, what would remain for people to read? I firmly believe that offensive materials like books should not be removed from shelves. Not everyone will find them offensive, and removing them could deprive people of their favorite subjects. I have personal experience with a supposedly offensive book. In my @CAPS3 class, we were assigned to read 'The @CAPS4 in the @CAPS5'. While reading, I found it an engaging story. Later, research revealed that the book was banned in many schools across @LOCATION1 due to subjective words and events. Although there was some bad language, I don't think it's a valid reason to ban the book. It's an award - winning story that my class enjoyed. This experience further validates that certain books should not be banned. As @PERSON1 said, if everyone could ban books from libraries, there would be no books left. With millions of people in the world, if each could ban one book in @LOCATION1, there'd likely be nothing remaining. If all books vanished from @LOCATION1, what would school - kids read? Their reading rate would decline, and grades would drop. A minor law change in @CAPS1 could have significant negative future impacts. There will always be people who find certain books offensive, but they have the freedom to avoid those books. Unless a student, one doesn't have to read offensive books and can keep their kids away from them. Banning books to please one person could lead to loss of customers and make others angry. It's better to have one person mad because a library carries a certain item than to lose customers and upset many. In conclusion, libraries should maintain their current collection for all kids and adults."
932	3909	2	2	Would you allow someone to ban your favorite movie just because it contains mildly offensive content? I certainly wouldn't. If everyone had the right to ban books, we'd end up with no books at all because there will always be something that offends someone. Books should not be banned as it undermines our individuality, violates the freedom of the press, and ruins the future. Banning books means sacrificing our individuality. When we let others decide what's offensive for us, we lose the ability to express ourselves. By conforming to others' standards of appropriate reading, we give up our freedom. Thus, banning books makes us abandon our true selves and follow what others want. The freedom of the press guarantees our right to write whatever we choose. Similarly, we have the freedom to select what we read. As individuals, we should be able to decide our reading material. Therefore, due to the freedom of the press and our individual right to choose, books should not be banned. Banning books would also have a detrimental impact on the future. There are numerous excellent books that would be prohibited, denying future generations the opportunity to enjoy them. Some books can transform lives and teach us how to handle problems. By banning them, we destroy the chance to assist future people. People rely on books for knowledge, help, and ideas. If we take away their books, we can't claim to be building a better future while simultaneously destroying it. In conclusion, books should not be banned as it restricts our individuality, violates the freedom of the press, and ruins the future. If books are banned, it's very likely that your favorite book would be among those removed. And if everyone could ban books, there would be nothing left to read. Banning books destroys the future, limits our freedoms, and eliminates our individuality.
933	3910	2	2	Should books, music, magazines, and movies be removed from library shelves? A library should stock every type of item. Consider a farmer who wants a book on cattle; if a city - dweller deems it useless and discards it, the farmer is out of luck. Similarly, different people have different tastes. Some like romance, while others prefer action. If a library doesn't carry a particular type of item, it may lose customers. For example, if @PERSON2 dislikes violent content and has it removed, and @PERSON1 dislikes chick - flicks and has them removed, there would be few books left, and the library might close. Regarding movies and magazines, libraries should carry appropriate items. If an item is rated @CAPS1, it should be restricted to those @NUM1 or older, as they are adults. There are different cultures with specific preferences. Should we create separate libraries for each culture or have one large library where people can simply ignore the items they don't like? Ultimately, it's the parents' responsibility to teach their children not to pick up items disliked by their family or culture. Removing items based on one person's preference would lead to loss of customers and make others angry. It's better to have one person annoyed because a library stocks a certain item than to lose customers and upset many. In conclusion, since we can't please everyone, we should overlook the items we don't like, teach our children not to bring them home, and move on without causing problems.
934	3911	2	2	I firmly believe that no books should be removed from library shelves. Everyone should have the opportunity to read any book they desire. Just because a few people don't like a book doesn't mean it should be removed; they can simply choose not to read it. Everyone has different story preferences. I'm into freaky novels, while my friends aren't. I dislike some love stories, but I'm fond of abnormal and fiction stories. My favorite novel is 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2'. Many people want to remove books with bad language or certain content from the shelves, but there are others who enjoy such stories. It would be unfair to take away what they like. Some people also object to sex - related books being on the shelves. Removing someone's preferred type of book can discourage people from reading. It would make me stop reading if I couldn't access the books I want. Think about whether you'd risk taking away someone's favorite book and causing them to stop reading. You should view things from others' perspectives. First, consider the positive aspects, such as how much happiness a book brings to the reader. Banning books not only affects the readers but also the authors. It can cause significant harm, put authors out of work, disrupt families' livelihoods, and take away people's beliefs. It can turn something positive into something negative, drive people crazy, and make what a person stands for seem meaningless. Books can be an escape from the real world, a source of conversation, and a way to learn better ways of dealing with things. In conclusion, books should be left on the shelves as they are a means for people to express themselves, and they play an important role in people's lives.
935	3912	2	2	No items such as books, @CAPS1's, and magazines should be removed from shelves just because they are considered offensive. The @LOCATION1 is a free country, which means that if you find something offensive, like a book or magazine, you can choose not to read it. It really frustrates me when people get upset about a book or movie. Different people find different things offensive due to factors like race, gender, and ethnicity. So, we shouldn't remove materials just because a few people are offended. For instance, some people think it's offensive that professional athletes earn @MONEY1 for playing a game while there are homeless people on the streets. However, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is still the most - watched event globally. Just because a few find sports offensive doesn't mean they should be shut down. Similarly, racial jokes are funny to some but offensive to others, yet people still tell them. As Katherine Paterson said, no items should be removed from library shelves just because some people find them offensive. People's views on offensiveness vary, so removing materials isn't the right solution. Almost every book in the world has something that someone, somewhere, finds offensive. If we removed all such books, there would be nothing left to read. In a free country, we have the right to choose what to read. Instead of eliminating books from libraries, we should simply avoid the ones we don't like because someone else might enjoy them. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of preferences and not ban items based on the sensitivities of a few.
936	3913	2	2	I firmly believe that all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason is that there is a risk of young children accessing grown - up books with explicit pictures and inappropriate words. These children may pick up bad habits without understanding the actual meaning of the words.  Music should be edited as some contains cursing and discusses topics unsuitable for young minds. It should be age - appropriate. Movies also need to be censored. Nowadays, children are allowed to watch almost anything, including content that doesn't control language. Additionally, the show @CAPS3 should be blocked as it contains exclusive content that many children watch and imitate.  Magazines often have revealing images on their covers and pages, and they sometimes present false information to seem real. The internet should mainly be used for research and homework, as children may use it to access inappropriate content.  In conclusion, there should be a limit to what we listen to and watch because children absorb everything they see and hear.
937	3914	2	2	I don't think offensive content should be removed from the library. Most books published by authors have some offensive elements, and it's not the library's fault if children read such books; it's the parents' responsibility to monitor their children's reading.  I've been to the library and encountered offensive content in music, movies, and magazines. If all offensive content were removed, the library would be nearly half - empty. I've seen parents discussing with librarians about banning inappropriate content, but they can simply ignore it and keep their children away.  I once discussed this with my mom, and she agreed with me. She said that the issue wouldn't be a problem today if people could just ignore offensive content. The music in the library should stay, whether it's offensive or not, as people use it to express themselves. Most movies made today have inappropriate content, regardless of their rating.  In conclusion, offensive content should remain in the library. Many teens and adults enjoy the existing content. If children access offensive material, either they need to grow up and face such things eventually, or parents should keep them away from it.
938	3915	2	2	Certain materials like books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries. As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone had the right to remove a book from the shelf, the library would be empty because there is always something someone finds offensive.  For every person who finds material offensive, there are ten who don't. People's beliefs can influence their views, especially regarding religion. In libraries, since you never know who will access the materials, it's recommended to have different sections for adult novels, children's books, and science - fiction novels. This way, parents can be more cautious about where their children go. If a child enters the wrong section, it's the parents' fault as children are naturally curious and tend to wander.  A single book, movie, or magazine can teach numerous lessons. If these lessons aren't learned early, they may be learned later in a more difficult way. Everyone has different beliefs and opinions. Just because the world has things people find offensive doesn't mean they should be removed. There's always a choice.  Removing material from libraries can lead to various reactions such as approval, disapproval, anger, and happiness, and it can even cause fights that may escalate. The materials in libraries are meant to teach about life. If people find this wrong, it may indicate they haven't fully experienced life. In conclusion, these materials should stay in libraries.
939	3916	2	2	Censorship is a complex issue that requires in - depth consideration. When thinking about library censorship, I believe all books should remain on the shelves.  Why take books away from those who want to read them just to satisfy others? If you don't want a child to access adult books, you can monitor them instead of removing the books. Trying to keep something from teens often makes them more eager to obtain it.  Books are beneficial as they tell stories, share past events, and convey others' thoughts. Hiding books from people, especially due to their racy content, isn't a good idea as it prevents learning.  Censoring books in libraries can cause problems. One person's opinion could lead to the removal of most books, resulting in arguments and a decrease in library visits.  Books are especially important for teens whose minds are developing. In some places, banned books are celebrated. When considering banning books, remember there are other sources, and think about the people being deprived of them. In conclusion, library books should generally remain uncensored.
940	3917	2	2	When you go to a library to read books, listen to music, or read magazines, you might come across offensive materials. I strongly believe that offensive books, music, and magazines should be removed from library shelves. We should feel safe in libraries.  I had a bad experience at the library when I was young. I can't remember the names of the books, but they had words I'd never heard before, which confused me. This could happen to many little kids. Libraries should only have good books.  After that experience, I tried to ignore it. But offensive materials should be removed permanently. As a bookworm, I just want to go to the library and find non - offensive, good books.  When kids read books or listen to music, they want to immerse themselves, but offensive content makes this difficult. Offensive materials have no place in libraries.  In conclusion, I still firmly believe that offensive books, music, and magazines should be removed. Imagine if your sister, daughter, or niece found an offensive book in the library. How would you feel?
941	3918	2	2	In fifth grade, chaos erupted in my community over the issue of censorship. Teachers, students, parents, school - board members, and community leaders all had their say. It all started when the parents of a high - schooler were outraged that their daughter had read *The @ORGANIZATION1* in class. They found the rape scene in the book too disturbing for their daughter, which seemed a reasonable concern at first. But then, they took it a step further and tried to ban the book in all the schools in our township, aiming to shield other children from what they considered traumatic material.  This led to the crucial questions: Can and should content be censored? And when? As the debate raged on, I began to think deeply about it. I firmly believe that no one has the right to tell me what I can read, listen to, or watch. The only exception is parents and their children. Parents have the responsibility to monitor their kids and use their best judgment to decide what their children are mature enough to experience.  In the case of the *@ORGANIZATION1* censorship, no one had a problem with the family not wanting their own child to read the novel. The issue arose when they tried to restrict others. This is why libraries shouldn't remove materials just because some people find them offensive. What one person loves, like a piece of music or a book, might be offensive to another. These feelings are subjective; there's almost nothing that's universally offensive or appropriate.  We learn from what we see, hear, and read. These experiences teach us what to do and what not to do. Removing materials from libraries based solely on opinions is unfair. It steals the learning opportunities from community members. Parents do have the right to censor what their children are exposed to, but they must do it carefully so as not to hinder the child's learning ability. If we take away the chance for children to learn from the mistakes in books, movies, and other media, we're setting them up for preventable errors in the future. In conclusion, removing library materials based on opinions is not only harmful to society but also dangerous to the very people we aim to protect.
942	3919	2	2	Libraries are a vital source of information, offering valuable research, entertainment, and facts. In my opinion, libraries should not censor the books available for citizens to borrow.  In life, we're constantly faced with choices. Some are simple, like what clothes to wear, while others have a greater impact. At the library, we also have choices. If we see a book with a title that might seem offensive, we can simply walk past it. Most libraries are well - organized, and we can use common sense to identify sections that might contain offensive material. It's our choice whether to borrow a potentially offensive book, and if it does offend us, it's our own fault.  Another reason libraries shouldn't censor books is that no one forces us to borrow a particular book. It's entirely up to us and how we feel about the material. Different people are offended by different things. For example, I'm not bothered by an occasional curse word, but I'm offended by sex - related content in movies or books. I choose not to engage with such materials, but others might not be offended by them.  If libraries start censoring materials, many people will be upset. Who would decide what's offensive? It would be impossible to please everyone, and library usage would likely decline. There are so many factors to consider, like different religions and moral values. It's impossible to censor all materials without upsetting customers.  I'm not suggesting that libraries should stock every magazine out there. Some are clearly inappropriate. But when it comes to books and movies, people know what they're borrowing and what they find offensive. There are too many diverse opinions in the world to try and censor library materials. In conclusion, libraries should not censor the materials they display.
943	3920	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, and magazines, should never be removed just because a person or group finds them offensive. The authors of these works have the right to freedom of expression, as stated in the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1. This is a fundamental right that should be respected.  The @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1 is an important document that set the standards and laws of a nation. Great leaders, like the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, recognized the value of freedom of the press for a growing country. This freedom allows all materials, no matter how offensive some might find them, to be published and enjoyed.  What one person or group finds offensive may not be offensive to others. People have different religions, ethnicities, and moral values. For example, different groups may have different views on literature and art, like @ORGANIZATION3 and @ORGANIZATION2 disliking each other's work, but neither has the right to suppress it.  Often, literature is removed before its true meaning can be understood. This is a great loss because we could have learned a lot from these works. Some books can teach older generations how to leave a legacy, and others can inspire future generations to change the world. But these books are sometimes removed due to difficult lessons or strong language.  Censorship in libraries is not okay. All works of literature should be accessible to people of all ages, races, and religions. By allowing materials to be removed from library shelves, we're depriving ourselves and future generations of learning opportunities. In the end, we must ensure that everyone has the chance to learn and grow through the diverse materials available in libraries.
944	3921	2	2	There's a wide variety of literature and media in the world, and it's meant to appeal to someone. Otherwise, why would it be created? However, there comes a point when some media and literature cross the line and shouldn't be available.  Media has a huge influence on society. We're constantly exposed to it, from watching the morning news on TV to reading magazines. Teens, in particular, are often addicted to it, with video games, online chats, and movies being popular. But a lot of what we learn from these sources is bad for our minds and health. For example, some video games involve non - stop killing and violence, and when we laugh at it, we start to think it's okay. Our minds get exposed to so much immorality that we start to imitate what we see in movies, thinking that if movie stars do it, we can too. This kind of media is harming our minds, and it's even driving some young people to commit suicide.  Music can also go too far. The oldies, country, and jazz are fine, but rap and heavy metal are a different story. Rap often focuses on sex, which is not what our lives should be centered around. I can't understand why people would like the thought of that. Heavy metal music is hard to understand, but when you look into the lyrics, you find that it portrays life as useless. People say it helps them calm down, but after listening to such negative messages, what will happen when they get really angry?  Too many lives are being affected by this kind of media and literature. Friends have been lost, and friendships have been ruined. We need to set a limit on what's acceptable. We're not like in a video game where we have second lives. In conclusion, we must take action to protect ourselves from the harmful effects of excessive and inappropriate media and literature.
945	3922	2	2	Books, music, movies, and magazines can all be offensive in different ways, whether it's through inappropriate language, actions, or stories. But should these materials be removed from the shelves just because some people think they're too offensive and don't want their children to access them?  When I go to the library, I see different sections like fiction and non - fiction, but there's no 'offensive' section. If parents don't want their children to read offensive books, they should accompany them and make sure they don't pick up such books, or keep them in the children's area.  Libraries usually don't have offensive music, but they do have @CAPS1 for books. Before borrowing or buying a @CAPS1, you should ask a library staff member if they consider it offensive. If they're not sure, it's better not to get it. Usually, we know what we're looking for before going to the library.  Offensive movies are marked rated @CAPS4, while @NUM1 movies are generally better. Parents who don't want their children to watch rated @CAPS4 movies should check the back of the movie case, which always provides information. My mom used to do this when I was young because she thought most rated @CAPS4 movies were too offensive for me.  Magazines usually don't have offensive language, but they may have inappropriate pictures and gossip stories. If you're letting your children read magazines, you should read them first to make sure there's nothing inappropriate.  I don't think there's any reason to remove books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelves just because some people find them offensive. Parents should take responsibility for what their children are exposed to. They can read materials before their children do, accompany them in the library, or have them choose from the children's section. Everyone shouldn't be punished for the concerns of a few. In conclusion, libraries should keep their materials available, and it's up to parents to guide their children's choices.
946	3923	2	2	I firmly believe that any form of media, be it books, movies, magazines, or music, that is offensive in any way should not be made available to the public. Our country unfortunately has a lot of racist people and documents, and if we prevent the display of offensive materials, it would surely be beneficial.   When you pick up a magazine or watch a TV show about a famous actress or musician, you often see embarrassing aspects of their lives being broadcast worldwide. This is completely wrong! People deserve respect and the right to privacy. Without actresses and musicians, we'd have no TV shows to watch, no radio to listen to, and no one to sing songs for us. They work so hard to create new content for us, so why would we want to embarrass them?  Libraries should not have books with sexual assaults or foul language, especially in school libraries. There's no reason for children to read such content. Library books should set good examples, not contain vulgar sayings. It's a disgrace to the school when they do.  Movies are a major concern. Children and young adults can easily access restricted movies. Would you want your child bringing home a movie with nudity? I once had a terrible experience when my little sister brought home a movie from our local library. It was full of nudity, foul language, and violence. I was shocked that the library would have such a movie. My mother complained, saying that restricted movies should be separated, and one should either be of a certain age or have parental permission to rent them.  Every local and school library should take action for the community. We need to keep children and young adults away from violence. Allowing offensive content in libraries implies that such violence is acceptable. We should put a stop to it and promote good attitudes. So, please remove the violent materials from the shelves.
947	3924	2	2	The question of whether offensive materials like books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shelves is a complex one. There are indeed offensive elements in these media, which younger adults shouldn't be exposed to. However, I don't think all offensive things should be taken off the shelves because people can learn from them.  Some people struggle to understand right from wrong because they haven't experienced the full spectrum of life. The problem is that some may not recognize offensive content because they don't understand its meaning.  Movies, on the other hand, can have a significant impact, especially on young children. They may copy what they see on TV, and these on - screen figures may not always be good role models.  Music also plays a crucial part in a person's life. There's sad, loving, and violent music. Music can define a person's mood. For example, listening to a sad song can make you feel sad, and violent music can make you angry. The music people listen to often reflects their personality and mood.  Magazines are a form of advertisement. They tell stories and show various things. Similar to movies, they can influence people, but since they mostly use pictures, their impact may not be as strong as that of movies or music.  Books are similar in that you can learn from what's written in them. If a person reads about violence, they might think it's acceptable, even if the book is trying to convey the right message. So, I believe keeping offensive books can help readers learn what's offensive. In conclusion, while offensive media has its drawbacks, it also has educational value, and we should not be too hasty in removing it from the shelves.
948	3925	2	2	The main idea of @LOCATION1 in art, language, and music is freedom, which is enshrined in the 'freedom of speech' amendment of the '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2'. Based on this, I firmly believe that we should not ban, censor, or remove books, music, or movies from the @CAPS3 public. It's their right to buy what they want. When we censor, we take away @CAPS2 from people, making them feel like they have no autonomy, like toddlers who can't choose what to see.  Everything in the world can be offensive to someone. Just because one person finds something distasteful doesn't mean everyone else should be deprived of it. This is what makes the world diverse. What one person finds weird, another may find normal. Why should we take away what makes someone feel normal just to please another?  I once went to a store to buy a video - game. I found one I liked, but the cashier said I needed an adult to purchase it because of the game's rating. I argued that my dad wouldn't mind, but it didn't matter. I had to search for my dad in the store so he could buy the game for me. In the end, I got the game, but it made me feel like my wishes were being ignored.  This experience made me understand how writers, artists, and movie directors feel when their work is censored or banned. We need to let people express themselves. If we didn't, the world would be very different. @PERSON1's idea that the world was round was once considered crazy, but he proved it right. Galilaue @CAPS5's theory that the sun didn't revolve around the @LOCATION2 was also initially rejected, but it was later proven correct.  Freedom of speech is essential as it encourages different ways of thinking and the development of new ideas. We must allow people to express their feelings and ideas freely.
949	3926	2	2	There are many things in libraries that some people may find inappropriate. If I come across something offensive, I would ask for it to be removed from the shelf. Libraries are great places for projects. You can go there to meet friends and work. If you need help finding a book, just ask the person at the desk. They're also a great resource for those without a computer at home.  Libraries would attract more readers if they had their books on discs, DVDs, or used tape - players. If all libraries had the same books, more people would come in and out to get the ones they want. There should be a separate section for kids' books. And libraries should get rid of inappropriate books to avoid complaints.  There are probably about @NUM1 to @NUM2 libraries in @LOCATION1, and I'm sure there's something inappropriate on the shelves of all of them. With so many books, it's very likely that someone will find something they don't like and ask for it to be removed. If enough people are offended by a book, it should be taken off the shelf.  Magazines also pose a problem. Some magazines, especially those that talk about drugs and other offensive topics, shouldn't be accessible to little kids. All magazines should have a rating, and you should be at least @NUM3 years old to get a PG - @NUM3 magazine. Magazines should be divided into sections for kids and adults.  In our hometown, I think there are some inappropriate materials, though I'm not @PERCENT1 sure. We have the right to ask for offensive materials to be removed, and if the libraries don't comply, they should be held accountable. In conclusion, libraries and magazines need to be more careful about the content they provide to ensure it's suitable for all ages.
950	3927	2	2	Dear newspaper editor, I'm writing to discuss the issue of censorship in @LOCATION1 libraries. While some may not see it as a big problem, it's a major concern for others. Censorship has led to the removal of books, music, magazines, movies, and other items from local stores and libraries because they're considered offensive by sellers or workers.  It's not about what store or library owners like. It's about the general public's interests. Some have even removed the @CAPS2 from local library systems. Does it really matter what the owner wants to sell? In most cases, no. Just because a book, magazine, or movie has a small comment about sex, drugs, or alcohol, it gets removed. If we remove everything related to these topics, all that will be left are children's books, and some people may even try to censor those. Without books, magazines, and other forms of media, we may become illiterate.  There was an instance where a person was fired from their job for reading a magazine on their break. If we keep listening to people who want to remove books one by one, we'll end up with no books in our libraries or stores.  This censorship is a serious problem, but few people really care. Some think most items should be censored, while others believe we shouldn't censor at all as we're a free country.  So, newspaper editor, I urge you to ask yourself, 'Would I like to have all my favorite magazines, books, and movies gone forever?' The answer is obvious, and we should take action to stop this excessive censorship.
951	3928	2	2	Some books on library shelves may contain inappropriate content, such as offensive language or subject matter unsuitable for certain age - groups. This raises the question of whether library materials, including books, magazines, music, and movies, should be censored or left to the readers' discretion. I firmly believe that no books or magazines should be censored. If someone wishes to read a book with curse words, they should be allowed to do so. While some parents may restrict their children from accessing such materials, others may not care. Children who read such content may initially imitate the language, but they will learn that it is inappropriate. Regarding movies from libraries, censorship is also unnecessary. Parents will prevent their children from borrowing or watching movies they deem inappropriate. Kids are generally aware of what they can and cannot watch. Even if a child borrows an inappropriate movie, parents can take it away and explain why it is not suitable. In a school library, all materials must be school - approved. If a book, movie, magazine, or music is not appropriate, the school cannot lend it out. Public libraries, on the other hand, have a more diverse clientele, mostly adults. Children should know their limits in terms of what they can read, watch, or listen to. Censoring materials would limit the choices available to everyone, including parents and adults. In conclusion, library materials should generally remain uncensored, with parents taking responsibility for guiding their children's choices.
952	3929	2	2	What are your thoughts on the appropriateness of books in libraries? I'm going to share my opinion on which books should and shouldn't be in libraries. I think people have a wide range of views on books. One can't simply say a book shouldn't be in a library. For example, a book inappropriate for grade - school students might be suitable for high - school students or in a public library. I understand that some parents don't want their kids reading certain books. However, kids are likely to encounter worse content in real life. I also understand parents' concerns about their children reading inappropriate books. But if a child wants to read such a book, they will find a way. Parents shouldn't be overly strict about what their kids read. They want to protect their children, but sheltering them isn't a long - term solution as they will eventually face the real world. Grade schools should not have inappropriate books in their libraries. If they do, parents should be required to give consent. In conclusion, if parents have concerns about library books, they should discuss the issue with the school. They can talk to the librarian and let them know they don't want their child to borrow certain books. This simple step can resolve the problem.
953	3930	2	2	The question of whether to censor library materials is a complex one, and there are diverse views on this topic. However, I am convinced that there are more valid reasons against censorship in libraries. First, how offensive can library materials really be? I believe they are not very offensive. There are movies and materials designed for mature and older audiences. This is appropriate, as mature individuals should have access to advanced materials. They can't stay in a sheltered environment forever; they need to be introduced to real - life situations. If they are sheltered throughout their lives, it won't be beneficial for them or society. If a child selects older - level material, it's not a major issue. Parents can simply explain that the child is not old enough. We don't all need to read the same books. Variety is what makes libraries attractive to customers. A library with all the same books would be unappealing. There are children's sections in libraries, and removing slightly offensive materials would reduce the customer base and discourage writers, affecting their income and motivation. In @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of choice. Implementing censorship in libraries would go against our values. Everyone makes mistakes, but we can learn from them. When choosing library materials, people usually make the right decisions. Libraries are centers of learning and information, and removing certain materials would undermine their purpose. I have had positive experiences in libraries and have never been harmed or offended. In conclusion, there is no need to change the current state of libraries by introducing censorship.
954	3931	2	2	In my opinion, libraries are excellent sources of information, offering a wide range of books in various genres such as biographies, fiction, non - fiction, and science fiction. I don't think books, music, movies, and magazines should generally be removed from library shelves. People love music and use library resources to learn about artists and song lyrics. Books are crucial for people. They provide entertainment beyond television and are used for study. However, offensive books that talk badly about people should be removed, unless the readers are immature and can't handle such content. Movies are also very popular and entertaining. While offensive movies should be removed, many movies with foul language are still enjoyed by people. People need to learn not to use foul language inappropriately. Magazines, especially sports - related ones, are loved by many. As a sports fan, I enjoy reading sports magazines. However, inappropriate magazines for children should be removed. Magazines are used for different purposes, like comics, housework tips, and beauty advice. In conclusion, most library materials should remain available, with offensive or inappropriate content for specific audiences being removed. This way, libraries can continue to meet the diverse needs of their patrons.
955	3932	2	2	Censorship in libraries is a rather primitive and childish approach to exclude what some may consider offensive from others. Consider a child who refuses to play with another at recess because of a minor incident in math class. There are more reasonable solutions to such a situation, and the same applies to library censorship. A book is meant to be read to gain information and knowledge. For example, you can learn to cook a meal or graph linear equations from books. Just because a person has no interest in a particular topic, like cooking a turkey, doesn't mean the relevant book should be removed. And if a book has been written, it's a sign that it's not offensive to at least the author. People have different opinions. Just as not everyone likes rap music, but it still plays on the radio, reading a book is a free choice. Just because someone is exposed to offensive material, either by accident or otherwise, and voices their dissatisfaction, it doesn't mean the material should be discarded. Let's compare radios and libraries. Radios have specific channels for different types of music. Libraries could benefit from more detailed categorization. For instance, different areas in a library could be designated for specific genres. This way, if someone finds a particular topic offensive, they can avoid that section. Outright removal of offensive materials is not the best solution. Compromise is key. After careful thought, we can come up with more reasonable solutions than censorship. In conclusion, by implementing better categorization and allowing free choice, people can enjoy libraries without being offended by unwanted materials.
956	3933	2	2	Having libraries is beneficial as they teach children to read and allow them to gain insights from the books or magazines they peruse. Libraries can also assist children and family members with limited literacy skills. Some libraries have shelves, while others do not, which seems rather odd. Libraries house books and magazines suitable for children, adults, and even grandparents. There is often confusion about where to place books on shelves or carts, and it requires respect and physical effort to organize library items properly. Librarians offer more than just books; they also provide CDs, computers, and tables with coloring pages for children. However, I believe certain items should be removed from libraries. I wouldn't want my children to encounter things they don't understand. Libraries should primarily contain materials appropriate for a quiet reading environment, such as books for reading and computers for homework. It's ridiculous and inappropriate for libraries to have items that can teach children bad behavior. Librarians should convince those who bring in such items to take them back. Instead, only appropriate materials should be kept, and inappropriate ones should be sent elsewhere where they won't be accessible to young children. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a suitable collection to ensure a positive learning experience for all visitors.
957	3934	2	2	"The question of whether books, movies, music, and magazines should be censored or ""banned"" is a topic of debate. This essay will discuss three main aspects related to this issue: children, race, and religion. First, many parents are concerned about their children being exposed to violence, vulgar language, and drug - related content in these forms of entertainment. Violence is a major problem, as it can influence children negatively. Vulgar language is seen as disrespectful by older generations. The prevalence of drug - related news and the risk of overdose among teens are also reasons for concern. Second, race is another factor. Racism, which involves discrimination based on skin color or ethnicity, has a long - standing history. Although it has lessened over time, certain words and labels have been used to demean specific groups, leading to riots and gang violence. People of all races want to be treated equally. Third, religion is significant worldwide and is often represented in these forms of media. Different religious beliefs can lead to conflicts, as everyone believes their way is the right one and tries to convert others. So, the question remains: should these books, movies, music, and magazines be restricted? Exposure is inevitable. We have the option of allowing it now or later. Banning these materials may not be the best solution, as people will still learn about them, and someone can gain experience from the exposure. In conclusion, rather than banning, we should encourage a more informed and open - minded approach to these forms of media."
958	3935	2	2	"Every library is entitled to have a wide variety of books, movies, and magazines, regardless of whether they are considered ""good"" or ""bad."" People have different preferences, and just because some individuals are offended by certain library materials, it doesn't mean they should be removed from the shelves. Libraries play a crucial role in helping people learn about the world, as not all information on television is accurate. If libraries start removing certain items, they may lose their essence as a place with diverse sources. Not everyone will agree on what should or should not be in a library, but all types of materials should remain. Just because something is offensive to some doesn't mean it is for everyone, and it would be unfair to those who enjoy reading, viewing, or listening to these materials. Librarians know what they are doing when they select and display items on the shelves. If they didn't want to offend people, they wouldn't have included such materials. Libraries leave these items for others to read and learn. In conclusion, all books, magazines, and movies should be left on the shelves to facilitate people's learning and exploration."
959	3936	2	2	"I firmly believe that censorship of certain books in libraries should not be removed, but rather regulated based on the age of the readers. Bigger kids, especially those in grades @NUM1, should be able to access these books as they have likely heard the words before. However, these books should not be available in lower - grade libraries. For example, books like @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3, which contains the ""n - word"" frequently, and @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, with a lot of vulgar words such as the ""f"" and ""s"" words, are inappropriate for young children. Taking these books out of libraries would be unfair to the bigger kids. If any books are to be removed, it should be from grades @NUM2, as these books can have a negative impact on younger readers. Another reason is that we don't want little kids going home and repeating the inappropriate words they read. In conclusion, it is essential to maintain a proper balance in library collections to ensure that older kids can benefit from age - appropriate reading materials while protecting younger children from inappropriate content."
960	3937	2	2	"Imagine being a @NUM1 - year - old child sitting in front of one of history's greatest philosophers, @LOCATION1. Later, you learn that this philosopher was killed for ""corrupting the minds of children."" This is a prime example of censorship, and it happens daily to countless books, movies, and songs. Censorship is not only wrong but also unnecessary. Most books, movies, and songs are open to multiple interpretations. For instance, many poems are written vaguely so that different people can interpret them in their own way. Moreover, most forms of entertainment are meant to amuse, not to offend. Consider a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1; it may not be as offensive as some claim. In school, books are assigned for their educational value. Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' offer valuable insights into @CAPS6 culture, yet some try to remove them from school libraries in @LOCATION2 because they find them offensive. This is unjust, as the educational value of such books outweighs any potential offensiveness. Finally, no matter how many books are removed from shelves, movies are banned, or songs are taken away, the problem is not solved; it is merely suppressed, leading to new issues. People who want to read these materials may be restricted, and even if a ban is in place, the content can still be shared. Before complaining about an offensive book, one should consider the impact on teaching and learning. Banning these materials is wrong as it limits educational opportunities. In conclusion, we should approach the issue of offensive materials with an open mind and focus on their overall value."
961	3938	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should allocate a dedicated room for inappropriate materials, including adult books, magazines, and other articles. To restrict access for children and teenagers, a lock can be installed on the door. Only individuals who can provide proof of being of a certain age (@NUM1) should be permitted entry. This approach is similar to movie stores, where films with age restrictions are kept in a locked back - room, accessible only to those of the appropriate age.  The reason for this is that books, like movies, can stimulate a child's imagination. Reading a book can create vivid mental images, much like watching a movie. If a child reads a book with inappropriate content, they may pick up bad words and use them around younger siblings, which can lead to more significant problems.  In today's world, children are growing up quickly, and it's crucial for parents to safeguard their children from exposure to inappropriate materials such as magazines, movies, pictures, and books. Parents often assume they are smarter than their kids, but children are quite intelligent. It's disrespectful for kids to cuss and say inappropriate things to others. When they do so, other parents may think that the child's parents don't care.  Although it may seem that this issue will never be completely resolved, it would be better if parents took responsibility and didn't allow their children to cuss in public. At home, if parents are okay with it, that's their choice. However, in public settings, a child's inappropriate language can often be traced back to the books, magazines, or movies they've consumed. In conclusion, I remain opposed to kids under the age of being a mature teen using cuss words.
962	3939	2	2	There is a wide range of inappropriate entertainment in the world, but does this mean we should eliminate it all? In my view, censoring materials such as books, movies, and music in libraries is not a wise decision. Censorship would lead to a lack of diversity in the world and entertainment options, as people have different opinions on what is offensive or inappropriate.  Censoring library materials would severely limit our learning opportunities. For instance, if someone deems a book about how an animal catches its prey offensive, a person interested in this topic would be unable to access relevant information. Many people rely on libraries for research. If a single person finds a book on a particular work - related topic offensive, it could prevent others from completing their assignments. In the medical field, professionals often need to watch movies demonstrating certain procedures. If one person considers a relevant movie offensive, it could potentially hinder medical staff from saving lives.  Censorship would also result in a lack of diversity in entertainment. It would reduce our reading choices significantly. If one person dislikes a particular book, it could be removed from the library. Even if not all books are removed, the limited selection would lead to everyone reading the same books, thus minimizing diversity.  There are only a few merits to censorship. It can prevent children from being exposed to inappropriate or offensive content. However, our society is filled with crime, hatred, sexual content, and profanity, and these are facts we must accept. Censorship can only hide these issues temporarily; it cannot change society in the long run.  In conclusion, I do not support censoring materials in libraries. It would only bring negative consequences to our communities. Although the idea of censorship has some appeal, its negative impacts far outweigh the potential benefits. Censorship would lead to a lack of diversity, limit education, and prevent us from facing the realities of our society.
963	3940	2	2	In any case, a particular piece of material will eventually be found and utilized. There are people in the world who will appreciate this material and want to share it with others. Just because you find a certain material offensive and attempt to remove it, it doesn't mean you have the right to do so. I consider this act unfair. What you find offensive may not be offensive to others.  The idea of removing materials from the shelf based on one's own selfish opinion is absurd. Doing so would undermine the rights of the material's author. Authors should have the freedom to sell or convey their works to viewers, readers, and listeners. However, if a person or a small group deems the material offensive, this freedom is restricted.  The world is vast, and you can't assume that by hiding certain materials in your area, no one will ever find them. People will always find a way to access the material. Trying to control what people view, listen to, or read is like trying to control people themselves. But we must realize that we can't hide everything in the world. Everyone has different mindsets, and what you find offensive may not be offensive to others.  In conclusion, it is not right for an individual or a group to remove materials from the shelves just because they find them offensive. We should not attempt to control what people, including children, view, listen to, or read. No matter how hard we try to create a perfect world, reality shows that it's impossible to keep everything hidden.
964	3941	2	2	Many people believe that kids should not be exposed to certain offensive materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. However, I don't think these materials should be removed from library shelves.  It should be the parents' decision to determine what their children can view or listen to. Nowadays, when parents or other authorities restrict children from doing, watching, or listening to something, it often makes children more curious and eager to access it. They will find ways to do, watch, or listen to what they're prohibited from, even if it means going behind their parents' backs and not caring about getting in trouble.  In this new generation, authorities can only limit children's exposure to offensive content to a certain extent. Children are interested in a wide range of things and can find them through various means, such as computers, television, and the radio. Young parents are partly responsible for children's knowledge of offensive movies, books, music, and magazines. They may say and do things that are inappropriate for young people, which makes children think it's acceptable.  Therefore, it should be up to parents to decide what their children can see. Whether or not materials are removed from libraries, children will still find a way to access them. In conclusion, parents should take on the responsibility of guiding their children's media consumption.
965	3942	2	2	"To begin with, I believe Katherine Paterson is right. There are many people in the world who are very protective of their personal belongings and the things in their lives. They don't want others to touch or even be around these items.  One of the most precious things to me and my [@CAPS4] is the [@CAPS5] that my [@CAPS6] gave us before he passed away. We've wanted to listen to it for a long time, but we haven't had the courage to do so. We get upset when someone tries to grab it without permission. We make it clear that we don't want anyone to touch it because it holds immense sentimental value for us.  Many people may think we're crazy for being so protective of our things, but there are others who are even more extreme. For example, my best - friend's [@CAPS11] once said, ""Don't be near my clock on the wall. I don't want you to knock it off, so stay away!"" She still feels the same way today.  People get frustrated when others touch things that have been hanging on the wall or kept in cases for years because these items mean a great deal to them. It's not because they're mean or have a reason to complain; it's simply because of the deep emotional attachment. We should try to understand what they're trying to convey. These items could be of utmost importance, and we might even start to protect them to help out.  Katherine Paterson's view is correct. She probably also has things in her life that are extremely important to her. There are many people who have significant items in their lives, and we could be among them. We should try to understand and respect how others feel about their precious belongings. By doing so, we can be better friends and help each other safeguard what matters most."
966	3943	2	2	In my opinion, libraries should maintain a comprehensive collection. There are individuals who enjoy spending time in libraries, reading newspapers and listening to music. If someone finds certain materials offensive, they can simply choose not to read them or select an alternative. Everyone has their own vision of what a library should be, and they should be allowed to voice their thoughts.  I believe that the diverse resources in libraries today are beneficial for children. They can learn more efficiently and have greater anticipation for the future as they grow older. From my own experiences, I've noticed that libraries are more frequented, and there are numerous activities beyond just reading books. One can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when alone or with friends. Since reading books can get monotonous, trying something different for a while and then returning to the original book can be a good idea.  However, some people may oppose certain items in libraries. I've witnessed protests outside libraries and even closures due to such issues. In extreme cases, some individuals have gone too far and set libraries on fire. It's heart - wrenching to see people cry over these incidents, and I feel helpless as I want to help but am unable to.  The most important users of libraries are children and young readers. Closing down a library is like burning down someone's home for these kids. They have the most powerful voice. If we can take actions to make them feel better, it would be extremely beneficial. They don't deserve to be caught up in such chaos. It's difficult for them to find a proper place to read when libraries are unavailable.  Everyone has the right to express their opinions freely. We have our own voices, the voices of those who agree or disagree with us, and the voices of our children. When faced with a choice, we must make the right one.
967	3944	2	2	"Should children be shielded from the inappropriate aspects of the world? Should libraries take precautions to prevent them from hearing, seeing, or reading about the bad things? In our world, where daily occurrences include suicide, murder, government scams, and terrorist attacks, it's challenging to keep those who shouldn't know, uninformed. In our nation, it's easy to access information; one can simply watch TV or visit the local library. While we censor television content, we often neglect library materials. Libraries now house thousands of books, magazines, and an equal or greater number of movies, DVDs, and video - games.  I advocate for library censorship in terms of collection and organization. Similar to the current practice, libraries should have different sections based on age groups and appropriateness. To prevent people from checking out items from sections meant for older age groups, an age - group security check should be implemented in the library's card - filing system. Although this may seem complex, it's the best we can do to avoid exposing anyone to content they're too young for.  Regarding offensive material, I believe it shouldn't be removed from the library but rather relocated. Some people may need to read offensive materials for educational purposes or because the book, despite being offensive, teaches valuable life lessons. For example, the book ""N*****"" by a man with the last name of Wallace may sound offensive, but it actually educates people about the origin of the word and why it's offensive. It may be offensive to some, but it imparts an important lesson.  There are parents who may not be as concerned about what their children read, watch, listen to, or play. However, for children to access such materials, parents must obtain them, ensuring that parents are aware of what their children are getting from the library. In conclusion, a balanced approach to library censorship, considering both the needs of different age groups and the value of certain offensive materials, is essential."
968	3945	2	2	We all encounter offensive content in various forms, such as books, magazines, movies, CDs, TV shows, or newspaper articles. Libraries contain all these items, and some people may or may not want to remove what they consider offensive. But would that be the right approach? If everyone removed offensive items from library shelves, there would be little left.  Perhaps writers should reduce the inclusion of inappropriate, racist, or foul - language content. This would reduce the number of offended people and allow parents to let their children choose books independently. However, it may not always be the writers' fault. Some readers may take things too seriously. If they were less sensitive, they wouldn't have to worry about their children's reading materials.  Most adult - oriented content is inappropriate for children, which is why it's labeled for adults. Children have their own selection of books and movies. Parents should take their kids to the children's section. All forms of entertainment are age - categorized, and people should pay more attention to this. If parents monitored their children's activities, they wouldn't have to worry about their children reading or watching inappropriate content. That's the responsibility of parents, and some fail to fulfill it adequately.  If parents read a book they don't want their children to read, it's likely something they read at a later age. So, they shouldn't worry until their children reach that age. By then, children may be old enough to distinguish right from wrong and could potentially benefit from reading the book. Parents can't always control their children's actions. If children pick up a book their parents don't approve of, they may view it differently and learn a valuable lesson. In conclusion, a combination of responsible writing, parental supervision, and age - appropriate content selection can address the issue of offensive materials in libraries.
969	3946	2	2	When visiting a library, one expects to find a wide range of materials, including books, movies, music, magazines, and other items. If a person wants to check out a book that may be offensive to a race, culture, or religion, they should have the right to do so. Libraries should not control such situations as it is an individual's or an adult's choice to read such stories.  In our country, the Constitution guarantees the right to express opinions, including free speech. This ensures that anyone can share their personal feelings or views on certain matters. Technically, by law, a person has the right to check out a book that may offend others. I'm not advocating for reading hateful or cruel materials, but legally, people have the freedom to do so.  Libraries are government - funded institutions. They don't have the right to disregard certain works because the government pays for the books in the library. Their job is to provide books that people are interested in, even if some groups may not agree.  I'm not encouraging the reading of offensive novels or listening to offensive music. However, as citizens of the United States, we have the freedom to listen to and read what we want. This is what our country stands for - freedom. When I think of America, I think of freedom, and I'm proud that our country upholds this value, even in small aspects of life. In conclusion, while offensive materials may not be ideal, the principle of freedom of choice and access in libraries should be respected.
970	3947	2	2	I've been asked to write an essay for a newspaper about my views on library censorship. Well, I'll share my thoughts, even if some may not like them. I firmly believe that if the government were to decide what we can say, read, or do, we'd be severely restricted, unable to learn beyond basic daily tasks.  We have the right to read any book we desire. If we don't want to read a particular book, we simply don't have to. The people are the ones who run the state, not the government. The government doesn't have the right to remove books from libraries. We, the people, have the freedom to express ourselves, regardless of what the government thinks.  Books are essential as they teach us about our lives and history. They help us distinguish right from wrong. They can be used to tell scary stories around a campfire or give kids bedtime stories. If we remove these books from library shelves, the next generation will be in a worse state than the current one.  It's our right and responsibility to save our books. Without them, our past will be lost, our folk tales forgotten, and our children won't have bedtime stories.  Let's all come together. If you find a book offensive, put it down and walk away. Don't complain about it. No one forces you to read it. Don't ruin the experience for everyone else. Whether you believe in God or not, if you think a book is inappropriate, just leave it alone.  Some people blame video games for corrupting kids' minds, but it's often the parents' lack of supervision. Teens like to do the opposite of what their parents tell them. So, parents should back off and let kids read, play, and do what they want within reasonable limits. In conclusion, we should safeguard the freedom of access to books in libraries and trust that with proper guidance, children can make good use of them.
971	3948	2	2	People have diverse preferences for books, music, movies, and magazines. While some individuals may find certain materials offensive, others do not. In my view, there is no need to remove such materials from the shelves because different people have different tastes. If someone takes offense to a book or magazine, they should simply put it back. If we were to remove all books that might offend someone, there would be hardly any books left on the shelves, considering that there are so many people in the world and it's likely that each book would offend at least one person.  Music also comes in various genres, such as rap, country, rock, and pop. For example, if someone likes rap but dislikes country, they can choose to listen to rap. However, just because one person doesn't like country music doesn't mean it should be removed, as there are others who enjoy it.  Movies are also of different types, including horror, comedy, and romance. That's why theaters have different screening rooms for different movies, giving people a choice.  In conclusion, the fact that people have different preferences is, in my opinion, the beauty of human nature.
972	3949	2	2	The perspectives on library censorship vary significantly from person to person. There are those who are offended by the accessible materials in libraries, while others advocate for the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they desire. In my view, both sides of the censorship debate have their merits and drawbacks, yet some form of censorship is necessary in libraries; a boundary must be established.  The lyrics in music can be highly offensive to some individuals. Similarly, inappropriate movie scenes, whether involving opposite - sex interactions or intense action sequences, are not suitable for young people.  The ease of access in libraries is part of the problem. People of any age can obtain almost any material they want. I recall an incident from my own experience when I was younger. The advertising on the covers of books, movies, and magazines gave me a false impression of the content. I brought home materials from the library that my parents disapproved of.  On the other hand, if we were to remove all offensive materials, libraries would be nearly empty. I believe that once people recognize the offensiveness of such materials, authors, directors, and artists would modify their work. So, while many materials would be removed from library shelves, they would be replaced with more appropriate content.  Some may argue that individuals have the right to consume whatever they want. However, shouldn't parents have the right to send their children to libraries without worrying about inappropriate exposure?  Although this debate can go either way, if no limits are set on available materials, the situation may worsen. The offensive and disturbing content could have a greater impact on people, especially children. By showing that we don't accept such content, authors, directors, producers, and artists will change their work, and this is why some form of library censorship is essential.
973	3950	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from libraries because they can hurt people's feelings and may lead to negative consequences like causing distress, anxiety, or even more serious issues such as suicide. I wouldn't like to read racial comments about myself in a book, and I'm sure others feel the same way. Removing these materials could improve the lives of some people.  Last week at the library, I witnessed a young African - American girl run to her mother in tears. The book she had read contained offensive remarks about her race, and she was terrified that the slavery - era atrocities might happen again. Reading about being mocked, named - called, and beaten would surely ruin anyone's day. I hope libraries will learn to stop stocking such inappropriate materials.  Based on my personal experience, I've presented convincing arguments for my stance. I think libraries should take my advice and realize that such materials are harmful to kids, teenagers, and adults alike. All they do is bring people down, make them cry, and cause unnecessary distress. Removing these materials is a smart choice that would benefit everyone.
974	3951	2	2	Picture a library with empty shelves, where there are no books to immerse oneself in, no controversial classics to expand one's mind, and where renowned works like @ORGANIZATION1, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and @PERSON1 are absent from the shelves, waiting for students to explore. Many of the greatest books are celebrated for their controversial and thought - provoking ideas. In my view, libraries should not practice censorship because everyone has the right to read what they like, to broaden their minds, and to enjoy reading in an era dominated by modern technology.  In the @LOCATION1, a significant number of children struggle to read at their appropriate grade level, and this number is increasing due to poor educational opportunities, lack of interest in learning, and limited resources. Reading is fundamental for all school subjects. Research shows that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall successful students. By censoring library books, we deprive children of the chance to expand their minds and access books that interest them. Children are @PERCENT1 more likely to read books they are interested in. For example, preventing a child from reading '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' is both impractical and harmful, as it discourages them from reading. Everyone has the right to the best education and the freedom to read what they choose.  Books open up new worlds and adventures for children that they may never experience in real life. They have the power to broaden people's perspectives. However, many interesting and controversial books that challenge people's beliefs are being removed from library shelves. @LOCATION2 was founded on the principles of freedom, including freedom of speech and thought. This freedom should apply to reading as well. No one should dictate what others can or cannot read, and books in public and school libraries should not be censored.  In today's world, where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones are ubiquitous, books are often seen as outdated. Censoring libraries further discourages kids from reading. They don't want to be told what they can read, and taking away their favorite books makes them less likely to read and more likely to engage with technology. Moreover, censorship is ineffective because kids with internet access can find more controversial content online. For instance, the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series, which has been removed from many libraries due to its use of witchcraft, can still be accessed through movies or the internet.  In conclusion, libraries should not practice censorship. Everyone has the right to read freely, expand their minds, and enjoy the benefits of reading. Books can be an escape for children from the harsh realities of the world, and censoring them would deprive future generations of inspiration and the opportunity to learn.
975	3952	2	2	In my opinion, if an item is on the library shelf, anyone, regardless of age, should be able to access it. Of course, there may be some materials that are inappropriate, but if kids aren't allowed to get certain items, then those items shouldn't be on the shelves in the first place.  Parents may have different views. They might think that only certain materials should be available in libraries. However, it's not their sole decision. Libraries should have a wide range of materials. If parents don't want their kids to read or access certain things, they should accompany their children to the library and help them select books.  In conclusion, whether you're a child or an adult, you should be able to check out anything on the library shelf. If an item isn't supposed to be accessed, then it shouldn't be there. This, in my opinion, is the right approach for libraries.
976	3953	2	2	Mom asked, “Are you reading, dear?” Instantly, I hid the book behind my back, aware that she wouldn't approve of me delving into such an in - depth book. Some parents are averse to their children reading certain content. If something isn't acceptable at home, it shouldn't be allowed at school either. There are subjects that perhaps we shouldn't be exposed to, but we are because our parents say no. By removing these subjects, we can prevent children from disobeying their parents and imitating behaviors from books.  There are books, movies, magazines, and music that are considered “cool” yet not entirely appropriate. Some movies and music feature offensive language and actions that kids may pick up and imitate from actors, actresses, and artists. Soon, they start using such language or actions to gain attention and may end up being known as the “bad kid.” Students, like me, who aren't popular or well - noticed often feel the need to do things to stand out. Most of what students model after comes from what they see, hear, or watch, such as the media.  It is prudent to implement censorship in school libraries. Although some students may not welcome library censorship, it is in their best interest to remove offensive materials. By not being exposed to such content, students, including myself, can become better individuals. I believe that censorship will also help students make the right decisions at home and avoid getting involved in inappropriate activities.  I've noticed that students often mimic the actions of movie stars and famous people. If they're fans, they're more likely to imitate them. For example, if I were a fan of @PERSON1 and read that she stole something, I'd either find a new role model or think it was “cool” to do the same. However, if I did what @PERSON2 did, my parents would be furious, and I'd probably end up in jail.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that censorship in libraries is crucial as it safeguards the well - being of students and shields them from unnecessary and inappropriate content. I respect the idea of censorship in my school as I know it's there to assist me. I hope all students recognize the importance of not being exposed to violence, sex, drugs, and drama through movies, music, magazines, or books.
977	3954	2	2	I firmly believe that censorship should not be practiced in libraries because it is unfair to everyone. If censorship were implemented everywhere, there might be no movies or other forms of entertainment available due to numerous complaints from people. I have several reasons to oppose library censorship.  Firstly, there is the issue of freedom of the press. As stated in our @ORGANIZATION1, we have the right to write what we desire. If censorship persists, we will lose one of our fundamental rights. Controlling what we write or read is unjust.  Secondly, freedom of speech is at stake. Our @ORGANIZATION1 also guarantees us the right to express ourselves freely, and no one should be able to restrict this. With continuous censorship, this right will gradually be taken away from us. We are slowly losing our @CAPS1 - given rights because some people are offended by books and similar materials.  I had a personal experience related to this. One day, a friend and I went to the library to find a book for our history report on the @DATE1's and slavery. My friend, who was @CAPS2 @CAPS3, found it difficult not to be offended by the assignment. When we reached the library, the situation worsened. All the books we found described the harsh treatment of slaves in the past.  My friend became increasingly upset. Then, he saw a book mocking the slaves and asked the librarian, “Can you take those books off the shelf and put them somewhere else?” The librarian replied coldly, “No. What makes you think you should get any special treatment?” My friend was shocked and couldn't believe what he heard.  After he returned to where I was sitting, I told him the librarian was right. He asked, “Why?” I explained, “If she removed all the offensive books, she'd have to take down almost every other book because someone would always find something hurtful.” He then agreed, saying, “You're probably right.”  Censorship is unfair as it limits our abilities and restricts what we enjoy. Punishing people based on what they read, write, or say is unjust. We all have our own preferences, and it would be terrible if ours were taken away. In conclusion, library censorship should not be practiced to preserve our rights and freedoms.
978	3955	2	2	Some people frequently visit the library to borrow books, movies, magazines, etc. However, they may not realize that some of the items in the library could be offensive to certain individuals. I firmly believe that all materials in the library should remain as they are. Since the library has allowed these items, there must be a valid reason, so they can't be that bad.  I oppose the removal of certain items from the library. People need to understand that this is life. There will always be things we don't like, but we have to accept them. For instance, when watching TV, we can notice offensive content, yet no one makes a big deal out of it.  A book that may be offensive to one person could be just another regular book for someone else, with no intention of causing offense. The library is a place for learning, and all materials are for educational purposes. I've read books that contained harsh content, but instead of complaining, I continued reading.  Many books are based on real events. No matter how offensive they may seem, we should consider the author's purpose in creating them. The same goes for movies. They allow us to understand the author's perspective. Everyone has the right to their own opinion, and most magazine articles are about expressing views on specific topics.  In my @CAPS1 class, we had to read “To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3.” Some @CAPS4 @CAPS5 people might think it's racist, but it's actually the author's way of showing how things were before white and colored people were treated equally. If someone still finds it offensive, that's okay because we live in a free country where everyone can express their feelings without fear of punishment.  In conclusion, it's acceptable for some materials to be offensive as long as that's not their main purpose. The next time you come across something offensive while reading or watching, think about the message the author or creator is trying to convey. Maybe the offense is part of getting the point across.
979	3956	2	2	Censorship can be a beneficial measure as it prevents inappropriate material from reaching the wrong hands and keeps disturbing content out of the community, thereby creating a better living environment. However, excessive censorship can be detrimental. For example, @ORGANIZATION1 had an extreme censorship policy when he burned books. There are also several books, like @CAPS1 @NUM1, that discuss the issue of censorship getting out of control. Hence, libraries should exercise a certain degree of censorship over their materials.  Books and magazines should be censored according to their content. Both use words and sometimes pictures to convey their messages. If a book uses vulgar and inappropriate language, it should be censored in some way. One should not expect to pick up a book and find sexual dialog or a constant stream of swear words. Moreover, many people are offended by violence and gore. If there are inappropriate pictures in books or magazines, the material should be censored. For example, if one sees a magazine with a nude picture on the cover in a library, it raises questions about the library's censorship policy. Similarly, if a book contains an inappropriate picture, it also makes one question the library's standards. Magazines with extremely violent or gory pictures should also be censored. Overall, extremely inappropriate books and magazines should be censored.  Music available in libraries also needs censorship. Musicians use album sleeve artwork to attract attention. If the artwork includes swear words or inappropriate pictures, it should be censored. Additionally, if the lyrics of the songs are explicit or have many sexual themes, the music should be censored. No one should have to deal with such inappropriate music. Any album that is extremely inappropriate should be censored.  Movies are perhaps the most challenging media to censor because they incorporate language, pictures, music, and video. They are multi - media entities that can range from being very clean to highly inappropriate. A movie rated @CAPS2 should not be in a public library. Movies rated @CAPS3 for sexual content, nudity, drug use, alcohol abuse, or swearing should also be censored. Public libraries should not make such movies accessible to the public, especially kids. The level of violence and gore in a movie should also determine whether it needs to be censored.  It is regrettable that the debate on censorship is even necessary. However, certain materials that may offend people, such as those containing nudity, sexual content, swear words, gore, and violence, should be censored. At the same time, there must be a limit to censorship, as Katherine Paterson said, or we'll end up with no books at all. In conclusion, some form of censorship is essential in public libraries.
980	3957	2	2	Based on my personal experiences and the books I've read, I am convinced that some books should be removed from library shelves. My main concern is for the well - being of children. Kids should be allowed to be kids and should be shielded from certain inappropriate content until they are older and more mature. This applies not only to books but also to music, movies, and magazines.  Some people believe that exposure to inappropriate content in these media can lead to bad behavior such as stealing, cussing, and even murder. By reducing the availability of such obscene materials, we can better control the behavior of at least some of our children.  We witness bad behavior like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault on a daily basis. It's worth considering what causes people to engage in such actions. A quick look around reveals that these behaviors are often depicted in movies, discussed in books, and even the subject of songs. It's no wonder that kids may think these actions are acceptable. If we limit access to these items, we can expect to see positive changes.  As I've mentioned, kids should be protected from obscene materials. They will inevitably be exposed to such content at some point, but hopefully when they are older and better equipped to handle it. In the meantime, censorship should be implemented on these items, and the most inappropriate ones should be removed from the shelves.  In conclusion, censorship of books, music, movies, and magazines is necessary to safeguard the innocence and well - being of children. By taking these steps, we can create a more positive environment for them to grow and develop.
981	3958	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries may have certain books, music, movies, and magazines on their shelves that are inappropriate for young children. These materials can have a negative impact on daily life. For instance, books with violence, like those depicting killing, can give children the wrong ideas. A twelve - year - old should not be exposed to such content, as it might lead them to think that violence is acceptable, potentially resulting in criminal behavior later in life. Similarly, books about slavery can be a sensitive topic. If a mother doesn't want her ten - year - old to know about it, such books should not be easily accessible. This could cause the child to develop negative views towards certain groups.  Music in libraries can also be a concern. Even if most libraries don't stock extremely bad music, there may be some with content about stealing, which can mislead children. Movies with themes of killing, breaking into houses, or fighting have no place in school libraries. These can give young children inappropriate ideas. Magazines with revealing pictures of men or women are also unsuitable for school settings, as they can lead children to engage in inappropriate behavior.  In conclusion, it is crucial to ensure that libraries carefully curate their collections to protect the well - being and proper development of young children. By removing inappropriate materials, we can create a safer and more positive environment for learning.
982	3959	2	2	If there are any offensive books, movies, music, or magazines, they should be removed from the shelves for the safety of young children. Everyone has different preferences for media, but we need to be aware of where children pick up bad habits. Books can remain on the shelves if younger kids are not likely to access them. Adults should have the right to remove materials that are inappropriate for their children.  Offensive movies, music, and magazines can have a detrimental effect on children. They can learn bad habits from movies, pick up bad words from music, and be exposed to inappropriate pictures in magazines. Many young children are curious and tend to get into things they shouldn't. For example, they might watch age - inappropriate movies and learn bad behaviors. If a movie is offensive, it should be kept away from the shelves, except in a household with only adults. Otherwise, children might accidentally access and watch these movies.  Horrible music can also teach children bad language. Parents should hide such music to ensure their children don't develop bad habits. Magazines with inappropriate pictures should be monitored around children. Before allowing children to read a magazine, adults should check it.  In summary, offensive items should be kept away from young children. By doing so, we can prevent them from learning bad habits and ensure their healthy development.
983	3960	2	2	Many books are placed on library shelves for various reasons, but some take issues like race, sexism, and bullying to an extreme. Putting myself in a child's position, reading such materials can be terrifying. The language in movies and music is often not as we would like it to be. Would you want your @NUM1 - year - old child to imitate the behavior of other @NUM1 - year - olds just because they think it's cool?  In the past, parents didn't have to worry as much about what their children were exposed to. However, if we don't take action now, future generations may face even more problems. Removing some books from the shelves or eliminating profanities from songs won't harm children or teenagers. These offensive materials imply that it's okay for children to engage in activities like having sex, smoking, drinking, or swearing.  My mother is always concerned about me. She frequently calls to check on me. If we work together to address the issue of profanities, the world could become a safer and nicer place. Bullying, problems in cyberspace, and the use of drugs and alcohol could be reduced. We need to show our children that these behaviors are unacceptable.  When buying a DVD or a CD, we should preview it to ensure it doesn't contain offensive content. We also need to talk to our children about right and wrong. If we don't want our children to be exposed to offensive materials, we should avoid them ourselves.  In conclusion, by taking steps to reduce offensive content in media, we can create a better environment for our children's growth and development.
984	3961	2	2	Suppose you go to your local library to reread a favorite book. You search shelf after shelf but can't find it. When you ask the librarian, she tells you that the book was removed because someone found it offensive. This makes you extremely angry, and you decide to write an article for the local newspaper about the removal of books, movies, and music from the library.  Personally, I don't think the media removed from the library should be considered offensive. Determining what is offensive is subjective. A book that is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. It's not reasonable to remove media from a library just because it contains 'offensive material.' This is a ridiculous practice that really angers me.  If you're worried that an item might get into the hands of a child or someone it could affect, you can choose not to rent it. Most libraries have separate areas for adults and children to prevent children from accessing such items.  It's difficult to determine if something is offensive. Just because something is offensive to me doesn't mean I'll ask for it to be banned so that others can't enjoy it. If you find something offensive, simply avoid it. Filing a complaint about it is disrespectful to both the librarian and the artist who created the work.  We live in a rather closed - minded world. Some people are overly sensitive about what they consider appropriate. However, it's not reasonable to report something just because you don't agree with it. We have a general understanding of what's right and wrong. If a work weren't appropriate, it probably wouldn't have been published.  In conclusion, media should not be removed from libraries based on subjective notions of offensiveness. We should respect different opinions and the freedom to access a wide range of media.
985	3962	2	2	Imagine someone snatching a book out of your hands and saying it's offensive. If the government notices citizens with offensive magazines, books, movies, or music, it has no right to take them away. Everyone should be able to decide for themselves what is right or wrong to watch, read, or hear. No one should be forced to be exposed to something they don't want to. Moreover, if someone really wants to find offensive entertainment, they will, regardless of the law. So, trying to stop people from accessing such content is a pointless effort.  Think about your favorite bedtime story, '@CAPS2 The @ORGANIZATION2'. It's gone because the government declared it offensive to camels. This is a real shame, and we should also consider the authors. One of the great things about our country is the freedom of speech and expression. Government censorship can limit the creativity of authors and make it difficult for them to write great stories.  If a song is beautiful but has one bad word, is it a bad song? And who would decide what is appropriate if there were censorship? Would it be the @CAPS5 or the @ORGANIZATION1? As a mature adult, I can decide for myself what is good or bad.  If there were strict censorship, many of the books and songs we have today might disappear. It's almost impossible to have a unified standard for moral opinions on entertainment across the country. Some censorship may be necessary for the protection of young children, but it should be limited and used only to help them.  In conclusion, while some limited censorship for children is understandable, overall, we should uphold the right of individuals to make their own choices and protect the freedom of expression in our country.
986	3963	2	2	In contemporary times, numerous libraries face limitations regarding the materials they can stock. Undoubtedly, there exists offensive content in the world, yet much of it is the work of artists striving to establish their reputations. If we start regulating one another's thoughts, emotions, and artistic capabilities, where will it lead our rapidly evolving culture? Libraries should not possess the authority to censor materials. One effective approach to meet diverse demands is to divide the library into two primary sections: children's and adults'. Subsequently, these sections can be further subdivided. This method is cost - effective. Additionally, setting an age limit in the adult section to prevent noisy children from entering would be beneficial. It would simplify the process of finding the right book. Censorship is defined as the removal of a particular item that is either offensive to a specific group or banned. If someone were to remove @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other works, our cultural development would be hindered. When materials are removed, we can never anticipate the consequences. Censorship restricts the true potential of many artists. Limiting an individual's knowledge can impede their chances of achieving success in the world. I have read various books, some of which are offensive, while others are about knowledge and intelligence. There is no fundamental difference between them as different things appeal to different people. Katherine Paterson's quote aptly illustrates this point: if one person has the right to remove a book from the shelf, then everyone has that right, and eventually, there will be no books left. Censoring materials not only harms the creators but also the entire community. In conclusion, libraries should refrain from censoring any materials. Censorship stifles people's desire for an open mind and a better understanding of the world. As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 emphasizes that if one person can remove a material from the shelf, everyone can. Censorship has no place in libraries.
987	3964	2	2	Is something offensive? Should people be allowed to suppress others' ideas? I think about this question often. For centuries, people have been engaged in writing, making videos, and creating all types of music. Some view it as an exercise of freedom of speech, while others might see it as rebellious or a conspiracy. I believe @CAPS1 are outstanding writers, promising producers, and talented artists. However, not all media is positive. Over time, young children have been influenced by various media such as books, movies, and music. It is understandable that many parents discriminate against certain media. But it's not just children who are affected; there are also issues related to religion, race, gender, sexuality, and social groups. There should be specific rules and laws against such unjust practices. However, everyone is entitled to their opinion. Hundreds of people face discrimination because of what they encounter in the media. A life - changing experience for me was watching the movie The @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This movie can be considered offensive to many, especially those of African - American descent or any other race that has endured similar abuse. These are just a few of the issues related to freedom of speech. There will always be disagreements and different viewpoints. But I firmly believe that there are certain things that should not be made public in the media. In conclusion, while freedom of speech is important, we need to be more cautious about the content we share to avoid causing harm and discrimination.
988	3965	2	2	Dear @CAPS1, is it wrong to ban a book? I've noticed that our library is considering banning any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that someone finds offensive. I strongly disagree. The world becomes a better place when everyone has equal access to information. Some information may be sensitive, but it should never be completely blocked just because of its nature. Our country is founded on the principles of freedom of the press and speech. Denying this is denying our nation's livelihood. To address this situation, we need to establish a checks - and - balances system. This system should ensure that information remains accessible while protecting younger individuals until it is appropriate from a guardian's perspective. Our country has several problems, some of which stem from the core values enshrined in the @CAPS6. The @CAPS6 states that we have the freedom of the press and speech, which means we can publish anything, regardless of its appropriateness. This also safeguards readers' right to access information. For example, in @LOCATION1, a local library had to allow people to look up porn on library computers due to the laws in the @CAPS6. Despite some people's discomfort with this level of freedom, we cannot ban works based solely on the judgment of a few. The world is constantly changing, and so is information. No one can predict what will or will not be acceptable in society in the future. Currently, many sexual subjects are offensive to many and inappropriate for the younger generation. The problem is that this type of information is easily accessible, especially on the internet. We cannot block all information, but we can restrict it. To create such a restriction, our library should implement a checks - and - balances system. People of age @NUM1 or older can access sections with sensitive works, while those under @NUM1 need a guardian's consent. A good example is from '@CAPS10 @CAPS11 and The @CAPS12 of @CAPS13', where @CAPS10 can only enter the restricted section with a signed pass from a teacher. This protection allows works to be available to the public while shielding the younger generation from inappropriate content. As humans, we have a natural thirst for information. Blocking access to it limits our potential. Many things in life are offensive, but our founding fathers recognized this when writing the @CAPS6, which now protects our information. While this is a good thing, we also need to protect our children. In conclusion, we must create a program that respects people's freedom to access information while safeguarding the younger generation.
989	3966	2	2	I'm okay with the censorship of reading materials. I understand that product sellers want to attract customers and make them buy what they're selling. I have a lot of experience with this because I read many car magazines, which sometimes feature a lot of models. As a 17 - year - old, I'm fine with it, but there should be a limit. My school handles this issue well. When they notice something inappropriate, they flag it and move it to the back, but still allow students to read it. I like this approach as it keeps inappropriate materials out of easy reach. My parents and I have a good relationship. They tell me what I can buy. If a magazine is 95% about cars and only 5% about models, they're okay with it. Everything has a limit, just like how stock car parts have a limit on the horsepower they can handle before breaking. Since I'm not yet 18, I'm restricted to car magazines. But don't get me wrong, I love cars and have a passion for them. In conclusion, while I support some level of censorship, it should be balanced to ensure that we can still access the information we need while being protected from excessive or inappropriate content.
990	3967	2	2	What is considered offensive? How can we determine what offends people? Everyone is unique, with their own thoughts and beliefs. So, it's difficult to know what will offend whom. For me, racial discrimination, gender discrimination, and religious discrimination are offensive. I think these things would offend most people, but we can never be completely certain. Books are a form of expression, and we can't tell people what they can or can't write or publish because everyone has the right to freedom of speech. People will always voice their opinions, but not everyone can get what they want. We need to be rational and understand this concept. If a book, magazine, song, movie, or any other written or vocal recording offends someone, they don't have to read, listen to, or watch it. No one can force someone to engage with offensive content. In most cases, people have a choice. In our world, books, songs, movies, magazines, and other things will always offend at least one person. But should we really care if it offends someone if that's how we feel or believe? I believe that if something offends a person, they can choose not to access it. If they remove it from the shelf, that's their personal decision. We can't tell others what they can or can't write or record. It's their life, and they should be allowed to live it. In conclusion, while we should respect others' feelings, we also need to uphold the principle of freedom of speech and expression.
991	3968	2	2	"There's a well - known saying, ""It's a free country."" However, I believe there are numerous things in the world that people probably shouldn't be exposed to. Yet, regardless of what it is, we always find ways to access such content. The world offers a plethora of sources to obtain the truth, or perhaps even lies. Media, the press, paparazzi, and even the people around us all contribute to the spread of things that might be better left unseen.  There are certain matters that the government and the world keep hidden from the public's view. On the other hand, there are things that the world presents to us, like the case of @PERSON1. Many people find what happened to him offensive. Moreover, racism in general and the news are also concerning. Why do people put violent content such as murder stories, kidnappings, and robberies on the news? Many find this not only offensive but also scary, yet it remains on the air.  I firmly believe that things considered offensive should not be removed from shelves or wherever they are found. Take, for example, the incident when a marine died, and gay supporters and protestors chanted offensive things near his funeral, like ""Thank god for dead soldiers"" and ""God hates the army."" No one stopped them. If we, as a society, can't come together to decide what should or should not be displayed, then what's the point of telling others what offends us when we might end up doing the same without considering who we're hurting? Everyone has an opinion and wants to assert it, but people are different, and some will always see things differently from us.  So, if you come across something offensive in a book, movie, or in real life, simply avoid it. Don't watch, read, or listen to it. By ignoring it, you won't even be aware of it. Let's focus on the positive aspects of life and not worry about the negative."
992	3969	2	2	"The question ""Can I read this?"" has been asked or posed to many @CAPS1 around the world. @CAPS1 have the right to read whatever they desire, but the question remains: should children be allowed the same freedom? There are books that are suitable for children or young adults and those that are not. This suitability varies depending on age and the reader's ability to understand the book's content. Some books contain cursing, smut, and @CAPS4, which are inappropriate for children.  In high school, there are books like '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' that contain cursing. High - school students aged @NUM1 or older can handle reading such books as they have heard these words before and understand their context. However, if a teacher gives this book to a @NUM2 grader, the student won't be able to fully grasp the learning potential it holds. Children at that age won't understand that a character is handicapped, nor will they comprehend the killing done by the handicapped man or why his friend killed him.  Would a parent let a @NUM3 - year - old read a smut novel? This depends on how the parent was raised and their perception of how it will affect the child's development. An @PERSON1 book is not appropriate for a child of that age because the child lacks the maturity to understand it. @PERSON1 books have a gothic and romantic writing style, and a @NUM3 - year - old hasn't developed the mature thinking required to appreciate such a book.  Regarding @CAPS4, the saying "" @CAPS4 is not the answer"" is well - known, but it's not always followed. Young adults play video games and read school - related books about @CAPS4. The book '@ORGANIZATION1's don't @CAPS5' is about a colored teenager going to a white school. Younger children in elementary school might think it's funny if there's a cartoon about @CAPS4, but they lack the background and maturity to understand that it's wrong. Just watching a TV show with hitting or punching might make them think it's okay to do so.  In conclusion, there will always be books with @CAPS4, cursing, and smut. Whether a child reads such books depends on the parents and the child's maturity level. It's not right to allow underage children to read books with curse words, violence, or smut."
993	3970	2	2	I firmly believe that people should have the right to choose what they and their children read, watch, or listen to. In today's world, almost everyone has a movie they want to see or a book they want to read. But what if they go to the library and find that the item they're looking for has been removed due to offensive language or mild themes? It wouldn't be fair to remove offensive books, music, or magazines from the shelves because different people have different preferences for content.  We live in a violent world, and it's difficult to avoid offensive material. Some people try to avoid it at all costs, while others don't care or even like it. Firstly, different people perceive the same content differently, and the titles being removed may not be judged fairly. People who want to watch the latest movies often encounter some form of violence. With advanced technology, it's easier to add special effects and more violence to movies. In books, there may be old language that doesn't meet today's standards. For example, in the @NUM1 and @NUM2, the word 'gay' meant happy, but it has a different meaning now and is found in many old books and songs. Some people may find this offensive, while others may not.  Adult content is very different from children's content. Adult movies and music are based on real - life situations, while children's content is often about the alphabet and sing - alongs. Even some more grown - up kid movies, like @ORGANIZATION1's '@CAPS1', which is set in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1 training to be a hero and involves killing creatures in fights, would be considered violent if libraries started censoring materials. Adult movies are even more extreme, involving cursing, killing, gun battles, and sexual content.  As adults, we should have the right to choose what we watch and decide what our children watch. Different people have different life experiences, which influence their perception of violence and offensive content. For example, a person who grew up on a farm and is used to seeing animals killed will be less affected by a movie or book with an animal - killing scene than someone who grew up in a neighborhood.  In conclusion, it's only fair that people decide for themselves what they consider violent and what they watch. There should be no censorship of library content. Parents should make decisions for their children, and adults should have the freedom to choose for themselves.
994	3971	2	2	In my opinion, libraries should not practice censorship. Even if books, music, movies, or magazines on the shelves are offensive, they should remain there as they are part of our history and the history we are creating.  If someone wants to read a particular book or magazine, they will likely find a way to do so. With today's technology, there are numerous ways to access such content. One can simply look it up online and read or listen to it on a computer.  Moreover, censoring in libraries, which are places where people feel calm and comfortable, can lead to rebellion and may even put the library out of business. From my observations, many people already look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet, especially if they know it's a topic that could be debated for censorship.  Many great books and movies, even classics, contain some offensive content. Generations have enjoyed these works. So, who would want to be the unreasonable one and deprive those interested of these cultural treasures? Everyone should have the right to access these books, magazines, movies, and music, and libraries should not censor them. We should respect the diversity of content and the right of individuals to choose what they consume.
995	3972	2	2	Libraries are filled with a wide variety of books, movies, and magazines. Some of these items may come across as offensive to certain people. Parents may not want their children to be exposed to specific books or movies. But does this mean we should remove these offensive items from the shelves?  If everyone removed one book or movie they considered inappropriate, there would be little left in the library. Books are a source of adventures and life lessons for both kids and adults. Young children need books to stimulate their imagination. Without books in the library, children would miss out on opportunities to learn and grow. Movies are similar to books, but they are often easier for young children to visualize.  What one person finds offensive, another may not. If a book or movie offends you, simply choose another one. It shouldn't be removed from the shelf. A world without books would be a world without imagination and adventures, a boring world. I'd rather have a few offensive books than none at all, as it allows me to learn and experience characters' adventures through my own eyes. In conclusion, we should preserve the diversity of library content and let individuals make their own choices about what to read or watch.
996	3973	2	2	Should one remove a book from a shelf merely because it causes offense? If the answer is yes, how does this differ from a white boy claiming he can't study in the same class as a black girl? Or when two individuals of different religions state that the other offends them due to their different beliefs in God. Merely because someone is offended by a book or its writing does not justify its removal from the shelf. In fact, those who dislike it need not read or even glance at it. One of the freedoms we possess in America is the right to read whatever we wish. For someone to remove anything from a publicly accessible shelf is an infringement of that freedom. In conclusion, it is unacceptable to remove anything from a public shelf, regardless of who it may offend. As Americans, we have the right to read and write whatever we desire, and removing offensive material would be a deprivation of our freedom.
997	3974	2	2	I firmly believe that censorship has no proper place in our libraries. Libraries were established as information hubs for the public. If censorship were implemented, numerous books would be removed as they might be perceived as offensive to a minority of people. Censorship undermines the very purpose of libraries, which is to provide unrestricted access to knowledge and diverse ideas. By censoring materials, we limit the public's exposure to different perspectives and historical truths. In conclusion, libraries should remain free from censorship to fulfill their role as open repositories of information.
998	3975	2	2	I am of the opinion that libraries should censor certain materials. Some music and magazines contain inappropriate language and explicit images. Parents may not want their children to be exposed to such content and may not always be aware of what their children are accessing in the library. To safeguard children, it is advisable to remove inappropriate books and music from the shelves. Some children visit the library without adult supervision and can freely select any book. Without parental guidance, they may choose inappropriate materials and be unaware of what is right or wrong. Removing such items is a practical solution. Alternatively, having an attendant to monitor each child's activities would be extremely labor - intensive, and librarians are already overburdened. Another option of setting an age limit for borrowing books and music also has loopholes, as children can easily find ways to bypass it. Therefore, the simplest way to avoid issues with inappropriate books and music is to remove them from the shelves. This approach better protects children and is the most efficient way to maintain a safe environment in the library.
999	3976	2	2	Have you ever searched for a book in a library and couldn't find it, or noticed a magazine tucked away on the top shelf? If so, you've experienced censorship. Censorship involves hiding things from public view, and libraries are a place where this occurs with books and magazines. Nowadays, many people are overly concerned about offensive content in books and magazines. I think this is because they are too worried about what others think and strive for an unrealistic sense of perfection. I strongly oppose this. If an author writes a book, they should not be afraid to include certain content due to others' opinions. Readers who dislike it can simply choose not to read. Sheltering materials in libraries is not a good idea. Sometimes, an article with an appealing image can catch a reader's attention. If it conveys a meaningful message, the reader will form their own opinion. Whether positive or negative, it allows for independent thinking. If you believe something is too inappropriate for others, that's your opinion, and you're entitled to it. I respect your view, but I hope I've made my point clear about the drawbacks of censorship.
1000	3977	2	2	I am against the idea of censorship in our libraries. When we censor libraries, we are essentially censoring the people. This is a democratic country, not a dictatorship. A recent example of improper censorship is the rewriting of @PERSON1 books because of the use of the 'n word'. However, this was the language of that era, and we cannot rewrite history just because it makes some uncomfortable. We study history to avoid repeating past mistakes. Music is a form of self - expression, and censoring it means censoring the artists. They create music with a purpose and work hard on their creations. We have the right to freedom of speech, and we should not have this freedom taken away because a few people find it inappropriate. We don't force anyone to listen to music they don't like. Each generation has its own music and ways of dealing with problems, and our generation uses music to express ourselves. Movies are often censored for language and content, but removing them from libraries is unnecessary. If the audience is mature enough, they should be able to watch them. We don't need to sanitize movies for children; if a movie is too inappropriate, children should wait until they are mature. Magazines should also be censored based on maturity and age. Removing articles just because someone in charge doesn't like them is wrong. People have the right to know what's happening in the world. Censoring materials only makes people more curious and likely to seek them out. We can't please everyone, so we should be allowed to make our own decisions. Censoring libraries is an infringement of our rights as stated in the constitution. We won't be kept in the dark by censorship; instead, it will turn into a game, and we're ready to play.
1001	3978	2	2	The author, Katherine Paterson, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope no child will pick up. However, if I have the right to remove a book I detest from the shelf, then everyone else has the same right, and eventually, there will be no books left for anyone.' There are countless books in the world that may offend someone in some way. It is a fallacy to expect everyone to consider one's feelings. Everyone has the right to explore others' thoughts, though they may not always like what they find. On every bookshelf, there are books with harsh opinions or uncensored content. During my years as a student, I have come across books with vulgar images and language. In @PERSON1's play '@CAPS2', the character is described in crude terms. Our class was shocked by the language and sexual innuendos. The nemesis described @CAPS2 as a 'black ram'. Such comments in books can mislead young minds into thinking name - calling is acceptable. This is how children learn about certain authors and the outside world. @PERSON1 also mentions a'strumpet' in '@CAPS2'. Once a young mind is exposed to such adult matters, their perception of the world changes. Children face challenges as their books and magazines display racy pictures and product advertisements. Magazines are a gateway to adult content. When teenagers or children see the vibrant ads and beautiful models, they lose touch with reality and their childhood. The photoshopped images of tall, tan, and thin models make girls aspire to that lifestyle. They start wearing shorter skirts, dieting, and tanning because of magazine ads. Everyone wants to be like a model. When actresses, singers, and models look like goddesses, men form an ideal of the perfect girl. As a result, women feel inadequate. This cycle of under - appreciation and the obsession with perfection gives the media more power. In conclusion, the world has been drawn into the unrealistic fantasies presented by racy books and magazines. Crude comments in classics have a strong influence on the mind. Magazine advertisements make women feel worthless and men unfulfilled. The question is, will you take control of your life or let the media dictate it?
1002	3979	2	2	Nowadays, kids have various options of books in the school library, and some of these books are censored. School systems have valid reasons for censorship, such as the presence of racial slurs, profanity, and inappropriate situations in books. Racism is a common issue in books. In fact, one out of fifty books contains racist content. For example, '@PERSON1' by @PERSON2 has recently been banned from schools across the @LOCATION1. Parents around the world try to teach their kids proper language. However, kids may pick up bad language from the books on school library shelves. It is up to the kids to decide whether to read these books. Schools are also cautious about the content in magazines. They only order certain Sports Illustrated magazines to prevent kids from seeing nudity or violent scenes. It is understandable for school librarians to take such measures. I firmly believe that schools and parents are doing the right thing. It is the kids' choice whether to follow their parents' advice. Censorship is beneficial for the @CAPS1 youth.
1003	3980	2	2	Parents have the right to decide whether their children's books should be censored. Some parents prefer their children not to read such books until they are older. Young kids in grade school may not be aware that the books they pick up contain profanity. In my opinion, grade schools and middle schools should not have censored books. While some parents don't care what their children read, we should consider those who do. Not everyone has the courage to voice their concerns to the school. I would not allow censored books in my child's school. On the other hand, high - school students are old enough to browse through books and decide whether to borrow them. Although some parents still worry about their high - school children, students at this age are capable of making their own decisions. Some students may not realize what book they've chosen until they start reading, but they can exchange it. I believe high - school students are smart enough to select their own books. Therefore, I think censored books and magazines should be removed from grade schools and middle schools, but not from high schools. If you agree, you can take action by talking to your child's school.
1004	3981	2	2	Certain materials like books, music, and magazines often contain offensive information that many people would like to censor. However, the creators of these items do not intend them to be offensive; rather, it is the way people perceive information that matters. People form their own opinions and decide what to believe. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. This could lead to conflicts between the public and those who do not consider the removed items offensive. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. Removing an item based on a single complaint is unjust. For example, a book about slavery might be offensive to a white man, but a black man may see it as a part of his history. People can be offended by just a title or a lyric, but they don't have to read the book or listen to the song. Others may enjoy these materials. These materials can also be informative. Although the content of a particular magazine may not be acceptable to some, it can provide a lot of new information. If all offensive materials were removed from the shelves, there would probably be nothing left. Removing them could cause problems for someone trying to learn about a disease, while another person suffering from it may not want their story told. Censoring in libraries would also disappoint those with different interests. Many people read books and rent movies for fun. What one person finds offensive may be interesting to another. For instance, teenagers are often interested in action and romantic films and books, which usually contain physical and sexual content and foul language. Older people may find this offensive, but it is what attracts teenagers. In conclusion, offensive materials in libraries should remain on the shelves. They are a source of knowledge, and what offends one person may interest another. Censorship would limit access to information and take away the choices of those with diverse interests.
1005	3982	2	2	The question of whether materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are offensive is a controversial one. Censorship is a matter of different opinions; some people think it is necessary to protect kids, while others don't consider it that important. Books are an important part of people's lives and learning. However, some book topics may be inappropriate, against someone's beliefs, or religion. Personally, I don't think full - scale censorship is necessary to keep certain things out of libraries. Instead, inappropriate materials for children or offensive materials should be placed in a separate, clearly - labeled section of the library. This way, people will know what to expect and won't accidentally stumble upon them. Another reason why censorship may not be necessary is that offensive and inappropriate content can be easily found on @CAPS1 or the internet. @CAPS1 has some censorship, but it is not enough to eliminate the negative impact on young people, such as violence, drugs, bad language, and racism. Children and young people should be taught what is wrong. When they mature, they will understand the importance of staying away from such content. I still believe that censorship is not necessary, despite the presence of inappropriate and harmful things in today's culture. If young people can see the negative effects of offensive content on others, they will learn to stay away from bad things and choose the right path. In conclusion, censorship is not necessary at present. If everyone is guided towards what is right, they will hopefully make the right decisions and avoid harmful books, movies, music, magazines, and other similar materials.
1006	3983	2	2	"Censorship is a highly sensitive topic in contemporary society. People often raise questions such as ""How much content should be censored?"" or even ""Should any content be censored at all?"" In my view, the responsibility of censorship should rest with the parents of children who consume various materials through reading, listening, or watching. Television networks, publishers, libraries, and other providers of such materials cannot replace the role of parents. If a parent fails to take responsibility for monitoring what their child is exposed to, it is unfair to hold the content distributors accountable.  My own experience attests to the importance of parental involvement in censorship. My mother has been actively censoring offensive materials for me since I was a young child. She always shows interest in what I am reading and will occasionally review a book or other reading material to determine its suitability for me. She has also censored my music by checking my music player and sampling songs. She discourages me from listening to music she disapproves of.  I have also noticed censorship practices in my local library. The library is divided into sections, starting with children's books, which are free of offensive content and suitable for young minds. This section is followed by young - adult and then adult books. The music collection is similarly categorized. I believe this categorization is appropriate because there are certain materials and music that young children should not be exposed to.  Reading the book "" [Title 1] "" by [Author 1] has further convinced me of the need for parental involvement. In the book, [Character 2]'s parents left him unsupervised in his room, allowing him to listen to his own music and watch whatever he wanted. This led him to listen to a [Genre] metal band called "" [Band Name] "", which ultimately influenced him to commit a homicide at school, killing ten students. This is an extreme case where a lack of censorship had tragic consequences. Since violence can have a significant impact on young children, they should not be exposed to it until they are more mature.  Based on my reading, I firmly believe that the government does not have the right to impose censorship on the entire population. The novel "" [Title 2] [Number] "" is an example of extreme censorship. In that society, reading is banned, except for comic books and sex magazines. This shows that without the freedom to read, society degenerates into simple - minded and uneducated beings. Censoring the reading materials of an entire population is not practical. Once a person reaches adulthood, they have the common sense and maturity to choose what they want to read.  Censorship is a complex issue with both positive and negative aspects. My stance on this crucial matter is that parents should be responsible for censoring their children's reading, not the government or reading companies. Adults should have the right to choose what they read. Reading is a wonderful activity that should not be restricted for adults who are ready to fully experience it. As long as society strikes a balance between the situation in "" [Title 1] "", where there was no censorship, and "" [Title 2] [Number] "", where censorship was excessive, we can achieve an appropriate equilibrium. Censorship is beneficial for children but restrictive for adults."
1007	3984	2	2	A lot of people believe that libraries should be censored in some way to keep certain types of books away from the public. But does it really work? Even if you take certain books or music out of a library, people can still get the same information from other sources. Moreover, many of the things that people want to censor might not be that bad. I think it's better for someone to read about something rather than experience it directly. As Katherine Paterson said, if we let people get rid of books or music they think are bad, there'll be nothing left.  When people try to censor libraries, they usually just remove items from the shelves. But in today's digital age, that doesn't stop people from getting what they want. The internet allows people to share books and music. So, even if you can't get a book at the library, you can probably find it online. In the end, removing books and music from libraries doesn't really achieve much.  Deciding what should be censored is a tough task. Everyone has different ideas about what's appropriate for the public. Some books that get removed might insult a particular group of people because of its content. This can lead to a loss of business and make people angry. Isn't it better for people to learn about bad things like crime and death in a non - real and non - harmful way? In books, these events often show the consequences and how the situation was handled, which can be helpful for people who might face similar situations in real life. This makes it extremely difficult to determine what should and shouldn't be censored.  Katherine Paterson also pointed out that if we let people censor what they consider immoral, everything will be gone. Every person in the world can find something wrong in every book. Even if there's a book that most people agree should be censored, there will always be others who think differently. If we censor libraries, there won't be any books left because people can always find something bad or immoral in them.  Overall, censoring libraries causes more problems than it's worth. It doesn't stop people from getting the information they want. There's no clear way to decide what to censor, and if we start censoring, it could lead to more and more things being removed. In conclusion, library censorship is more trouble than it's worth and doesn't have much of a positive impact.
1008	3985	2	2	Dear Newspaper staff, I am [Name], a student in the [Grade] grade. I am writing to express my belief that certain offensive materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the library shelves. Nowadays, children's minds are exposed to a wide range of inappropriate content, from porn to bad music and games.  Many books, magazines, and movies contain content that is not suitable for public consumption. When children get their hands on such materials, they may be overly influenced. Also, on the internet, children can access websites that they are not supposed to visit. If we could remove all offensive materials from the shelves, it would eliminate many problems, such as loud and inappropriate music, computer viruses, and damage to books.  However, in today's world, it is difficult to completely control access to such materials because of the internet. But if someone were to remove all the offensive items from the library shelves, it would be a great improvement. Leaving these materials available will only lead to more problems. Once they are removed, the situation will be much better.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that removing offensive materials from library shelves is a necessary step to protect the well - being of children and the overall public. It will create a more suitable environment for everyone.
1009	3986	2	2	The question of what the public should read and consume in terms of media is a complex one. There is a vast array of reading materials and music that people enjoy as hobbies. Books, which have existed for centuries, can transport readers to entirely new worlds. Magazines offer the latest gossip, while music can help people cope with life's challenges. Movies can stimulate people's imaginations and evoke emotions, even for seemingly unimportant themes. These elements are integral to people's lives. Without them, what would people do with their free time? Clearly, books, magazines, music, and movies should not be removed from the shelves. They are crucial components of society and shape our lives.  Books and magazines are two popular forms of reading. Whether they are fiction or non - fiction, books create engaging stories. Reading has been a pastime since ancient times, with a wide variety of genres such as adventure, mystery, comedy, and love stories. People will always read, and often, the sad and sometimes gruesome stories are the most appealing. Magazines are often picked up at the grocery store checkout. People love to read about gossip and the latest trends, and magazines provide a form of self - entertainment. A juicy magazine title is often irresistible, making people want to learn about others' lives.  Music serves multiple purposes. It is commonly listened to while driving or to help people fall asleep. The lyrics of songs can resonate with ordinary people and help them through difficult times. Different beats can change people's moods. On [Date] nights, movie theaters are usually crowded. Movies bring stories to life, allowing people to follow along and use their imaginations. A sad - ending movie can make people cry, as it touches them emotionally, even if the story is not real.  Life is shaped by various factors, and people have different preferences. Books, magazines, music, and movies reflect these individual likes and dislikes. Removing items from the shelves because they are offensive or might not make people feel good won't improve the world. Instead, it will take away sources of happiness. Often, offensive content is the truth, and there's no point in hiding it. What would writers, musicians, and actors do if they couldn't create because their work might offend a few people? These forms of media are a source of comfort for many.  In my experience, books pique my interest in different subjects, magazines satisfy my curiosity about celebrities, music makes me happy when I'm sad, and movies allow me to feel the emotions of the characters. Books, magazines, music, and movies make the world and our daily lives what they are. They are simple yet essential elements. Once they are gone, a significant void will be left. They should not be removed from the shelves just because they might be offensive; they are an important part of life.
1010	3987	2	2	In this essay, I will discuss library books and whether offensive books should be removed from library shelves. I firmly believe that libraries have the right to keep various materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines, on their shelves. In my opinion, libraries should not remove any books because what one person may find offensive, another may enjoy.  When I visit libraries, I come across books that I like and others that I don't. But this is just my personal preference. There are people who may like the books I dislike and vice versa. Books are meant for people who are interested in learning about different things, whether it's history or fictional stories.  It's extremely difficult to determine which books should be removed because everyone has different opinions. Some books that are removed might be offensive to a particular group, but at the same time, there are others who appreciate them. By removing books, libraries may lose customers and cause dissatisfaction.  In conclusion, removing books from library shelves is not a good idea. These books are valuable resources that cater to different interests. We should respect the diversity of opinions and allow people to choose the books they want to read. After all, libraries are places that should provide a wide range of materials for everyone to enjoy.
1011	3988	2	2	Books are a crucial component of literature. Different individuals hold diverse views on various types of books. Some people relish reading, while others do not. Reading speed also varies among individuals. Reading is a personal activity, as one's reading abilities, interests, and preferences differ from those of others.  The core here is personal preference. You might enjoy a particular genre or topic that someone else finds offensive. However, just because someone else dislikes it, it doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. Just because a book is in the library doesn't mean you have to borrow it, and just because a new release is popular doesn't mean you have to buy it. People can avoid the topics they don't like. For example, if a local library removes all books related to drugs and alcohol because they are considered offensive, this action could be offensive to those who enjoy such books. Moreover, some content that is offensive to some might be essential for others' research. Otherwise, some people may lack the necessary resources.  The same principle applies to music, movies, and magazines. People have the right to choose what to buy or rent. If a particular artist or actor is offensive to them, they should find an alternative and leave that work for others to enjoy. They shouldn't complain. Imagine if someone found their favorite band's music offensive and it became unavailable for rent or purchase. Then, they would understand that everyone has different tastes.  In conclusion, recognizing that everyone is unique and special, we should understand that people enjoy different things to varying degrees. Every book, movie, album, magazine, and other forms of media should be available for people to enjoy, and hopefully, everyone can find something they like.
1012	3989	2	2	People around the world often find things offensive that others do not. In the case of public libraries, they should be cautious about what they place on the shelves. If a young child picks up a Playboy magazine from the children's section, the library may face a lawsuit. Libraries are meant to be places where people can borrow books for reading or look up information for schoolwork. While books on anatomy are an exception, if a library has a book like ""Sex for Dummies,"" something needs to be done.  The same goes for movies. If someone wants such content, they should look elsewhere. Exposing children to certain movie clips and images can be harmful. If our world deteriorates because children cannot access the correct information, it shows that we are at fault.  The movies we watch, the advertisements we notice, the music we listen to, and other aspects shape our identities. Nowadays, many seemingly harmless magazines contain ads with inappropriate content, such as those found in some well - known magazines. These ads are completely unnecessary.  If people paid more attention to this issue, we would have fewer problems. The offensive content is harsh and cruel for young readers, writers, and musicians. It can influence children to engage in behavior that both Americans and non - Americans find offensive. Therefore, libraries should be aware of what they stock and the potential consequences."
1013	3990	2	2	Censorship is a complex topic. People have different opinions on what is acceptable in libraries, given the content in books, music, movies, and magazines. When we start to censor the information available to certain people, it can lead to anger and protests. However, there should be age limits on some materials. So, how can we determine what is suitable for younger children and teens?  For movies, music, and magazines, there are already age restrictions for purchase or rental. In libraries, the rules for movies should be the same as elsewhere. One should be seventeen to borrow any movie rated R. I'm not sure about the age limit for unrated movies, but in libraries, it should follow the general standard. Other movies should be accessible to all ages.  Music is also a controversial area for censorship. If an album has an explicit label, one should be eighteen to borrow it. Some music contains violent lyrics, and those under eighteen should not listen to it. When encountering offensive music, one should be wise enough to avoid it. Artists can record whatever they want, but children should not be exposed to such content until they are mature enough to distinguish appropriate from inappropriate listening.  Printed materials are the most difficult to censor. Personally, I believe no book should be restricted from anyone, except for magazines. Magazines can contain graphic content and should be restricted from those under eighteen. There are things that children should not see, but as legal adults, people should have access to any type of book.  In a library, all these materials should be available. It is a place to understand how writers, movie directors, musicians, and magazine editors view the world. Censoring library materials would deny the public access to the real world and violate the right to free speech. I respect the work of others because in their eyes, what they write is the truth. It is an expression of self, and preventing their work from being accessible is a violation of free speech.
1014	3991	2	2	I'm writing an essay about whether books, magazines, or movies with bad language or violent content should be removed from the shelves. First, we need to find out how many people like such materials. Personally, I like books with violence and graphic language as they make the book more interesting. Regarding music, parents need to be cautious about what their children listen to. And broadcasters should be careful about what they air, as some content can be harmful to children.  Second, we need to consider if it's appropriate for children to read such books. I don't think it's okay for children under fourteen to read about violence or encounter graphic language. However, it's not up to me. A survey should be conducted among parents to see what they think. It's ultimately their decision whether their children can listen to or read such material.  Parents are also responsible for the music their children listen to. There are more explicit words in modern music than ever before, and the same is true for books and magazines. Magazines can sometimes have graphic pictures. I'm not really interested in magazines; I'd rather watch TV.  Finally, we should think about how to make American libraries more child - friendly. I think libraries should have separate rooms for different types of books. If a library allows anyone to pick up any book, children will likely choose inappropriate ones. There should be an age limit for borrowing books with bad language, graphic pictures, or unsuitable content.  In conclusion, books should reach the right readers, not children. Children don't need to learn bad language at a young age, as it's a bad habit. Reading about violence or murder might give children the wrong idea. This is not acceptable to me.
1015	3992	2	2	Cursing, violence, gang activity, murder, and other such elements are present in today's books and music. Should they be censored? I believe that books and music with such messages can influence the choices of both children and adults. Therefore, I think they should be censored.  My first reason is that children and adults are highly influenced by the information in books and music. In today's world, we see murders, gang violence, and abuse. If a book or song promotes murder or drug - dealing, many people, especially those influenced by peer pressure, may think it's ""cool"" and follow suit. This can lead to loss of life, imprisonment, and poor decision - making. People often follow famous artists or authors, which creates a negative impact.  The second reason is respect. Some books and music can be offensive based on race, religion, or appearance. While this is more common in music, it also occurs in books. Young children and teens should not be exposed to racism, sex, or drug - related content. Such books and music are disrespectful to parents and their teachings. The message they convey is against what parents try to instill in their children. People should be able to enjoy a song or a book without being disrespected or offended.  My final reason is the reputation. Books and music, like people, can send the wrong message and create a bad reputation. For example, certain types of music are often associated with negative messages, leading to stereotypes. If books and music were censored, there would be fewer stereotypes, and people could base their decisions on whether a song or book is suitable for themselves or their children more objectively.  Most people want to read and hear about love, positive messages, and good influence. If books and music are censored, there will be less cursing, fewer bad ideas, and potentially less violence. In conclusion, I firmly believe that books and music should be censored."
1016	3993	2	2	I firmly believe that there should be no censorship. These materials, whether they are books, music, movies, or magazines, represent someone's opinion. We cannot simply ignore them just because we dislike what they convey. It's analogous to saying that black people or anyone we don't find visually appealing are not allowed. Everyone should have the right to express their thoughts without the fear of censorship. While I may not agree with all the statements presented, they should have a fair chance, just like anyone else. Of course, age - appropriate restrictions based on content should be in place to prevent young children from accessing inappropriate material. We can't go around getting books removed or franchises closed just because they offend us. People get offended by minor things, but they need to accept that others have different opinions. It's similar to judging someone based on their race; everyone has different morals and values, which can't be easily changed. If you don't like an article, simply don't read it. Don't stop others from reading it due to your personal views. In conclusion, censorship has no place in a free - thinking society.
1017	3994	2	2	There are diverse viewpoints regarding censorship in libraries. Some people advocate for removing books that are in any way offensive, while others believe these books should stay since the definition of 'offensive' varies from person to person. I am of the opinion that books should remain on the shelves. People perceive things differently, and free will allows individuals to choose whether to pick up these books; no one is forcing them to read. The offensiveness of books, music, movies, and magazines is a matter of personal opinion. Different people have different standards of what is appropriate. For example, a magazine article about political wrong - doings or a cartoon of a candidate might be seen as offensive by some politicians but just an opinion by others. A book on a particular religion might be offensive to some if it portrays them as a stereotype, while others view it as educational. This ties in with the concept of free will. No one can force another person not to read a book or listen to a song. It's our free will that enables us to consume the media we like. Demanding that a book be removed from the shelf takes away the free will of those who might want to rent it. It's up to each individual to decide what to read and how to interpret the content. Moreover, these media should stay on the shelves for learning and educational purposes. Even if a book or movie has a few offensive lines, it doesn't mean the whole thing is offensive. The library is a place for research, and offensive material in some parts doesn't invalidate the rest of the work. In conclusion, the offensiveness of media in libraries is based on personal opinions, and these materials should never be removed as they offer valuable information and respect people's free will.
1018	3995	2	2	Can you think of a book you wouldn't want your children or other kids to pick up? If you had the power to remove it, would you? I believe that if I found a book, magazine, music, or a movie offensive, I wouldn't remove it. Everyone has the right to their opinion, even if it's offensive. Instead of completely removing the materials, we could remake them to be less offensive. Firstly, no one should have the right to remove materials they find offensive. If people were allowed to do so, there would be no music, books, movies, or magazines left for entertainment. It would also lead to conflicts because people have different views on what is offensive. When those who find certain materials offensive start removing them, while others don't see them as such, it could spark a riot. Secondly, rather than removing materials, why not try to remake them in a more suitable way? For example, we could approach the publisher to make the content less vulgar. The same goes for music, movies, and magazines. In conclusion, everyone has the right to their opinion, offensive or not. If I came across something offensive, I wouldn't take action because the creator might be expressing their feelings, and we can't tell someone how to feel or express themselves. Instead of removing materials, we should consider that they are a form of self - expression.
1019	3996	2	2	Is it wrong to censor? In today's world, with approximately @NUM1 billion people, there are various groups with different moral codes, ethics, beliefs, and worldviews. This creates a dilemma regarding what is right and wrong. The three main subjects to be discussed here are censorship, expression, and society. Censorship labels certain materials as unfit to be seen or heard. It was established to protect people from raw, unseemly, or cruel content. Music, movies, magazines, newspapers, television, and other media are censored based on their subject matter, such as sex, drugs, or politics. The reasons for censorship vary from place to place. The expression of one's inner thoughts can be seen as disastrous by some, while others view it as a chance to discover the next great thinker like @CAPS3 vinci or @PERSON1. Censoring these individuals would be a terrible idea. Just because someone has a different outlook doesn't make them evil. Their work might cause issues, but their ideas shouldn't be shunned. Their creations should be accessible to people of all ages. Society poses a significant problem. Social norms and what is considered acceptable behavior vary globally. What is censored in one place may not be censored elsewhere, which means the concept of right and wrong differs among people. Society has a great influence on what is allowed to be seen or heard. If a society disagrees with an idea, it may ban it. If this continues, no one will be able to freely express their thoughts. So, is censorship wrong? Censorship is unjust to those with unique ideas. If one person can censor another, the censored person could, in turn, censor the censor based on their views. Therefore, it is wrong to censor anyone or anything based on their ideas, morals, ethics, rules, laws, beliefs, or conduct. In conclusion, censorship, expression, and society will always have different views, but these views should never be hidden.
1020	3997	2	2	I believe that even if the content in a library is considered offensive, it should remain on the shelf. While it may be inappropriate for many, there will be a select few who value it. It's like taking a kid's cake just because it has too much frosting; it would upset most people. If a book, album, movie, or magazine contains offensive or inappropriate material, it should be organized with other similar media, not exiled to a far - off corner. When someone checks out such media, they should be required to state that they are comfortable with the possibility of offensive or inappropriate content. Personally, I find @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or @ORGANIZATION1 in a song fascinating. Every time I look up these poems, I have to accept an agreement regarding the violent or hateful content. I do agree that this kind of material should not be readily available to those who are not aware of its nature. Simply asking the customer if they are comfortable with the content of a form of media should be sufficient. No one should have to settle for less just because others find something offensive. In conclusion, respecting people's choices and ensuring they are informed about the content is the key, rather than removing offensive media from the library.
1021	3998	2	2	Some materials may be considered offensive by certain individuals due to their language, racial slurs, or other offensive elements. In my view, everyone should have the right to choose what they read or watch as these books and movies are created for entertainment or educational purposes. For example, events like the @LOCATION1, which many would like to forget, actually happened and cannot be changed. By presenting such events, we can teach the next generation that they were wrong and should not be repeated.  Language is an important part of our world, and while many people dislike bad words, they are sometimes used in movies to emphasize significant moments. Although it's not always necessary, in some cases, a particular word can make or break a scene. Just because a movie has a lot of cursing doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I've seen some of the best movies with countless bad words, but their storylines are excellent. What makes these movies enjoyable is not the cursing but the success of the protagonist.  Regarding offensive materials in libraries, we should create a separate section for them. This way, young, innocent children won't stumble upon them. We can put up signs warning people about the content in that section and attach special stickers to the books to alert parents.  In conclusion, offensive materials aren't always bad and shouldn't be removed from shelves. Instead, they can be relocated. People should be free to read what they want.
1022	3999	2	2	Everyone has an opinion, but it's only in specific situations that people's opinions are truly taken seriously. When it comes to a debate on serious issues like 'censorship', there will be arguments from both those who agree and those who disagree. In my opinion, the view in favor of a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' should not be ignored.  Children, teens, and young adults are naturally curious. If they're interested in something and adults don't provide adequate information, they'll seek it on their own. Public reading materials like books, magazines, newspapers, and novels are meant for everyone. Hiding them would be a violation of people's right to be informed.  Not all reading materials are harmful to the youth. The key lies in how parents raise their children to acquire knowledge. A child needs to have a certain level of maturity to understand what they're reading. It's pointless for adults to hide things from children until the age of @NUM1, when they're legally allowed to access any knowledge. A better approach is for adults and children to have in - depth conversations for better understanding.  Removing novels and books from public libraries or schools will only increase children's curiosity. Some believe this might lead children to experience things firsthand, which can be harmful and dangerous. The simplest solution is to allow children to read and be educated.  If one person out of millions dislikes a book because they think it can influence a child negatively, it shouldn't prevent other children from learning from it. Agreeing to remove information from the library is completely pointless and may inconvenience those who are determined to research a particular topic. After all, books and novels are created to entertain, inform, and educate. Those who support the removal should also consider the consequences for the overall growth and education of children.
1023	4000	2	2	In my opinion, there's no point in removing books from library shelves. Libraries are filled with a wide variety of books covering every topic. If people want to read 'bad' books, they should be allowed to. Reading is essential for everyone, and some people may only enjoy certain types of books. Taking these books away won't solve anything.  I think some of the so - called 'bad' books that are removed from shelves are actually good, despite having some inappropriate content. Any book has its value. If a book is considered bad enough to be removed, there's usually a reason, and often, it's the part that makes people angry. People get angry either because they don't want their kids to read it or because they didn't come up with the idea themselves. If you don't want your kids to read a certain book, just tell them not to, and let adults enjoy reading freely. Many people are interested in reading about 'messed - up' things.  Music and movies are different. Bad movies shouldn't be made available to everyone. Unlike books, movies show the bad things directly, and kids may not fully understand the implications in books but can clearly see them in movies. Music can also teach bad behavior by presenting it in a cool way. However, I still believe people should have the right to choose. If you're a parent, you can tell your kids not to access bad content.  In conclusion, while there are differences in how we should handle books, music, and movies, people should generally have the freedom to choose what they consume, and parents should take responsibility for guiding their children.
1024	4001	2	2	In my view, libraries should offer readers a choice. Whether you prefer uncensored or censored books, it's up to you. Libraries shouldn't remove books because of their content. It should be the readers' decision, not someone else's.  When choosing a book, you need to think about whether you really want to read it. The back of each book usually has a description that gives you an idea of the content, helping you decide if it's worth reading. I believe books with suggestive content should be kept away from young children, but high - school students are generally capable of making their own choices.  Music shouldn't be censored either. If a song has offensive language or suggestive content, you can simply change the radio station. You have the power to choose the music you listen to, and no one can make that decision for you. Radio songs are for enjoyment, and you choose to tune in to a particular station.  Movies also come with clear descriptions on their cases, including what's in the movie and its rating. If you don't want to watch a movie with bad language or content, you shouldn't have selected it in the first place. The movie case often has pictures of certain scenes, and if they seem inappropriate, you can put the movie back and choose another one.  Magazines are supposed to tell the truth, and sometimes the truth can be harsh. The front of a magazine clearly indicates its content. If you're bothered by certain language, you can quickly flip through it to see if it's suitable for you.  In conclusion, libraries shouldn't get rid of books because of their content. Readers should be aware of what they're getting into when they enter a library. People should take responsibility for their own choices when it comes to reading, listening to music, watching movies, and reading magazines.
1025	4002	2	2	The question of whether libraries should have offensive books, music, and magazines is a complex one. Different people have different preferences, and what one person finds offensive, another may like and want to read. It's unfair to remove an item from a public library just because one person dislikes it.  Children, teens, and young adults are at a curious stage. While there are materials that may not be suitable for young children, parents shouldn't have to worry about their kids seeing inappropriate content in libraries. Library staff can take measures to keep such materials away from young children. For example, they can create a special section where only people of a certain age can access these materials.  Libraries are for everyone, regardless of appearance or dress. People have the right to enter a public library and read materials, even if they contain curse words or violence. As long as a person is mature enough for their age, they shouldn't be overly concerned about such content. In today's world, we're exposed to various things everywhere, so there's not much difference if a child sees or hears something in a library.  In conclusion, libraries should remain inclusive. While protecting young children from inappropriate content is important, we shouldn't remove materials just because some people find them offensive. By taking appropriate measures, libraries can ensure that everyone can access the resources they need while safeguarding the well - being of children.
1026	4003	2	2	Libraries are excellent sources of information, yet they present both advantages and drawbacks in this regard. Certain information is suitable only for adults. One might wonder what would happen if a child accessed an adult - oriented book. A solution needs to be found. Libraries also offer information about daily life through magazines, movies, music, and books. However, there is explicit music with cursing and inappropriate content, and there are books where authors discuss their sex lives. Magazines like '@CAPS1' also fall into this category. These materials should either be removed from libraries or placed in a section inaccessible to children. Parents should supervise their children when in public places, including libraries. Libraries could be divided into different areas. Music is not essential in a library and could be removed. While children should not have unrestricted access to certain books, they will inevitably learn about such topics in life. The committee could organize a contest where community members of all ages write essays expressing their opinions. I have devised a plan to address this issue. I don't think these books should be discarded as they are a source of livelihood for some and are liked by others. Instead, libraries should establish an adult - only section. Patrons must be @NUM1 or older, present an identification card, and have a membership for this section. This way, there's no need for censorship, and children won't be able to enter. In conclusion, libraries are valuable information sources. The solution isn't to remove books, music, magazines, and movies. By creating separate sections for specific items and age groups, censorship can be avoided.
1027	4004	2	2	I believe that one has the right to choose to remove certain books, movies, music, and magazines, but only if they are inappropriate for some people and children. Some individuals like such items, while others do not; it all depends on personal preferences. If I visit a library and the books I want are on the restricted list, the library should charge a small fee, ranging from @MONEY1 to @MONEY2, depending on the type of book. For example, if I wanted the movie @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1, which is restricted, I would be willing to pay a fee similar to a Redbox rental. This is my stance on restricting certain items in the library. -@PERSON1
1028	4005	2	2	Some people in our world often feel the urge to ban things or tarnish their reputations. However, if someone has taken the time to create something, we all have the right to access it. I firmly oppose censorship in our society. Local libraries are wonderful places to obtain books, movies, and information. But if censorship continues, libraries will lose their value as a resource. Many of the world's greatest books are targeted by censorship. Katherine Paterson's statement, 'Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is very true. Once people start removing one item, they won't stop. They'll keep searching for things they dislike, and people will be deprived of the things they enjoy. When I was young, I frequently visited the library for @CAPS1 movies and books. I witnessed a book being removed due to censorship. Although I didn't fully understand at the time, I felt that reading it would get me in trouble. This is not good for kids as they shouldn't be afraid to read. We live in a country with freedom of speech, but this right seems to be disappearing. There are other ways to observe the impact of censorship on libraries, such as reading about book - banning cases. Currently, most attempts to ban books fail, but the future is uncertain. In school, students often read about people trying to ban some of the best books. It's ironic that these are the most interesting books to read. Removing them from library shelves doesn't make sense. Reading keeps us informed about the past and future. If people want a world with no books, they can continue with censorship. But if there's any sense of decency, they should choose to oppose censorship. Reading makes us stronger, entertained, and helps us avoid repeating the past.
1029	4006	2	2	Every day, many people visit libraries around the world to access books, magazines, and movies. Libraries are a place where people of all ages can find materials for reading or research. There should be no restrictions on the books, movies, magazines, etc., available on library shelves. Everyone has different beliefs and preferences regarding what they want to read or view. If libraries start limiting their options, they will likely lose business, and people will read less. This could lead to a decline in an individual's @CAPS1. Reading benefits people by expanding their vocabulary and exercising their eyes. When someone's interest is taken away, they won't read as much or feel as free. Just because one person dislikes something doesn't mean others will. If a book or movie is offensive to someone, they can simply choose not to read or watch it. No one has the right to dictate what others are interested in. However, it's not a bad idea to limit access to certain items based on age. Books that may be offensive or inappropriate for young children should not be accessible to them, but they shouldn't be removed from the library altogether. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a wide range of materials while implementing age - appropriate restrictions to ensure that everyone can enjoy the benefits of reading and learning.
1030	4007	2	2	Nowadays, books often contain action, romance, and other engaging elements. Books that don't move off the library shelves usually lack these features. Meanwhile, popular books like the happy @CAPS1, The @CAPS2 side, The @CAPS3, and vampire books are in high demand because they have action, love, and more. Some books on the shelves may be great, but others never leave because they are boring or old - fashioned school books that don't meet readers' expectations. On the other hand, books adapted from movies, such as The @CAPS2 side, are very popular. This book has sold faster than the movie. Readers prefer these movie - based books because the authors provide more information than the movies. I've heard that The @CAPS2 side book is much better than the movie as it offers more details. That's why people like books adapted from movies. There are other reasons why people like books today. You no longer need to go to a bookstore. Books are available on iPhones, iPods, iTouches, iPads, Nooks, etc. People are happy that they can get books on the go without having to leave their homes. That's why books are now easily accessible. For those who like the feel of a physical book, I suggest getting an iPhone or a Nook. It can save time, especially when you're on your way to work or school.
1031	4008	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should not remove all items from their shelves. Some people rely on certain materials, like music for concentration or magazines for information, to assist them in their work. Therefore, libraries should refrain from taking these items off the shelves as they serve a purpose for patrons.
1032	4009	2	2	This short piece is about me and PERSON1 watching the horror movie anthology of CAPS7. Initially, I was extremely scared, but I soon got over it. After watching it a few times, I got used to it. That concludes this CAPS6 assignment.
1033	4010	2	2	The library is a crucial haven for those in search of knowledge. It houses books from past and present writers and information on historical and contemporary events. The issue of library censorship has become an ongoing debate. Censorship in libraries should not be permitted, particularly when it comes to historical events, books, and newspaper articles.  Censoring historical events in libraries would lead to a loss of vital information. For example, the Holocaust, during which approximately six million CAPS1 were killed by LOCATION2, was a significant global event during CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4. If censored, this event might fade from collective memory. Similarly, the slave trade, a major part of CAPS5 history that shaped the nation, would be lost. Moreover, historical facts offer opportunities for teaching and learning. Forgetting key parts of history by censoring materials is not advisable.  When it comes to books, authors write their works as they intend. For instance, PERSON2, the author of The CAPS6 of PERSON3 and The CAPS6 of ORGANIZATION2, used the word NUM1r to convey the tone of the time. PERSON1, the author of To CAPS7 A CAPS8, also had his unique writing style. Authors use the language and words of the period they write about, and censorship goes against their creative intent.  Newspaper articles should also not be subject to censorship. Newspapers were the primary means of disseminating information, bringing attention to current events. Removing them would result in a loss of information. They were crucial in reporting on events like LOCATION3, CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4, the assassination of CAPS12, and ORGANIZATION1. Even today, they keep people informed about past and present events, such as the death of LOCATION1 and views on the death penalty.  In conclusion, the library is a place where knowledge seekers can access information on various topics. Censorship in libraries, whether aimed at historical events, books, or newspaper articles, should not be allowed as it restricts the free flow of information and goes against the purpose of the library.
1034	4011	2	2	Dear CAPS1, around the world, there are governments, often communist or socialist, that censor what people read and write. In LOCATION1, we have the right to express, read, and write freely about anyone or anything. Although censorship exists in LOCATION1, it is mainly in the form of the perception that it exists.  I've read newspaper articles about textbooks covering up the truth to be politically correct. I've also heard about libraries removing books with strong political opinions, often written by conservatives. Additionally, I've read about books published with the sole purpose of criticizing potential presidential nominees. As a conservative, I believe these books should be available in bookstores, libraries, and other public places.  In LOCATION1, we have freedom of the press, and preventing these books from reaching the public violates this right and hinders the free - flow of ideas. I want others to hear and read my ideas on achieving life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, so I believe all books should be accessible.  I agree with having a restricted section for certain books to protect children. I hope this paper will publish an article on these thoughts. We, the ORGANIZATION1, are a republic that has encouraged the free - flow of ideas for over NUM2 years, and there's no reason to stop now. Thank you, PERSON2.
1035	4012	2	2	In my view, censorship in libraries has its merits. Certain materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from libraries if they are offensive to more than one person. However, if they are not a significant issue, they should remain.  If patrons find a large number of offensive items in a library, they may be less likely to visit. Moreover, offensive materials in libraries can be accessed by children, potentially influencing their behavior and thinking. For example, books or magazines containing drugs, nudity, extreme violence, or bullying are offensive and can have a negative impact.  From personal experience, books with such content can be offensive to parents. I once got in trouble for reading a book from the library that a teacher deemed inappropriate, even though it was freely available on the shelf. Libraries should take the time to review their collections and determine if the materials would be offensive to parents if their children were to read them.  I support the removal of offensive materials from all libraries. I believe that if parents had the choice, they would eliminate all mean, nasty, and offensive materials. In conclusion, libraries should be more vigilant in curating their collections to ensure a suitable environment for all patrons.
1036	4013	2	2	I firmly believe that public libraries should implement censorship. Public libraries are frequented by families and young children, who should not be exposed to certain content. If individuals wish to purchase inappropriate reading materials, movies, or music, they can do so elsewhere. There are clear distinctions between what is acceptable and unacceptable in public libraries.  Certain materials, such as rated @CAPS1 movies and romance novels, are not inappropriate or unacceptable. Although they are intended for adults, their covers do not display extremely racy images. However, there is other material that most people do not want to see, and young children should not be exposed to it.  Those who wish to view, listen to, or read inappropriate materials that are not suitable for all ages or should not be seen by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere. They should seek such items outside of public places where families and children gather. While I believe these individuals have the right to access the content they desire, public libraries should censor such materials.  Most people do not read inappropriate materials in public, and extremely racy movies are not shown in theaters. Therefore, there is no reason for these materials to be available for checkout in a public library. Additionally, many people do not want others to know they are viewing such content, so they would not check them out from a public library.  I also believe that not only should children be protected from such content, but parents should not have to deal with their children's curiosity about things they are too young to understand. The youth of @LOCATION1 are being exposed to new and inappropriate things at an increasingly young age, whether it be drugs or inappropriate magazines. We should not expose them to such content at an even younger age. In conclusion, censorship in public libraries is necessary to protect the well - being of families and young children.
1037	4014	2	2	Katherine Paterson, the author, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Her quote implies that there may be books, magazines, etc., on the shelves that some people find inappropriate.  I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed from library shelves just because they are considered offensive. There are ways to avoid encountering them. If something is found offensive, it should be placed in a special aisle.  First, offensive items should be placed in a specific aisle. Since there are things meant only for adults, there should be an aisle dedicated to offensive or inappropriate materials. To access this aisle, people should need permission and show an ID to prevent children from accidentally entering and seeing inappropriate content. Exposure to such content at a young age may influence children to engage in bad behavior as they lack the judgment to understand.  Second, if an individual finds a book or magazine offensive, they can simply walk away. They don't have to read or search for it in the library if it's in a specific aisle. If someone is highly offended, they can complain to the library management. If there are enough complaints, the item can be removed. However, it's not difficult to avoid something one doesn't like, and it should be kept out of the reach of younger children.  Third, libraries contain offensive or inappropriate materials, so children should be supervised by adults when visiting. If a child sees something inappropriate, they may find it interesting and want to read it, which could give them wrong ideas.  In conclusion, there are many ways to avoid offensive content. One can walk away or stay away from the relevant areas of the library. There will always be offensive and inappropriate things, but the best approach is to ignore them. If one is concerned, they can make a complaint. Placing inappropriate materials in a separate aisle is a wise decision as it prevents young children from accessing them.
1038	4015	2	2	Katherine Paterson wrote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote reflects on what children should and should not be exposed to and what they should learn at a young age.  Libraries house non - fiction and fiction books, magazines, music, and movies. I enjoy learning about various things, but there are some things I don't want to learn when I'm too young. I prefer to discover things on my own. Life is full of reality, and we need to emerge from the fantasy world. Magazines can be full of drama and sometimes present a rather exaggerated view of people.  Libraries are excellent places to learn. One can learn about the history of presidents, countries, important people, and music. I mainly go to the library to read and check out books, and I've learned a great deal from them. However, there is some material that is too strong for young children and should be learned gradually as they grow.  Libraries should label books for children and display age - appropriate warning signs. While it's good to learn about life, we need to be cautious as some content can be overwhelming. I've learned a lot from both old and new books. I don't think books should be removed, even if they are strong, as it's our choice whether to read them or not. Racist books, for example, are there to help us understand the past, not to make fun of people.  Magazines can be beneficial as they keep us updated on world events, but some only focus on drama and criticize famous people. This is not suitable for children. However, magazines should not be removed as everyone has the right to choose what to read.  The music in libraries often dates back centuries, and there were great composers. Music should not be removed as everyone has different musical tastes. Similarly, movies are an important part of life, and I've learned a lot from them, from the history of slavery to visions of the future. There are also rated movies, and it's our choice whether to watch them.  In conclusion, there are reasons for the existence of certain books, music, magazines, and movies that may offend some people. These materials have significance and should not be removed. It's up to us to decide what to read, watch, or listen to, and we should make these choices based on our age and understanding.
1039	4016	2	2	As a member of the community and a frequent library visitor, I believe that books, magazines, movies, etc., should not be removed from library shelves. Just because something may be offensive to one person doesn't mean it's offensive to others. Removing various items from libraries would limit people's knowledge of the world and could lead to a less - informed society.  Libraries offer a wide range of materials that are not always suitable for family viewing but can provide valuable knowledge to the appropriate age groups. Movies in libraries are mainly for entertainment. We should view library items as a source of knowledge rather than focusing on whether they may offend a certain number of people. In the long run, removing these items could be harmful to the new generation.  As someone who visits the library often, I've noticed that removing items can cause unrest. I've read many books from different sections of the library, including some that contain racist language related to my ethnicity. I tolerate such language because I want to understand what my ancestors went through to get me to where I am today.  Magazines are also part of the library collection. Like movies, they are there for entertainment. Many people use the library as a place to relax and learn. The library is not just a place to borrow items; it's a comfortable environment for learning.  In conclusion, as a community member and regular library user, I firmly believe that items should not be removed from library shelves. Libraries offer various materials that may not be suitable for family use but can be helpful to others. Some books about racism are not meant to be harmful but to show the struggles of our ancestors. Magazines are for entertainment, and if someone finds them inappropriate, they can choose not to read or watch them.
1040	4017	2	2	There are two key points regarding the removal of books from library shelves. Firstly, there will always be something that offends someone, regardless of its nature. Secondly, no matter how hard we try, children will inevitably encounter things that we don't want them to see or do.  If people were allowed to remove items they find offensive, there would be nothing left on the shelves, in stores, or anywhere else. People have diverse tastes and dislikes. If one person removes a book, another person who wants to read it will be disappointed and may stop visiting the library.  Even if an offensive book is removed, there are far worse things in the media. Cartoons can be more violent than most books, and many commercials and advertisements use sex, money, and fame to attract people. These are often not suitable for children, like billboards advertising alcohol or adult - oriented products on the way to school. They are part of real - life exposure.  No matter how hard we try to keep our children 'safe' from offensive content, it's becoming increasingly difficult. No matter how much we try to change or remove things we find offensive, there will always be something equally offensive around the corner, whether it's a billboard, a poster, a movie cover, or a band. Just because someone doesn't like something doesn't mean their children or other children will feel the same way. In conclusion, removing books from library shelves is not a practical solution as offensive content is widespread in our daily lives, and everyone has different sensitivities.
1041	4018	2	2	Conflicting artworks, including books, music, and movies, are commonly found in libraries. Regardless of whether it's @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1, there will always be someone who takes offense. The question of whether these offensive works should be banned is a frequent topic of discussion among authors, musicians, and movie - goers. Personally, I firmly believe that all such works have the right to be seen, heard, or read. Creators invest significant effort in expressing their opinions and are entitled to freedom of the press.  Any famous work may offend someone because it contradicts their beliefs. However, this does not justify banning the work. Banning a book means completely rejecting the author's thoughts and opinions, and everyone has the right to hold such views. Censoring any work is unconstitutional as citizens of the @LOCATION1 enjoy total freedom of the press. Censorship is not a viable solution because, whether the work remains on the shelves or not, people will still be offended. As @PERSON1 demonstrated in @CAPS4 @NUM2, censoring books can lead to a society lacking a true understanding of the past and the thoughts and feelings of people from that era.  In my view, so - called 'offensive' books, movies, and music are not bad; they are catalysts for debate. They allow readers, viewers, and listeners, not just the authors, to express their thoughts on the presented content. Removing the possibility of debate would be a form of sabotage. @PERSON2 from @LOCATION1 stated that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.' By saying this, she implies that if everyone were to remove the books, magazines, movies, or music they dislike from the library, there would be nothing left. Every work would be removed because at least one person is offended by each such work.  Allowing people to read books, listen to music, and watch movies means allowing everyone the freedom to record their thoughts and stances. Censoring any work anywhere stifles ideas. These ideas are what drive society forward, making us think and helping us form our opinions. By allowing the free flow of these ideas, we can nurture future generations of great thinkers. By keeping books, magazines, and music on the shelves, we can continue to 'learn from the past' and make use of historical information and ideas.
1042	4019	2	2	Shelves in libraries hold various media and entertainment materials like movies, books, magazines, and music. However, not all of this content is suitable for everyone, as some can be offensive to foreigners and children.  Censorship in libraries can be a complex issue. While we are accustomed to certain content in movies and music, libraries are primarily places for study and educational learning, not for entertainment. Although they can be a bit of fun at times, most people take their children to libraries to focus on school - related learning. Therefore, @CAPS1 rated @CAPS2 movies, explicit music, adult books, and magazines should be removed from library shelves.  One day, while I was in the state library looking for a book about @LOCATION1 and its people, I came across a book that contained very mean and offensive remarks about the @CAPS3 people. I was shocked that such a book was placed in a public library. After some people read these offensive comments, they started to have negative views and disliked the @CAPS3 people.  In my opinion, magazines and movies related to different countries and their ways of life should also be removed from the shelves. The content can be distressing for those who have experienced similar situations. Another reason for censorship is the titles of these materials. For example, if a child sees an adult - themed film that is mislabeled as suitable for children, it can be offensive. I would not want my child watching a violent movie.  When it comes to public libraries, we need to consider the well - being of children and foreign visitors. If censorship is not carefully implemented, it can anger foreigners or make children violent and reckless. Foreigners may be less likely to return to our country if they encounter offensive materials in our libraries. In conclusion, censorship is crucial in libraries and on their shelves to ensure a suitable environment for all.
1043	4020	2	2	I can definitely think of a book that I wouldn't want my children or any other children to take off the library shelf. This book would likely be offensive or demeaning to someone's race, and it would probably prompt children to ask questions that we'd rather not discuss.  I wouldn't recommend this book to my children. If it weren't demeaning to any race or skin color and didn't contain profanity or racial slurs, I'd let them read it. But with such inappropriate content, I'd tell my kids it's off - limits until they're older.  Certain magazines, like those featuring swimsuit models and other inappropriate content, are off - limits for my children. Music is the same; if it has profanity and talks about drugs, my kids won't be listening to it. Movies follow the same rule. If a movie has inappropriate content, my kids won't watch it. The exception is if a movie is rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, then they can watch it. But if it's rated @NUM1 or @CAPS3, forget about it.  In the end, there are definitely books, movies, or magazines that I don't want children to access. You never know what kind of influence such materials can have. As a strict parent, I won't let my kids watch, look at, or listen to inappropriate stuff because it can have a negative impact on their minds. I've personally experienced watching, listening to, and looking at bad stuff, and I deeply regret it. In today's libraries, there are many inappropriate materials that kids can easily take home without their parents noticing. We need to be vigilant to protect our children from such content.
1044	4021	2	2	The question of whether someone offended by a book or movie from a library should be able to get it removed is an important one. Here, I'll share my views on library censorship.  If parents are offended by a book and don't want their children to access it from the library, they can simply forbid their children from reading it. They shouldn't have the power to remove the book. Just because they think other children shouldn't read it doesn't give them the right to make that decision for everyone. Each parent should decide for their own children, and one parent shouldn't be able to deny others the opportunity to read a book.  Some people may be offended by certain library books, but one person's offense doesn't mean everyone will be offended. Does this one person have the right to demand a book's removal? It's just their personal opinion. By removing the book, they prevent others from reading it, which is unfair. Different people have different tastes in books and are offended by different things. If everyone removed the books they disliked from the library, there would be no books left. I believe that if someone is offended by a book, they should simply avoid reading it. They can share their concerns with friends and family, but ultimately, everyone should make their own reading decisions.  I don't think individuals should be allowed to remove books from libraries. However, if the library itself deems a book offensive, it has the right not to stock it. After all, it's the library's decision what books to have on its shelves. I also think that when libraries are selective about the books they acquire, it should be sufficient for others.  In conclusion, people should not be able to remove books from libraries because everyone has different opinions on what is offensive. We should all have the freedom to read what we want, not what others think we should.
1045	4022	2	2	Offensive content seems to be everywhere, and as a result, censorship in public places is a common practice. It's acceptable to access non - censored materials in private, but not in public. I firmly believe that censorship is necessary in libraries due to the diverse audience, the nature of public materials, and people's strong opinions.  Libraries are public spaces with a wide range of users, including children, teens, adults, and the elderly. Some content is inappropriate for certain groups, especially children. As the quote says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Why would @CAPS1 place offensive books in libraries? Censorship can filter out inappropriate parts of books, movies, music, and magazines, making these materials suitable for all age groups.  Since libraries are public places, their materials are public property, and everyone has the right to access them. However, not all libraries will have the specific book, magazine, or movie you're looking for, as it may contain profanity or inappropriate content. Some people may oppose library censorship, but bookstores, movie stores, and music libraries often don't censor their materials. If you want a non - censored item, you can buy it. Then it becomes your private property, and you can do with it as you please.  In today's world, people freely voice their opinions without fear of punishment. Libraries serve all age groups, and censorship ensures that the content is appropriate for everyone. Some parents restrict their children from reading certain books, watching certain movies, or listening to certain music based on their parenting beliefs. Other parents may allow their children to access inappropriate materials, and that's their choice. However, libraries should not introduce inappropriate content to children; that decision should be left to parents or guardians.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is essential because of the wide - ranging audience, the public nature of library materials, and people's strong opinions. Everyone has the right to choose what they read, watch, and listen to, but in public places like libraries, we need to ensure that the content is appropriate for all. While not everyone can be satisfied, we can at least ensure that the environment is appropriate.
1046	4023	2	2	In my view, certain forms of media, such as offensive music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed from public libraries. I once babysat a young girl and took her to the library. She found a music item and put it in her player. To my horror, it contained sexual references and curse words. Had I not been there, she might have picked up on those inappropriate words. Similarly, I once picked up a magazine at the library with my friend and saw revealing pictures. I couldn't help but wonder what would happen if a young child saw such content.  I believe that children's exposure to inappropriate content should be carefully managed. However, for adults, they should have the freedom to choose what they consume. Many movies and books today are considered offensive, but they are also a form of art and expression. For example, some books have been banned due to the use of racial terms, but one must consider the time and context in which they were written.  In conclusion, while we should protect the young from inappropriate content, adults should have the right to access a wide range of media. Libraries should strive to balance the needs of all patrons and ensure that a diverse collection of materials is available.
1047	4024	2	2	I don't think anything should be removed because not everyone wants to look at the same thing. If you don't like it, don't look at it. So, there's no need to remove it, no matter what. In a free - choice environment, people should be able to engage with the content that suits them. Removing items based on individual preferences would limit the variety available to others. Everyone has different tastes and interests, and we should respect that. In conclusion, keeping a wide range of items accessible is the best way to accommodate the diverse needs of the public.
1048	4025	2	2	A quote from @PERSON1, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' makes a strong point about citizenship. Censorship is prevalent in various forms of media, including books, magazines, and TV shows.  I firmly believe that offensive content should not be removed. Censorship restricts the viewer or reader from fully enjoying the potential of the material. For instance, when TV shows censor words, it can be frustrating as the audience often already knows what the words are. @PERSON2's famous book @ORGANIZATION1 has been banned in schools because of a racial term. But we need to consider the time and age in which the book was set.  In literature, books like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @NUM1 explore the concept of censorship. In @CAPS3 @NUM1, books are censored, which is challenged by @CAPS1 and others. In @CAPS2, a boy challenges his society's censorship. In today's media, TV shows censor vulgar language, violence, and gore. While it's understandable for children's shows, censoring mature - audience shows is unacceptable, considering the freedom of speech.  In conclusion, if something is offensive to an individual, they should choose not to watch or read it. People should have the right to access uncensored content, and we should respect different perspectives on what is acceptable.
1049	4026	2	2	The question of whether censorship solves any problems is complex. In a free country, individuals have the right to choose the literature and music they enjoy. Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and historical precedent, but it is necessary when protecting the young.  It is a person's right to read the literature of their choice. If one person gets a book banned from a library because they don't like it, it can lead to a domino effect where everyone wants to ban books they dislike. For example, in a hypothetical public library, as different groups start to ban books for various reasons, such as mothers disapproving, religious groups objecting to the message, or books making people sad, the library would soon be left with only toddler books. This system harms everyone, and it's better to let people keep their right to read what they want.  History has shown that dictators often use censorship to control the public. By controlling what the public reads, thinks, and believes, they can weaken and abuse the people. In a country that values civil rights, censorship goes against the principles of freedom.  However, when it comes to protecting the young and their innocent minds, censorship can be necessary. Children are impressionable, and exposing them to inappropriate content can have a negative impact.  In conclusion, in a free country that promotes civil rights, censorship should be avoided except when it comes to safeguarding the youth. Everyone should have the right to choose their own reading material, and we should learn from history to ensure that freedom is maintained.
1050	4027	2	2	I think offensive books should not be removed because they can be a valuable part of a child's learning experience. Many kids today find movies, music, and magazines interesting, and these forms of media can actually encourage them to read. For example, a lot of kids read books because they've watched the corresponding movie. Some kids even like to listen to music while reading.  Magazines are also great. They are entertaining as they have pictures, gossip, and more. They can help people, especially kids, start reading and improve their reading skills. However, there are also some drawbacks. Kids might read magazines and start imitating what they see or read in them.  Some books are good, while others can be bad. Some books have excessive cursing and inappropriate covers or pictures. Different authors write different types of content, some good and some bad.  In conclusion, I love reading and enjoy books, magazines, music, and movies. We should recognize the positive role these forms of media play in our lives, while also being aware of their potential negative impacts. @ORGANIZATION1.
1051	4028	2	2	"When @LOCATION2 was established and our forefathers signed the constitution of @LOCATION1, freedom was of utmost significance. With each signature endorsing the constitution, @LOCATION2 became one of the few countries where freedom in all aspects was guaranteed. Laws such as ""you are innocent until proven guilty"" and freedom of speech have distinguished our country from those that suppress their own people. Freedom is an inherent part of @LOCATION2, and it is the birthright of our future generations.  Freedom of speech is evident everywhere. Even though some individuals may express excessive views, it is a right granted to us, and we must tolerate the nonsense that may be spoken. Offensive remarks are common because of the diverse ethnic groups in @LOCATION2. Inevitably, someone's feelings may be hurt at some point. While this is not acceptable, it persists globally. Freedom of speech is an unrestricted form of expression. One can say what they feel, but excessive expression may lead to conflicts.  Nevertheless, speech remains a freedom. If we curtail freedom, we will be in a dire situation. Genocide and unlawful imprisonment are common in countries lacking freedom. In such places, speaking out against a powerful figure may result in imprisonment, and holding different beliefs may lead to being targeted by the army. In contrast, the freedom in @LOCATION2, although it may cause controversy and produce offensive materials like certain reading materials and videos, is far better than living under a dictatorship.  Crude forms of freedom often appear in magazines, books, and CDs. If these products are being produced, it means they are being purchased; otherwise, they would not be made. On some occasions, items are produced based on beliefs and religious values rather than for economic gain. This is also a freedom that many have sacrificed their lives for. Moreover, with the production of books, movies, and CDs, there is a rating and supervision system to protect people from being exposed to viewpoints they dislike. If one does not like a product, they can simply put it down and walk away.  I do not foresee freedom being abandoned anytime soon. We may have to tolerate offensive products. We should be grateful to live in a free society that allows us to express our differences without fear of being harmed. The constitution cannot be discarded casually, and society must bear the consequences of freedom of expression. Freedom may come in the form of discs and books, but it remains an essential part of @LOCATION2 and the birthright of our future."
1052	4029	2	2	Do you think that offensive books, movies, music, etc., should be removed? I'm torn on this issue, and in this essay, I'll discuss my thoughts and experiences regarding it.  I can understand both perspectives. First, let's consider why I oppose removing offensive materials. What interests many people may not interest me. Everyone should have the freedom to read and listen to what they love and enjoy. I don't really care what others like. We may all come to appreciate things we never thought we would. For example, I love romance and scary books, while someone else may dislike them. No one has the right to tell others what they should like or dislike.  However, I also agree to some extent. When people make a big deal out of certain things, it can be annoying, like when a mother constantly reminds her child to clean their room. Some materials may be too offensive for some people, especially when they have concerns about their children. Once, I was in a library looking at a book that seemed really good. But a lady told me I shouldn't read it because it was too much for me. However, it was just right for me. She went to the main desk and complained. I was shocked and calmly asked her why she was so worried about what I was reading. She replied that the book was too revealing. I showed her the title, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. Eventually, we ended the argument, and I still checked out the book because I knew I would love it, and I did.  Instead of removing offensive materials, we should set them aside and let people request them if they want. This way, we can avoid unnecessary conflicts and ensure that everyone gets what they want.  In conclusion, I hope you understand both sides of the argument. Whether you agree, disagree, or are like me and can't choose, it's your decision. No one can force you to change your preferences for reading or listening. Both sides of the argument are understandable.
1053	4030	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials deemed offensive by some should remain accessible. It is up to individuals to decide whether to engage with such materials. I have personally encountered situations where I came across an article that upset me and also had an argument with someone who found what I was listening to offensive.  Once, while reading a newspaper, I found an article making fun of the town where I grew up. It described the town as full of rednecks, claiming that the people there were uneducated and unintelligent. This article deeply bothered me and made me feel ashamed of my hometown. However, upon reflection, I realized that it was merely someone else's opinion. Just because an article is written does not make it true.  Another incident involved a friend who visited my house to hang out and do homework. While we were in my room, I played a CD by my favorite rock artist. I was really into the music and admired the artist's talent. However, my friend walked over to the stereo and turned it off, saying that she didn't like it and found it offensive. This led to an argument. I told her that I thought it was great music and that I shouldn't have to stop listening to it. Eventually, we reached an agreement that I would not play the music while she was there, out of respect for her feelings.  Over the years, I have noticed that more people are taking others' words and songs to heart. When an author writes a story or an article, they are expressing their opinions. Sometimes, they present facts along with their personal views. If a material is available and one dislikes it, they simply don't have to pick it up and read it.  In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and the freedom to access different materials. As long as the materials do not violate the law, they should be allowed to exist. Everyone has the right to make their own choices when it comes to what they read, listen to, or watch.
1054	4031	2	2	I do not think it is necessary to remove offensive materials from public libraries. Since most town and city libraries are open to the public, if someone finds a particular piece of material offensive, they can simply pass it by or skim through it. While individuals have the right to freedom of speech, they should not exceed the boundaries set by the law when expressing their opinions.  In the case of music played in the library, if some people find it offensive, they do have the right to speak up for their rights. However, books and magazines should be allowed in public libraries, even if they may offend some people. Public libraries are meant to provide a wide variety of materials to cater to different interests. People have different personalities and preferences, so it is natural that they will like different things. Everyone in the United States has the right to express their opinions, even if they are not what others want to hear.  In conclusion, my opinion is that public libraries should maintain a diverse collection of materials. Instead of removing offensive items, we should respect the rights of individuals to choose what they want to read or listen to. At the same time, people should also respect the rights of others to express their opinions within the legal framework.
1055	4032	2	2	"I wonder if censoring is truly effective, considering that people often seek out banned books, ""rebel"" music, and controversial movies. In my view, censoring is not necessary. If a subject is offensive to someone, they should simply avoid it. Instead of censoring library materials, we should trust that people are mature enough to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. Media is a valuable source of knowledge, which is why it is used in schools.  I would like to find books like 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' in my school library. Although it is one of @LOCATION1's most famous literary works, it has been banned in some schools. The reason for the ban was the belief that it contained pornography and was not suitable for school. However, my English teacher used this as an opportunity to encourage us to read it. Some of my classmates who hadn't read the book were curious to find the so - called pornography, but I didn't find it offensive.  Another banned literary work is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1'. It was banned because a black character, @PERSON1, was called a @CAPS4 and was sometimes portrayed as stupid. However, @PERSON1 is actually the most noble and innocent character in the book. Some people found this portrayal offensive and inappropriate.  For movies with strong language, there are rating systems in place to protect the public, so this should not be a major concern. As for music, parents should monitor their children's music choices based on the singer's style.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that we should not censor materials in libraries. If necessary, an age limit can be set for checking out controversial materials. As mentioned earlier, media is a means of gaining knowledge, and we should trust people's ability to make their own choices."
1056	4033	2	2	As @CAPS1, we possess both the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press. Nevertheless, these rights are somewhat curbed in the media censorship at libraries. I can comprehend why libraries feel the need to ban certain works. Since numerous children frequently visit libraries, explicit content might discourage parents from allowing their children to go. However, the media in question could be placed in a separate area, restricted to those under a certain age. Even if someone obtains one of these works, safeguards can be implemented at the front - desk to prevent them from borrowing the material. The library card would display the borrower's age, and the staff would not permit a too - young person to check out the work. Moreover, I have faith in people's common sense. If they believe a book or movie is too adult for them, they will refrain from checking it out from the library. Parents, too, will surely not allow their children to borrow risqué material. Information is accessible to those who seek it, and the knowledge it imparts helps avoid unwanted outcomes. There are individuals who want this content banned because it does not align with their morals, but this actually restricts others' freedoms. One person @MONTH1 think it is too explicit, while another @MONTH1 not. The latter might wish to use the material, but due to the restrictions set by the former, borrowing the work becomes prohibited. It seems that if the first person disagrees with the material, they should simply leave it be and not involve others in the dispute. People are aware of their limits and generally ensure they do not cross them. I believe this conflict represents the @CAPS2 way of life itself. When a disagreement arises, regardless of the topic, one group of people wants to essentially control what others can or cannot do. They organize protests, sign petitions, etc. True, people do protest laws for valid reasons. However, there is truly no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people used common sense to reach a consensus. I think this censorship issue is a prime example of that. When it comes to such debates, we need to learn not to be too hasty in imposing restrictions; we should allow others to do what they think is best for themselves. The best course of action is to leave others alone regarding simple matters like this and avoid placing any restrictions on anyone's works, rights, and freedom. To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I @MONTH1 not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right to say it.
1057	4034	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, are offensive and inappropriate. The reason I hold this view is that these items contain content that can harm people in various ways. Those who create and read these materials often fail to recognize the impact they have on the consumers. I have personally encountered offensive and inappropriate books. Once, when I visited a public library, I picked up a @CAPS1 book, thinking it might be suitable for my book report. As I flipped through the pages, I was offended by the words and images. There were derogatory terms for people of color and pictures of black women being raped or abused. I was so outraged that I put the book back and was angry at those who disrespected my culture. A white librarian approached me and asked if I needed help, but I just looked at her and shook my head. As I walked around the library, I was shocked to see children looking at inappropriate books like '@CAPS2 books'. I believe these adult - oriented books, along with music that often contains references to @CAPS2, drugs, and gangs, should be placed elsewhere to prevent younger children from accessing them. Such content can have a negative impact on their future and may lead to violence, abuse, and harassment as they grow up. In my opinion, all public libraries should have a separate section for @CAPS1 - type materials, accessible only to adults who can prove their age with an ID. This way, we can protect the younger generation from being exposed to inappropriate content.
1058	4035	2	2	Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, censorship in libraries should never be a problem. It is a straightforward concept. Clearly, no parent wants their children to be exposed to inappropriate reading materials or movies. A library should be a family - friendly place where children can gather for story - time and college students can study. I recall frequently visiting the library as a child. I would read a different story every week with a group of kids in the community, and it was a wonderful experience. Don't you want your community library to be a place where children can learn and have fun? Unfortunately, some libraries do have offensive materials, including reading materials, movies, and music. It is the responsibility of library employees to place these offensive items in the adult reading section. Parents should inform their children that the adult section is off - limits, and library staff should ensure that children never enter this restricted area. These items @MONTH1 be offensive to some people and @MONTH1 be too inappropriate for children. However, there are readers who have the right to access these materials if they choose to. Therefore, these materials should not be removed from the shelves entirely but should be separated from the rest of the books, music, and movies. I am not one to deny anyone their rights. Although I personally do not see the need for offensive reading materials in a public library, it does not mean that others should be deprived of the opportunity to view them. In general, we must be fair. Would you want someone to take away your right to do something you enjoy just because they find it offensive? No one wants that. However, we also need to be reasonable. If there are going to be adult reading materials in a community library, they must be placed in an area where children are not allowed. It is just common courtesy, and everyone should cooperate. This is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue. I hope you can understand my perspective and help resolve this issue once and for all.
1059	4036	2	2	"We all have a favorite book, and mine is 'OF @CAPS1 and @CAPS2'. '@CAPS3' is a book I would recommend to anyone. However, there are some books in libraries that are so bad that I would be worried even if my mom just looked at the cover. My name is @PERSON1, and in this essay, I will explain what I mean. I love reading during the day. I enjoy going to the library, picking up a book from the shelf, and starting to read right away. But when I see books or magazines with sexual content, I get very angry. I have seen many of my friends get engrossed in such materials right in front of adults, like their mothers. Children as young as five can go to public libraries and be exposed to these terrible things. I don't understand why these books are even needed in libraries when people can buy or rent them online. I have a best friend whose father was deeply affected by sexual content and pictures. His mother had to kick his father out of the house. Now, my friend is starting to follow in his father's footsteps. He can buy these magazines from friends who steal or rent them from the local library. He doesn't even realize that he is doing the same thing his father did. He still refuses to see his father, but his actions are identical. I have had several conversations with my friend, but he says it's not hurting anyone. What he doesn't see is that it is hurting me. Back in the late @NUM1's and early @NUM2's, parents noticed the inappropriate books their children were reading and tried to stop it, but their plan didn't work. Since then, this problem has grown to an uncontrollable level. Libraries do this all for the money they make. More people go to libraries now not to study or read quietly but to get a ""sex high"". This is where about half of the libraries' income comes from. The government tries to stay out of it because the tax revenue comes from these activities. No one knows when this will stop, but we will do our best to put an end to it. The purpose of this essay is to show why this situation needs to be stopped. If you go to your local library and really look at what they offer, you will understand what I'm talking about. I will try to stop it, even though I may not succeed. But I won't stop helping my friends in the future. At least you are now aware of this problem."
1060	4037	2	2	Many people find certain books offensive. For example, if @CAPS5 is the Bible and you are an atheist or someone who doesn't believe in God, the Bible @MONTH1 be offensive and hurtful to you. As a student, I feel that if everyone were to remove books based on their own feelings, there would be nothing left to read. Everyone has different views, but books, magazines, and music are valuable resources that are often knowledgeable on many important subjects. First, let's talk about magazines. If we got rid of all the magazines in the world, there would be fewer of those awful advertisements that men are attracted to, and there would also be less gossip. Most magazines are filled with @PERCENT1 gossip about the break - ups and make - ups of modern celebrities. I think magazines are a waste of time because they can hurt people's feelings, and the behavior of some famous people depicted in them is offensive. I strongly believe we should remove magazines from the shelves. Next, there is music. Some of the greatest inspiration comes from music. Do you remember the song 'We @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3'? If not, let me tell you a bit about it. It's about America, past events that were significant. In the chorus, it says, '-we @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3, - but we tried to fight it. It's always been burning since the world's been turning.' This song is about Americans saying they @CAPS1't cause panic, but that such problems have existed since the beginning. It inspired many famous singers, like Elvis @CAPS6. We should keep music available so that those who have been inspired, like me, can inspire others. Music helps the blind, heals the sick, and gives hope to Americans. Without music, there would be chaos. Then, there are movies. Where would we be without movies? We need movies not only for entertainment but also because many of the best movies are based on historical events. These movies help us better understand the past. For example, movies like @CAPS7, and @LOCATION1, and The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, are both enjoyable and educational. We should definitely keep movies. In conclusion, I hope I have clearly conveyed a message that you will seriously consider. We need books and music to inspire and energize the world, but we do not need magazines. We all need a little inspiration and education in our lives. I hope I have had a positive impact on your thoughts and feelings.
1061	4038	2	2	In today's world, it's impossible for everyone to share a single opinion on a particular topic. When a person recognizes injustice, they feel compelled to voice their thoughts; otherwise, they may believe their opinions hold no value. Take women's clothing as an example. A man shown a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen will likely have only one or two opinions, while a woman will have multiple views. This is how society functions, shaped not just by upbringing but also by our thought processes and actions.  @ORGANIZATION1 portrays beauty as being half - dressed and heavily made - up. Many magazines like @CAPS1 and modeling books depict beauty as being extremely thin with clothes barely on the body. Songs and movies often emphasize external beauty. These materials are readily available in local bookstores, and it's likely they can also be found in local @CAPS2 libraries.  Libraries are for people of all ages, and many have dedicated sections for teenagers. However, young adult books and magazines should not be placed in these sections because they often contain topics that many teenagers haven't even started discussing. A five - year - old child could wander into this section, pick up a magazine, and wonder how the women in the advertisements became so beautiful. It's important to note that @ORGANIZATION1's depictions are often photo - shopped.  If a five - year - old can access inappropriate books and magazines, it's questionable why libraries keep them on the shelves. The child may start to think, '@CAPS3 am I not that beautiful?' In today's society, @CAPS4 image is a significant factor in how people are perceived. Modeling agencies, photographers, and cheerleading coaches make girls feel worthless if they don't meet certain physical standards. Many @CAPS8 women starve themselves to maintain a 'healthy weight' of @NUM1 pounds, where every rib is visible.  Books, magazines, and TV shows across the nation also promote such ideals. @CAPS1 magazine has articles on how to become skinny, and @LOCATION1's @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 TV show suggests that being tall and stick - thin is the ideal. Workout books claim that being like @PERSON1 is the 'best for your body' way. But it's unrealistic to tell a woman she must reach a specific height and weight by a certain time.  I firmly believe that if libraries removed these materials, the prevalence of the '@CAPS4 image' in society would decline rapidly. Women and girls would stop feeling ugly or fat and learn to love themselves, disregarding others' negative comments. Beauty is not just skin - deep; a beautiful heart shines brighter than anything else.
1062	4039	2	2	Have you ever been to a library and noticed a book that was too graphic for a particular section? When young children visit the library, it seems obvious they should stay away from such sections. In today's world, libraries need censorship. Many children are exposed to inappropriate material at a very young age, which can give them bad ideas and lead them astray.  Libraries have numerous books that are too mature for young children. There should be a restricted section where only people of a certain age or those with parental guidance can access books, movies, music, games, and magazines. Just like video stores have an adult section that children can't enter, libraries should implement a similar system, although with different content.  Personally, I've witnessed children picking up bad behaviors from video games, movies, and some books. Young children don't know what's bad for them. When they see movie stars they admire or play violent video games, they may imitate the violence.  Libraries should either remove these inappropriate materials from the shelves or create a section that children can't access. When taking a young child to the library, accompany them. This will protect the next generation of kids from the violence and other bad habits found in books, games, magazines, and music.  As long as there's no censorship in libraries, children will see these behaviors and think they're acceptable. Once again, I emphasize that libraries should implement censorship for materials intended for certain age groups or that are offensive. Don't let young kids wander alone in libraries to avoid their exposure to inappropriate material.
1063	4040	2	2	Books have been an integral part of human culture for centuries, holding significant value in our lives. We often see kids enjoying books about ponies and puppies, but we rarely consider how books and magazines can impact people of different races, religions, or ages. It's time we take action and remove negative books from circulation.  Negative books, movies, and magazines should be taken off the shelves to prevent hurt feelings and harmful ideas. I recall an incident in @NUM1 grade when a girl named @PERSON1 was deeply upset because a book excluded an African - American girl, implying she wasn't pretty enough. The teacher threw the book away and taught us to respect everyone regardless of their appearance. We need more books that promote positive self - esteem and respect for others. As the world changes, so should our books.  Books that speak negatively about other religions or make people question their faith are harmful and should be removed. How would you feel if someone belittled your religion? That's how many people feel when reading such materials. These books, magazines, and movies have no place in libraries.  Parents should pay attention to what their children are reading and watching. While many children's books and movies feature princesses and mermaids, some contain violence and inappropriate scenes. When children see fight scenes and zombies attacking, they may believe it's okay to kill or hurt others. Boys may think it's acceptable to be violent, and girls may strive for an unattainable standard of perfection.  Not all books are bad, but we need to carefully evaluate which ones should remain on the shelves. Books that cause people to have negative thoughts about themselves should be permanently removed. Eliminating these conflict - causing books can significantly improve the well - being of both adults and children. Please help by removing negative books and movies from library shelves to prevent unnecessary problems.
1064	4041	2	2	When you're in a library, there are many books that may not be suitable for children. Some parents allow their kids to read such books, but in my opinion, some books are simply not appropriate for children.  These days, kids are more mature and can read at higher levels. When they go to the library, they look for attention - grabbing books. Unfortunately, many authors write about topics like sex, drugs, and other bad things. When a child reads about these things, they may get ideas and try what they've read. I'm not saying all kids will act on what they read, but most will be influenced to some extent.  Kids often mimic what they hear, see, and read. They look up to others and will try to imitate their actions. I believe that books that are inappropriate for children should be put away. They should be removed from the shelves and placed in areas accessible only to adults, similar to how video games are restricted to certain age groups.  We should also rate books, just like we rate movies and video games. Not all books are bad for children, but some clearly are. I've noticed that many parents only care that their kids are reading, without considering the content. This is a mistake because there are many cruel people in the world. I even saw a news story about an author who wrote a book about killing a woman. Many teens found it interesting, and it gave some young boys ideas about violence. Such books should only be in the hands of mature individuals who can distinguish right from wrong.  Many parents find it offensive that bookstores sell inappropriate books to children. The content in some books is simply not suitable for anyone to read. Books that are inappropriate for certain age groups or contain inappropriate content should be removed from the shelves. However, different people may interpret and view the content differently. There are many books that parents and grandparents hope their kids never pick up. But this situation will continue unless someone takes a stand.
1065	4042	2	2	I firmly believe that offensive reading material should be supervised to control who can access it. Parents have the right to monitor what their children read, and sometimes, censorship is a necessary measure.  Books are not the biggest concern for our youth compared to other media. Today's youth are more likely to pick up a magazine, use a cell phone, iPod, or a computer than read a book. In my opinion, magazines are more harmful than books. Books are mainly read for knowledge, while magazines are often read to keep up with the latest trends. Magazines can lead people to follow the latest music trends, including listening to new bands, singers, or rappers.  Radio music is filled with suggestive lyrics that can draw people in. Unlike movies, music doesn't have ratings, making it harder to control. Although movies have ratings, children can still access them.  The internet is another significant factor. Most people have access to a computer, and children can spend hours online looking at inappropriate content. While the internet is also used for education, it also provides access to video games. Children can now play games with friends worldwide or with strangers from their bedrooms. Some players may be a bad influence, as they themselves have been influenced by negative media such as music and magazines.  It's impossible to completely control what our youth are exposed to. The only extreme solution would be to close libraries and shut down the internet, but even then, there may still be ways for them to access inappropriate content. However, we should still make efforts to limit their exposure to harmful media.
1066	4043	2	2	In a large library filled with numerous books and movies, a single one does not have a significant impact. Therefore, books, magazines, and movies should not be removed from library shelves. Some parents of children do not strictly monitor what their kids read or listen to, as long as the children follow their instructions. Additionally, some parents may overestimate their children's ability to select appropriate books.   However, if you are a parent who is concerned about what your children read or listen to and realize that not all kids understand your preferences, you should talk to the school principal. Explore the possibility of creating a specific area in the library for books with inappropriate language or sexual content. Alternatively, you could propose a permission - slip system where students need to get their parents' approval for such books.   There are also kids who enjoy reading these types of books. They would be disappointed if their favorite books were removed from the shelves while other students could still access their preferred reading materials.   If someone claims that a book is negatively changing their life, it is important to note that the kids choose to read the book in the first place. So, any life - changing effects are self - inflicted.   In conclusion, books should not be removed from library shelves because some people like them. For kids or parents who do not want these books, the librarian can mark them as unavailable for checkout.
1067	4044	2	2	Author Katherine Paterson once remarked, 'All of us can think of a book we hope no children will have removed from the shelf. But if I have the right to remove a book I detest, then everyone else has the same right, and eventually, there will be no books left for anyone.' While many in society share Katherine's view, some advocate for strict library censorship.   It is crucial not to violate others' rights, suppress freedom of speech, or limit knowledge. Thus, I support her stance. If materials are considered inappropriate for children or others, parents should implement censorship at home, not public institutions.   America was founded on the principles of freedom, including freedom of speech, religion, and the press. Limiting library resources undermines the nation's core values. Once we start removing 'offensive' books, it becomes difficult to determine where to stop, as anyone can claim a book is offensive.   History provides a cautionary example. In @LOCATION1, personal freedom was severely restricted, starting with the seemingly minor act of book censorship. First, it was considered improper to possess books by @CAPS1, @CAPS2 - @CAPS3, or @CAPS4 authors. Later, these books were burned, and people were punished for owning them.   In a country where individuals should have their rights, library book censorship is unacceptable. This seemingly harmless act can have far - reaching consequences.   Families have diverse values. Some parents are very protective of what their children read, while others allow more freedom. If parents find certain materials inappropriate for their children, they should handle censorship at home through discussions and teaching responsibility.   In conclusion, we should uphold freedom of the press and public access. We cannot clearly define 'offensive' and 'okay,' so we should not impose our opinions on public institutions. Instead, censorship should occur at home.
1068	4045	2	2	Most people perceive libraries as harmless places. However, it is common to find offensive books and magazines on library shelves. A child looking for a book should not pick up a @CAPS1 novel with a nude lady on the cover. I firmly believe that libraries need to implement some form of censorship, not only for their shelves but also for computers and movies.   Libraries are places for mental exploration through reading. No one wants to encounter offensive images while searching for a favorite book. I have seen offensive content such as nudity, cursing, and references to drugs in libraries. It is inappropriate to have an article about alcohol next to a kids' magazine. This sends the wrong message to children.   An organization should be established to assist with library censorship. Since the media controls the internet and many magazines, these should be carefully managed in libraries.   Libraries are reading havens for children, friends, and family. We do not want children to get the wrong ideas from books. Censorship in libraries is necessary and should be implemented soon. I am not suggesting discarding all previously purchased books. While offensive content is everywhere, we should keep it out of libraries.   In conclusion, libraries should have censorship to ensure a positive and appropriate reading environment for all.
1069	4046	2	2	Do you want your children to be exposed to bad images? Should everyone be able to read or watch anything they desire? I firmly believe that in most cases, offensive materials should be removed from libraries. Such materials are harmful to children, offensive to people, and give libraries a bad reputation.   Firstly, children should never be exposed to explicit material. This can have a negative impact on their development. For example, if a child sees a pornographic magazine, they may think it is acceptable. Parents generally do not want their children to be exposed to such content. I have personal experience of being terrified by a horror movie from the library as a child, and the images haunted me for a long time. Children do not deserve to experience such long - lasting fear.   Secondly, some library materials, such as music with explicit lyrics, offend people. We do not want our youth to be exposed to the vulgar language in some rap songs. This type of music also offends many adults. I have observed that children who listen to rap at a young age are more likely to have a less successful future.   Thirdly, certain magazines in libraries contain offensive images, like blood, which can be disturbing to people. Banning offensive materials from libraries would solve one more problem in our society. I have been offended by magazine pictures in the past, and I would not let my future children access such library sections.   Finally, libraries that carry offensive materials can develop a bad reputation. Employees may prefer to work at libraries without such content, and parents concerned about their children's development will think twice before visiting uncensored libraries. I read that libraries with offensive materials attract fewer customers. If I were a library manager, I would immediately remove potentially offensive items.   In conclusion, I strongly support censorship in public and private libraries. Inappropriate materials can destroy a library's good reputation and have a negative impact on minors. I hope to see an increase in library censorship, which will bring about positive changes.
1070	4047	2	2	As Katherine Paterson's quote suggests, everyone has the right to remove books, movies, magazines, and other items they consider offensive or inappropriate from library shelves. However, this should be an individual decision, not a collective effort by parents to achieve their desired censorship.   In today's society, much more is regarded as offensive or inappropriate compared to previous generations. When parents read certain materials now, they find them inappropriate, even though they may have considered them acceptable during their teenage years. In the current technological age, kids can access almost anything if they know how.   If parents start censoring items, it can create an incentive for kids to read or listen to the restricted content just to disobey their parents. This can also lead to an unconventional or unintended form of education. By censoring, parents give their children reasons to go against their wishes and access the restricted materials anyway.   Ultimately, parents should not censor what their kids read, listen to, or see because children will eventually be exposed to such content. The question is, do you want that to happen under circumstances where they are more likely to rebel against your wishes? In conclusion, it is better for parents to have an open - minded approach rather than strict censorship.
1071	4048	2	2	The issue of library censoring has been on the rise in recent years. It has been widely discussed, yet no decision has been reached. In my view, there should be no library censoring. If libraries were censored as they currently are, I would not have developed my love for reading. I firmly believe that libraries should not be subject to censorship as it would violate our basic rights, such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to a free press. Without these rights, we would no longer live in a free country but rather a totalitarian state. However, implementing age restrictions on certain materials could satisfy the debaters. I think many would agree to this proposal. By doing so, children would only have access to materials appropriate for their age. Ultimately, it is the parents' responsibility to censor what their children read and listen to, not the libraries. Parents are the ones who introduce children to music, magazines, and books. If parents started censoring these materials from an early age, this debate would not be ongoing. As @PERSON1 said, 'if we have the right to censor libraries, then there will be no more books for any of us.' In conclusion, library censoring is not the best approach, and alternative solutions like age - restricted access should be considered.
1072	4049	2	2	I firmly hold the belief that books, music, movies, magazines, and other such items should not be removed from libraries. Firstly, books are invaluable learning resources for people of all ages. Just because a book mentions certain historical events like the @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 dying, which might seem inappropriate for some age groups, it is still suitable for teenagers and adults. Books also offer insights into the past. For instance, a book about slavery and the derogatory terms used for black @CAPS9 back then can educate people about history, preventing them from using offensive language unknowingly. Secondly, movies, although some are not suitable for certain age groups, can be highly educational. Films like @CAPS2 and To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4 @CAPS5 teach us about our @ORGANIZATION1 and the progress we've made in overcoming racial segregation. Movies provide a visual representation of the past, allowing us to better understand historical events and relate them to the corresponding books. Moreover, movies can convey important messages, such as the consequences of pollution. Music is also an important aspect of @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1. While some music may have negative elements, many artists use it to express the hardships they've faced and as an escape. We can learn about the evolution of music over time, from the @DATE1 to the present. Music has the power to communicate messages in a unique way. For example, a message conveyed through a song by a favorite artist is more likely to be well - received and understood by the audience. Lastly, magazines. Some magazines may be inappropriate, but these are unlikely to be found in libraries. Magazines like @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11 are mainly for entertainment and do not cause any harm. They can keep people informed about current events and new discoveries. In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should remain on library shelves as they offer diverse learning and entertainment opportunities for people of all ages.
1073	4050	2	2	"Certain items on the shelves in bookstores and other places can be highly offensive. In my opinion, the use of cuss words in music and sexual content can be offensive to women. I choose not to listen to such music because I believe it has no place in music and books. I envision a future where a woman will lead the @CAPS1.S.A. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this. Women have the same rights as @CAPS2. It is completely wrong for some people to view women as mere slaves. Women and @CAPS2 are equal, regardless of what others may say. Katherine Paterson has a valid point. It would be ideal if the law allowed people to remove offensive items from the shelves. However, some people only care about themselves and act however they please to feel superior. There are also kids who, when looking through magazines with inappropriate content, may think the people in them are cool and learn bad behavior from them. This is why I think offensive items should be removed from the shelves. One day, I was in @CAPS4 - mart and saw a magazine with a movie star and her three kids on the cover. The title was ""superstar"". It was disheartening to see the kids on the cover, as they may not have the same wealth and success as their parents in the future. In today's world, it may seem foolish that some people care so much about material things like money, what they wear, and the cars they drive. Throughout my life, I've thought about this issue. When I see someone driving a new car worth @MONEY1, it makes me wonder how they can afford it. In conclusion, we should take steps to remove offensive items from public spaces to protect the well - being of children and promote a more positive environment."
1074	4051	2	2	Libraries are not just repositories of books. They also house music, movies, magazines, and more. The materials in libraries are intended for people of all ages, although not everyone approves of all the content. In my town, the library has separate areas for children, teens, adults, and @CAPS1 - rated materials. Not everyone agrees on what should be allowed in a public space. Libraries strive to provide a wide range of materials to meet different interests, even if some of the choices deviate from public expectations. When I visit the library, I wouldn't mind seeing @CAPS1 - rated materials. I believe everyone should have the freedom to access the content they want. However, creating areas that are off - limits to children is a good way to ensure that people can get what they want without exposing younger audiences. This would make parents and children more comfortable with what they encounter at the library. To address this issue, building separate rooms for different age groups would be a good solution, even though it may be costly or difficult for library owners. If young children are exposed to violence, drugs, and sexual content, they may think such behavior is acceptable. Parents often try to keep their children away from these areas but don't always succeed. Therefore, creating age - specific rooms is the right thing to do. Although we have different opinions on what should or should not be seen in public, we can't eliminate such content. We can, however, try to restrict access to those who want to see it. It may cost more money, but if we consider our own childhood and the well - being of future generations, we should make the better choice. In conclusion, building age - specific rooms in libraries is a practical and necessary step.
1075	4052	2	2	As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I think we can all relate to this. We've all read something that we didn't want to finish or wish we hadn't read. However, I believe that these materials should not be removed from the shelves and made inaccessible to the youth or adults. When we take away learning materials, we deprive people of the opportunity to learn. Take the popular internet video clip '@CAPS1 guys one hammer' as an example. It's a gruesome and horrific video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver. I've never seen it, and based on what my friends said, I don't want to. It sounds like a video that would be extremely scarring. But it serves as a perfect example because what some people don't want to learn from, others can. My friends who watched the video learned that one should strive to be successful in life, as being homeless could potentially lead to such a tragic fate. Hearing about this sad video has inspired me to be a successful person and avoid homelessness. If someone had banned the video from the internet, my friends wouldn't have seen it or told me about it. As a result, I wouldn't have been motivated to be a good student and a good person. In the long run, I might have ended up homeless and at risk of being in a similar situation. In conclusion, we should not interfere with people's right to learn. We should not remove materials just because we think they are bad, as one person's pain can be another person's learning tool. If we censor all the materials we find inappropriate, we will be left with very few learning resources, just as Katherine Paterson said, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
1076	4053	2	2	As a teenager, I believe offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from local libraries. A library is a place for relaxation and learning. However, many books and movies are filled with sex, gang violence, and drugs. In our generation, these issues are prevalent everywhere. Books are meant for learning, and offensive materials can set bad habits for younger children.  Sex, gang violence, and drugs are common topics in magazines. Children should not be exposed to such offensive content. Magazines should offer new knowledge. Similarly, books are useful for research and school projects, but it can be difficult to find relevant information due to the presence of unwanted topics. As a teenager, I often come across books about sex or gang violence.  If younger children continue to read about bad topics, it can lead to bad habits such as killing, smoking, and pregnancy. Parents should guide their children. Therefore, offensive books, movies, and magazines should be removed from local libraries. Libraries should only provide materials that allow people to learn.
1077	4054	2	2	The other day, I read an interesting quote in @CAPS1 by author Katherine Paterson. The quote stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - the work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  I firmly believe that people should not have the right to remove materials like books, music, movies, and magazines from library shelves or any place where they are displayed. I wholeheartedly agree with Paterson because everyone has their own opinions. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. People are different, and so are their thoughts.  If someone finds a book, song, movie, or magazine offensive, they should simply put it back, as another person might find it interesting. I am interested in knowing what my fellow citizens think about Paterson's statement. I would appreciate it if you could share the quote in @CAPS1 and gather people's opinions. Thank you for considering my request.
1078	4055	2	2	Many of us have experienced the situation where we are deeply engrossed in a book or magazine, only to suddenly encounter vulgar language, inappropriate pictures, or unsuitable activities. We may wonder why the author included such content and why the back of the book did not warn us. Such offensive materials can even make some people lose interest in the author or the library.  Certain materials in libraries should be removed. Firstly, they are not suitable for children and young teenagers. For example, a child may pick up a book based on its cover, moral, or critic reviews without reading the summary. If the book contains vulgar language and illegal activities, parents will likely be upset.  Secondly, books and materials with offensive content can be placed in bookstores instead of public libraries. This way, parents can be more at ease with their children reading at the library. Adults and older teenagers can still access such materials, but they will have to visit a bookstore. Although they won't be able to check out items for free, it will be safer for younger readers.  Thirdly, libraries should be required to indicate on the back of books, magazines, movies, etc., if they contain offensive content. This will allow readers to make an informed decision.  Removing certain materials from library shelves will create a more civilized environment. People won't have to worry about accidentally encountering offensive content. Libraries will have safe materials for all ages, while bookstores can offer offensive materials. It's a win - win situation.
1079	4056	2	2	Should offensive books be removed from library shelves? Many people believe that it would be beneficial for children if they were not exposed to certain materials. However, I firmly believe that we have no right to remove books based on their content.  If I find a book offensive, I should simply choose not to read it. Just because a book offends me does not mean it will offend others. Every book has an impact on someone, either positive or negative. We cannot allow everyone to remove the books they find offensive, as there would be no books left.  I recall a second - grade incident when a classmate's mother complained about the teacher playing gospel music. At the time, I didn't understand why. Now, I realize it was because the parent disagreed with the song's lyrics. As a result, the teacher stopped playing music in class.  As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone has the right to remove the books they abhor, there will be no books left for anyone. In conclusion, I strongly believe that books, whether they offend someone or not, should remain on the shelves. Removing them would achieve nothing.
1080	4057	2	2	I firmly believe that offensive materials should be kept on library shelves. People have diverse opinions about offensive materials. Some think they should not be in libraries for children to access, while others believe they can be helpful. Offensive materials can be seen as negative, but they can also make movies more enjoyable.  Offensive materials can be valuable for high - school students' research projects. By researching offensive materials, students can learn about their origin, why people are offensive, and gain more knowledge than they previously had. Keeping offensive materials in libraries educates people not to be offensive.  Libraries offer a wide range of books, including those on offensive materials from different eras. If someone wants to research offensive materials from the past, the library can provide generations of relevant books. This helps us understand what offensive materials were like in the old days.  Many people visit libraries to learn more about what they are interested in, and some are eager to learn about offensive materials. Learning about offensive materials is a personal choice, and people should be able to learn whatever they want. If libraries remove offensive materials, it's like taking away a good book from readers.  In conclusion, offensive materials in libraries allow people to learn, understand the past, and make their own choices. Therefore, they should remain on the shelves.
1081	4058	2	2	To whom it may concern: Is it justifiable for you to remove books simply because someone might find them offensive? Do you believe that racism is an inherent part of literature? Currently, libraries are contemplating the removal of various items such as books, music, movies, and magazines from their collections for the purpose of censorship. They assume that certain individuals might take offense to the beliefs presented in the diverse forms of entertainment available in the library. However, these forms of entertainment should not be permitted to be removed from either public or private libraries.  In numerous libraries, the inventory is being stripped due to censorship. This implies that books, magazines, movies, and music are being taken away because some individuals might find them offensive. People may disagree with certain beliefs related to their lifestyle and personal convictions.  Literature can be regarded as an art form that individuals interpret in their own unique ways. It has existed since the dawn of human writing and has witnessed wars, politics, art, and slavery. All these aspects are integral to literature, making it a form of history in itself.  Some advocate for the removal of offensive material from libraries, even suggesting its complete eradication. This is a misguided approach as such material is a part of history. Can you really justify erasing an era of history just because it offends you? I certainly cannot. It provides valuable insights into what was happening at a particular time, in a specific part of the world, and reflects the opinions of people during that period. While many of us recognize that racism is wrong, we must also acknowledge that there were those who once believed it to be right. They might have held the view that white skin was superior to dark skin, but we should respect their beliefs as long as they respect ours.  Literature plays a crucial role in society and its functioning. Without it, we would not be where we are today. It belongs on the shelves of libraries, and we should respect the personal opinions expressed within books. Do you really want to be remembered for destroying an important part of history? In conclusion, let us preserve literature in libraries and embrace the diversity of ideas it represents.
1082	4059	2	2	People hold a wide range of views and opinions on various matters, and no opinion is inherently right or wrong. Controversial books, music, and movies should not be removed from shelves because not everyone finds them offensive, individuals have the right to access them, and one person cannot make decisions for everyone.  Everyone is entitled to their own views, but they cannot force others to see things their way. For instance, if someone visits a library and believes the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series is offensive, they may be the only one with that opinion. They cannot tell the library to remove these books just because they are uncomfortable. In a democratic sense, decisions should be based on the majority, and this individual is clearly in the minority.  People have the right to view or listen to legal content of their choice. If someone finds a particular type of music offensive, they cannot demand that the store remove it. One person's preferences should not dictate what is available to everyone else. Removing such music would make many people unhappy. Instead, the offended person can simply choose not to listen to it, as there is a vast selection of other music available.  One person cannot make decisions for the entire population. Even the president does not make decisions alone but relies on the government. If an individual believes a magazine is inappropriate, they do not have the authority to change it. Others may enjoy reading it, and it is not within the power of a single person to restrict access.  In my view, while everyone is entitled to their opinions, they should not impose them on others. People often try to control access to books, music, movies, and magazines because they are uncomfortable with the content. However, some material may be inappropriate or offensive to some, but one person cannot change it. Not everyone will find it offensive, and people have the right to choose what they view, watch, or listen to. One person cannot make decisions for everyone. We should respect the diversity of opinions and ensure that individuals have the freedom to access a wide range of content.
1083	4060	2	2	Should works deemed 'inappropriate' or 'offensive' be removed from store shelves and made unavailable for sale or viewing? If you think so, then do you also believe that campaigners running for @CAPS1 should be restricted from expressing their thoughts on different topics? When someone writes an article or a book and has it published for distribution in stores or libraries, it is similar to a campaigner presenting their views to the public.  When an author writes a book, they typically have a deep interest in the topic. Similarly, @CAPS2 campaigners introduce themselves to the public, declare their political party, and share their beliefs. If it is acceptable to remove a book or magazine from the shelves because people consider it 'inappropriate,' perhaps we should re - evaluate what campaigners can say during live @CAPS3.  Even in a store, if there are nude magazines or CDs with explicit lyrics, the question arises whether they should be removed. There are appropriate times and places for such content. For example, in a children's store, displaying such items can have a negative impact on kids. Children have a strong memory, and exposure to inappropriate content like a story about bank robbery, or a song about drinking or drug use can lead them to try things that we would not want them to.  When an author spends months or years writing a story, they hope to get it published and rewarded for their hard work. Whether it is music, movies, or books, the intention is to make the work available to the public. All forms of creative expression should be on display so that people can explore the diverse range of music and stories.  If items are removed from shelves or not displayed, people may stop creating music, making movies, or writing books and ads. This would result in a lack of new knowledge and information. For example, if there are no science books or biographies, people will not learn about new things. Artists and creators expect their work to be accessible to the public. If their work is removed due to claims of 'inappropriateness,' they may lose the motivation to create.  In conclusion, those who spend a significant amount of time and effort creating works should be rewarded and allowed to sell their items. If someone believes an item is 'inappropriate,' they should keep their comments to themselves and not have the item removed from display. There are people who enjoy non - 'appropriate' content, and the creators clearly thought their work was good enough to be published. We should not deprive others of the opportunity to access and enjoy different forms of creative expression.
1084	4061	2	2	Imagine being told that you cannot wear a yellow shirt because it is offensive, or that you cannot look a certain way lest you offend someone. No single person or group has the right to determine what is suitable for everyone. With the multitude of religions and traditions across the @LOCATION2, it is absurd to set a single standard. If @CAPS1 are not restricted in their choices of apparel, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limitations in libraries? Libraries should remain uncensored, as censorship would not only limit their resources and knowledge dissemination but also pose a threat to our future.  When visiting a library, one expects to find a wide range of books, magazines, and movies. However, censorship can frustrate this expectation. Suppose you are interested in a book about the assassination of @PERSON1 and ask the librarian for it. If she replies that the library does not carry such books because they are too vulgar for young children, you will be disappointed. This kind of restriction limits the library's resources and can be very troubling for patrons.  Censorship in libraries not only reduces the available content but also hampers learning in the @LOCATION2. How can people stay informed if they are shielded from knowledge? Many individuals who do not have access to computers rely on libraries. If the library fails to provide the content they need, where will they go? Libraries would lose business and funding if they do not meet the demands of their users. People will take their business elsewhere, and protests may break out. Rebellious citizens may oppose the censorship, causing unrest in society.  The problem is not limited to the public's reaction. Censorship itself can easily get out of control. @CAPS1 are already subject to censorship in news stations, radio, and TV shows. Libraries are a haven of infinite knowledge, where people can freely choose what they learn without being forced by teachers or parents. What may start as a small - scale intervention in libraries could have far - reaching consequences. It could lead to a situation where our decisions are influenced only by the limited content approved by a select few. This would result in the loss of individuality and the suppression of diverse opinions.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable. It would lead to a decline in knowledge in the @LOCATION2, erode the respect for libraries, and threaten the future of @LOCATION1. Just as no one can tell us what to wear or say, no one should dictate what we read. We have earned our freedoms through the efforts of our @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and we must not let censorship take them away. Let us preserve the free access to knowledge in libraries.
1085	4062	2	2	On @DATE2, @DATE1, @PERSON1 poses an important question: Should we have the freedom to read any book, listen to any music, and watch any movie we want? In some libraries, this may not be the case as some people find certain books, music, and movies offensive and unfit for public libraries.  In my opinion, public libraries should not censor books. For books with more adult content, libraries should establish an adult section. This way, the library can accommodate different types of books while ensuring that younger readers are not exposed to inappropriate material. The decision of whether a book is suitable should ultimately rest with the person checking it out.  Regarding music in libraries, censorship is unnecessary. Although some lyrics may be inappropriate, many teenagers listen to such music. However, younger children should not be allowed to check out adult - oriented music. I believe that a minimum age of thirteen should be set for accessing such music. Children under thirteen should require parental consent to check out music. This is necessary because some parents may not be aware of what their children borrow from the library.  As for movies, some offensive ones should definitely be removed or placed in the adult section. Public libraries are not the place to expect movies with highly adult content. While movie rental stores may have such offerings, libraries should focus on providing appropriate and educational movies for children.  Katherine Paterson's statement, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf,' is very apt. I would not want @CAPS1 little cousin to read books with racial comments or inappropriate content. Even if a child does not fully understand the content, it can lead to awkward questions for parents and may give the child the wrong ideas.  In conclusion, in public libraries, books should generally remain uncensored, music should be accessible with age - appropriate restrictions, and movies should be carefully selected to ensure they are suitable for the library environment. The issue of what to allow children to read, watch, and listen to is a long - standing debate in many libraries. I hope that by sharing my opinion, others will also recognize the importance of this topic and make more informed decisions about library content.
1086	4063	2	2	Freedom of speech is a crucial aspect in @LOCATION1, which has contributed to the country's prosperity over the years. The constitution guarantees freedom of the press, meaning that if written material offends some individuals, they must accept it. While some may claim certain material is offensive, and it sometimes is, I believe that books, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves due to the sensitivities of others.  Over time in @LOCATION1, media and books have become more inclusive. Although the rights have always existed, they were not fully exercised. There have been instances of book - burnings, book bans, and even people being killed for their writings. This continued for many years until @LOCATION1 adopted a more open - minded perspective. However, such issues still persist, and I find this quite narrow - minded.  In some cases, people have wrongly blamed books unrelated to a murder for the crime. I do acknowledge that there should be limits on the distribution of certain books and magazines. For example, books about death, poverty, or sex should not be sold at public schools.  We all have different reading and writing preferences. We should not have our choices restricted because someone deems something too offensive. If you don't like a book, simply put it down and let someone who will read it pick it up.  From my personal experience, I've seen bad people do bad things and try to blame it on a book, story, or @CAPS1 show. This is just an easy way out. I've encountered intense content in my life, but it has not made me want to do bad things.  I know I can't speak for everyone, but books, magazines, etc., are not inherently harmful. Reading can be a learning experience, and people can gain knowledge and awareness from it. Just because you read about something doesn't mean you support it; it could mean you want to understand it better. Reading is scientifically proven to make you smarter in the long run. In conclusion, we should respect the freedom of speech and the diversity of reading materials, while also implementing reasonable distribution limits.
1087	4064	2	2	Nowadays, children can find all kinds of reading materials on library shelves. Some are age - appropriate, but there are also inappropriate magazines, books, and movies. The question is, should we remove these inappropriate items, and how can we prevent kids from seeing them?  Children are naturally curious and will ask many questions. When they see inappropriate items on library shelves, we need to take action. Instead of getting rid of these items, libraries should implement a rating system for books and magazines, similar to the rating system for movies. This way, everyone can check out materials suitable for their age.  If someone wants to borrow something not suitable for kids, they can show the librarian their @CAPS1. Libraries could also create a separate section for the most inappropriate items, which kids cannot enter. Additionally, parents should monitor their children to ensure they don't access inappropriate materials.  The only form of censorship in libraries should be rating items by maturity level. We can label what children can and cannot check out, and parents should be vigilant about what their children are trying to read. In conclusion, this combination of rating systems and parental supervision is the most practical approach to ensure children are protected from inappropriate content in libraries.
1088	4065	2	2	Many libraries house a wide variety of materials, including books, magazines, music, and movies. Some of these materials are inappropriate for children. Currently, many libraries separate adult and children's sections, often with an upstairs for adults and a downstairs for kids, and there are toys for kids downstairs so they can play while their parents are upstairs.  However, I believe there should be separate libraries for children and adults. Moreover, all inappropriate materials should be removed from library shelves. What if a child goes with their parent and opens a book to find something highly inappropriate? These materials should be taken off library shelves, and if someone wants to purchase them, they can do so online or at a store.  The owners and staff of libraries should remove all inappropriate magazines, music, books, etc. It is unacceptable to have such materials in a public place. Public libraries must take all inappropriate items off the shelves. In conclusion, creating separate libraries and removing inappropriate materials is the best way to ensure a suitable environment for all library users.
1089	4066	2	2	Libraries contain books, magazines, movies, etc. They are generally great places to read quietly, but they can also be offensive to some people. Some may complain about this, but the question is, should all offensive materials be removed from library shelves, and whose opinion matters?  If I find an offensive book, movie, or magazine on a library shelf, I would simply leave it. Clearly, it's not considered too bad, or it wouldn't be on the shelf. If it offends me, I won't look at or pick it up. A library is a place with a wide range of materials to suit different people's interests, so libraries have the right to stock what they want, even if it offends some.  In my library experiences, I've rarely come across offensive materials. However, I have seen books where the author makes fun of @CAPS1 people and others that contain racist content about black people.  It can be unfair for people with children if an inappropriate book is on the shelf and the children see it. But just because some people find materials offensive doesn't mean they should be removed. Everyone has different sensitivities. If you don't like a book, you can share it with a friend, return it to the library, or talk to the library manager about your concerns.  In conclusion, books, movies, magazines, etc., in libraries can be offensive or not. If you find them offensive, simply avoid them. We should respect the diversity of materials in libraries while also being aware of the potential impact on different users.
1090	4067	2	2	If we remove all the books we think shouldn't be on the shelves, there won't be much left to read. Many books have rich details that give us a vivid picture of what we're reading. Even seemingly harmless books can sometimes have unexpected content. Instead of removing books that others love to read, we should rate books like we do movies and music, or place the offensive ones in a separate area.  If books were rated like movies, we would know exactly what we're buying or checking out. Movies are rated based on language and content, and books should follow the same principle. If someone finds a book or magazine offensive, it should be placed in a different location with a label indicating its potentially offensive nature.  Books that are too offensive should be placed on their own bookshelves. By doing this, people will know not to let their children near them, as they are labeled. Similar to rated '@CAPS1' movies, where minors need to be with an adult, with books, at the age of @NUM1, individuals should be able to make their own choices.  In my opinion, this is a great idea that should be implemented. There are many books that are not suitable for young children, but kids love to read and could easily pick up an inappropriate book. Many parents are concerned about what their children read, watch, or listen to. Labeling books would help parents control what their children are exposed to.  In conclusion, instead of discarding offensive books, music, movies, etc., we should label them. This way, we can ensure that children don't access inappropriate materials while still respecting the diverse reading preferences of others.
1091	4068	2	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I recently read a quote by the great author Katherine Paterson regarding her views on the type of material used in books. Some @CAPS1 may be offended by certain language in books, while others find the pictures inappropriate. In my opinion, if one is uncomfortable with the material in a book, they should simply choose another.  Many authors view a book as a platform to express their thoughts and beliefs about worldly events. They should not be denied the opportunity to write just because of their way of expression. @CAPS1 should not be allowed to voice hateful opinions just because they disliked a book, as no one is forcing them to read it.  I'm not an avid reader; in fact, I rarely read. But when I do, I'm sometimes eager to continue. The way authors describe things, even with occasional profanity, is remarkable. One can truly feel part of the book.  To many @CAPS1, a book may seem horrible, but to others, it could be the best in the world. If we start removing books from the shelves, we'll end up with empty shelves. There's no such thing as a 'perfect book.' A book can receive both negative and positive comments.  The world is vast, and we shouldn't be overly selective. My beliefs may differ from yours, but this is how I feel, and I'll maintain this stance. So, what are your beliefs?
1092	4069	2	2	Have you ever visited a library and noticed that some books aren't suitable for younger kids? I'm about to write a persuasive essay on what I think is best for young children to read.  I've been to multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are too extreme for kids. I personally believe that children under @CAPS5 years old shouldn't be exposed to rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @NUM1 books, movies, or magazines. Kids at the age of @NUM2 shouldn't have to know what adult media looks like. I think kids should watch and read @CAPS2 - rated content.  Some might say, 'They won't understand it.' But if children don't know what something means, it won't stop them from repeating it. Kids learn through hands - on experience and observation. They'll eventually ask about the meaning of words. No parent is prepared to explain a four - letter word to a three - year - old. If a parent doesn't know how to explain things, they can introduce older media but shouldn't let the kids access it alone.  Kids usually start asking about adult things around @CAPS5 years old. That's when parents can start allowing them to read and watch older media. Twelve is still a young age for kids to consume such content independently. Parents should sit with them and explain what's going on. As kids, we look up to our parents and learn from their actions. Reading and watching inappropriate media at a young age is like that. By sixteen, kids usually know how to handle such content on their own.  In conclusion, I think rated @CAPS1 books, magazines, and movies should be restricted to those above @CAPS5 years old. Kids will be better off learning age - appropriate things by middle school, and by high school, they'll have a better understanding of adulthood.
1093	4070	2	2	Books, movies, and magazines are created for different age groups of adults and children. I agree that certain books are inappropriate for some children. But is it right for parents to ban books from schools and libraries? Authors create books because they have an idea, and students have the freedom to write what they want. Schools should find a way to make age - appropriate books available.  Books are crucial for students' learning. Parents need to understand that they can't protect their children from the world forever. Children will grow up and live independently. How will they learn to react to certain words or situations if they're completely shielded?  There are things teenagers experience that parents may not want to discuss. Some families can't afford library passes, so school libraries are the only option. If students can't access appropriate books, what else can they do? In today's changing society, students of appropriate age should be able to learn about topics like sex or @ORGANIZATION1's.  Libraries check out books under a name. At our school, some students take books without checking them out, but some still use the card. A solution for schools to have age - specific books could be to keep them in a locked case. Students would have an electronic key to unlock books suitable for their age group. The computer would then know which books a student can access.  Books are essential for learning, and parents shouldn't block students' access to them.
1094	4071	2	2	Censorship in libraries? In my opinion, I don't really care if books, movies, or magazines are censored. I'm not much of a reader, but I know some media are filled with profanity. I think it's just the authors' or producers' way of expressing themselves.  I believe libraries should keep such materials on the shelves, perhaps in separate sections. Removing them would be disrespectful to the creators, as it's their work and they spent time on it for our entertainment.  If you dislike the cursing in books and magazines, there are plenty of clean options available. The same goes for movies. I hate it when I'm watching a movie with my family, and suddenly there's offensive language or nudity. But if we read the movie description or ask about it, we can choose a more family - friendly option.  Just because there's media with foul language and indecent behavior doesn't mean we should ban them from libraries. If some people want to consume such content, let them. Those who don't should choose other media. We should recommend better books and movies to others and be role models for healthy media consumption.
1095	4072	2	2	Censorship in today's libraries is a significant issue. There are groups both supporting and opposing the idea of censoring books and other media for children. Do you think it's right for someone else to decide what we can or can't read? I believe we should have the freedom to decide if a book or movie is inappropriate.  As humans, we have the ability to make decisions. Every day, we face numerous choices, from what to wear to what to eat. So, why should someone tell us what to read? What may seem vulgar to one person may not be offensive to another. Everyone has different media preferences, so it's wrong for someone to make media - consumption decisions for others.  Censoring media for kids should be the parents' responsibility. If a parent doesn't want their child exposed to certain media, they should restrict access. We all have different opinions, and the ability to make and process decisions is a human trait. These decisions shouldn't be left to bureaucrats in @LOCATION1. When the government makes such personal decisions, do we truly have freedom?  Regarding television censorship, ratings are in place to warn people about content. With ratings, there's no need to completely remove shows or movies. The same should be done for books. Books should have age - appropriate ratings. If a person is under the required age, they can't purchase or check out the book. Since ratings work for TV and movies, they should work for books too.  In some cases, media promoting racism or hate towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned. This will have positive effects on society by preventing hurt and embarrassment.  In conclusion, we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies to consume, except for media that promotes racism and hate. Our decisions should be influenced by a rating system for all media. As humans, we have the right to make our own decisions, and this right should never be taken away.
1096	4073	2	2	In my view, people should not be granted the right to ban books or other media. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if we remove every item that offends someone, there will be nothing left. Everyone has the freedom to choose whether to engage with a particular book, movie, or other content. Just because one person dislikes something doesn't mean others can't enjoy it.  Some individuals are overly sensitive and take offense easily. If they don't like a book, they simply don't have to read it. Similarly, I may find some people's words offensive, but I don't have the right to silence them.  However, I do believe that certain standards should be set for books. Some books are too graphic for young children, and an age - appropriate policy should be in place. But this doesn't mean these books should be removed from the shelves. For example, the book '@CAPS1' contains a harsh rape scene. The author wrote it not just to share an experience but to show that there is always hope. The graphic details are there to convey the girl's agony, and many readers find it comforting to know they are not alone.  Books aren't the only things that can offend. In department stores, a movie line might be offensive to me, but I don't have the right to demand its removal. I can choose whether to watch it. The @CAPS2 also has offensive content, but it also offers many benefits, so we shouldn't ban it. In a library, there are various things that one might find offensive, like religious books or websites related to musicians with drug - related lyrics. But we can't let our personal dislikes dictate what others can access.  In conclusion, books and other media should not be banned because someone doesn't like their content. We all have different tastes, and libraries should not be restricted in what they can lend. We should respect others' choices as well as our own.
1097	4074	2	2	Globally, books, music, and movies are being removed from shelves because they are considered offensive. However, these forms of media are created for a purpose. They serve as a source of entertainment and a means to acquire knowledge. Artists, authors, and publishers release their work to share information and express their views, which is their right to freedom of speech.  Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be removed just because they are offensive. Censorship in libraries only conceals certain information from society. If all books about @CAPS1 were banned, people would be uninformed about a significant event, and it could potentially reoccur. Most media contain relevant information, depict real or possible events, and teach valuable lessons.  Artists and authors use their works to convey messages to their audiences, whether it's a moral lesson or interesting knowledge. People should not be allowed to arbitrarily remove media from shelves. The choice of what to read, listen to, or watch should be ours, not determined by those who want to ban things. If someone finds a particular piece of media offensive, they should take personal action, such as avoiding exposure for themselves and their families. Banning public access to media deprives people of the opportunity to engage with things they are interested in.  Some media can be banned for something as minor as a single provocative word, sentence, or thought. The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4' has multiple instances of cursing, but it tells a true story and indirectly warns about the potential breakdown of families and how to prevent it. Such minor issues should not lead to the removal of valuable media.  Katherine Paterson's quote is accurate. If we keep removing things because someone deems them inappropriate for children, there will be no media left. Most materials will have something that someone disagrees with, and continuously banning things defeats the purpose of creating new content. There will always be offensive material, but no one should have the right to ban it for everyone.  In conclusion, media around the world are removed due to offensive content, but they are created for valid reasons. They are not only for entertainment but also for knowledge, and artists and authors have the right to express themselves.
1098	4075	2	2	Have you ever thought about whether the book, music, movie, or magazine your child brings home could be offensive to someone else? There are times when there's no clear - cut answer to this question, and it's difficult to simply say yes or no. The key question is whether a parent's opinion that a book is unfit for a child should lead to its removal from the shelf.  Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that I work abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Her point is that if we remove books every time someone thinks they're inappropriate for children, there will be no books left.  Parents naturally want the best for their children. However, there are reasons to both agree and disagree with the average parent. There are books that are meant only for adults and others that are too advanced for children. These books all have a purpose. Parents need to consider both their children and the wider world. It's a big world, and we can't simply remove things from it. No matter how much we want to protect children from age - inappropriate books, it's impossible to completely prevent their access.  I believe that books are written for a reason. Just because one person doesn't like the way a book is written, it shouldn't be removed for a particular child. Libraries can't start removing books based on individual parents' preferences. People from different areas have different perspectives and may not have a clear sense of right and wrong.  The world is vast. When one person tries to oppose the general trend, they will likely face resistance. So, instead of fighting, we should strive for a peaceful co - existence where everyone can respect different views. In conclusion, we should balance the need to protect children with the freedom of access to diverse media.
1099	4076	2	2	In my opinion, censoring books and movies is unnecessary. Many people are overly protective and need to face the facts. Eventually, everyone will encounter most of the content mentioned in books during their lives. Life is unpredictable, and we may end up reading the so - called 'off - limits' books when we get older.  Those who advocate for censorship of library books may succeed in their communities. I think libraries should be organized better. There should be separate sections for adults, teenagers, and kids. This organization would help parents keep their children in the appropriate area and also make it easier for people to find the books they want if they know the type of book.  Another useful addition to libraries would be signs that categorize books. For example, in the teenager section, if someone is looking for a mystery book, they can easily find it by referring to the signs on the bookcases or the ceiling. This would be extremely helpful for new library users or those who are not familiar with library searching methods.  Movies, magazines, and music should also be categorized into adult, kid, and teenager sections. They should be placed within the book sections but clearly separated with signs indicating'movie' and'music'. This way, kids don't have to wander into the adult section to find a movie they want. Since movies are generally more well - known than books in modern times, they don't need to be as precisely categorized as books.  To keep young children in the right section, the kids' area could be decorated with bright colors to attract their attention. A dull and boring section might lead kids to wander into the adult section and encounter inappropriate content. The teenager section could have a single color, and the adult section could be the least colorful.  All these ideas would work well to keep kids entertained and interested in reading. They would also increase the likelihood of kids taking an interest in the library. These are the most practical ideas I have, and while there may be other ways to engage kids, they may only have a short - term effect. In conclusion, a well - organized library with proper categorization can strike a balance between access and protection.
1100	4077	2	2	The question of whether to remove offensive books is a complex one. Some believe that removing offensive books would help kids and young adults read more educational material instead of magazines and comics.  However, everyone has a different opinion on what is offensive. Personally, I don't think we should remove books just because they are offensive. Instead, we could prevent the author from publishing more offensive works.  Libraries have the right to decide where to place books with violent or gory content and whether to stock them at all. I, for one, like such books because they show the real world, unlike fairy - tale books where the hero saves the princess.  If parents are worried about offensive books, they should simply not let their kids access them and give them more suitable books. We know which books are inappropriate for kids, but sometimes parents still let their children read them.  In conclusion, if a book seems offensive to you, don't pick it up. Don't demand its removal from the shelf because there will always be someone who disagrees with you. We should respect different opinions and the diversity of reading materials available.
1101	4078	2	2	I firmly hold the view that library censorship is not a positive practice. There are numerous reasons for this stance, but to be concise, here are a few key points. If certain books were removed from library shelves, there would be a dearth of reading materials. Moreover, we would lose the knowledge contained within those books, and our children would be deprived of exposure to diverse thoughts. By the end of this discussion, one can grasp the pros and cons of library censorship.  If everyone removed a book they found offensive, there would be few, if any, books left in libraries. What one person deems offensive, another may find engaging. For instance, some of my friends consider '@CAPS1' an offensive novel, yet I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, we must also recognize that there are indeed some things that should not be publicly accessible.  Without the extensive collection of books in libraries, would we acquire the same level of knowledge? Would people be able to make significant discoveries in science, history, and electronics? Books are a wellspring of knowledge and a valuable learning resource. I personally learned how to become a successful @CAPS2 novel @CAPS3 from the @CAPS4 I gleaned from 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4 for @CAPS5.'  Offensive books can also be useful for research or casual conversations. Without them, people would struggle to understand others' perspectives on politics and daily - life issues. These books inspire creativity and innovation. The ideas expressed in written works can spark imagination and offer an escape from personal problems.  In conclusion, library censorship has its merits and demerits. While I find it inappropriate in many cases, it can be viewed from different angles. Those advocating for censorship often fail to realize that others may lose their favorite books, and they underestimate the knowledge we gain from books, even fictional ones. Without books, we would be oblivious to the thoughts of people from around the world. We need to reflect on the implications of a world without books.
1102	4079	2	2	The world is replete with a vast array of books, music, movies, and magazines. Some are humorous, historical, or romantic, but others can be offensive in various ways. People often get offended when exposed to certain content, but does this justify removing such items from the shelves? Different individuals have different sensitivities, so it's not reasonable to remove these materials.  If someone insists on removing a song from the library, what about those who don't find it offensive? Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and feelings, but no one's feelings should take precedence over others'. If we try to please everyone, the library will have limited options. One person may find a book offensive, and another may find a different one offensive, and this process could lead to an empty library.  It's nearly impossible to satisfy everyone when it comes to entertainment. No matter what the item is, there will always be at least one person who dislikes it. However, this doesn't mean it should be removed. Just because one person is offended, there are likely others who enjoy it. Those who don't find something offensive also have the right to be satisfied.  When someone finds something offensive, they should simply avoid it. They have the freedom to stop listening to a song, watching a movie, or reading a book or magazine. This way, those who aren't offended can still enjoy their choices at the library.  I personally avoid offensive content. There are many books and songs I find offensive, so I steer clear of them. By doing so, I don't deprive others of their enjoyment.  Library workers are well - aware of their responsibilities. If a library removes a book based on the opinion of a few, it may offend those who don't find it offensive, suggesting that their morals are inferior. Libraries should only remove materials when necessary, not to please specific customers.  In conclusion, people have the right to voice their opinions, but this doesn't mean they should decide what stays in the library. Compromise is key. Libraries should offer more non - offensive options, and people should avoid offensive content on their own.
1103	4080	2	2	Libraries have long been an invaluable source of information, offering a wide range of materials such as books, movies, and magazines. Recently, the issue of library censorship, specifically regarding offensive materials, has become a hot - button topic. Many parents argue against exposing their children to explicit content in public libraries. However, others counter that if all offensive books are removed, library shelves will be almost empty. As author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  The primary reason against removing offensive books is that if everyone were allowed to remove a book they found offensive, there would be few books remaining. Many historical works contain offensive elements, but these are records of our past. Without them, society would forget the events that shaped our world.  Another reason why library censorship is misguided is that what one person finds offensive may not bother another. Everyone has their own perspectives on various matters. Therefore, the decision to remove a book should not be based on the opinion of a single individual. Instead, it should involve the views of a large group to ensure a fair representation.  Most books are either fictional stories or historical accounts that are not intended to offend. Fictional books stimulate the imagination, while historical books preserve our past for future generations.  In conclusion, the idea of library censorship is a negative one. Books are meant to educate and entertain, not to spread harmful content. People should respect different views on books, even if the content is offensive to them.
1104	4081	2	2	I firmly believe that no book or form of literature should be removed from a library simply because someone finds it offensive. Those who are offended should simply refrain from reading it or letting their children read it. After all, just because one person has a problem with a book doesn't mean others will. If a book is good enough to be published, there are people who want to read it. Removing it based on one person's opinion will upset those who enjoy it.  As the famous author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' What she means is that everyone has an opinion about the materials in libraries and stores. If we let everyone remove materials they dislike, there will be no books, music, movies, or magazines left.  When someone encounters offensive content, they should simply avoid it. Everyone has different views on things. Just because you hate something doesn't mean your neighbor will. So, just because a book or other material offends you, it doesn't mean it should be removed from library and bookstore shelves.  I'm not opposed to all forms of censorship, but I don't think individuals should decide what can be in libraries based on their personal opinions. Libraries are places where authors can express themselves and share their works.  If something is offensive to you, it's your opinion. Instead of getting the book removed, it's easier to keep your children away from it. Teach them to avoid such books. The risk of children being in a car crash is much higher than the risk of them being negatively affected by inappropriate books, as long as they are properly educated. That's why I oppose censorship in libraries and bookstores.
1105	4082	2	2	Dear sir or madam,  Have you or a family member ever come across an offensive book, magazine, or movie? Do you think removing such an item would make a difference? And should everyone have the right to decide what gets removed from library shelves?  I believe that many people in our community have read books that they found slightly offensive at some point. This is likely true for people around the world. The main group affected by offensive materials is teenagers and kids. At first, they may find this content exciting and want to consume it repeatedly until they get bored.  Removing offensive items from the shelves may or may not make a difference. If only one item is removed, the person who requested the removal will likely find other offensive materials. If everyone removes the books they find offensive, those who enjoy these items will be disappointed. Eventually, there will be very few materials left for the community.  In conclusion, everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive. The decision of what should be on library shelves should not rest with individuals but with the community as a whole. When looking for a good book, magazine, or movie, people can seek suggestions from friends or family. If they can't get suggestions, they should choose based on their interests and ignore the offensive parts.
1106	4083	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should implement censorship. There are numerous books, music, movies, and magazines available today that contain content inappropriate for young children and teens. In my view, libraries should enforce stricter censorship, and materials like magazines, movies, and music should carry warning labels. Parents should be required to sign these labels, indicating that they consent to their child accessing the content.  In this century, channels like @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 air shows with violence, sexual content, and references to alcohol and drugs. It's nearly impossible to shield all children from such content, but we should make the effort. For instance, @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 shows depict teenage pregnancies, promoting the idea that having children without marriage or a relationship is acceptable. @ORGANIZATION1 shows feature theft with no consequences, along with violence and offensive language.  I recall when I was a child, watching @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2, my dad came into my room and told me to turn it off, stating that the content was inappropriate. When I have children, I'll do my best to protect them from unsuitable materials until they're old enough to understand and make the right choices. Words like'retard' used in some shows are deeply offensive.  In my opinion, censorship in libraries and households has declined. Some parents are unaware of what their children are exposed to. A responsible parent should ensure that their child's media consumption is age - appropriate.  Even books contain sexual content and offensive language. When I have kids, I'll carefully select their reading materials. Magazines are often worse; for example, the @CAPS7, known as '@CAPS6 @CAPS7', is easily accessible to young teens. Most radio music contains offensive language related to sex, drinking, or drugs.  Parents need to be more involved in their children's lives and monitor their media intake. I'm not advocating for the removal of all materials, as some movies and books convey positive messages. I'm simply concerned about the easy availability of un - censored, inappropriate content.  I hope you'll consider my concerns and respond to me soon. Thank you for your time.
1107	4084	2	2	I am of the opinion that libraries should censor materials that are offensive to children. Children should not be exposed to books with inappropriate pictures, as censored and offensive materials can have a detrimental impact on them. Scary movies, for example, can cause children to have nightmares. There is a clear need for restrictions on offensive materials in libraries.  Libraries offer a wide range of books, music, movies, and magazines. However, they also contain some offensive items. These offensive materials should be removed because children do not need to encounter inappropriate content in libraries. Such content can have a negative influence on kids.  Censored elements like offensive language, smoking, and alcohol are extremely harmful to children. Children should not learn to use cuss words. Smoking can lead to cancer or death, and alcohol is addictive and can cause violence. Children should not be able to access these inappropriate items in libraries.  I have personal experience with the negative effects of scary movies. When I was a child, I watched a scary movie and couldn't sleep that night. Inappropriate movies should have ratings to prevent kids from watching them. Since kids tend to believe what they see in movies, there should be restrictions on children's access to such movies.  There is a significant amount of material in libraries that requires censorship for children. Bad influences can have a lasting negative effect on them. Therefore, I firmly believe that libraries should restrict items that can harm children.
1108	4085	2	2	Parents bear the responsibility for their children, which includes overseeing their education, academic performance, and the materials they read. Libraries should not be tasked with removing 'offensive' books, magazines, or movies. This is the parents' responsibility, not the library's.  The library serves as a place where people can obtain books, movies, or magazines for entertainment or research purposes. Every book in the library is placed there for someone to read. If we were to remove all the materials that some people find offensive, there would be very few books left. Moreover, it is difficult to determine which books are truly offensive.  If an adult or a mature teenager visits the library and cannot find a book because it was removed due to parental concerns, it is unfair. Parents should take the responsibility of guiding their children and teaching them what is appropriate. If a child is young, the parent, who usually accompanies them to the library, can easily monitor the materials they select. Additionally, most libraries have a dedicated children's section.  The library's role is to provide the community with a diverse range of books, movies, and magazines. It is not the library's job to watch out for individual children. Libraries should keep the books on the shelves so that people can freely choose what they want to read.
1109	4086	2	2	Some individuals object to the presence of books on library shelves that they consider offensive. They advocate for the removal of such 'corruptive' books, magazines, and movies. However, customers have the option to avoid checking out these materials; they do not have the right to demand their removal.  Library - goers have the freedom to choose whether to read a book or not. If they have heard negative reviews about a book, they can simply ignore it. The books on public library shelves are there for a purpose and should not be removed just because some people dislike them. The reasons for disliking a book, such as it conflicting with one's religious beliefs or personal views, do not justify its removal.  People have diverse tastes and preferences when it comes to books. Just because a book does not meet one person's standards does not mean it won't appeal to others. Beliefs and standards vary from person to person, which is why book preferences differ widely.  Many parents are concerned about their children reading offensive books. If a child selects a book that the parent deems inappropriate, the parent should simply tell the child that the book is unsuitable. The child is likely to listen and put the book back. This approach is far better than trying to get the book removed from the library.  Removing a book from the library shelf is unfair to other library users. Everyone should have the right to read what they want and the option to ignore the books they don't like. When searching for a book, magazine, or movie, if one comes across an inappropriate item, they should simply ignore it and continue with their search. In conclusion, the best way to deal with offensive materials in the library is to exercise personal choice rather than seeking their removal.
1110	4087	2	2	I've often wondered if anyone has ever tried to get something removed from a library shelf because they found it offensive. If so, how did they handle the situation and what were their expectations? I've personally encountered offensive things in libraries, so I'm certain such materials exist. There are numerous rules, qualifications, or standards that could prompt someone to remove an item from a shelf, and these criteria can vary from person to person.  In a children's or school library, it's widely agreed that books with offensive language, situations, or opinions should be removed. However, in the teenage or adult section of a public library, the same books might be acceptable. The audience is different, so the literature, music, movies, etc., can be more opinionated, mature, and controversial. The decision to remove an item partly depends on the intended audience.  In my view, there's a fine line between what's considered too controversial or too mature. This is why I believe in censorship. Some things are clearly inappropriate. At the same time, there should be guidelines and perhaps rules regarding what should be on the shelves. Some materials might be on the verge of being inappropriate, but they could also serve as learning tools or great reads.  As Katherine Paterson said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' This is precisely why I advocate for guidelines or rules. If everyone had the power to remove items, there might be nothing left to read or listen to. Different people find different things offensive. Rules and guidelines would ensure that there's still a diverse range of materials available in libraries.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that libraries should implement censorship. Some works are simply too offensive and need to be removed. Developing rules or guidelines would be an appropriate step to balance the needs of all library users. As Paterson also said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'
1111	4088	2	2	During a class, we visited the library to browse various books. One book that our teacher picked up was '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Right @CAPS5' by @PERSON2. Written during the cult of domesticity, this book was filled with notions of women's submissiveness and their dedication to the home. From a modern perspective, I found it highly offensive. In today's context, assuming that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside is considered sexist. However, just because it is a piece of literature that I don't agree with doesn't mean it lacks value. Certain materials that may be found offensive should not be removed from libraries. There is a wide range of people using the library, and it is nearly impossible to find a piece of material that no one finds offensive. Censoring library materials is unjustifiable as these materials are a form of expression for the creators or society. Censoring them would violate the freedom of expression. People of all ages visit the library to find books, music, or magazines, and they hold different beliefs. What one person considers a work of art may be highly offensive to another. If libraries start censoring books, the result will be a limited selection of dull and emotionless materials. People go to libraries to find materials they are interested in or to expand their interests, so libraries need to have a diverse range of materials to meet this need. The primary function of a library is to educate its visitors, and exposure to different types of materials is an effective form of education. Sometimes, the controversial nature of a novel makes it valuable as it prompts readers to think about the author's purpose. 'The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON3 was considered offensive for a long time because it addressed the issue of slavery when many were not ready to confront it. As a result, it was banned from libraries and schools. Now, it is regarded as one of the most famous works in @CAPS7 literature. This example shows that offensive materials should not have their value automatically diminished. Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' which accurately describes the outcome of library censorship. Part of what makes a great work is its ability to stir up controversy among readers. Removing the controversial elements will also remove an aspect of education, which is the core purpose of a library.
1112	4089	2	2	I think it's okay to have books even if they are considered offensive because some people don't find them offensive at all. People shouldn't let the content of books bother them. In my view, if a book offends you, simply don't read it. There's no need to make a big fuss over a book that isn't offensive to everyone. I agree that offensive books are bad, but that's why you have the option not to open them. It would be easier to find specific things if we had a dedicated library for each category, like music. If there were a music library, it would be simpler to narrow down and find exactly what you're looking for. The same goes for movies and magazines. However, the main problem with this solution is the high economic cost. Getting back to the main point, I've never come across an offensive book, and if I did, I'd just put it back. Why remove a book that many people like from the shelf just because one person might find it offensive? Most libraries already label certain books. If you know what kind of book you're looking for, it shouldn't be offensive. Books are a good thing and are meant for entertainment and fun. They shouldn't be considered offensive. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. If you find a book offensive, just put it back on the shelf and leave it alone. Music, on the other hand, is offensive to many people. Let's face it, we all have music we love and music we hate. There are a lot of offensive songs in the world, and I personally think they shouldn't exist, and putting them in libraries is even worse. Music is persuasive, and if a kid picks up an appealing song in the library that promotes drug - use, it could be a bad influence. No one wants their kids to be persuaded to do drugs. I believe that if anything should be removed from libraries, it's offensive music, not books. In conclusion, the offensiveness of a book or music is a matter of personal opinion, and we should handle the situation rationally.
1113	4090	2	2	I firmly believe that if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offend someone, people should not be allowed to remove that material from the library shelves. If people are worried about children being exposed to such materials, they can teach their children to stay away from the adult section. Some people dislike foul language, but that's their personal opinion. If everyone had the right to remove offensive materials, there would be hardly any material left in the library. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us.' If you're worried about your children seeing censored materials in the library, you can have them stay in the kids' section. You can also choose to visit the library alone to avoid such concerns. Before checking out a material, skim through it to ensure there is nothing offensive for your child. Many people don't like foul language, but it doesn't bother me. It adds flavor to the book and makes it more interesting. It helps readers understand the emotions and mood of the characters in the story. If everyone had the right to remove all offensive materials, it would have a negative impact on people's education and reading skills. Some of these materials are people's hobbies, and taking them away would prevent people from doing what they like. As Paterson also said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off of the shelf.' The solution is to teach children the difference between right and wrong. We should ask ourselves whether we want our children to have a good education or be unable to read. Foul language can sometimes enhance a book. I can't imagine a world without books. In conclusion, people should not have the right to remove materials from the library just because they are offended. We should respect different opinions and ensure that libraries can continue to play their educational role.
1114	4091	2	2	The question of whether to remove certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc. is a serious one. Some people think it's a good idea, while others disagree. In my opinion, I side with not removing such materials. One of the main reasons is that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Some people find a book offensive, while others find it engaging and not offensive at all. If a person finds a book offensive, they should simply choose not to read it. There's no need to ban books, music, movies, etc. just because some people are offended. Different people have different beliefs, and as long as no laws are broken, we should be free to express them. Another reason is that if we start removing materials, we might end up with none left. As mentioned before, everyone has different opinions, and it's impossible for every single person to say that a book or other item doesn't offend them. However, I do believe that we should restrict certain materials. If a book, movie, etc. is too complex for a child to understand, they shouldn't be allowed to access it. We should classify materials based on knowledge, understanding, and maturity. We all have the right to believe what we want and make our own choices. I can understand some of the arguments for removing certain materials, but the key is to do what's best for everyone. Removing every potentially offensive item won't solve any problems; in fact, it will make things worse as there will be arguments about what to remove and what to keep. In conclusion, I believe we should keep libraries as they are. It will keep things less complicated and is the best choice overall. This way, libraries can continue to serve as a place where people can freely access a wide range of materials and express their different views.
1115	4092	2	2	Have you ever wanted to see a movie but were not allowed to because of its graphics? Many parents and young adults think that censoring movies is a good thing, but they don't realize that censorship often makes kids more eager to see the movie. First, if kids really want to see a censored movie, they may sneak into the theater or obtain an illegal copy from the internet. I remember when I was younger, my friends and I always wanted to see @CAPS4 - rated movies. We'd have our parents drop us off at the theater. When we got home, our parents would ask what we saw, and we'd lie and say we watched the new @CAPS5 @CAPS6 movie. So, kids can get into trouble over something so silly. Second, if you don't think your child should watch a movie because of your religious beliefs, you should have a talk with your child. Statistics show that when kids can communicate openly with their parents and reach an agreement, they are less likely to lie and go behind their parents' backs. Many parents agree that if they can preview the movie first, they can decide whether it's appropriate for their child. In many cases, this works well for both parents and children. If the parent gives permission for the child to see the movie, they'll have something to discuss when the child gets home. Finally, I believe movies should be uncensored. Most movies aren't as bad as they seem, and your child will see them one way or another, whether at a friend's house, on the internet, or at the theater. What harm can it do to see them now? In conclusion, since your child will likely see the movie eventually, it may be okay not to censor it. Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This statement also applies to movie censorship. Can you imagine living in a censored world? I can't. So, think about whether you're for or against censorship. Would you want your child to lie to you about where they were going or what they saw? I wouldn't.
1116	4093	2	2	The world is filled with diverse individuals, each with unique perspectives on various matters. Some are opinionated, while others are outspoken and mature. Many of these people are the authors of the numerous books that line the shelves of our school libraries. However, some schools censor certain books, deeming their tone or message inappropriate or overly violent. In my view, we have the right to access these books, and no book should be removed from the library. Our troops fight for our freedom of press and speech, yet book - censoring disregards these precious freedoms. During my freshman year, we were set to read a book called '@CAPS1 @NUM1'. Our teacher briefly explained its plot, which centered around a society that banned books as if they were harmful substances. Ironically, a school disliked the idea of a book about book - banning and prohibited it from being read to their students. This is illogical considering the book highlights the absurdity of such a ban. By the time students reach high school, they have likely encountered more extreme situations than what is depicted in 'banned books'. I understand that some believe just because one engages in inappropriate behavior doesn't mean they should constantly read about it. To an extent, I agree as high - schoolers often do things they shouldn't. But that's life. High - schoolers are mature enough to handle offensive language or violent scenes, as they may see worse on TV or at home. For instance, a 17 - year - old friend of mine has two jobs, lives in her own apartment with her boyfriend, and receives no parental support. She has good grades and is very mature, yet she's not allowed to read a book with offensive language. Our society is over - protective. In the real world, there will be no censorship. High schools should include these books in their libraries as they may help students grow and become more mature. After college, when we enter the workforce and start our lives, we need to be equipped to deal with reality. Censored books only shield children from life experiences and prevent them from growing up. We have the right to read these books, just as the authors have the right to write them. If they can publish, we should be able to read, regardless of age.
1117	4094	2	2	"It's just not right,"" says reporter @PERSON1, referring to inappropriate magazines being accessible to children. He believes that magazines, books, and other materials with profanity should be out of the reach of children and only discussed under adult guidance. Modern libraries should supervise children during their library visits. If a child wants something without a guardian present, they should not be allowed to obtain it. Although some people find certain books inappropriate, they should not be removed from library shelves. Older books teach children about history, the origins of current practices, and real - life stories. For example, books about @ORGANIZATION1 may seem abrasive and mocking, but they show the pre - legal - era of anti - racism. Books about @NUM1 can be provoking to those who lost loved ones in the bombing, yet they teach children that not everyone is kind and that bad things can happen to good people. Books about people's lives, including childhood traumas or parental deaths from cancer, teach children that life can have both positive and negative outcomes. Some forms of entertainment are not suitable for children, such as pornography and provocative language. Pornography, mainly for adults, can scare young children who do not understand it. Similarly, provocative language in books or on CDs is not for children, but they need to learn not to repeat such words to avoid trouble with parents. History books are generally beneficial for children's growth; about @PERCENT1 of children absorb and utilize the information. However, @PERCENT2 of children may naively view all historical information as positive. @ORGANIZATION2's bombing of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 was the result of long - term, devious planning. While some people object to children learning certain historical events, it is essential for every child to understand the ups and downs of their own and other countries. Children may not currently understand economic issues, but they will as adults. Some history - related books may be offensive to some, but they are valuable resources. Children will eventually learn about the harsh realities of life. Without books and videos, future generations will be ignorant of history. Although some young people may distort information in books, the truth remains. That's why libraries should keep books on the shelves, just out of children's reach."
1118	4095	2	2	Reading is highly important for today's kids. Libraries should have the freedom to stock any type of text, movie, magazine, or music genre that can aid students' learning. Generally, there are few books that should be considered offensive, except for those targeting a specific race, religion, or gender, such as those written by radical racist groups like members of the @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1 - @CAPS2's. As a high - school student with access to a great school library, I've learned a lot from its collection. In my entire high - school experience, I've never encountered or heard of an offensive book. I can say with confidence that no book in the school library would offend me personally, though I acknowledge that there are books that may offend certain individuals. I love reading and don't want to miss out on a good book just because a library decides not to stock it due to the potential of offending someone. Reading should not be restricted based on content as there is always someone looking for a particular book. I've heard of people getting angry about a nude picture in an art book, which is absurd. Art has featured nudity for thousands of years, and it's strange that it offends people now. Some movies, like porn, should definitely be removed from library shelves. Porn has no place in a library, and there are other platforms, like the internet, for it. Music is different. Many people can't afford to buy music from platforms like @LOCATION1, iTunes, or @CAPS3. With so many music genres and diverse listeners, it's impossible to determine what should or shouldn't be in the library. It would be unfair to restrict certain types of music. However, listening to music in the library should be regulated; it shouldn't be loud enough for others to hear. I'm not a big magazine reader, but I know that some magazines should and shouldn't be in libraries. Magazines like '@CAPS4' and '@ORGANIZATION1' are educational and should be included. On the other hand, pornographic magazines like '@CAPS5' and those targeting young girls to promote an unrealistic body image, such as '@CAPS6', should be excluded. There are some materials that libraries should not stock, but one controversial item should not lead to the exclusion of an entire category. Libraries are places for people to explore and find what they need. We have the right to access a wide range of materials in libraries.
1119	4096	2	2	Freedom of expression, manifested in writing, acting, and art, is a significant part of how people express themselves. Since we all have different views, I won't dictate what's right or wrong but will share some library - related experiences. These experiences took place in various libraries, from small - town libraries to those in the heart of large cities, and even include a story from the suburbs. It's fascinating to see the different standards of acceptance across our country. It all began when I was sitting at a small table in the back of the @LOCATION1 library with a group of friends, working on our research papers. We noticed a man and a woman, presumably a couple, looking at magazines on the shelf in front of us. When the man picked up a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine, the woman exclaimed that it was derogatory towards women. He put it down and left. Curious, I walked over and saw a picture of a woman in underwear next to a classic car. About a month later, I was dropping off books at my local library for my mom. As soon as I opened the door, I heard two people arguing about a painting on the back wall of the adult section. The painting, an old one with peeling paint, showed a woman with her chest exposed. The head librarian pointed out that the painting had been there for many years without any complaints. Many people in the area were not even willing to listen to the woman's concerns as the painting was famous and had been there since before some middle - aged people could remember. These incidents show that there are diverse views on what is acceptable in modern society. Advertisements often use people's bodies to attract attention, and many magazines do the same. I believe there should be a clear line for this type of advertising. Magazines should indicate on the front cover if they contain adult - oriented content. However, for a long - standing and famous painting like the one in the library, it should not have been removed. There should be a rating system for books and other materials to help determine what is appropriate.
1120	4097	2	2	@PERSON1 says we should all share, yet he never gives things back. In reality, we can't all get what we want simultaneously or at all. If a book is popular, more copies should be purchased to meet the demand. Sharing is better than wasting money when someone you know has the book and is willing to lend it. However, most people these days are not very sharing. The truth is, we don't always get what we want, and we need to accept that. @PERSON2 has an opinion, but everyone is entitled to their own. We don't have to follow what others say; if we agree, then we do. Just like in '@CAPS1 OF @CAPS2', everyone has a say. I don't believe that books, music, etc., should be removed from library shelves. It's just stupid to do so; you'll lose your job, and there are people in the world who need these resources for entertainment or education. I'm not much of a reader; I prefer listening to music as it's more interesting and entertaining to me. I do read magazine articles occasionally, but music is my main interest. Reading a book is like having someone tell you a story. For now, I'm enjoying being a teenager and not overly focused on reading. Later in life, I might become interested in reading, but for now, I'm living my teenage years to the fullest. I've stated my opinion, and it's ridiculous to be graded on this because everyone has the right to their own view. You can either agree or disagree with me, but in this case, I'm firmly against the removal of materials from libraries.
1121	4098	2	2	I am penning this essay to persuade the local library members to exercise better censorship when including inappropriate material on the shelves for community use. In this piece, I will present my views on this matter, supported by real - life facts gleaned from numerous past experiences. I firmly believe that a substantial amount of reading material in the children's section of our libraries is overly advanced for young children to comprehend. I have personally reviewed many books in the children's sections of various libraries. During this review, I noticed that a significant portion of the material is either too complex or profound for children to assimilate. Young children should read more fantasy books to stimulate their imagination rather than filling their minds with thoughts of war and disaster. Today's children need more accessible reading material that they can understand, rather than an abundance of incomprehensible content. Let us stock the library shelves with more suitable books and stop wasting money on inappropriate ones. In conclusion, I hope that I have convinced the readers to understand my point. I trust that they will put the information I've provided into action.
1122	4099	2	2	Libraries serve as community centers where both children and adults visit to borrow new books that offer fresh experiences and information. If libraries were to remove books deemed inappropriate or offensive, young adults and adults would be deprived of these new experiences. A well - functioning library requires a diverse range of books. Censoring library books may lead to the disappearance of other materials as well. Most young adults are interested in adventure, mystery, or love books. While some might find a mystery book with a serial - killer protagonist offensive, one cannot rewrite the book for an individual or remove it entirely from the shelf. These books are public property. Removing such a book from the library means taking away the reading experience from other young adults. One teenager's opinion does not represent the views of all teenagers. Libraries that remove offensive or inappropriate books may influence multi - billion - dollar industries, such as the movie industry, to second - guess their work. The movie industry might question the directors, actors, and actresses they hire. Actors and actresses have a significant influence on teenagers and children. If a child's favorite actor were to disappear from future movies, the child would lose a role model. The impact of censoring books and magazines extends far beyond libraries. Music artists can also be affected. Rappers use curse words in their music to express their opinions and personal experiences. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, a well - known rapper, curses in his music to convey his emotions during an event. If music publishers refused to publish his work because it is offensive, he would lose his job and career. In today's society, many people make a living by providing entertainment. Libraries have no right to remove books from children and adults. Authors know what they are writing, as it is a means of expressing emotions and feelings. The same applies to music artists and screen - play writers. If movies were all about unicorns, the movie industry would quickly collapse. Libraries need to consider the broader implications before removing books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work.
1123	4100	2	2	The movie @CAPS1 is rated for @CAPS2, violence, and some nudity. This type of movie has no place on any shelf. It is highly inappropriate for kids, even just to read the description on the movie case. There should be no movies or magazines with nude pictures. It is harmful for children to be exposed to such content because they may imitate what they see in movies or magazines and get into trouble. In my opinion, it is wrong to see others naked. The only person I would want to see in such a way is my wife in the future. I don't want to watch a movie and see a nude woman. Another concern is violence. I wish guns and bombs had never been invented. I've lost many friends to guns and about six cousins in the war when a bomb hit their area. More and more people are buying guns and bombs because of what they see in movies, books, and magazines. They learn about different guns from these sources and obtain them, along with bombs from the black market. Movies are the main source of these dangerous ideas. Lastly, @CAPS2 is a major reason kids get in trouble at school. They learn these words mainly from movies, as the actors use them. Studies show that kids tend to imitate what their favorite actors say and do. In conclusion, all materials with violence should be removed from the shelves.
1124	4101	2	2	Throughout history, many books were written when beliefs on certain topics differed from today's views. As the world has evolved, views on slavery, women's rights, religion, and other matters have changed. These views were based on the majority opinion of a particular time. I believe that just because a book or a quote offends someone, it does not give people the right to ban it from society. Individuals can choose to avoid it themselves, but the decision to ban something for everyone should be left to each person. Our government grants us the right to freedom of speech. This means that even if someone writes or speaks against the majority opinion, they can do so without fear of punishment. People cannot simply ban something based on its content. In my life, some people are trying to ban explicit music. My parents think I'm old enough to listen to any type of music I like. Public libraries can set age restrictions on items with inappropriate language, nudity, or other content, similar to movie theaters. However, they do not have the right to ban books. With an age restriction in place, as long as a child's guardian approves or checks out the book for the child, it is acceptable for the child to have access to it. The decision about what is appropriate for each child should be made by their parents. If libraries had to ban books because someone found them offensive, there would be very few, if any, books left. In almost every book, someone can find something offensive. These offensive books should remain on the shelves so that people can understand the historical views of society. Offensive items in libraries show us the flaws in past society and help us learn from history to avoid repeating mistakes. For example, the play A @ORGANIZATION1 depicts the low - regard society had for women in that era. It shows that women were seen mainly as child - raisers and were not considered intellectually capable of discussing science. This indirectly teaches us how not to treat women today. Libraries should not ban books, music, movies, magazines, or other items because they are offensive. Instead, they can set age restrictions. Authors and artists have the freedom of speech, and libraries cannot take that away.
1125	4102	2	2	I believe that today's children should have the opportunity to learn the same things that our parents learned in the past, through the same teachings, books, movies, and other resources. Learning in this way is better than removing cussing, swearing, and certain detailed writing. Taking these elements out is like distorting history and hiding what really happened. Should today's children be deprived of the truth? Would you want your children to go to school and learn from textbooks that have been altered to be appropriate and non - offensive? Think about it. Were you deprived of learning history when you were in school? I doubt it, so why start now? Suppose your child is going to read '@ORGANIZATION1' in @CAPS1 class. Would you want to ruin a classic book by removing the '@CAPS2' word and the word'slave'? Doing so would deprive them of learning about slave owners, slaves, and racial comments, which are part of actual history. Would you also deprive them of learning about wars, revolutions, and mass killings just to make learning more appropriate? No, I wouldn't. I want my children to learn everything about world history. In conclusion, I do not think there should be censorship in libraries.
1126	4103	2	2	Libraries are repositories of a vast array of materials that can be both educational and entertaining for individuals of all age groups. While some may argue that libraries should not stock documents that are potentially offensive, I firmly believe otherwise. Libraries house a diverse collection of books, magazines, movies, and more, which can significantly enhance the knowledge of the public.  It is true that libraries may contain materials that some might find offensive. However, this should not be a reason to remove them from the shelves. Instead, libraries could be organized into different sections based on topics. For instance, if a parent does not want their child to access books related to racism, they can simply keep the child away from that particular section.  Children need to be exposed to the real - world situations that occur in @LOCATION1. Without such exposure, they will not learn how to deal with the harsh realities of life. This does not imply that children should be exposed to inappropriate content like magazines highlighting @PERSON2's drug scandals. Rather, they should understand that such things exist and that they should not emulate such behavior.  Libraries do not include offensive material without purpose. Consider a high - school student working on a report about the rise of teen pregnancy. A library would be the most reliable source of factual information on this topic.  The materials in libraries not only educate but also entertain. If a library removes a biography of the rapper @ORGANIZATION1 because of his controversial past, it may lose a patron who comes to the library to be inspired by the struggles of successful people.  As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries censor all potentially offensive materials, there will be little left to entertain the public. Therefore, libraries should refrain from monitoring what materials are placed on the shelves.
1127	4104	2	2	Nowadays, libraries are filled with thousands of books, some dating back @NUM1 years. Books are a form of media, and people of all ages should have the freedom to pick any book off the shelf. Books, music, movies, and magazines are all created to appeal to people's interests and preferences. Authors and publishers should not be penalized for their hard work.  There is a wide variety of people in the world, each with different tastes in books. Just because a book contains elements that some might consider inappropriate does not mean that no one will enjoy it. I, for one, love reading romance stories, and I'm certain that some of them contain content that could be considered sensitive.  I have a strong preference for romance stories. If all romance books were removed from library shelves due to censorship, I would likely stop reading altogether because that's the only genre I truly enjoy. Usually, it's adults and young adults who read romance stories, and they have the maturity to handle any potentially sensitive content.  It's unfair to deny adults and young adults the opportunity to read stories that interest them just because of censorship. Some people might find certain stories so engaging, especially if they are based on true events, that they may even be motivated to help those involved.  We shouldn't deprive authors of the chance to achieve greater success. Young adults should be allowed to explore all the topics they are interested in. I'm sure many people would be disappointed if censored stories were removed from library shelves. In conclusion, libraries should keep a diverse collection of books to cater to different interests.
1128	4105	2	2	Censorship is often seen as a safeguard for the more sensitive individuals. This issue has persisted for as long as anyone can remember, from our childhood to adulthood. We've witnessed censorship everywhere, from the bleeps on television to hide seemingly harmless words to the replacement of letters in curse words. While I acknowledge that censorship has its place for a certain period, when it is over - extended, especially in books and newspapers to limit what we can handle, it becomes excessive.  As a high - school student, I find it ridiculous to restrict our reading because a book might contain one or two bad words. It's extremely hypocritical. Science and anatomy books show parts of the body like genitalia, and that's considered acceptable because it's in an educational context. But if the same content appears in a regular book, it becomes a major issue. I believe that in a library, we should have the freedom to read what we want.  High school is a time when students start to develop maturity, and the level of censorship should be reduced. I'm not advocating for the complete removal of censorship, but high - school students can surely handle a few bad words in a great book.  When it comes to movies and music, obviously, anything pornographic, extremely idiotic, or demeaning should be censored. However, if there are just a few bad words, it shouldn't prevent an entire school from enjoying good music or an amazing movie.  In conclusion, censorship should exist, but only to a reasonable extent. We shouldn't have music and books taken away from high - school students just because of a few bad words. Censorship is for the sensitive, and those who are easily offended can simply choose not to pick up a book or listen to music that contains content they don't like. That's my stance on censorship.
1129	4106	2	2	Reading, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 are activities that we all enjoy in our free time. Books, music, and movies have their own meanings and purposes, and they keep us occupied when we have spare time. The library is a haven where we can read quietly and @CAPS1 to music without distractions. However, not all materials are suitable for the library.  People often discover interesting books at the library and decide to borrow them, often unaware of the content inside. Books, music, and movies come in a wide range of genres, and we all have our own preferences for what we like to read, listen to, or watch.  Genres vary greatly. For example, there are specific books designed for children, which should be carefully selected for them at the library. There are also books intended for adults only, and once borrowed, they should be kept away from children's reach. This is because children may be exposed to inappropriate content, which could lead to problems.  All readings, music, or movies that contain explicit or uncensored graphics or words should have their own dedicated section in the library. By doing so, we can ensure that everything is organized and that no harm is done. In fact, all media should be segregated by age - appropriateness. For instance, children's media should be in one section, and adult media in another.  All books should remain on the library shelves because people know what is suitable for them to read. A child's ideal book is one with colorful pictures, while adults have their own selection criteria. The same principle applies to movies, music, and other forms of media. In conclusion, media in libraries should be properly organized but not removed based on individual sensitivities.
1130	4107	2	2	Libraries already have enough to worry about, such as people not returning borrowed items. They shouldn't have to remove books, music, movies, and magazines just because some people find them offensive. There's no point in removing something that only offends one person when no one else has raised a complaint.  I understand that some may ask me to see the perspective of why something is offensive, but I really don't see how a book can be so offensive. When someone comes across something they find offensive in the library, they don't have to borrow it. There are people who are willing to read offensive material to learn from it. If someone doesn't like a particular library, they can always go to another one. There's no need to be overly offended by books because authors are simply trying to convey their ideas and express their feelings on a subject.  In my opinion, people have two options. The first is to accept the situation and continue using the library to borrow books. The second is to avoid the library if they are likely to find something offensive. However, they should realize that no matter where they go, they will encounter things that might offend them. So, they might as well get over it and visit the library because offensive content is everywhere.  Some may ask why we don't just remove the offensive materials if it's not a big deal. Well, just because some people don't want to read certain books doesn't mean that others don't. It's unfair to get rid of something just because a few people find it offensive.  Therefore, I firmly believe that we should not remove books, music, movies, magazines, or any other materials from libraries. People will have to deal with the content they don't like. We won't eliminate the materials that the library has. Everything in the library should stay where it is.
1131	4108	2	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, while growing up in my small neighborhood, life was extremely simple. For children, life consists of eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing. Their innocent minds do not contemplate the meanings of life or love, yet curiosity occasionally seizes them. With tenacious determination, a child might go to great lengths to understand confidential information overheard from their parents. However, does harmless curiosity lead to the destruction of a child's innocence? By accessing adult - oriented materials like library books, children can acquire premature knowledge that may harm their development.  Nonetheless, libraries should not hesitate to stock books suitable for adults. An author invests countless hours in writing a book, which represents a part of human history, and not everyone will find its contents inappropriate. Authors have the freedom to write about their interests, and depriving them of the right to present their thoughts and opinions is unjust. A censored author may feel like a basketball player who fails to make the team despite extensive practice. An author who has honed their writing skills hopes to publish their work. Disagreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude their valuable thoughts from society. Adult - appropriate books should be displayed as the author intended.  Every piece of literature documents a portion of human history. Even fictional novels are testaments to human imagination. Therefore, no book should be censored, regardless of its inappropriate content. Just as remembering past atrocities has taught mankind not to repeat mistakes, keeping books with the most abhorrent content can prevent authors from repeating such dishonorable material. If censorship removes literary 'errors' from library shelves, there is a risk that an unaware author may repeat them. By remembering these mistakes, humanity can progress in literature. Books are not 'errors'; they are reminders of literary high - points. All literature, whether appropriate or not, is part of human history that should not be hidden.  Finally, who can judge what is a 'mistake' in literature? A book on a certain topic may be inappropriate to one group but sacred to another. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Moreover, for every book, there is at least one person who disagrees with its message. A library is for public education, not for the interests of a single individual. If someone is offended by a literary work, they should find a more suitable book. The decision on a novel's appropriateness lies with the reader, not the government, library, or activist group.  Censorship of library materials would deprive authors of the chance to share their works, conceal human records, and take away the reader's right to decide what is appropriate. Authors spend long hours writing, and their motivation should not be undermined. Every book represents an aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid past mistakes. These 'mistakes' should be judged by the reader, not by censorship. Instead of deciding which books the public can see, libraries could create an adult - only section for 'controversial' books. This way, humanity can remain educated and free, and children can stay innocent. - @ORGANIZATION2.
1132	4109	2	2	In our country, there are diverse perspectives on censorship. People of different ages, including the young, the old, parents, and children, hold various views. In libraries, there is some reading material that some may find offensive.  Offensive material in libraries is not primarily intended for young children, nor are they supposed to access it easily. However, it sometimes ends up in the hands of those who shouldn't have it. The material is not always locked away, and it may be placed on a child - reachable shelf that seems appealing to them.  Removing all such material from libraries would result in nearly empty shelves, except for children's books. The material to be removed includes books for the appropriate age group that inform and tell good stories. Protecting children through over - censorship would deny knowledge and a source of escape for many regular library - goers.  Most movies, books, music, and other materials are properly labeled. Some materials may be inappropriate for children, but not all of them are. A rated '@NUM1' movie may be similar to a rated '@CAPS2' movie, with only one extra reference that could be misinterpreted. Even protective parents may allow their children to watch such movies if they deem it appropriate.  Libraries should not remove this material from their shelves. If it is a significant issue, they could separate children's books into a different room. There are multiple ways to keep such reading material away from children without removing these books and other materials from the library shelves.  Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic. There are valid arguments on both sides of whether to remove offensive material from library shelves. I believe it should not be removed, and there are alternative solutions. This essay has proposed solutions to this problem without taking away the public's right to read.
1133	4110	2	2	Yesterday, in @STATE1 @NUM1, I read your article in the newspaper, @PERSON1, about offensive books in the library. I concur with your views. Some books, music, movies, or magazines in public libraries may be offensive to me, but they could be normal to others. Similarly, there may be books that I find normal but others find offensive. Everyone has their own perspectives on everything. In @LOCATION1, people have the freedom of speech, so naturally, everyone has different things to say.  There are books and movies that children should not read or watch, yet they do because once in the library, children can access any material. We cannot rely solely on the librarian, as they have other tasks such as arranging books, checking out items, making library cards, or helping patrons find books.  In my opinion, libraries should have separate sections for different types of movies, books, and magazines, and assign a person to each section. This way, children will be unable to access the sections meant for older people. If there are books that everyone finds offensive, people should write to the president to have those books removed from the library. Yours @NUM2.
1134	4111	2	2	Have you ever been in a situation where you couldn't read a book because someone else had an issue with it? Are you frustrated when, after waiting two months to read a book, it suddenly becomes unavailable due to its content? I certainly am, as this happens frequently at @ORGANIZATION1.  I believe a book should not be removed just because one person finds it offensive. Some novels may contain profanity or discriminatory remarks, but everyone has to deal with such content in real life. So, why remove a book from the shelf for a few vulgar words when not everyone dislikes it? If we removed a book every time someone reported a bad word or a discriminatory remark, we would have no books left, including those that teach us about history.  Some authors, movie directors, and artists rely on history to create great works of literature, commentary, or lyrics. If public and school libraries censor everything, there is a significant risk of losing a large amount of historical and epic material. As we know, many history books about the Holocaust, slavery, and the civil rights movement contain words that certain genders or races may find offensive. These words are essential for explaining the experiences of people in those situations, and for the sake of history, they should not be censored.  I am not alone in my fight to keep books on the shelf. Katherine Paterson, an author, said, '... If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In this quote, she implies that if people abuse the censorship policy, there will be no books left for anyone to read. This is what will happen if we do not manage censorship in libraries properly.  However, I do not advocate for the complete abandonment of censorship. In some cases, it is necessary. For example, a song with excessive profanity and no logical reasoning should not be available in the library. Inappropriate movies should not be distributed by libraries, as that is the role of movie rental stores. On the other hand, I have not found a single book that is completely unsuitable for the library. So, why are so many books removed each year due to what some call 'censorship' or personal opinions?  In this writing, I aimed to show that the issue of censorship has gone too far. We know that there may be offensive content, but it is something that readers of books, movies, or soundtracks have to face. In history books and movies, offensive words often have a purpose. Censorship is meant to protect, but in many cases, it has a valid reason. The only appropriate use of censorship is for inappropriate movies and songs without historical value. After all this, do you still support the current level of censorship in your local library? How can you help prevent the loss of historical knowledge in libraries?
1135	4112	2	2	I believe that things should be left as they are because they were arranged that way for a reason. People may not understand the reason, but changing them just because one finds them offensive can make the person who set them up angry. Additionally, even if the material is removed, people will watch or access it online or on TV. So, removing it won't make any difference. In conclusion, leaving the situation unchanged is the most reasonable approach as the alternative has no real - world impact.
1136	4113	2	2	I firmly believe that all materials should remain on library shelves. Different individuals have varying preferences, and what some find offensive, others may like. For instance, materials from other cultures or different religions might appeal to some but not to others. Parents should take responsibility for controlling what their children read. If they find certain materials offensive, they should guide their children to choose a different book, CD, movie, or magazine. It is the parents' fault, not the library's, if they fail to do so.  Regarding inappropriate materials, libraries can set up separate rooms for adults. To access these rooms, individuals must present identification showing they are [NUM1] or older. This way, adults can view inappropriate materials without the risk of children seeing them. Moreover, if a person under [NUM1] wants to check out such materials, a parent or guardian must accompany them. Similarly, for CDs or music with explicit language, the listener should be [NUM1] or older, or a parent should check them out.  In conclusion, I oppose the removal of materials that a few people find inappropriate. Exposure to diverse content can help us recognize the world's differences and the diversity of people's interests.
1137	4114	2	2	People around the world hold diverse opinions. Censorship is a highly debated topic, with everyone having their own stance and not all viewpoints aligning.  Libraries typically have sections divided by age, including children's, teens', and adults' sections. I believe censorship is closely related to maturity levels. Inappropriate materials for children should not be placed in the children's section. While I understand parents' concerns about their children being exposed to obscene content, as children grow, they will inevitably learn about such things in school.  I don't think materials should be removed from library shelves just because a few parents find them offensive. I don't take censorship too seriously. Some parents encourage their children to read books with inappropriate content to help them understand the real world. Many children and some teens have limited knowledge of the world due to a lack of exposure, and reading is an important way to learn. Whether for school projects or personal interest, people often go to the library to borrow books.  Most parents agree that inappropriate materials should not be in the children's section, as they don't want their young children using vulgar language. However, I think teens are mature enough to read or watch materials with some inappropriate elements, such as books with cursing or movies with kissing scenes. Parents should not dictate what goes on or off the library shelves. Instead, they can simply tell their children if a book is too offensive for them. Parents who demand the removal of books are asking for too much.  In my opinion, library censorship is not a significant issue. Children should be allowed to read the books they want, as at least they are showing an interest in reading. But as I said, everyone has their own views.
1138	4115	2	2	"I am writing to express my view that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be placed on library shelves. Allowing such materials can lead to conflicts and criminal behavior. For example, if a CD is labeled as ""Black Man's Only CD"" and a white boy picks it up, a black kid might see it and try to take it from him, potentially starting a fight.  In conclusion, to maintain a peaceful and appropriate environment in libraries, offensive materials should be removed from the shelves."
1139	4116	2	2	The issue of what should and should not be censored in libraries is a matter of opinion among library users. If everyone were to remove the materials they disliked from library shelves, a large amount of information would become inaccessible to the public. Although some people may be offended by certain forms of literature, this does not justify removing them for everyone. A solution must be found to satisfy all parties.  Currently, some people are dissatisfied with certain books, music, movies, and magazines available in libraries. They believe that some information may be unsuitable for certain viewers, especially children. While this is a valid reason for censorship, there are others who oppose it. Allowing library censorship would reduce the amount of information available to the public. Parents should be responsible for checking the materials their children borrow.  I propose that parents fill out a form before their children obtain a library card. This form should list the types of materials they want to restrict, such as books and music with swear words, and movies and magazines with nudity. This information should be linked to the library card number. If a child tries to borrow a restricted item, the librarian should ask them to choose another one.  Censorship can be useful and important, but it can also be taken to extremes. We need to find a balanced solution to address this issue.
1140	4117	2	2	"I've noticed that some library materials are inappropriate for younger age groups. For example, rated [CAPS1] movies may contain drug use, sexual content, and extreme violence. Not all libraries have movies, and those that do usually restrict the rental of rated [CAPS1] movies to people over [NUM1]. Magazines with sexual content can also mislead children into thinking that's how they should look and act as they grow up.  Libraries are typically divided into adult, teen, and children's sections. These sections are designed to indicate that some materials may not be suitable for certain age groups. The children's section is usually bright and colorful, which attracts children and keeps them from wandering into the adult or teen sections.  When I was young, I preferred the children's section, where I enjoyed reading books like ""The [CAPS3] in the [CAPS4]"" and ""[CAPS5] [CAPS6] [CAPS7] [CAPS8]."" Libraries offer many resources for children, including movies like ""[CAPS9] [PERSON1]"" and an abundance of books. Some libraries even provide toys for children.  The main problem is that younger teens may enter the adult section, and there may be inappropriate materials in the young adult section. For example, some TV shows at the library depict teens using drugs, partying, and getting drunk, which can have a negative influence on younger teens.  In conclusion, libraries should reorganize their books, movies, and magazines to ensure that each item is placed in the appropriate section. This way, people are less likely to accidentally borrow materials that are inappropriate for their age. I don't think library music is a major issue, as it is a form of self - expression. This is my perspective on library censorship."
1141	4118	2	2	In my view, books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves simply because someone deems them offensive. Offensiveness is subjective; it only exists when people perceive it as such. I hold this opinion because no one is forcing others to watch or read materials they don't desire. Students have the freedom to choose what they want to engage with. What one person finds offensive, another may find interesting and exciting. I've had similar reactions before, but that doesn't justify removing the item from the shelf. The next person has the same right as I do to access and form their own opinion about what's on the shelves. A library offers a wide range of content beyond what some may find offensive. There are scary books like 'Dracula' by Bram Stoker, a best - selling author, and mystery books like 'The Da Vinci Code' by Dan Brown, another best - selling author. In conclusion, nothing should be removed from library shelves just because I or someone else finds it offensive.
1142	4119	2	2	I firmly believe that there are certain books in a public library that should not be freely accessible to all patrons. It's true that libraries may contain some offensive materials, such as books about racism against African - Americans. However, individuals who are offended by these items are not obligated to be around them or even visit the library. The library is open to everyone. Consider a scenario where you take your young child to the public library. While you're looking for a book, the child reaches for the highest book on the shelf, pulls it down, and it lands open on the floor. You look down to find an inappropriate picture right in front of your child. In this case, the responsibility lies with you, not the library. Although the library may not always be at fault for the placement of certain books, patrons should be more vigilant and assess the area they're in. I propose that there should be a dedicated area for 'inappropriate material'. To access this area, patrons must present a membership - type identification and sign a waiver stating that the materials they borrow will not cause trouble or offend anyone around them. This is my stance on this issue, as it balances the need for access to diverse materials with the protection of those who may be sensitive to certain content.
1143	4120	2	2	Removing books from library shelves? Absolutely not! Libraries are the ideal places to find books, movies, music, and other materials that match your interests. Should some materials be removed just because they offend someone? No, libraries are meant for everyone. People are diverse, and they visit libraries to seek different types of information. If libraries removed all offensive materials, there would be little left. What offends one person may not bother another. For instance, libraries provide information on the Nazi history. Some people are interested in learning about it, while it may offend Germans who are associated with that history. However, it's selfish to take away materials that others want to learn from. Doing so would prevent future generations from accessing all the knowledge they could potentially gain. When people go to the library, they expect to find any information they're looking for. That's what makes library trips so great: discovering new things, even if they may offend others. The most important thing is to expand your knowledge on a subject. It will never be acceptable to remove materials from library shelves just because they offend some people, as libraries are for everyone.
1144	4121	2	2	Should certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines be removed from shelves if they're considered offensive? I don't think so, and there are several reasons for this. People have diverse views on what is offensive. What one person finds funny, another may consider nasty or inappropriate. If we removed all materials that someone found offensive, there would be very little left on the shelves because everyone has their own opinion. I agree that some content shouldn't be exposed to young children, but that's a parental decision. Not everyone shares the same view of the material. In conclusion, certain materials should not be removed from shelves based on one person's opinion. Everyone is unique, and what one person likes, another may dislike.
1145	4122	2	2	There are numerous books available that, upon inspection, contain obscene or vulgar content. Even though children of certain ages probably shouldn't read such materials, these books should not be banned from library shelves. Authors have a purpose for every word they write, whether it is a happy, sad, or vulgar one. There is a reason an author wants readers to encounter these so - called 'offensive' elements. Every bit of text in a book is there because the author intended it to be read, not just to fill space or be unpleasant. I concur that children should not read books with such content, but that does not mean removing the books from the library. The library in my area has separate sections for children, teens, and adults, which eliminates any confusion or concerns regarding the book's content. Patrons must meet age requirements to borrow certain materials. I believe this is an excellent approach that can satisfy both those who don't want their children exposed to such books and those who wish to read them, without removing any materials. If books were removed based on offensive content, many classic and prize - winning works, such as 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'The Catcher in the Rye', and 'J.D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey', would be taken off the shelves. Harsh actions like these are unnecessary when a simpler and more effective solution is available. Although offensive material is a concern for children, there are better ways to ensure they don't access it until they're ready. No book should be removed from a shelf because of its content.
1146	4123	2	2	I firmly hold the view that removing books, music, movies, etc., from the library shelves merely because someone deems them offensive will not resolve the issue. People may find numerous aspects of life offensive according to their personal perspectives, yet they cannot simply eliminate them. Removing such items from those who do not find them offensive could lead to chaos. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, 'And then we have no books left.' If everyone were to pick out the books, music, movies, etc., they considered offensive and have them removed from the library, this statement would likely hold true. Moreover, the library is divided into different genres. So, if one has a different opinion about a particular genre of books, movies, music, etc., they can simply skip that section and choose the genre they prefer. In essence, what offends one person may not offend another. Thus, removing a specific item would be unjust to those who like or are interested in it. Instead of solving the problem for one person, it would create dissatisfaction for two. While it may not be ideal, the library has taken measures such as separating books for this very reason. According to Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' The library has a dedicated children's section, where the books, music, movies, etc., are age - appropriate. Additionally, there are sections for teenagers and adults. In conclusion, what is offensive to some may not be offensive to others. The library does not intentionally offend anyone by having these items on the shelves. If one is mature enough to understand this and overlook potentially offensive content, they would not be so easily offended. Also, with the library's genre - based organization, one can easily avoid a particular genre. Problems can be readily solved if addressed correctly.
1147	4124	2	2	I don't think removing books from the library permanently is a good idea. What if a person only likes to read a certain type of book that might contain some so - called 'bad words'? The library can organize books into different sections. For example, they can create a kids' section, a teenagers' section, and an adults' section. This way, little kids won't be exposed to inappropriate words. The librarian can also set an age limit for checking out certain books. Just because a book has some bad words doesn't mean the whole book is bad. There are many good books with valuable information and stories that happen to have a few inappropriate words. In conclusion, instead of removing books, proper organization and age - based access can ensure that everyone can find suitable reading materials in the library.
1148	4125	2	2	The library is a place where people go for various purposes. Some visit to borrow books, while others simply seek a quiet environment to relax. Although the library is mainly associated with books and studying, it also houses many other items such as movies, magazines, and music. Imagine you need to listen to a specific song, read a particular book, or review an article in a certain magazine, but you can't find them at the library because they've been removed due to being considered offensive. People have diverse views on what is offensive. All forms of media, including books, music, magazines, and movies, should have a place in the library regardless of their content. Books serve multiple purposes. Some people read for pleasure, while others read for assignments or research. They provide essential information and knowledge. If a needed book is unavailable because someone deems its content inappropriate, it can pose a significant problem, especially for those working on research papers. A necessary book should be accessible on the library shelf, not removed because of its pages' content. Music is an excellent means of relaxation and mental clarity. Some library - available music may be offensive to certain individuals. However, if the library is the only place where you can find your favorite music, and it's removed because it's considered offensive, you'll lose access to the sounds that calm or motivate you. Music should remain in libraries due to its cultural and educational value, which may not be found at local music stores. Magazines are another valuable reading material in libraries. They help people stay updated on the latest fashions, dessert recipes, and other trends. Without magazines, it would be difficult to keep up with the world's advancements. They offer insights into the hottest trends, celebrity gossip, and educational facts. Without library magazines, our knowledge of the evolving world would be severely limited. Movies can be found everywhere, but some believe that only the library has really good and old movies. Libraries have educational movies for children that may not be available elsewhere, as well as classic old movies. In conclusion, libraries hold a wealth of important books, movies, music, and magazines. Removing these items can deprive people of valuable resources. All these resources should stay on the library shelves regardless of their content.
1149	4126	2	2	In my view, censoring literature, the very foundation of civilization, is not only unjust but also a futile attempt. It would be a grave crime against humanity to deny people access to the written word. Some may argue that censoring culture protects children, but I firmly believe this is a poor excuse. Parents should take the responsibility of guiding their children. They should set guidelines and positive examples so that children feel the need to follow them, rather than being forced. If parents fail to do so, they are neglecting their primary duty of protecting their children. Censorship is often used as a way for parents and government officials to do less work. It's impossible to please everyone when it comes to what is offensive. Every piece of literature, film, or music has offended someone in some way, whether it's spiritually, ethnically, or morally. People are prone to causing strife and misery, and they'll find various means to do so, including through the media. I am deeply appalled by the idea of censorship. If a person cannot freely express their thoughts, they become little more than mindless beings controlled by the government. In a society where free speech is restricted, it loses its essence of civilization. In conclusion, libraries should not be subject to censorship. Instead, parents should be more involved in their children's lives. If someone is offended by something, they have the right to avoid it, but they have no right to dictate what others can read.
1150	4127	2	2	The question of whether offensive materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves is one that we've all pondered. In my opinion, these offensive materials should be taken off the shelves. Firstly, age plays a significant role. Older people often find modern materials 'crazy' and want nothing to do with them, while younger people are attracted to what is new and 'cool'. I firmly believe that little kids should not be exposed to anything bad or offensive. Keeping such content away from them helps them learn not to use it in the future. My own experience shows that my parents' efforts to shield me from bad things have had a profound impact on who I am today. Secondly, beliefs, especially related to race and culture, are crucial. I frequently come across books, movies, or magazines that offend other races or cultures. This is the most disturbing aspect of some materials, and in my view, any such offensive materials should be removed immediately. There are countless such items, and it may be impossible to remove every single one. Finally, many people are unaware that the materials they are about to read, watch, or listen to will be offensive. I've encountered numerous offensive movies and songs without prior knowledge. People often approach these materials blindly. If the materials cannot be removed from the shelves, they should at least be marked as offensive. In conclusion, despite the challenges, offensive materials should be taken off the shelves. Factors like age, beliefs, and awareness make it difficult, but these materials are generally harmful to everyone.
1151	4128	2	2	Have you ever encountered offensive material in a library? Some people have and believe there should be censorship in libraries to protect those who are offended. However, I disagree with this notion. People should have the right to express themselves through art, literature, and music, as freedom of speech is enshrined in our rights.  Many authors, artists, and musicians have the freedom to express themselves through their work. If they saw their work being censored in a library, it would be highly offensive to them. While an artist's material might be offensive to certain individuals, it is a form of self - expression. They don't publish their work to offend but for self - fulfillment and for others to enjoy. An artist's work is an integral part of who they are, and censorship would cast a negative shadow on the art and literature in libraries.  Over the years, most libraries have developed a system called @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to organize their media. This system categorizes books, magazines, music, and movies into different genres. For instance, if you're looking for a mystery book, you'd find it in the non - fiction section. This system helps people locate exactly what they want. Those who are offended by a particular genre can avoid it. It's a better alternative to censorship, and almost every library uses this system.  Wherever we go, someone is bound to find something offensive. It's part of human nature, and it's impossible to please everyone. In a library, there will always be a book that someone dislikes or finds offensive. The author and the readers who enjoy the book shouldn't be punished by having the book removed from the shelves. Just because a book offends one person doesn't mean it should be censored or removed. If that were the case, there would be no books left in libraries, and it wouldn't even be a library anymore.  In conclusion, books are books, and music is music. We shouldn't introduce censorship or remove books from shelves just because they're offensive to some. Authors write what they want, musicians play what they want, and actors act as they wish. People will have to accept that not everything will align with their sensibilities, and there's no need for censorship in libraries.
1152	4129	2	2	It's true that everyone has their own preferences and likes and dislikes. Take books, for example. I don't like books about illegal substances, but I firmly believe that offensive materials shouldn't be removed from library shelves. While it's true that an inappropriate book or article can be disturbing to some, it doesn't mean everyone finds it offensive.  Once, in my @CAPS4 class, we were assigned a book project. The goal was to find a non - fiction book and create a PowerPoint presentation on its main ideas. One classmate presented on a book about illegal drugs. I know that not many people are offended by words like 'drugs' or 'alcohol', but I find them obnoxious. While I was disturbed and uncomfortable, others found the topic interesting. It was appealing to them but not to me.  Another time, I went to the library to write a research paper on human body systems. My friend @LOCATION1 found pictures of blood disturbing. Strangely, I've never found blood disturbing. While @PERSON1 was revolted by the pictures, I was engrossed in the book because I find the human body fascinating. @PERSON1 didn't try to deal with the pictures but instead went off to find another book without grotesque images. That book was useless to @LOCATION1, but it helped me get an 'A' on my research paper.  I believe it's important for people to accept that everyone has different opinions. Every individual is unique. As I've mentioned, a book that disturbs me might interest others, and vice versa. This is normal, and there's no way to change it. If we were to remove every offensive material for each person, there would be nothing left on the library shelves. I think the best solution is for people to ignore offensive books and look for other materials, as others might need those resources.
1153	4130	2	2	I firmly believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. A library is supposed to be a helpful place, and offensive content has no place in it. For example, who would want to watch a racist movie in a library, or let a child watch a sexually explicit movie? Magazines and music can also cause a lot of problems.  If a young adult or child reads or watches racist content, it can teach them bad things. Racism is extremely hurtful. What we see or read can have a profound impact on us, and we may not even realize it's wrong. It could lead us to say hurtful things to people of different races. Even non - racist people can be offended by such content and may end up saying racist things, only to feel guilty later. Movies that make fun of one's race are a form of bullying, which can even lead to suicide. Public libraries should ban such movies.  Today's movies can contain sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can watch these movies without much supervision. The librarian just swipes the card, and the kids get the movie. They may not know right from wrong. If they see drug use or sexual activities in movies, they might think it's cool and try it themselves. We need to make it harder for kids to access such movies in public libraries. These movies can also offend us and make us feel like we have to try these things.  Magazines today portray people as perfect. These images can be offensive, especially to young teenage girls and boys. When they see someone like @PERSON1 in a magazine, they may become jealous and want to look like her. They may starve themselves to be skinny, which is very dangerous to their health. Magazines can damage our confidence, and we should learn to love who we are and accept our uniqueness.  Music today can also be offensive. Some rap, country, or rock songs have lyrics that can really hurt people. For example, a song by @ORGANIZATION1 called 'I must be emo' makes fun of people who self - harm and are unique. Depression and self - harm are serious issues, and making fun of them is unacceptable. Such songs should be removed from public libraries.  In conclusion, we should have a say in what's in our public libraries. The library is meant to be a positive place. People are unique, and if something offends them, they have the right to speak up. We need to make it more difficult to access offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., so that everyone can have a better library experience.
1154	4131	2	2	Would you censor the @CAPS1? I certainly wouldn't. The @CAPS1 is a precious and religious part of our nation's history, and it's just one example. There are thousands of books, newspapers, articles, and media that play a crucial role in human history and the future.  Common sense isn't something we acquire out of nowhere. We absorb it through what we do, see, and read. Take 'The @CAPS4 @CAPS5' as an example. In this book, a @CAPS5 meets a young boy and is overjoyed to be of use to him. Throughout the story, the @CAPS5 gives the boy its apple, branches, and even its trunk, and it's happy to do so. At the end, the former young boy is an old man who just wants a place to rest, and the @CAPS5 straightens its stump to provide that rest and is content with giving the old man happiness. Would you censor such a story? It reflects that helping others is a key to life and that bringing happiness to others is the true gift of life.  Religion is often censored these days, but why? The @CAPS1, for instance, is a collection of short stories that offer reminders of right and wrong, kindness and jealousy. It doesn't demand that we follow every word, but rather provides helpful advice. Everyone asks for advice at some point. There's a trend that tries to tell us through TV, schools, and other places that we don't need religion to be productive and honest. As someone from a Roman Catholic and Christian background, I wasn't very involved in religion until a close friend influenced me.  However, censorship can have its benefits. For example, protecting minors from adult - type content is helpful since kids don't understand much. Another example is censoring mail sent to different countries, which helps keep our country safe from invasion and war.  In conclusion, censorship can be a good thing, but too much of it is bad. Censoring religious content or classical books that teach common knowledge for future generations is not a good idea. These are things that should be passed down through ages.
1155	4132	2	2	Yes, I think libraries should be shut down. Music, movies, etc. in libraries not only may have inappropriate attire but also contain foul language. This kind of language can corrupt the minds of young people. Libraries stock such materials to meet customer demands and make money. Do you agree with this practice?  Libraries should create separate spaces for different types of readers. Instead, they put all these materials in the same building. They should offer discounts on kids' movies instead of adult ones, but librarians just say 'books are books'. I might even write my own @CAPS1 series.  Some libraries close down because of a dull environment or lack of customers. We should think about this situation. I wonder if there are books about endangered fish species. Some kids' series are dying out because of more popular ones or are being replaced by family stories.  If a little kid hears cursing, their mind can be permanently warped. Imagine a chic cursing in front of a baby or saying '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 that?' or '@CAPS4 that ball, you meanie!' Is this the kind of 'education' we want?  Some older boys and girls are teaching bad language to younger kids, sometimes even before they learn good language. These delinquents don't care about the young minds at all. I have evidence of this, and I suggest re - educating these teenage delinquents to act more @CAPS1.  In conclusion, due to the presence of inappropriate content in libraries and the negative influence it can have on young people, along with the management issues in libraries, there are valid reasons to consider shutting them down. And we need to address the problem of delinquents teaching bad language to the young.
1156	4133	2	2	In a world full of diverse cultures, languages, beliefs, and races, it's inevitable that different subjects will be offensive to some but not to others. Books, songs, magazines, and movies are all created with specific purposes, such as to entertain, inform, or persuade. Libraries serve as a source for people to access these works, with many individuals visiting daily for research or simply to gain knowledge for enjoyment. In my view, any type of material, regardless of its content, should be available on library shelves. A library is a place where people can find books, CDs, videos, magazines, or any other subject that interests them.  If libraries were to remove every item that offended someone, there would be no library left. Every item one reads or listens to is likely to contain a word, sentence, or meaning that may offend someone. This is because many items are, to some extent, biased. An author's attempt to entertain might offend if they use certain language with a particular tone. Persuasion is often one - sided, and readers may not agree with the author's chosen stance. The same goes for informative works; readers may feel that an author did not address a certain point adequately.  I once visited a library and read a magazine that criticized teenage drivers. The article was clearly biased as it lacked input from teenagers to show that not all teen drivers are bad. Although it deeply offended me, I'm glad I read it as it allowed me to see a different perspective. Not everyone wants to explore different viewpoints, but if one encounters an offensive item, they can simply put it back on the shelf. One is not obligated to read or listen to something they don't want to. However, there may be someone who needs that item for personal knowledge or research.  Therefore, all items should be accessible to the public. If someone finds an item offensive, they should be able to request a label on it to warn other readers. Similarly, for items rated 'Mature', an age limit should be set to protect young readers and listeners. With these measures in place, libraries can satisfy everyone.  Since libraries are present in most communities, there will always be discussions about the content of the items they carry. What one person likes, another may find offensive. Even if an individual has an issue with an item, it should still be available to all. The purpose of a library is to provide materials that benefit the public. Every person has the right to visit a library and read about any subject they desire. Whether an item is biased or not, it should be on library shelves. Those who don't agree with or don't want to read an item can simply avoid that section and choose something else. A well - functioning library allows people to find what they need or want, thus serving the community effectively.
1157	4134	2	2	A library is an excellent resource for acquiring knowledge and wisdom. At a local library, one can find a wide variety of books, ranging from documentaries to science - fiction and regular fiction. The best part about a library is that readers have the freedom to choose what they read. However, if one person opposes the view in a book and insists on its removal from the library, this freedom of choice is lost. Reading selection should be open to all readers. Heavy censorship of libraries is an unnecessary measure that restricts the ability to gain knowledge, despite some people's disagreement.  In modern society, people have diverse tastes and preferences. It can be challenging to find common ground in a large group. The library is a place where people can embrace their differences by reading different types of books on the many shelves. One person's dislike for a book should not lead to its removal based on personal preference. Author Katherine Paterson made a profound statement about censorship: 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books' (no pag.). If one person deems a work vulgar and wants it removed, there is nothing to stop others from removing books they dislike. If heavy censorship is allowed in libraries, they will become limited resources, containing only a few documents.  Nonetheless, censoring age - specific materials in libraries is necessary. Allowing a child to access inappropriate books, movies, or other materials is unacceptable. However, censoring books for children does not mean removing them. Removing a book from the library shelf is as wrong as letting a child read a book that is too mature for their age. Katherine Paterson also said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (no pag.). Censoring books in libraries should not result in the removal of works that have shaped society and ideas, even to protect children. A balance must be found between true censorship and the opinion - based removal of books. This will benefit both libraries and society.  In modern society, people have different opinions due to differences in beliefs and ideas. Disagreements are inevitable, but it's important for people to respect each other's right to choose what to read. Libraries enable people to make these choices and expand their knowledge. Literature, whether in a library or at home, should never be discarded because of someone else's opinion. Censorship of libraries should be considered, but not at the expense of knowledge. Libraries should not be over - censored.
1158	4135	2	2	I firmly believe that removing certain materials from the library is a bad idea. Some students need the information in these materials to write reports or prepare for finals. The library exists for students to take advantage of and spend time looking up what they need for their classes. I always make sure to put in the time to understand what is required for my reports in class so that I can do them correctly, rather than just adding random information.  It is crucial to keep materials in the library for convenience. For example, if you are writing for a newspaper, you need to access as much information as possible to keep students informed about celebrities' lives. Also, when students are about to graduate, they may need to look up different colleges online before leaving [ORGANIZATION1] to be prepared for the real world and start achieving things that their parents may not have had the chance to do.  The library can also inspire readers. For instance, reading a book about cancer can show how the sun and tanning beds can cause skin cancer and damage the skin, making a person look older. I think the library should be used for our education and personal benefit. Reading books is often more interesting than watching TV shows or movies, as books can provide more details.  In conclusion, the library is a valuable resource that should be maintained with a wide range of materials. It helps students in their studies, keeps people informed, and enriches our knowledge. We should not limit access to library materials based on personal opinions.
1159	4136	2	2	To be honest, it doesn't really matter to me what's in the library because I only go when my school teacher tells me to. But libraries should be able to put whatever they want on the shelves. They're divided into sections for kids, young adults, and adults. If someone doesn't like what they see on a shelf, they don't have to look at it or check it out. Just because one person doesn't like a book doesn't mean others won't.  Libraries don't force people to look at or borrow things they don't want. So, I don't understand why people are complaining. You can check out books, movies, and music for free, as long as you don't keep them overdue. People should stop complaining about what's on the library shelves.  In the end, libraries are there to offer a variety of choices. Everyone has different tastes, and the library should respect that. Instead of complaining, people should just pick what they like and leave the rest alone.
1160	4137	2	2	In [LOCATION1] on [DATE1], there are numerous libraries open to the public, housing an endless amount of information. This wealth of information provides us with many opportunities in life to explore new paths and courses. However, we must consider the possibility that some of this information may have a negative influence. What if certain information changes people's perspectives and identities? Libraries do contain offensive and provocative books, movies, and other items that could potentially harm human behavior.  Given that the people in [LOCATION1] come from diverse backgrounds, making the area highly diverse, censorship in libraries should be established. What may not be offensive to one person could be offensive to another. Magazines, movies, books, etc., should be evaluated to determine their appropriateness for people of certain ages. This can be achieved by creating a children's section for books and movies or by providing knowledgeable assistance to help people find suitable materials.  Sections in libraries help organize the space and make it easier to locate items. There are also search engines in libraries to assist people in finding information. Dividing libraries into sections based on age has the advantage of separating mature and immature content. Usually, children have their own section for children's books, while older and more mature adults or teenagers have a separate area to gather important information. For example, if there were a book about drugs and alcohol in the children's section, children would be confused as they don't understand these concepts. They might learn bad things and, being curious, might be tempted to try dangerous things. This is common sense. While sections in libraries create organization, personal assistance can also be very helpful.  Personal assistance in libraries is valuable, but the assistants must be mature, understanding, and aware that there are offensive materials in libraries. If someone is looking for information and the book contains inappropriate content, the assistant can inform them. There is a vast amount of information in libraries, and I believe there will always be books on the shelves for people to learn from. Every time I visit a library, there are plenty of books, and the assistants help me find what I'm looking for. They warn me about offensive content and treat me with respect. They can prevent confusion about books and movies.  Personally, I think freedom of speech is relevant in libraries. Writers and authors share facts and opinions, and people learn about subjects they're interested in. Censorship in libraries is necessary to inform people, but assistants don't have the right to prevent someone from reading a particular book just because it's inappropriate or provocative. Everyone in [LOCATION1] has the right to read what they want. However, some measures should be taken, especially regarding minors, to avoid potential issues. But there shouldn't be a law that completely bans a child from reading something. No book should be discarded because every word, no matter how ridiculous it may seem, can make us think and help us make decisions in life. Factual information, even if offensive, is part of our knowledge - building process.  In conclusion, there should be a reasonable level of censorship in libraries. While everyone has the right to read whatever they want, considering the diverse nature of the population and the potential harm of some materials, appropriate measures like sectioning and personal assistance can ensure that libraries remain a safe and useful resource for all.
1161	4138	2	2	If your library were to be censored, what would you think? Do you believe that library censorship is justifiable? I'm here to share my views on library censorship. In my opinion, there should be some form of censorship, but we shouldn't penalize everyone by completely removing books from the shelves. As an adult, I wouldn't want my child to borrow overly graphic books, magazines, etc., but I also wouldn't want to restrict their entire world. Individual - based censorship is also a viable option. For instance, parents could come to the library and decide what level of censorship to apply to their child's library card. This kind of censorship would assist parents in monitoring what their children read and watch. Personal censorship, as I've mentioned, would prevent children from accessing age - inappropriate, graphic novels without offending parents. Regarding rated - X magazines, movies, etc., they shouldn't be removed from the library but rather relocated to a secluded area where children can't access them. This would avoid offending parents when they bring their children in. However, book censorship can sometimes be excessive. Many books contain graphic parts, yet they are also great reads with valuable morals. Graphic elements in books are like those in real life; they are inevitable. If a child, teenager, or anyone is mature enough to read a book, it shouldn't be removed from the shelves. Just because a book is offensive to some doesn't mean others won't want to read it. Trying to please some by censoring may anger others. Libraries also have a form of built - in censorship. They are organized by book categories, and some books are classified according to the intended age group. This is more evident for younger readers. As readers reach higher reading levels, they are usually mature enough to choose what they think is appropriate to read. All in all, libraries don't need extensive censorship, except for personal censorship for younger patrons. There's no need to punish those who simply want to borrow items from the library and have done no wrong to the community.
1162	4139	2	2	Media sources are ubiquitous in our daily lives, including newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. Media serves to inform citizens about events and provide entertainment. However, many media materials contain photos, language, and other elements that some citizens may find offensive. Offensive media materials should not be removed from circulation. In the @ORGANIZATION1, citizens enjoy the freedom of speech. Censorship deprives authors, directors, singers, and other producers of this fundamental right. If the government enforces censorship laws, people are restricted from expressing their true feelings and opinions on various subjects. Moreover, citizens' right to choose what to watch and listen to is also violated. People have diverse opinions on what should and should not be censored in media materials. Parents and certain groups play a significant role in promoting censorship. They often complain that books, television shows, and other media are offensive and harmful to their children and demand their removal. I believe that if parents are concerned about what their children are viewing, they should take personal responsibility by restricting their children's access to such materials instead of advocating for broad - scale censorship that affects everyone. Parents and certain groups shouldn't deprive the rest of the world of the right to choose what to watch and read. Censorship can cover a wide range of content, from photos to news reports. Those who advocate for censoring offensive materials for young viewers and others fail to recognize that people will encounter such content at some point in their lives. Sometimes, to understand major world events, such as the death of @LOCATION2, one needs to grasp the associated violence and forces. If this content is censored, citizens won't fully understand the real story. Censorship affects people of all ages, depriving them of knowledge and understanding. Due to the violation of citizens' freedom of speech and rights, censorship should not be allowed in the @LOCATION1 and other parts of the world.
1163	4140	2	2	I think that certain materials like books, music, movies, magazines, etc., can be removed from the shelves in some cases. For example, @CAPS1 can be removed when cleaning the shelves. But generally, I don't believe they should be removed unless the shelves are overcrowded and it becomes necessary. I'm a @CAPS2, and I always strive to do the right thing. My parents assign me household chores every day, and I think these should be prioritized over other activities. I find it absurd to remove books and other items from the shelves without good reason. Removing items from the shelves isn't inherently bad, but it doesn't need to be done constantly. Some people may choose to do so, but it's not my preference. I always try to be obedient and well - behaved around others. In conclusion, while there are situations where shelf - clearing might be needed, it shouldn't be a regular practice.
1164	4141	2	2	Should a library have the right to remove a book or a movie from its shelves if someone finds it offensive? In my view, the answer is no. Since everyone in the world could potentially find something in a library offensive, if a library were to remove every piece of literature or art that someone deems offensive, its shelves would be empty. We've all witnessed people getting offended by seemingly trivial things like children's novels, magazine pictures, and song lyrics. I've seen people become extremely angry because of a piece of literature or art. However, I've also realized that what one person finds offensive, another might find beautiful. For example, paintings of nude figures are considered inappropriate and disturbing by some, while others see them as masterpieces. Everyone has their own opinions, and it's not the library's responsibility to judge which opinions are right or wrong. There's no way to avoid offending someone without completely emptying a library. Anything can be offensive to someone. I personally found some books on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 disturbing due to their graphic content. But that doesn't mean others shouldn't have the opportunity to read them. Offensive literature and art are often the best because they evoke emotions and make people think, even if the emotions aren't the intended ones. We learn a lot when we're confronted with something that stirs strong emotions. In today's society and culture, both in the @LOCATION1 and around the world, someone is bound to be offended every day. Religious groups may be offended by a book cover or magazine pictures, and political leaders may be offended by journalists' writings. It's truly surprising that libraries are still concerned about censorship when television shows are filled with sex, drugs, and violence. People are offended by TV shows, but they're still being aired. Similarly, offensive books, pictures, and music are still being consumed. If a library removes every offensive piece of literature and art, there will be nothing left. A beautiful creation for one person may bring back painful memories for another, but that doesn't make it a bad creation. A disturbing novel may teach us more than we've ever learned. We should realize that just because something is offensive to someone doesn't make it wrong. People shouldn't have the right to deprive others of the chance to experience offensive literature and art.
1165	4142	2	2	Everyone has their favorite music and books, even if they might offend certain groups. People continue to read and listen to these materials. Authors and songwriters are simply expressing themselves, and I believe that offensive content should not be censored as it's a form of self - expression. I listen to music as long as I like the sound. The lyrics don't really matter to me, and I'm sure many people feel the same way. However, some songs resonate with people, and they actually pay attention to the lyrics. I'm quite selective about the books I read, so I don't read a lot. But many people love reading because it takes them to a different world and offers an escape from everyday life, which I can understand. Movies are similar to books but offer a visual experience, making them more entertaining for many. However, movies often lack the detailed content of books, so books can be more fulfilling. Just because someone dislikes a movie doesn't mean others won't enjoy it. In conclusion, everyone has different preferences. Just because someone doesn't like something doesn't mean others won't. People are diverse, and so should the materials they read, watch, and listen to. We should respect the right of everyone to access a wide variety of media, regardless of whether it offends some individuals.
1166	4143	2	2	As a teenager, I am in the process of self - growth and self - discovery, seeking ways to express myself. I firmly believe that certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should not be censored in libraries. Everyone holds different opinions on the music we listen to or the books we read.   I do think that younger children, such as middle - schoolers and preschoolers, should be protected from violent songs and movies. However, for high - schoolers and older individuals, the choice should be ours. If libraries truly consider a book or magazine offensive, they should prevent its publication in the first place. Not everyone will like every book or type of music available. We should have the right to access the books we like from libraries. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries remove books, music, etc. because they find them offensive, there will be nothing left for us to read or listen to.  I am of the view that high - schoolers and older people should be able to decide for themselves what books to read and what music to listen to. If you don't like a particular type of music, simply don't listen to it; if you don't like the way a book is written, don't read it. No one is forcing you to consume content you don't want. What may be offensive to some can be eye - opening to others. In books, we learn about war and other gruesome aspects of life, but these are often real - life facts.  In conclusion, I believe libraries should only censor materials that are offensive to parents with younger children in the younger sections of libraries. This way, the rights and needs of different age groups can be respected.
1167	4144	2	2	I am of the opinion that certain materials should not be removed from library shelves. Libraries are established to offer people a wide range of media resources. Censoring library materials will lead to three significant issues: loss of business, inconvenience, and a reduction in people's book selections.  Firstly, to remain operational, libraries rely on people using their multimedia materials, including books, magazines, and music. Many people visit libraries to access specific magazines, movies, etc. Removing certain materials will result in the loss of customers. A decline in business due to censorship will lead to fewer customers checking out multimedia items, which may ultimately force the library to close. Since no one wants their local library to shut down, libraries should not be censored.  Secondly, instead of having the entire library censored, parents can take the responsibility of censoring what their children borrow from libraries. One approach is to have local libraries impose restrictions on young children's library cards. For example, a thirteen - year - old child may be restricted to borrowing movies rated @CAPS2 or @NUM1 movies and not be allowed to check out @CAPS1 - rated movies. Another option is for an adult to monitor what the child borrows. For instance, if a thirteen - year - old wants to borrow @NUM1 movies, the adult can limit them to one at a time. This can reduce the risk of offending parents or guardians.  Finally, if censorship is carried out, there will be little left in libraries. It is likely that at least one person will be offended by each book in the library. But this does not mean all libraries should close. If a particular item in the local library offends someone, they can simply avoid it and not borrow that book, movie, or magazine. Also, if the materials in a library go against someone's beliefs or religion, they can choose not to visit that library. Libraries play an important role in helping people expand their knowledge, so they should not be censored.  In conclusion, libraries should not be subject to excessive censorship. The focus should be on parental guidance for younger children, and the overall availability of diverse materials in libraries should be maintained.
1168	4145	2	2	The freedom of choice is a fundamental right that everyone should possess, similar to the freedom to choose what clothes to wear. I firmly believe that libraries should not implement censorship because everyone has the right to make their own choices. Moreover, there are alternative ways to prevent children from accessing inappropriate books without completely removing them from the library.  First, eighteen - year - olds are considered adults in our society and should have the right to read any books they choose. They can enter @CAPS1 - rated movies, which are likely as controversial as some books. In today's society, eighteen - year - olds have a great deal of freedom and can make most of their own decisions. For example, they can search for any information on the internet, and so can people of all ages. Even if a book is unavailable in libraries, they can probably obtain it online. Therefore, with modern technology, censorship in libraries would be ineffective.  Second, there are methods to prevent children from reading inappropriate books other than removing the books from the shelves. If parents are concerned about their children's reading materials, they can accompany their children to the library and guide them on what they can and cannot read. If parents do not censor their children's reading, it may indicate that they trust their children to make their own choices. The decision about what a child reads should be between the parent and the child.  Finally, there are numerous things in the world that can be offensive to people, not just books. People often offend each other with their words, which can lead to conflicts. Television also contains inappropriate shows, including those related to racism or body - shaming. These shows are accessible to everyone, yet we do not remove them from the airwaves. Therefore, we should not remove books from library shelves just because there is a possibility of offending someone, as people can be offended by many other things.  In conclusion, library books, magazines, and movies should not be removed from the shelves simply because they may be inappropriate for some children. Eighteen - year - olds should have the freedom to choose their reading materials. Parents can take on the responsibility of monitoring their children's reading if they are concerned. Since people are offended by various things in daily life, books, magazines, and movies should not be singled out for censorship.
1169	4146	2	2	In modern times, libraries offer a wide variety of media beyond books, such as music, movies, and magazines. The question arises: should certain offensive materials be removed from library shelves? I firmly believe they should not. Even if there are things that we don't want children to know, they will inevitably learn about them in the future. Once we start removing materials from the shelves, more and more information will be eliminated, and eventually, there will be nothing left for the children in the libraries.  Children acquire knowledge from various sources, including parents, books, and other media. Parents want their children to learn as much as possible, but there are certain things they prefer their children not to know. However, since children will grow into adults and will eventually encounter these things, there is no point in removing them from library shelves. Removing materials does not effectively prevent children from learning about them.  Katherine Paterson, a well - known author, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' I wholeheartedly agree with her. Once books or other media are removed for one reason, others will follow suit for different reasons. As she said, if we keep removing materials, there will be nothing left for the children in the libraries. And if there is nothing for the children, what is the purpose of having libraries?  In conclusion, certain materials like books, music, and magazines should not be removed from library shelves when they are considered offensive. Children need to learn about these things to grow into adults, and removing them will leave the libraries empty for the next generation.
1170	4147	2	2	The question of whether offensive materials on library shelves should be removed is an important one. I firmly believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines that some people find offensive should remain on the shelves. These materials are perceived differently by different people.  One of the main reasons offensive materials should not be removed is that what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. People have diverse perspectives. For example, a woman might find a particular book disturbing, while a man beside her could find it interesting and useful. Since no two people are exactly the same, not everyone will be offended by the same thing.  Furthermore, if someone is offended by a particular item on the shelf, they are not obliged to look at it, purchase it, or pay attention to it. The material is not placed there with the intention of offending anyone; it is there for those who are interested in it. People have the freedom to choose whether or not to engage with a particular item.  In conclusion, I do not think offensive materials should be taken off the shelves. People have the right to access the things they enjoy. A material should not be removed just because one person is offended by it. Different people have their own views and opinions, and we should respect this diversity in the context of library materials.
1171	4148	2	2	I firmly believe that removing certain materials from libraries due to their perceived offensiveness is unjustified. The freedom of speech, as enshrined in the relevant laws, allows authors to express their thoughts freely in books and magazine articles. Once these works are placed on library shelves, they should remain there. Just because a particular group or individual finds a work offensive does not give them the right to remove it. After all, the author is exercising their right to speak their mind.  In modern magazines, there are often elements that some people, such as celebrities and sports stars, may find offensive. However, they do not go to libraries to remove these magazines. If one intends to remove a book or magazine, they should consult others, as different people may have different views on the material. Continuously removing books from library shelves would leave us with little to read, learn from, and pass down through generations. When encountering offensive reading materials, one should simply put them back on the shelf and move on. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of ideas and the right of free expression in libraries, and not let the sensitivities of a few limit access to knowledge and creativity.
1172	4149	2	2	I don't think certain materials, like books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from shelves just because they're considered offensive. Nowadays, many kids get involved in gang - related activities because they see their parents, older siblings, or friends doing so and think it's cool. Teens these days don't really care about the content of movies or music, and not all of it is offensive, so we can't blame the media for this situation.  We, as parents, are to blame for allowing our children to watch inappropriate movies and listen to uncut music. We've chosen this lifestyle for them, so we can't point fingers at the music and movie producers. These producers are just trying to make a living, and they don't really care who watches their content or what impact it has on children, just like some parents don't.  If parents change the way they raise their children, the world could be a better place. Just because some people think offensive movies, music, or magazines should be removed, it doesn't mean it's the fault of the content. It's the parents' choice to decide whether their children can watch or listen to such things. In conclusion, instead of removing offensive materials, we should focus on parental guidance and responsibility to ensure that children are exposed to appropriate content.
1173	4150	2	2	When entering a library, it's concerning to see children accessing books, movies, and magazines that may be inappropriate. However, I believe it's not the authors' fault for including offensive language in their works. I understand that parents may be upset if their children are exposed to such content.  In my opinion, students and adults should have the right to choose what they read. If a book is offensive to them, they should stop reading it. They should be able to determine whether the content is harmful. The purpose of library censorship is to provide suitable reading materials for everyone.  I don't think libraries should ban anything because these materials may be useful to someone. It's hard to imagine that libraries would remove every offensive item, as many of them may have a low - rated content. If people find a book offensive, they should simply choose another one. Authors work hard on their books and go through the publishing process.  I firmly believe that items should not be removed from library shelves just because the content is inappropriate for some. My views may change when I'm older and have children of my own, but for now, I oppose the removal of items from library shelves. In conclusion, we should balance the freedom of access to information and the need to protect the sensibilities of different readers in libraries.
1174	4151	2	2	I firmly believe that we shouldn't remove certain materials from libraries. Taking away books that offer learning experiences would leave us with very little. Everyone in life should have the freedom to make their own choices, and we shouldn't limit them. People should have the right to read the books, magazines, etc. they want, without being judged for the material they consume. What one person may think is a bad read, another may think is great.  Music is a creative aspect of our world, and just as no two people are the same, neither should music be. Everyone has their own taste in music. If a person is of the right age and not hurting anyone, there's no problem in listening to music that inspires creativity.  There are movies that some parents may think are not suitable for their kids. However, we should focus more on what our kids are doing rather than what they're watching. Every movie has a hidden lesson. Some real - life solutions may be found in movies that are rated highly. We should focus on the lessons movies teach rather than their ratings.  Children need to make their own choices and discover what interests them. We shouldn't ban everything we think is inappropriate. We need to let children grow and learn independently. We can't force someone to read, watch, or listen to what we want them to. In conclusion, we should let everyone, not just kids, have the choices they desire. As the world changes, our ideas should change with it.
1175	4152	2	2	Katherine Paterson's view in her quote is quite reasonable. If we censor books, libraries would have little to offer. In fact, it's possible to find something offensive in every book. I somewhat agree with her, but I also believe there should be rules regarding the placement of books.  Books are meant to be read, and taking them away would be a disaster for book - lovers. There is a debate about how books should be arranged in libraries. Personally, I think children's books should be placed on the opposite side of the building from adult books. This would mostly prevent children from accessing age - inappropriate material. Teenage reading material should be separate from both children's and adult books, so that teenagers aren't exposed to things beyond their understanding. This arrangement would ease parents' concerns about their children finding inappropriate reading material.  Books that some people find offensive should be categorized, such as into specific groups. By doing so, we can prevent most situations where people might be offended. Although there will still be times when people come across these books and get offended, we must do our best to limit such occurrences.  At the same time, we shouldn't remove offensive books from library shelves. Removing a book means losing a piece of knowledge or life lessons that are hard to teach without experiencing them. Books offer us knowledge, entertainment, and comfort. They are important to everyone, whether they realize it or not. We have a lot to learn from books and can pass on a wealth of knowledge to future generations through them.  I support Katherine Paterson's belief that removing books from libraries defeats the purpose of having them. We can find ways to reduce the chances of people being offended without removing books. Removing books would destroy years of knowledge, past thoughts, and experiences. Books should never be removed from libraries just because they might be considered inappropriate. In conclusion, we should strive to balance access to diverse knowledge and the protection of people's sensibilities in libraries.
1176	4153	2	2	I firmly believe that no one should have the power to take away certain books or other forms of media, as people have diverse preferences. There could be someone who genuinely wants to read a particular book, so it's unjust to remove it. When I was in sixth grade, I was placed in a foster home that I detested. The foster parents prohibited me from listening to the music I loved, deeming it inappropriate for kids. They only wanted me to listen to Christian music, which I disliked. They even tried to take away things they considered to be the 'devil' in me and made me read the Bible every night, forcing their religion on me. This experience might be one of the reasons why I'm not religious today. For instance, they wouldn't let me listen to a band because one of their songs was about a girl's husband having an affair. Everyone should have the right to their own opinion and be able to choose what they like to read, listen to, or watch. When parents are overly strict, it often makes kids want to do the opposite of what they're told. If people are restricted from accessing the content they desire, it becomes difficult for them to express themselves and showcase their true interests. This is clearly wrong, and everyone should have the freedom to express themselves and pursue their likes.
1177	4154	2	2	One of the amendments in the Constitution of the United States is the freedom of speech. This amendment grants the right of free speech to anyone with something to say, as long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others. Although the Constitution of the United States was signed long ago, questions regarding this subject still persist. A particularly contentious issue is whether people should be allowed to censor books. This matter has been debated throughout human history and has remained a highly controversial topic for many years. Some argue that individuals should have the right to censor books they find offensive. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that if everyone had the power to censor books they disliked, there would be no books left in the world. Given the vast diversity of cultures, ethnicities, and the wide - reaching nature of the global population, writing a book that appeals to everyone and is non - offensive is an almost impossible task. On Earth, we live in a very diverse society. Over the decades and centuries, literature has adapted to different customs, cultures, and religions, enabling people to find books they enjoy. People's ways of life may vary, but just as literature has adapted, we should respect and accept these differences. It's similar to school, where we're taught to accept students who are different from us. Despite numerous articles written on this topic, it will continue to be a subject of intense debate because everyone has their own opinions. Some think censorship is a good idea, while others believe in the right to diverse ways of living. The issue will persist because of our inherent differences in viewpoints.
1178	4155	2	2	In my opinion, censorship in libraries is a complex issue. On one hand, it's not a good idea because it restricts people from reading what they want. I'm an avid reader of World War II books and a wide variety of other materials. If books are removed just because they're considered offensive, I'll have nothing to read. When I come across an offensive book, I simply put it back. On the other hand, I think age - rating for books, movies, and magazines is necessary. Kids don't need to be exposed to content related to drugs, alcohol, and murder. While I don't think music is a major concern, music videos can sometimes be inappropriate. Movies can also go too far, and I wouldn't want my kids watching offensive ones. So, I wouldn't mind if offensive movies were removed from the shelves. However, I don't think books should be taken off the shelf. Parents should be aware of what their kids are reading. I always check books or magazines before getting them for my kids, and other parents should do the same. Since there will always be offensive books and movies, it's the parents' responsibility to ensure their kids don't access such materials.
1179	4156	2	2	"I firmly believe that other materials in libraries, such as music and art, should remain available in public and school libraries. They carry symbolic meaning that reflects the ever - changing world. People have diverse beliefs, and it's a fact that everyone has different opinions about everything. It's fine for individuals to hold their own beliefs, but they shouldn't impose their views on others. The saying, ""If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all"" should be remembered. During my school years, there were no protests about certain reading materials in public libraries because the library provided people with the books they wanted to read. For example, if a person wants to read about the fall of the Berlin Wall and the library refuses to carry such historical material, the person will be understandably angry. Even though they can find the book elsewhere, it should be available in the library as it represents important world history. Trying to censor such historical content is similar to destroying the history that people risked their lives to create and be recognized for. I hope this essay makes the protesters reconsider the topic they're arguing about. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of materials in libraries and allow people to access the knowledge they seek."
1180	4157	2	2	I am of the opinion that libraries should refrain from censoring their literature. All forms of media are a rich source of knowledge waiting to be explored. No one should have the authority to determine what is appropriate for the public to know. The right to decide what is suitable lies with each individual, enabling them to make choices according to their own judgment. Over thousands of years, media has expanded at an astonishing rate through various forms such as books, music, movies, and magazines. From this media, we have learned valuable lessons from past trials and failures, which we still apply today. Media serves as a constant reminder of our past mistakes, helping us avoid repeating them. The remarkable thing about today's media is that we have yet to fully exhaust all the knowledge it can offer. Some media content may not be entirely appropriate, but we can still learn a great deal from it. If certain content upsets someone, they should simply avoid it. It's unjust to eliminate parts of the media because what one person finds immoral or wrong may be a learning opportunity for another. If people are offended by some material, they should steer clear of it rather than getting it removed for everyone. Media is extremely powerful and should not be censored. It has an immeasurable impact on the world, and we have only scratched the surface of what it can achieve. Therefore, we should embrace the full spectrum of media and not attempt to hide any part of it.
1181	4158	2	2	I firmly believe that no materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, should be removed from the shelves simply because they are deemed offensive. Katherine claims, 'I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor.' While she may possess such a right, others also have a say in this matter. People should have the freedom to read, listen to, watch, and view what they like. Even if certain materials do not convey positive messages, I still think they should not be removed. Although these materials might offend some individuals, those people have the choice of whether to engage with them. Many may concur with the author's stance, while others may oppose it. I believe people should be allowed to access whatever they desire because it is their personal choice. We make our own decisions regardless of others' preferences. Additionally, people may want to experience the humorous elements created by others in various forms of media. Some individuals do not enjoy being bored with the same content. In some respects, author Katherine Paterson is correct. She would not want her children to be exposed to inappropriate content, and as a parent of a daughter, I share the same sentiment. Children should not be allowed to view inappropriate materials until they reach the age of eighteen. Such content can have a profound influence on them. Indeed, many people in the world are influenced by negative things. The author stated, 'then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else,' meaning that we have the power to decide what our children can see. For example, if there is a magazine filled with negative language and disturbing content, as a parent who loves their child, you should remove it from reach, even though it is ultimately your decision. You would want the best for your child and protect them from inappropriate materials. In conclusion, the decision lies with each individual. There will always be things in the world that we dislike, and we cannot prevent all negative occurrences. Libraries should maintain a balance, but teaching children the difference between right and wrong is crucial. Based on our own experiences, we should guide them to make the right choices and avoid repeating our mistakes.
1182	4159	2	2	I am of the opinion that all types of books should be accessible to all individuals. A library should not be designed for a specific group of readers. Books are a form of creative expression in text. Creativity is an essential part of life, and without it, we would all be identical. For every person in the world, there is at least one book that can pique their interest, regardless of whether reading is a hobby or not. It is unjust to remove books from library shelves due to 'offensive' content. Different personalities give rise to different writers, who in turn produce different books that attract different readers. There are numerous people who enjoy reading. What will those who like 'offensive' content do when these books are removed? Books are written for two main purposes: to allow authors to express themselves and to enable readers to explore and connect with the authors' imaginations. I think that if a writer has the freedom to include whatever they want in a book, that book should be available to everyone. In conclusion, restricting access to books based on so - called offensive content is unfair and goes against the very nature and purpose of books. We should uphold the freedom of both authors and readers.
1183	4160	2	2	Have you ever visited a library and found a book offensive? In my view, books, music, movies, and magazines are available in libraries for a reason. For instance, if you want to borrow a movie and it's too expensive elsewhere, you can get it from the library if they have it. Most libraries I've been to have separate sections for adults and children. This means there are appropriate materials for children in their designated section. If a child wanders into the adult section and sees something inappropriate, it is their fault, not the library's. If every time a child or someone underage finds a book offensive and the library removes it, there would be fewer books for adults to enjoy. Of course, I'm not suggesting that extremely inappropriate books should be freely accessible to children in the library. I'm simply stating that adults have the right to access books that interest them. During my library visits, I've discovered books that I've truly enjoyed, and I'm not the type of person who gets interested in a book at first glance. There are books, movies, magazines, and music with strange titles that some people may find offensive, but these are often the ones that are more frequently read, listened to, or watched. I believe that no material should be removed from the shelves just because one person finds it offensive. If someone doesn't like the fact that the library doesn't remove the material, it's their personal issue. For example, there's a book called '@CAPS1' about a teenager who got involved with drugs and became pregnant at a young age. It was one of the best - selling books in the world. If someone takes offense and asks for its removal, it's their loss. Of course, if there were a book about how to murder someone, I would immediately ask for it to be removed. But no library in the world would have such content, so there's no need to worry. I highly doubt such a situation would ever occur. In conclusion, my stance is that libraries should balance the needs of different age groups, and materials should not be removed lightly based on individual offense.
1184	4161	2	2	Offensive material should never be removed from the shelves. Books cover a wide range of topics, from love to science fiction. Everyone is offended by something. If each of us could remove a book we perceive as offensive, the human race would have nothing to read. @PERSON1 had to present a similar argument to Congress regarding his music lyrics. Thanks to @PERSON1, there is an '@CAPS1' sticker on @CAPS2's with offensive lyrics. Books should never be censored because it masks the authors' thoughts, ideas, and the meanings behind their writing. I've read hundreds of books from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. When parents worry about what their children might read, they need to take action. Having a one - on - one conversation with their child about the book's content can alleviate their concerns. The process from pre - @CAPS4 to @CAPS5 to @CAPS6 involves many stages of physical and mental growth. During these phases, kids learn from various sources, including negative ones. It is the parents' responsibility to ensure that the next generation can distinguish between truth and falsehood. My grandmother once shared a memory of when I was @LOCATION1 learning to read. I was reading from a @CAPS7 magazine. Although it is an adult magazine, I acquired reading skills from it. This skill has opened up job opportunities and helps me in my daily life. In conclusion, censorship of offensive material is unnecessary. Parents should play an active role in guiding their children, and the benefits of exposure to a wide range of materials, even those that may be considered offensive, outweigh the potential drawbacks.
1185	4162	2	2	Over the years, numerous events have occurred in our history, and these events have been recorded, journaled, and filmed. The thoughts, opinions, and facts associated with these events may be offensive to some in our society. The question of whether libraries should remove 'offensive' materials from their shelves is a highly debated one, and the answer is a resounding no. Censoring libraries would be detrimental to the general public. Censoring libraries creates an illusion of a perfect society. If libraries were filled with bland articles and idealistic fairy - tale books, they would no longer represent reality. Libraries are repositories of raw and true information, and people need to experience reality through books to survive in the 'real world.' Exposure to offensive material and diverse viewpoints helps shape our identities. Removing such material would hinder our development and create an 'imperfect' society. Certain historical events, such as the @CAPS1, @LOCATION1's genocide, and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, are painful and sensitive topics. However, history is crucial as it helps us avoid repeating past mistakes. Losing public records of these events can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of important topics. If we censor all media in libraries, ordinary people will be left in the dark. As people develop their own opinions, they learn to distinguish between right and wrong. What one person considers right may be wrong for another, and what is offensive to one may not be offensive to another. As Katherine Paterson said, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In fact, removing offensive material would leave us with no media. Society is diverse, filled with different viewpoints. Censoring historical records and opinions destroys our ability to share ideas. We need to preserve the availability of all information for the public. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries as it is harmful to our social growth and goes against the principles of free expression. In conclusion, libraries should remain a place where all types of information, including that which may be offensive, is available. This is essential for our personal and social development, and for the preservation of a free and informed society.
1186	4163	2	2	There are various forms of media, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, that may not be suitable for children. Banning such content from library shelves is a complex issue. While it's the parents' responsibility to ensure their children don't access inappropriate material, removing these items would also affect teens and adults who may be interested in them, resulting in a loss of business. A better solution could be to separate offensive content from that which is appropriate for children. This way, no items need to be removed from the shelves, and no business will be lost. In conclusion, this approach strikes a balance between protecting children and respecting the interests of other patrons.
1187	4164	2	2	I visit the library every [DATE1] of the week. Although I don't read much, I usually borrow movies or music. When I do get a book, it's often a magazine or something for school. I firmly believe that books should not be removed from the library. Just because some people don't read certain books doesn't mean others won't. For example, if I come across a book about [CAPS1] or the [CAPS2] father, I wouldn't read it, but I wouldn't remove it either, as it's others' choice to read. It's similar to the radio, where they cut out curse words, which messes up the song lyrics and goes against the artist's intention. The same goes for television, where they edit movies to remove bad language or scenes. I think everything should remain as it is. If parents don't want their kids to see certain content, they can block it, but they shouldn't cut parts of movies, as it's unfair to others. People can simply switch the radio station if they don't like the music. Moreover, considering the high taxes we pay, we should have the privilege to relax and watch un - edited movies at home. In conclusion, censorship in these forms of media is unnecessary and unfair.
1188	4165	2	2	It is crucial to be aware of global events. Lack of awareness can limit the extent to which problems can be addressed. While there is a line between free speech and harassment, the boundaries before reaching that line are protected by the freedom of speech. One must learn to teach, and teaching is essential for others to learn. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the hidden material. Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time are precious. When searching for government - related information online, it's difficult to find useful data. In this generation, we rely on cell phones, up - to - date websites, and the news, but research time is decreasing. World history textbooks may not be entirely accurate, as information passed down over centuries can be distorted. Knowledge, regardless of its content, is valuable as it helps us learn from mistakes and solve problems. Censorship doesn't change the existence of thoughts or events. Hidden information could be helpful. Time is limited, and we need knowledge to make the most of it. Everyone deserves to be heard. Refusing to listen to someone is disrespectful. The cries of the starving in underdeveloped countries make the fortunate uncomfortable, but this information shouldn't be hidden. Even if a material is offensive, the author may be just thinking independently. In conclusion, the world cannot afford censorship as it hinders our access to knowledge and the ability to respect others' voices.
1189	4166	2	2	People often take things offensively, and it's an inevitable part of life. We can't please everyone, and we have the right to freedom of speech, even if it's offensive to some. On the internet, offensive content exists, and we can't control how it's viewed. Similarly, in libraries, while I understand parents' concerns about inappropriate material for their children, authors have the right to express themselves. However, there should be some censorship regarding the appearance of books. Music and movies usually have warning labels for young kids, and libraries could adopt a similar approach for books and magazines. We can't set an age limit for books without invading people's privacy, as books are becoming more mature. No one has the right to remove books from library shelves just because they're offensive. It's hard to judge what's offensive, and libraries are publicly owned by the city. So, it's the city's decision regarding book availability. Even if there's an uproar about a book, unless the decision is unanimous, books shouldn't be removed; instead, they can be placed in a restricted area. If parents are worried about their children's reading material, they should consult the librarian. In conclusion, removing books from library shelves is unjust, and a more balanced approach should be taken.
1190	4167	2	2	People often wonder whether offensive materials in libraries should be removed. I firmly believe that if something offensive is found in a library, it should be removed immediately. Libraries are supposed to be places of comfort, relaxation, and enjoyment of reading. Some people may not be bothered by offensive content, but others are. If I find something offensive, I'll politely ask for its removal. In short, if a book or any other material offends someone in the library, it should be removed. If a library has a lot of offensive or unappealing content, fewer people will visit it. We should make the library suitable for everyone, focusing on how others perceive the content rather than our own views. In conclusion, maintaining a non - offensive environment in libraries is essential for attracting and serving patrons.
1191	4168	2	2	This topic is extremely challenging to debate. In my view, certain types of censorship should be implemented in libraries. Inevitably, everyone will be exposed to the content in some of these books. Such material should be available in public and high - school libraries, but clearly, we wouldn't expect high - school - level content in an elementary library. High - school students are more likely to be exposed to inappropriate music and magazines than younger children. If they wish to listen to music with inappropriate language, they should have the right to do so. However, if young kids are exposed to this, it's obviously a bad thing as it can teach them wrong values at an early age. It's best if they aren't exposed at all. There are also some books in the world that are inappropriate even for high - school students, and they should be kept out of all libraries to prevent exposure. Once people are old enough to make their own choices, they can decide whether to read such books. There are certain materials that can and cannot be placed in libraries, and we should all be aware of what is appropriate. In conclusion, libraries should offer music, books, and magazines, but graphic material should be excluded as children don't need to see such content. It's up to individuals to make the right choices about what they read, watch, listen to, or are around.
1192	4169	2	2	Teachers in schools strive to ensure that the materials children and young adults encounter in school are suitable for their age groups. Parents also make efforts to censor what their kids read, watch, and listen to to maintain their innocence. However, as young adults grow, the sense of censorship often fades, and they start to consume whatever they desire. This is the common scenario, but I believe the strong sense of public censorship is outdated for today's society. In my opinion, to a certain extent, censorship should not exist in libraries. There will always be differences in what one person deems inappropriate and what another finds acceptable. When I was young, in an after - school program, we once watched movies. One particular movie caused a conflict. My mother was okay with me watching it, but some other kids' parents thought it was inappropriate, so all the kids in the program had to watch a different movie that all parents approved of. As @PERSON1 said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries restricted materials based on people's sensitivities, there would be little left, as people can find offensive elements in almost anything in this century. It's the nature of our culture. I'm not saying it's right, but others may think so, and they have the right to access materials they find acceptable in a library. In @ORGANIZATION1, censorship has rarely been present, which is one of the great aspects of this country. People can speak, believe, and read freely without government interference. This is not the case in many places, and we should cherish this freedom instead of complaining. Constitutionally, the government has no right to censor public materials; age restrictions are acceptable, but complete removal would violate the country's freedom policy. I agree with age restrictions, but ultimately, it's up to parents to decide what their children can watch or read. Overall, the censorship issue is complex. In my view, our country is built on freedom, and censorship doesn't align with the constitution. People have different beliefs, which is why this issue is hard to resolve. Once everyone learns to accept differences, perhaps this problem can be solved.
1193	4170	2	2	Nowadays, some books in libraries can be offensive. I understand that some are about historical events, but others deal with killing, shooting, drug use, etc. Firstly, I don't want my children growing up thinking it's okay to steal, do drugs, or engage in such behavior. I've seen meaningless books in libraries that I believe shouldn't be there. Kids might think they're good reads, but I disagree. There are even fourth - grade books with bad words. Secondly, @CAPS1 are enjoyable to read, I know. I'm old enough to read such books, but I and many others think it's inappropriate for young kids to read them. If it were up to me, I'd remove some really bad books, music, movies, and magazines. However, it takes more than one person to do this. It wouldn't be fair if it were solely my decision, as others may have different opinions. Next, it's okay to watch a movie or listen to music as long as it's appropriate. I'm just stating my opinion on what's right. People have different views, and @CAPS3 @CAPS1 kids watch and listen to various types of media. As long as parents are okay with it, it should be fine. Lastly, kids should be allowed to grow up as they wish. It may sound silly to some, but it makes sense to me. At the end of the day, we can still teach them not to imitate the negative behaviors in books.
1194	4171	2	2	In today's society, many things can be interpreted differently. Katherine Paterson once said that people have the right to remove harmful and explicit materials for children from library shelves. However, I believe that censorship in libraries is unnecessary for several reasons. If a librarian finds something offensive and decides not to put a book on the shelf for fear of children accessing it, I think this action is unjustified. The librarian can choose not to have the book in their library, but the material still exists in the world. A child can easily find it in another library or a store. Also, a library should keep the book on the shelf because an adult may want to read it but can't due to the perceived offensiveness. As a teenager, I've seen how far some teens will go to obtain explicit materials. If they can't find what they want in one library, they'll go elsewhere. In extreme cases, they'll use their parents' credit cards to buy the item online. So, a library's censorship can lead to unexpected problems. When people consume media like music or books, they may interpret the content differently from the author's intention. For example, a funny book may be misinterpreted by a reader who thinks the author is making fun of something they're involved in. Most modern songs use vulgar language, but it's not always meant to be taken literally. Everything can have a double meaning, making it easy to find offensive content. For these reasons, the responsibility of censorship shouldn't be on librarians but on parents. If a librarian doesn't like the material, they can avoid it, but they shouldn't deny others the right to access it. As Katherine Paterson said, taking away material for one child may leave nothing for others. We shouldn't let a minor issue ruin things for everyone.
1195	4172	2	2	The debate on censoring books and music in libraries has been ongoing for a long time. Libraries are places where people can escape the ordinary and immerse themselves in the works of authors and musicians. I firmly believe that reading and self - expression through music are essential parts of our lives. Censoring them would only shield us and prevent younger generations from experiencing the impact of words on our daily emotions and actions. Books are one of the oldest forms of information. If someone removes information they find offensive, it could set a precedent for others to restrict the works of authors. Personally, I love reading. Each book I read exposes me to different beliefs and cultures that I might otherwise never learn about. Children need to explore the world and understand how other civilizations function compared to our own increasingly judgmental society. The best way to do this is by reading books written by those with first - hand experiences. I'm also passionate about music. It helps me relax and open my mind. In my opinion, censoring music is unacceptable. Removing music from libraries is hard for me to accept. Freedom of speech was once a cornerstone of our country. Now, it seems that the ideals we were taught about our great @LOCATION2 are being undermined by government control over our lives, actions, and self - expression. Music is a non - violent way to express oneself. In the 1960s and 1970s, people used music to protest war and racism peacefully. However, times have changed, and those in power no longer see it as an 'appropriate' option. Just because one society deems something inappropriate doesn't mean it truly is. We already worry too much about others' opinions. We shouldn't judge others' work when we can't accept our differences. If we accept the diversity of world cultures, there wouldn't be a need to debate the censorship of expressive and emotional art in libraries.
1196	4173	2	2	"It is astonishing that some individuals advocate for banning books due to their so - called ""bad content."" In today's era, children seem to be exposed to an excessive amount of violence and cursing. Banning certain books could be an effective measure to guide them towards understanding that such content is inappropriate. Currently, only a small number of children choose to read books, while the majority are engrossed in video games and television. Children should not be allowed to swear or perceive violence as acceptable. Reading these ""bad books"" might lead them to think it is okay to use violence when they dislike something, which is clearly wrong. Banned books are indeed necessary for children in their formative years. However, if teenagers or young adults are mature enough, it can be acceptable for them to read banned books. They should have the maturity to handle books containing mild swear words or violent scenes. Some banned books, like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', do not even contain any swear words, yet they remain on the banned list. Certain books, movies, and magazines should be removed if they contain profanity and drug - related content. There are people making efforts to improve the banned - books list. Censorship should only be applied when a person is too young to understand the implications of bad language or confusing actions. In conclusion, censorship is a valuable tool but should be used moderately. Children today do not need to be exposed to sex, drugs, swearing, and violence. Implementing an age limit on what can be read or watched would make this a more manageable issue."
1197	4174	2	2	I firmly believe that censorship in libraries is unnecessary. Parents have the responsibility to ensure their children are not exposed to inappropriate materials, rather than placing the blame on libraries. Libraries exist to offer a wide variety of resources. What's the point of having a library if you can't find what you want because it has offended someone? If certain materials are too explicit, they can be placed in an adult - only section instead of being completely removed from the shelves. I do not think offensive materials should be removed. One reason is that parents can monitor their children. If you don't want your child to read or see certain things, you can keep an eye on them. It's similar to controlling what your child watches on TV. Just because you don't like a TV show doesn't mean it will stop airing. Similarly, you can control your child's access to library materials. Another reason is that libraries are meant to provide a diverse range of resources for everyone. Just because you find something offensive doesn't mean others won't like it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If you don't like a particular item, you don't have to check it out. If libraries removed materials every time there was a complaint, there would be nothing left on the shelves. Creating an 18 - and - older section could solve many problems. While there are some materials that younger people should not be exposed to, adults should have the right to access whatever they want. Most libraries already have different sections, and if parents keep their children in the appropriate sections, there should be no issues. In conclusion, offensive materials should not be removed from library shelves. There are many solutions to this problem, and an 18 - and - older section is a good start. Parents should take responsibility for their children's exposure to materials, and no one is forcing children to read or view anything they don't want to.
1198	4175	2	2	"Throughout the @LOCATION1, there are numerous libraries that stock a wide range of materials, including books, magazines, music, and movies. Libraries serve a crucial purpose by providing information that may not be easily found elsewhere. They offer a vast variety of resources all in one place. Materials such as @CAPS2 - rated magazines and movies should be immediately placed in a separate area on the shelves. If someone wants to rent them, they can ask for assistance. Since children of all ages visit libraries, they are likely to encounter unnecessary information. In my view, there should be an adult - only section where only adults above a certain age can enter or check out materials. Displaying such materials may encourage children to engage in dangerous or unsafe behaviors. Regarding music, it is a part of many people's lives. Adults often claim that they ""need music to survive."" If libraries remove music materials from the shelves, they may lose customers. A library without music, books, magazines, and movies is just an empty room. Inappropriate materials for all ages should be placed in a restricted area or on high shelves. Removing such materials would cause a great deal of dissatisfaction. Instead, libraries should reorganize their collections to create a safe environment where everyone feels welcome and there are no complications. In conclusion, by properly organizing and separating materials, libraries can ensure that both adults and children can use the facilities without issues, while still providing a diverse range of resources."
1199	4176	2	2	"When discussing the content of books, magazines, or songs, questions such as ""good or bad?"" and ""offensive or not?"" often arise. But who are we to judge what is appropriate for everyone? Authors of books, music, movies, and magazines express their opinions on various topics. Although their views may not please everyone, this is an inevitable part of society. No matter what the topic is, there will always be at least one person who has a problem with it. The world is far from perfect. The only way to reduce the chaos is for people to self - censor what they read or listen to. If someone dislikes a particular topic, they can choose not to engage with it. Many CDs, whether explicit or not, have an advisory label warning about potentially inappropriate content. This allows people to decide whether to listen to the CD or not. Everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but that doesn't mean everything said is acceptable. There are many examples of offensive language, from racial slurs to derogatory terms for females. People will always be offended because everyone has different views on life, shaped by factors such as ethnicity, personality, and religion. I remember when I was in @NUM2 grade, my @CAPS1 class was reading a story about the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. The story was about young black children trying to get an education in a white school during a time of high racism in @LOCATION2. On the third day of reading, when the teacher read the term 'nigger - lover' without hesitation, several black children walked out of the class, yelling in anger. The teacher didn't realize that her words had offended the students. The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' was not censored, and although it offended some, I believe it should remain on library shelves. It helps children understand the harsh realities of the past. By keeping the original language, readers can better appreciate how difficult life was. In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines will always contain content that some people disagree with. Removing this content would prevent people from fully understanding the author's message. Therefore, I firmly believe that these materials should be kept available."
1200	4177	2	2	When deciding whether certain materials should be allowed in libraries, multiple aspects need to be considered. Libraries are visited by a diverse range of people looking for different things. Banning materials will make libraries less appealing to some audiences, causing them to go elsewhere. However, this does not mean that offensive materials are acceptable. There should be a scale to measure the offensiveness of items. Profanity and minor actions are relatively mild forms of offense, while intense violence and explicit content like blood - related scenes need stricter controls. Categorization is a good way to restrict children from accessing harmful materials. For example, violent books can be placed in an area restricted to those over the age of @NUM1. Adults usually won't be interested in this section, so it won't be a problem. If offensive items are made available only to those who want them and hidden from the general public, the problem can be solved. A library is a place for everyone, and different types of materials should be placed in areas accessible to the appropriate audience. This applies to books, magazines, and movies. Movies are highly advertised, and any advertisement showing explicit or offensive content should be removed from public view and only shown to the intended audience. When it comes to computer use in libraries, rules are also necessary. Children under the age of @NUM1 should have safety measures to prevent them from accessing harmful material, while adults over @NUM1 can use the computers at their own risk. Computers should be separated to avoid unwanted viewing. When listening to music, headphones should be used if the song is offensive to others. In conclusion, proper categorization of harmful or explicit materials, separation of computer use, and the use of headphones for music can eliminate the problems related to offensive materials in libraries. Instead of removing items, conditions should be enforced to make the library a safe and enjoyable place for everyone.
1201	4178	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should retain music and other non - book materials. The library is a place where many people discover new music. While some content might be offensive to certain individuals, others find it acceptable. People have the right to choose not to listen to such content. The library houses over @NUM1 different types of music, movies, magazines, etc. Given this wide variety, there's no reason to limit what people can read, hear, or view. It serves as a space for people to explore and discover what others find interesting. I recall visiting the library as a @NUM2 - year - old child. I saw people looking at things I'd never even heard of. This shows that people develop their interests over time, not being born with fixed preferences. I think the library is perfect as it is. In fact, we should add more diverse music. Since not everyone likes the same music, there's no point in forcing a single taste. The @CAPS1.S is growing every day, and we should expand the library in every possible way. We must remember that not everyone enjoys reading books. Some find magazines and movies more interesting. I, for one, would rather watch a movie or listen to music than read a book. People are different, so we shouldn't treat them uniformly. As a @NUM3 - year - old, if I had to listen to Disney tracks all the time, I'd go crazy. I listen to what I'm interested in, and if my music were taken away, I'd be lost. I'd be left with books I don't like and music I can't stand. Music belongs in libraries. It's impossible to make everyone happy, but we should respect the diverse interests of library - goers.
1202	4179	2	2	In my view, overly offensive materials should not be on library shelves. While such materials may not be offensive to some, they can be against the religion and way of life of others. I've read books outside my school library that I believe have no place on library shelves. These books contain violence and inappropriate behavior. Would you want your children to read such books? There are also movies similar to these books. Many shows are based on book series, and some of these series may not be suitable. They can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. Children may see something on the @CAPS1 that they think is cool and then try it in real life, not realizing the potential negative consequences. They could end up in more trouble than they anticipate. I know that some materials on the shelves are considered offensive by some but aren't actually offensive. In my opinion, the most offensive ones should be restricted to adult access only. Adults can then decide whether their children should watch or read them. Some people will agree with my opinion, while others won't. What's your stance? Do you want your children exposed to content that could have a negative impact on their lives? Do you want them to grow up believing that everything they see in movies and read in books is good? Or do you want them to learn the difference between right and wrong? It's important to make a thoughtful decision to protect our children's well - being.
1203	4180	2	2	I'm of the opinion that many books in local libraries can seem crude or offensive to some readers, and this often relates to the maturity level of the individuals. For example, adults usually look in the adult section. However, there may be children accessing this section, and their parents should monitor what they borrow from the library. Maturity plays a significant role, but some young adult books may not be appropriate for the readers. These books might go too far, and the children reading them probably shouldn't be. I don't think unrestricted access to any item in the library at any time is a good idea. Different parents have different rules for their children, and they may not agree with the materials available on the library shelves for their kids. I remember when I was a child, my parents didn't always let me borrow what I wanted because I was too young. Adults are free to make their own choices about what to borrow. I don't think the adult section of the library needs extensive monitoring since adults can make informed decisions. They know right from wrong and don't need someone to tell them what to read. The young adult section concerns me the most. At this stage, children are in an awkward growth phase, still learning about right and wrong. Some books or movies can have a significant impact on them. Parents should be cautious about what their children watch or read in this section. I believe that some books, especially in the children and young adult sections, should be monitored. If they're found inappropriate for the intended age group, they should be removed. Parents also need to be actively involved in their children's lives, setting limits on what they can access. In conclusion, everyone should borrow materials from the appropriate age - section in the library.
1204	4181	2	2	I believe that offensive materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves. Librarians should not keep offensive items in libraries as they can be offensive to some people. Libraries should mainly have interesting books with good stories and children's books. There should be no sexual or racial content in the materials available. While libraries should offer a wide variety of materials to cater to different tastes, offensive items have no place on the shelves. There are children visiting libraries, and they should not be exposed to such content. If libraries removed offensive materials, there would be no arguments or issues related to them. People could visit the library and choose what they want without being confronted with offensive items, making the library a more enjoyable place for both adults and children. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from library shelves is a necessary step to create a more inclusive and appropriate environment for all library users.
1205	4182	2	2	Have you ever been eager to read a particular book you heard about, only to find out it's been removed from the library shelves because it's considered offensive? Public libraries often take all offensive materials off the shelves, making that special book off - limits. A book, song, or movie that someone worked hard on is now stored away due to a little controversy. Is this fair to our rights? I find the issue of censorship in public libraries very confusing. If someone writes and publishes a book, there will be people who want to read it. Just because some people find it offensive doesn't mean no one can read it. That's unfair to those who enjoy it. The right approach is that if you don't like it, don't read it; don't take it away from everyone. There are some materials in libraries that should be censored to a certain extent, such as those with nudity or adult content. However, this doesn't mean they should be removed completely. These materials should be placed in a restricted area for adults only. Many movie and book stores have similar policies, so libraries should adopt this idea. As @CAPS1, we have the right to freely express our opinions. If someone wants to write a book based on their beliefs, they should be allowed to. Censoring something just because you don't like it violates the constitution. You can express your opinion about it, but taking it away because you might not like it is wrong. Is it fair that people spend so much time and money writing a book, and a few people's objections make it inaccessible to everyone? If someone puts in the effort, those who enjoy it should be able to access it. It's not that hard to avoid picking up a book you find offensive. Censorship has its place, but over - enforcing it based on individual notions of offensiveness violates our right to freedom of expression. In conclusion, we should strike a balance between respecting different opinions and protecting the rights of creators and readers.
1206	4183	2	2	Should offensive material be censored? Removing offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., can have both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, it prevents younger children from being exposed to offensive content. However, it also restricts freedom of choice. Young children often lack the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, so censoring such content for them might seem beneficial. But sheltering children from the real world is not advisable. Protecting them from offensive things might hinder their healthy growth. Moreover, censoring now won't change the existing offensive material that is already in circulation.  There are valid reasons for people to want to censor offensive content. Parents may not want their children to read, hear, or see offensive material because it offends them or they don't want their children exposed to it. They believe they are making the right choice for their children as young kids can't tell right from wrong. By censoring, parents can control what their children are exposed to. Some parents also think it protects their children from potential harm and ensures they don't grow up badly.  However, removing offensive material from shelves takes away people's freedom of choice. No one likes to be told what they can or can't read. When parents censor for their children, they are shielding them from the real world. Children should have an understanding of the world before they grow up and become lost. Although parents think censoring is a good way to protect their children from what they consider bad, it might actually be harmful. Censoring books, movies, music, etc., won't stop the spread of already - purchased offensive content. Offensive media has been bought and sold for years.  I firmly believe that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc., is not a good idea. It denies people the right to choose. Some people enjoy reading graphic novels, and music is meant for people's enjoyment. Some like music that talks about drugs or contains curses. Taking away such choices is unfair. A movie is just a fictional representation, and just because something happens in a movie doesn't mean people will imitate it. People should have the freedom to make their own choices.  In conclusion, censoring offensive material is not practical as the existing offensive content is already widespread. We should respect people's freedom of choice and allow them to make decisions based on their own preferences.
1207	4184	2	2	The world is filled with books, movies, music, and magazines that may contain offensive elements such as bad language, inappropriate pictures, and offensive messages. No matter where people go, they are likely to encounter something that could offend someone. Despite efforts to eliminate all bad content, it will likely persist for a long time.  In @CAPS1 @CAPS2, all the tenth - grade students recently finished reading '@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5.' The story is about a runaway @NUM1er named @CAPS6 and a runaway boy named @CAPS7. Many libraries have banned this book because of its use of the n - word and profanity. However, I personally think it should be taught as it shows students what life was like during the era of slavery.  Music is popular among most people. Songs usually have a theme, with some artists singing about love, money, and fame, while others write about drugs, profanity, and suicide. There are hundreds of music genres like hip - hop, rap, country, rock, metal, jazz, r&b, and punk, and at least @NUM2 songs in each genre have a negative connotation.  Magazines and movies are similar. They can contain everything from cars and bad pictures to historical places, facts, and action. Even though there are age limits for purchasing or viewing certain content, it can still end up in the hands of teenagers.  Just because there is bad language in music, movies, books, etc., doesn't mean they should be banned. Instead, access should be limited. It's not wrong to express one's feelings in a book or movie, but proper analysis should be done to ensure that the content is only accessible to the appropriate age group. The interests of children and teenagers today will impact the world in the future, and change is needed.  In conclusion, rather than banning offensive media, we should focus on proper age - based access and analysis to ensure a more appropriate media environment for different age groups.
1208	4185	2	2	We live in a world @DATE1 that is constantly inundated and influenced by media. From a young age, our minds are filled with the opinions of others from both the past and the present. Whether we are reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to music, our lives are affected by the media.  The art world is one of the most controversial industries. Every piece of literature or movie is evaluated by a large community of critics. We all have the right to express our opinions about these works. However, many people find certain pieces offensive in some way. It is impossible to create a piece of media that will satisfy everyone. For example, religious works are often criticized for their non - factual information or the author's or director's personal views. Given the diversity of religions in our community, these works will never please all audiences. Movies have also been criticized for decades because they present life lessons or truths that are unappealing to some viewers. Instead of criticizing, we should learn from them and reflect.  No piece of media can satisfy the opinions of the entire world. For instance, novels and books about war are often heavily criticized. While the soldiers who fought for our country @MONTH1 may appreciate such works, war protesters and peace - keepers @MONTH1 may see them as an insult to their cause.  @PERSON1 wrote a book called @CAPS1 @NUM1. This book was highly criticized regarding the topic of censorship. In the world described in the book, people's opinions had a significant impact. If a book or movie offended a group of people, they would burn the books. History books about slavery and war were burned because some found the topics offensive. Non - religious groups burned religious works like the @CAPS2 because they considered religion offensive. The government in that world aimed for a world of peace and equality, where diversity no longer existed.  Although @PERSON1 denies that the book was written about censorship, it offers a valuable lesson to our generation. We have grown up in a world of diversity, where every person has unique thoughts. We must recognize that we need to coexist and accept the diversity around us. The books on our shelves, the movies on the big screen, and the music we listen to all contribute to our generation's history and that of the next. We should accept our neighbors and their opinions because we are all born equal. Throwing away our history and achievements means we have nothing to build on and no mark to leave on history. We need to accept others' ideas and use them to improve our lives and those of others.  As we stand @DATE1 in a diverse world, we should move forward, learn, and reflect. It is not a time to be offended or to offend others but a time to grow and progress.  In conclusion, we should embrace the diversity of media and the opinions it generates. By accepting and learning from different ideas, we can create a more inclusive and progressive world.
1209	4186	2	2	I am writing to present my views on censorship in libraries. Recently, during a visit to a library, I was overwhelmed by some of the content I encountered. I firmly believe that such offensive materials should be censored and removed from the shelves. As a place of business, a library should not have offensive items that could disgust customers. I hope to explain my reasons in this letter.  There are numerous reasons for censoring offensive materials in libraries. Speaking for myself and others who visit the library, certain materials like books, music, and magazines are offensive. I believe that such issues should be handled with great authority. By advocating for censorship, I am trying to help myself and my fellow citizens.  Imagine a visitor picking up a magazine in the library and finding insulting visual details related to something they can relate to or have experienced. It would be extremely offensive to them. People visit libraries for various reasons, and it is not to be insulted. Having offensive materials in the library is highly inappropriate.  People come to libraries for different purposes. Some come to escape, while for others, it is a daily routine. Regardless of the reason, they should feel comfortable in the library. If visitors are uncomfortable, they will tell others, and the library will lose customers and the support of the community. We should carefully consider our actions and the way we manage the library to ensure a positive experience for everyone.  In response to the question @CAPS1, I strongly support the removal of offensive materials from the library shelves. I believe in making people happy, and one of the problems in society today is excessive judgment and negative talk about others. If people stopped judging and insulting one another, the world would be a safer place. Every small step towards improvement can lead to a great outcome. Removing offensive materials from libraries could be a good start to making the world a happier place and bringing people closer together.  I hope that my thoughts will assist you in making a decision on this matter.  In conclusion, censoring offensive materials in libraries is essential for creating a comfortable and inclusive environment for all visitors. It is a step towards a more positive and harmonious society.
1210	4187	2	2	Regarding the question of censorship @CAPS1 in @CAPS2 paper, I believe that it's okay for someone to write a magazine or a book as they are expressing their opinions. Everyone has the right to voice their beliefs and fight for what they want, not just those involved in the censorship debate.  However, some materials like music, movies, and magazines in libraries need to be censored, especially considering the young children who visit. Children in @NUM1 @NUM2 grade or younger may access the library. We need to ensure that the library is free from content that is inappropriate for their age. Libraries are places for studying, reading good books, and magazines. We should censor bad language and inappropriate pictures. This is important because some parents may find content offensive if it talks about the color of another person or uses bad language to criticize the government.  Some people seem reluctant to stop the production of bad songs that contain offensive content. Those who write such content claim that people lack the attitude to express themselves freely. But I would ask them what they have done to clean up the libraries. We need people to take action and point out the problems.  Censorship is not just about removing bad content from the shelves; it's a call to make our cities better places to live. By helping libraries censor offensive materials, we can create a better environment for today and a brighter future tomorrow. Every effort counts in making a difference.  In conclusion, while freedom of expression is important, we also have a responsibility to protect the younger generation from inappropriate content. Censorship in libraries is a necessary step towards creating a more suitable and positive environment for everyone.
1211	4188	2	2	"I firmly believe that offensive materials, including certain books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from public access. Children should have restricted access to such content as some topics are inappropriate for their age. For instance, the movie ""@CAPS1"" contains excessive bad language, depicts characters taking drugs, a man cheating on his girlfriend, and people getting drunk and doing foolish things while portraying it as fun. I would not let my kids watch this movie until they are older. Moreover, some music is filled with bad language, and I think more meaningful songs should be created for children. As for magazines, it depends on their content. I once read about @PERSON1 doing something bad in a magazine, and I believe the suitability of a magazine hinges on what it discusses. If materials are offensive, they should be taken off the shelves. Conversely, non - offensive materials that don't cover bad topics should be accessible to kids. By doing so, children may be less likely to imitate the negative behaviors they see in these media, such as stealing, which they might think is ""cool"" after seeing it in movies or through their friends."
1212	4189	2	2	Offensive material should undoubtedly be removed from public shelves, especially in places like libraries. If a child were to come across such content, they might think it's exciting and desirable. People could unknowingly pick up offensive material from a library shelf and start reading without realizing its nature. However, it would be their own responsibility for choosing it. This kind of material should only be placed in environments where it is appropriate. For example, in a bookstore restricted to people over @NUM1, it can be on the shelves since children are not allowed inside. Depending on the location, if offensive material is on display in a non - public place and someone picks it up and engages with it, they have no one to blame but themselves for not researching the content beforehand. If consumers choose to take such material, they do so at their own risk of being offended and cannot hold the place where it was found accountable.
1213	4190	2	2	"You might be asking yourself, ""Censor us?"" and ""Censor now?"" I am writing to share my perspective on the issue of censorship in today's world libraries. Censorship, to me, means protecting children from inappropriate content, not restricting adults who can handle such material. In modern libraries, there is an adult or uncensored section where certain books, movies, and magazines rightfully belong, and they should not be removed from there. Many people today want to safeguard their children from harmful, uncensored materials. However, in a world with numerous laws, regulations, and authorities protecting our rights, some individuals are trying to bypass these systems. They attempt to create laws or bills to remove uncensored material, but it's challenging to get such measures through the government. Regarding the question ""Censor now?"", the world has changed over the years, and access to everything has become easier. Some think they can remove the adult section of libraries if enough people support the cause, but this won't happen because the adult section is for adults, not children. In conclusion, the adult section must remain in libraries. Some of the content in this section, such as materials about war and recessions, is valuable. Adults should have access to this section when they reach the appropriate age. We shouldn't penalize the entire world for a single library's mistake of allowing children into the adult area. Instead, we should teach children that this is an adult - only space."
1214	4191	2	2	In my opinion, all books and other related materials should remain on the shelves. Everyone should have the right to learn about various things, especially when others have already had the opportunity. Censorship, in my view, is often unnecessary. Whether people are exposed to certain content now or later, they will eventually encounter and learn about it in life. If someone wants to read something, it should be their personal choice. I've noticed that both students and adults in libraries often seem to think they can control everything. However, I firmly believe that keeping all materials accessible is the right approach.
1215	4192	2	2	I am of the opinion that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, and other such materials should be removed from libraries. This is beneficial for multiple reasons. Firstly, some people may misinterpret the content in libraries, leading to potential issues. For example, if a patron believes there is something offensive in the library, it could result in a lawsuit. It can also make people feel disrespected, which might cause them to lose respect for the library. This sense of disrespect can make individuals feel unequal compared to others. Secondly, removing offensive materials keeps customers happy. When a customer finds something offensive and the library takes action to discard it, the customer will feel respected. If offensive items are kept in the library, fewer people will visit as they may feel offended and have no say in the removal process. A more welcoming environment will attract more visitors. Thirdly, removing offensive materials might make someone feel better. If a person sees something they dislike in the library and it isn't removed, they will feel unrespected and unwanted. For instance, if someone takes a book out and doesn't return it because of offensive content, the library will incur losses as it has to restock. In conclusion, there are many non - confrontational ways to resolve problems in libraries. Respect is a two - way street; we must give respect to receive it. Some actions can enhance people's self - esteem and keep their day positive. Before making a decision, we should consider how we would feel if we were in the same situation.
1216	4193	2	2	In today's society, the issue of whether certain offensive materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves is a matter of debate. In my view, they should not be taken off the shelves. After all, this country still upholds the principle of freedom of speech. Just because some individuals find something offensive, it doesn't mean that the so - called offensive material doesn't have the right to be published or shared.  Take some authors like @PERSON1. Although there were numerous racist remarks in the literature of that era, their works are still an integral part of American history. Removing these types of books from the shelves would achieve nothing. Racist people won't suddenly change their views just because the racist books are gone.  Music and movies are forms of expression. If someone writes something offensive, others don't have to listen to the songs or watch the movies. No one can force them to do so.  These days, people tend to take things too literally and want to have a say in everything. They should realize that most of these problems don't even concern them. Instead, they should focus on their own lives and not worry about every piece of news they hear. In conclusion, respecting the diversity of opinions and the right to express through various forms of media is crucial for a free and open - minded society.
1217	4194	2	2	Censorship in libraries is a hot - button topic in contemporary society. It is an issue that demands our consideration and the expression of our viewpoints. In my opinion, library items should not be censored, and this stance is supported by constitutional rights, the creation of gray areas, and the preservation of classic literature.  The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1 clearly enshrines the concept of freedom of the press. This not only gives publishers the right to print as they wish but also empowers individuals to choose what they can and want to read. Censoring library books would be a direct violation of this right, which is clearly stated in the @CAPS4 of @CAPS5. I firmly oppose any idea that goes against the @CAPS3, and the people of @LOCATION1 should be outraged that such a thing is even being discussed.  When it comes to censoring based on offensiveness, one must consider the gray areas that will emerge. For example, what is offensive in one book may not be offensive to someone else who could benefit from reading it. The term 'offensive' is relative, as its definition varies from person to person. No single thing can be considered offensive by the entire population, so removing anything will face opposition. This creates a situation where there is no clear - cut answer, which would be extremely problematic for those attempting to censor library items. Additionally, deciding who gets to determine what is offensive would be as controversial as the books themselves. Since everyone has different opinions, those making the decisions would need to represent every person's view equally, which is highly impractical.  Finally, censoring books would lead to the loss of classic literature and impede our understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers. For instance, in @PERSON1's '@CAPS7 @PERSON2', the 'n' word appears over a hundred times. Many @CAPS8 @CAPS9 are offended by this word. However, this book is regarded as one of the greatest works of the century and cannot be removed from the education of young people due to an offensive term. If people want to censor books, they should do so for their own children, not for everyone.  In conclusion, the censorship of literature and other library items is not only unfeasible but also blatantly unconstitutional. The idea of censoring items for children based on offensiveness should not be pursued.
1218	4195	2	2	There is a wide range of entertainment options available today, including movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television, and radio. Most people have access to these forms of entertainment. While these may seem harmless at first glance, there are instances where they can be considered offensive. When a book, magazine, or movie is created, it may not be intended to be offensive. However, a particular group of people might find something offensive that others wouldn't even notice. With such a diverse range of consumers, it's difficult not to offend someone.  Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are found offensive. Censorship, whether in libraries or elsewhere, should be condemned. No one is forced to read a book, watch a movie, or listen to music. If someone finds a book offensive, the solution is straightforward: don't read it. Others may find the same book inspiring and uplifting, and taking away their option to read it is unjust.  There are many forms of entertainment that can be misinterpreted and offensive to some. Removing all potentially offensive books or magazines would be a monumental task and would eliminate a large portion of the library's collection. If a person doesn't want to read an offensive book, they can simply choose another one. The book should not be removed from the shelves just because someone might be offended by it.  Everyone has different perspectives. What one person finds offensive, another may not. For example, a book discussing a certain topic may offend one person but be enjoyed by another. If the book is removed because it offends one person, others will lose the opportunity to enjoy it. Just because something is offensive to one person doesn't mean it's offensive to everyone.  I firmly believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. People may have personal reasons for being offended, but that doesn't justify removing materials from the general public. If offensive items are removed from the shelves, people may miss out on great books or movies. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of opinions and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they consume.
1219	4196	2	2	In today's diverse society, people have a multitude of outlooks on the world. The world is a place that should have no restrictions on the flow of information. There are countless ways in which people perceive things, and telling someone what they should or should not know is shortsighted because everyone can interpret a book, music, movie, or magazine differently.  A quote by Katherine Paterson metaphorically uses a book and a shelf to illustrate the importance of information passed down through generations. The book represents the world's information, and the shelf is the place where it is stored for people to access. Removing a book from the shelf permanently means closing the minds of future generations. It has been said that 'you can't understand your present without understanding your future.' While a book may offend one reader, it can also inspire another. Everyone has a different opinion and lifestyle. Some people enjoy better lives, while others struggle every day.  A book that may offend someone who thinks it's too harsh and should be removed from the shelf could inspire a young child going through difficult times to overcome their circumstances and become a better person. I've read many books that didn't interest me, but when I passed them on to my siblings and friends, they were surprisingly interested. After talking to them about the books, I found that they got a different message from the books than I did. No one thinks exactly the same all the time.  The quote '@CAPS2 @MONTH1 argue that the glass is half - empty while others argue it is half - full' perfectly reflects the diverse mindsets in the world today. Ultimately, if everyone thought the same, we would all be the same person. Trying to remove books from the shelf in a diverse community is impossible. In conclusion, we should embrace the diversity of ideas and keep all books accessible so that different people can gain different insights from them.
1220	4197	2	2	I don't think offensive materials should be removed. Books usually have information about their content on the back, and movies have ratings. It's the parents' responsibility. They are the ones who allow us to read books, watch movies, listen to music, or play games. If they don't want us to be exposed to certain things, they shouldn't get those materials for us. Sometimes, they buy these things because kids are spoiled and want everything, and parents buy them to make the kids happy.  However, kids are also to blame. They want to watch rated @CAPS1 movies or play rated @CAPS2 video games with offensive language. They also say offensive words to each other and then ask their parents what those words mean. This happened to me. When I first read, heard, or watched something with offensive content and told my parents what the words meant, I got hit. I was angry at myself for saying those words and wished I could go back in time and never say them. I kept repeating the words, and I couldn't get them out of my head. I got in trouble just because I heard a stupid word that I wished I'd never heard.  I heard the word so many times that it was stuck in my head. I'm pretty sure some kids who said the word didn't tell their parents because they knew they'd get hit. The ones who did tell their parents got hit and were still wondering what they did wrong. When I found out what the word meant, I didn't say it for a long time, but when someone made me really mad, I started saying it again.  Now, the question remains: should we blame the parents or the kids? And should we remove offensive materials so that kids won't learn bad words? The choice is yours. If it were up to me, I'd blame the kids, and I don't think we should remove materials with offensive language because many of us don't find it offensive. We must remember that no matter what decision we make, there will always be opposition. In conclusion, finding a balance between personal responsibility and the availability of diverse content is essential.
1221	4198	2	2	Libraries worldwide are encountering the issue of censorship, which has become a more prominent concern in the present era. Censorship can impact various forms of media, including books, music, movies, and magazines. This raises the question of whether censorship is beneficial or detrimental. Censorship enables the removal of certain books from library shelves if an individual deems them offensive. However, everyone holds different opinions, so why should one person's view influence what others are permitted to learn? What one person finds offensive may be acceptable to others. Moreover, no one is compelled to engage with content they do not wish to. If someone finds censorship offensive, a simple solution is to avoid the censored material. Censorship not only affects learners but also writers. It deprives writers of their freedom of speech. Writers create various forms of media to express their thoughts, share their perspectives on the world, and recount their life experiences. Through their work, they establish a connection with readers. Writers should have the right to convey their messages to the world. Even if libraries can censor books and music, they cannot censor the internet. The internet is a platform where people globally can access a wide range of content, including books, music, magazines, and online stores. A library, like the internet, is a public space, and everyone should have the right to access and enjoy the content they prefer. Implementing censorship is comparable to preventing a teacher from teaching due to their nationality or silencing a president's speech. Censorship is based on personal opinions and should not affect learners or writers. It suppresses the voices of society and the thoughts of ordinary people. In conclusion, censorship should not exist as it restricts the free flow of information and expression.
1222	4199	2	2	Libraries are commonly perceived as rooms filled with books within school buildings. In reality, they are widespread across the country and are utilized by people of all ages. For this reason, I firmly believe that there should be no restrictions on the books libraries stock. If books and magazines are appropriately labeled, individuals can simply avoid content they find offensive. However, in the case of school libraries, all materials should be age - appropriate. Just because one person dislikes a movie or other media does not mean others will share the same sentiment. Since people have diverse tastes, no two individuals will like the exact same movies. Therefore, a personally offensive movie should not be removed from library shelves, as it may be enjoyed by others. This principle applies to magazines, books, and all library resources. Parental concerns for their children are valid. However, if a parent of a young child finds certain books or magazines in a public library offensive, I do not think the library should be required to remove them. Instead, libraries should implement organization and limitations. Adult - oriented materials that may be inappropriate for children should be placed in a separate section, such as a different room or level of the building, to prevent accidental discovery by children. Additionally, there should be limitations on borrowing. If a child attempts to check out an inappropriate or offensive book, they should be restricted from doing so. In my opinion, school libraries have different requirements. Elementary school libraries should contain no inappropriate material at all. All materials in these libraries should be strictly educational, as young children are too immature for adult - oriented humor or content. At the middle and high school levels, the rules should be more flexible than in elementary schools but still stricter than in public libraries, with absolutely no offensive content. Magazines and joke books can be included in teenage libraries, as long as they comply with school rules. Public libraries are places where both children and adults can find entertainment. Since everyone has different opinions, there should be no restrictions on the available materials. In a school environment, however, the rules must be more stringent, and no offensive content should be present. In conclusion, libraries should not be forced to remove books from their shelves.
1223	4200	2	2	I strongly believe that music, movies, magazines, and other forms of entertainment should not be removed. If all these forms of entertainment are taken away, people will have nothing to do in their spare time and will likely become bored. I know many people, including myself, cannot tolerate boredom. It would be a different situation if we had never had access to music, movies, and other forms of entertainment in the first place. In that case, people would not miss what they never knew. Consider the scenario of driving for [NUM1] hours without any music or magazines to read. I am certain that you would feel extremely bored. In conclusion, removing these forms of entertainment is not a good idea as it would lead to a dull and unfulfilling leisure time for many.
1224	4201	2	2	Libraries are not just repositories of books, magazines, and movies; they are guardians of history. Undoubtedly, many libraries house books and magazines with offensive content. While some people find this unacceptable, I completely disagree. Every book has a unique story, and people interpret content differently. Therefore, libraries should not remove offensive material from their shelves. Defining what is truly offensive is a challenging task because everyone has different views, opinions, and backgrounds. Some consider violence, drugs, gangs, and sexual situations offensive, while others find religion, beliefs, traditions, and morals offensive. Given the wide range of perspectives on offensive content, libraries would have to empty a significant portion of their shelves to remove even a small amount of it. Libraries have different sections, such as fiction and children's stories. Just as there are sections for children's books and adult books, there could be a section for materials that some readers might find offensive. Libraries could also mark books with offensive content. This would resolve many disputes. If a reader chooses to read a marked book, they have no right to be upset. Limiting library shelves is unthinkable. If someone is offended by what they read, they can simply put the book down. A public library is a place where many people gather. Just because one person is offended does not mean others will be. In essence, no book should be removed because someone cannot handle the content. As the saying goes, if everyone has the right to remove a book they dislike, then there will be no books left on the shelves for anyone. Since everyone's view of offensive material varies, eliminating it is difficult. If a library removes a book because one person finds it offensive, the library will eventually become empty, and its purpose will be defeated. People do get offended, but that is part of life. We should not let one person's opinion deprive others of the opportunity to read great books. In conclusion, libraries should keep their shelves stocked with a diverse range of books, regardless of whether some people find the content offensive.
1225	4202	2	2	Censorship has been a hot - button issue in debates involving politicians, activists, and ordinary citizens. Some groups believe that the government has the right to censor offensive content in today's society. However, I firmly believe that it is not the government's place to decide what is offensive. One reason some people support censorship is to protect children. While parental concern for their children is valid, completely restricting children from offensive material in adulthood may leave them ill - prepared for the real world. We spend at least twelve years in school to prepare for adulthood and face the challenges of life. If children are not exposed to certain aspects of life, they will not be able to handle them in the future. Not all individuals support censorship for the sake of their children. Some adults also want to limit offensive material for themselves. My response to this is that individuals have the power to control what they are exposed to. If a TV program bothers you, turn it off. If a book or magazine is offensive, don't read it. Change the radio station if you don't like the music. There is no need to remove offensive content from society when it can simply be ignored. One of the most persistent debates about censorship is whether the government should control the media. Looking back at [LOCATION1]'s history, giving the government more power in our daily lives has rarely been beneficial. Our forefathers founded our country to gain the freedom they were denied in [LOCATION2]. The [CAPS1] of [CAPS2] was established to ensure that the government does not overstep its bounds and control what it has no right to. Freedom of speech encompasses not only what we say but also what we see and hear. The citizens of this great country are capable of deciding for themselves what is offensive. The government's role is to protect the country from external threats, not to control what its citizens see and hear. We hold meetings and debates to enhance and expand our freedoms. It is absurd that some people want to give up one of the freedoms we already have. [ORGANIZATION1] is a remarkable country, and its citizens should take responsibility for deciding what they are exposed to. In conclusion, it is time for our society to become more self - reliant and stop relying on the government to filter our media.
1226	4203	2	2	Have you ever wondered if books can be offensive? It all depends on the individual and what angers them. Some individuals believe that books, music, movies, and other forms of media can be offensive in certain ways. While it's true that they can, the content can only affect a group of people if they collectively understand the issue. There are several reasons for and against removing books from libraries.  Based on what I've observed, people do get angry about various things, but the key question is what makes them so angry. What is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. For example, a fan of @ORGANIZATION1 reads a book that mocks or teases the organization. This can make the fan offended and angry at the book. Others may get angry at a movie that discriminates against different races. In the @NUM1's, some movies portrayed @CAPS3 @CAPS4 as stubborn and ignorant. As someone who is @CAPS3 @CAPS6, I find this a bit aggravating, but due to the freedom of speech amendment, it's not worth arguing over.  Whether something is offensive also depends on how it makes a person feel. During World War @NUM2, @CAPS7 people were depicted as short, fat, and big - nosed, taking all the money from the @CAPS8. This is offensive and is often used to sway public opinion. In my opinion, if something only mildly offends you, it's usually not worth worrying about. However, if you're extremely offended and the statements are untrue, you could find someone with similar tastes to read the content. This can help determine if it's generally offensive, not just to you.  After that, the main question is what should be done next. If a book I'm reading deeply offends me, I'd contact the library it came from and ask them to review it. If they also find it offensive, they're likely to remove it from the shelves. But if someone reads a book that criticizes their favorite sports team, there's no need to inform the library; it's a waste of time. Just choose another book. I understand people getting angry about racism and discrimination, but not over a sports team.  I hope that people will eventually understand the boundaries of what can be considered offensive. Perhaps it's human nature to be offended when something we like is mocked. Therefore, books should only be removed from library shelves for valid reasons, not trivial ones.
1227	4204	2	2	I firmly believe that people should have the ability to access various materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Many individuals rely on these resources for knowledge acquisition.  Firstly, people should be permitted to borrow items like books from library shelves. Whether it's a personal collection or a library's stock, individuals take these materials because they believe they will be useful for their work or studies.  Secondly, human memory has its limitations, especially when dealing with real - life situations. In the face of serious problems and sudden accidents, we often lack the necessary recall. This is why having access to books and other materials is crucial.  Most importantly, people have an innate desire to expand their knowledge. It is a natural inclination to want to know more and be more informed than others. To satisfy this desire, they need to access a wide range of materials from libraries.  In conclusion, allowing people to borrow books and magazines ensures that knowledge can be disseminated among those who need it. This not only benefits individuals but also contributes to the overall intellectual growth of society.
1228	4205	2	2	Have you ever thought about whether your likes align with others? It's uncertain. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. Why is this the case? Everyone has their own perspective. You may or may not agree, and there are those who simply don't care. There are several factors that influence what people find offensive, including religious beliefs, the pursuit of independence, and the act of experimentation.  Religious beliefs are of great significance. Don't you agree? Certain content in the world may be offensive to those with specific religious views. For example, the topic of gay rights. Not everyone accepts it, and those who do are often considered open - minded. On the other hand, those who oppose it have their own set of beliefs. I believe that it's important for individuals to adhere to their religious convictions.  Independence is either something we possess or strive for. Whether music, movies, magazines, or other forms of media are offensive to others should not affect you. Why? Because you know the difference between right and wrong. Even if some nonsense catches your attention, there's no need to take action. You should remain independent and accept things as they are.  Experimentation is a personal choice. It's as simple as deciding whether to do it or not. Many people may be influenced by external factors when they experiment. I've been in such a situation myself. I was known as the rebellious child in my family. My father always warned me to be careful about the company I kept. As a teenager, I didn't pay much attention. I was usually the youngest among my friends. I was influenced at times, but I never got hurt. I can say that I've experimented with life.  Is it harmful to observe or experiment with the negative aspects of life? It depends. In terms of religious beliefs, it may or may not be disrespectful. When it comes to independence, you are in control. Experimentation is a personal decision. What offends me may not offend you. We all have our own way of thinking.
1229	4206	2	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,  I firmly believe that the country should remove all books, movies, magazines, and music that have offensive covers or contain offensive, mind - grabbing, or sexual content. Children should not be exposed to such materials. Take the radio, for example. The rap and hip - hop music played often contains cursing and lyrics about money, cars, girls, and sex. Kids don't need to hear this on the radio. Similarly, adult books in @ORGANIZATION1 are meant for adults, not children.  Children will eventually learn about sexual issues, but not when they are @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old and are exposed to pornographic magazines and movies. I hope you will take this into consideration and ensure that such offensive materials are removed from public access and kept out of children's hands.
1230	4207	2	2	The concept of banned books is a thought - provoking one. We can all think of a book that we wouldn't want our children or any children to pick up. However, as Katherine Paterson said, if I have the right to remove a book I detest from the shelf, then everyone has that same right, and eventually, there will be no books left for anyone.  I wholeheartedly support Katherine's statement. Who has the authority to determine if a book is offensive? People have the right to their opinions, but I don't believe anyone has the right to remove books from a @CAPS1 library.  A @CAPS1 library is exactly what its name implies. It's a place where people can go to find a book to pass the time, a book for an @CAPS2 assignment, or a book to read to their child. Removing a book from the shelves just because it offended someone doesn't make sense to me. A person has the right to pick up a book, be offended, and complain; that's freedom of speech. But when someone demands that a book be removed from a @CAPS1 library's shelves just because they're offended, I question their right to do so.  Katherine Paterson's words are quite impactful. If everyone had the right to remove books they dislike, there would be no books left on the shelves. Isn't that a terrifying thought? It's likely that a person could find something offensive in any book.  Removing books from the shelves means taking knowledge away from the people. As @CAPS4, we have the right to read any book we want, without being persecuted by those who find the book offensive.  If we allow people to ban books because they're offended, it's a failure of our First Amendment. As a nation, we must stand firm against the banning of books from @CAPS1 libraries, not only for our generation but for future generations as well.
1231	4208	2	2	In certain places and at specific times, some individuals impose their personal opinions on the censorship of library content, whether it is fictional or non - fictional. I firmly disagree with this concept. The facts indicate that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications that explore the outcomes of similar censorship campaigns and has established systems to prevent such situations.  In my native @LOCATION1 and other democratic countries, society dislikes enforced censorship for several reasons. Firstly, many countries have a Bill of Rights and privileges protected by law. Our founding fathers, at the behest of the general public, drafted documents that led to the creation of the first ten amendments to our constitution, known as the Bill of Rights. Some of these amendments guarantee the freedom of speech for citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively, without restrictions. Removing these deeply - ingrained principles would cause a public outcry. We established our government to safeguard our freedoms, and as implied in the Declaration of Independence, we are prepared to replace it if necessary to preserve those freedoms.  Secondly, publications that are proposed for banning oppose the enforcement of personal opinions due to its negative impact on society. I can cite three books that depict a dystopian view of censorship. '@CAPS5 @NUM1,' a book assigned as a reading option by my teacher according to state standards, describes book - burning and extreme uniformity among citizens. '@DATE1,' by @PERSON2, portrays a dystopia where all citizens submit their will to an omnipotent '@CAPS6 @CAPS7,' who uses omniscient surveillance. Although I haven't read the book myself, its content clearly shows a sense of fear. '@CAPS8 @CAPS7,' a recent novel by @PERSON1 with a title that puns on the name of @DATE1's main antagonist, tells the story of an older teenager trying to evade a surveillance system. All these books convey a sense of fear that has permeated local society.  When examining the effects of censorship, it becomes evident that even the attempt to create a utopia and ensure compliance through censorship often leads to decline and misery in the areas where government or civil officials implement it. There must be a more effective solution today. For instance, libraries are divided into sections for different age groups, creating a natural barrier between content suitable for different levels of maturity. The film and television industries use ratings to categorize content, and the video game industry also has a similar system. The ESRB, or the Entertainment Software Rating Board, provides a relatively good ranking system for video games globally.  In conclusion, censorship already exists in an acceptable form. No one is forced to follow the recommendations, but it is hoped that people will do so voluntarily. Responsible parents usually adhere to these guidelines. Enforcing these moderation methods would only cause dissatisfaction. It is up to each individual to prevent the worst - case scenario and use these systems responsibly.
1232	4209	2	2	The ideas expressed through literature, music, and movies are a form of art. They are unique and cannot be replicated or fully explained in any other way. If we deprive people of the right to create or sell these masterpieces, the world loses a part of its essence.  Censorship is the root cause of many problems. It suppresses the expression of human thoughts and emotions such as greed, love, fear, and empathy, which are often conveyed in books and films. When people claim that certain content is offensive, it may be because they are unable to face the truth.  Many individuals can only express themselves through their art, and art can be incredibly realistic. Take 'The @CAPS1' for example, a short story where kids rob an old, wealthy man's home and then burn it down with his belongings inside. This story has been banned from many schools and libraries. However, what most people fail to understand is the motivation behind the kids' actions. Some believe that the kids are driven by a desire to destroy what is valuable or that our love for material possessions makes us greedy. This story makes us reflect on our values and actions, and this is precisely where the problem with censorship lies. If we censor content that makes us think deeply about ourselves, we start to lose our sense of self.  Throughout history, the loss of books due to censorship has been evident. The most prominent example is the Nazi regime. At the beginning of their rule, they banned books that went against their ideals. This censorship eventually escalated to large - scale book - burning, which was a means to control public opinion. As the movement grew, the German people developed a national pride and a specific goal. By the 1930s, nearly every literate German had read '@CAPS5 @CAPS6'. The censorship turned into an all - out attack on classical literature and a promotion of Nazi ideology. This was how Hitler was actually voted into power; the German people voted for him. The Nazis destroyed the public's original ideals and replaced them with their own.  Banning media can only lead to a lack of self - awareness. The human mind can best be expressed through the art we create. Trying to explain it verbally often leads to confusion. Censorship has never had a positive outcome; it only promotes negative ideas. If we allow our media to be banned, we lose the right to have our own thoughts and ideas. In conclusion, we should resist censorship to preserve our ability to express ourselves and understand who we are.
1233	4210	2	2	In my opinion, everyone has their own views on books. Just because you don't like a book doesn't mean others won't. There might be something in a book that you don't like but that others enjoy, and vice versa for movies. This doesn't mean that the book or movie should be removed from the library shelves.  Regarding magazines, if there are contents that you don't want to look at or don't want your children to see, then yes, such magazines might need to be removed. After all, a library should maintain certain standards.  In conclusion, we should respect different opinions when it comes to media in libraries. While there are cases where certain materials might be inappropriate, we shouldn't be too hasty in removing them just because of personal preferences. It's important to strike a balance between individual sensibilities and the overall availability of diverse content.
1234	4211	2	2	The media shows a lot of offensive content every day. I'm sure everyone can admit that they've been offended by at least one thing they've seen or heard in the media. However, we must remember that this is a free country, and everyone has the right to freedom of speech. Television companies and radio stations shouldn't be held accountable for the content they air because it falls under the protection of freedom of speech.  Personally, I'm not offended by anything I read, listen to, or watch on TV. I really don't understand how people can get offended by media content, as it's not like the offensive statements are directed at them personally. I've heard of people trying to sue record companies for offensive songs, and I think that's ridiculous. It's not the record company's fault if someone takes offense to a song, and fans shouldn't have to suffer because of such individual sensitivities.  In conclusion, we should respect the principle of freedom of speech in the media. While offensive content might exist, we should deal with it through understanding and tolerance rather than legal action. We need to remember that in a free society, diverse opinions and expressions are bound to include some that we may not like, but that's the price we pay for freedom.
1235	4212	2	2	Materials such as books, movies, magazines, and comics can be offensive to some people. What seems offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. For example, a comic writer's statement that offends you might be seen as full of knowledge and vibrancy by someone else.  There are approximately @NUM1 billion people in the world today, and each person has a unique way of thinking. If a librarian removes materials that you find valuable, it's like taking away your opportunity to learn.  In today's world, many teenagers and young adults are becoming more engaged in various issues. The content of a magazine article they read could inspire them to make a positive change in the world. It could even bring a young adult or a scientist closer to finding a cure for cancer. Although a magazine might be offensive to someone with cancer or a doctor treating cancer, would they still be offended if it leads to a cure?  If we remove all materials that could potentially be offensive, we might as well get rid of all books, movies, magazines, and comics ever created. Since around @NUM1 billion people have different thoughts, what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. Removing offensive - looking reading materials would also take away our ability to learn and grow as humans.  In conclusion, we should not be too quick to censor materials based on individual sensitivities. The potential benefits of diverse media content in terms of learning and personal growth far outweigh the risk of offending some people. We need to embrace the diversity of ideas and perspectives to foster a more informed and progressive society.
1236	4213	2	2	"Culture and history are two vital aspects of the world. Libraries serve as repositories for these elements, allowing all visitors to access and enjoy them. For this reason, it is firmly believed that libraries should refrain from censoring any of their materials. Learning has always been and will remain a fundamental part of life, and libraries offer this opportunity to people freely. Depriving someone of this freedom is unjust.  Not all events in the world and throughout history are perfect or have occurred in an ideal manner. Subjects such as slavery, the @CAPS1, and other controversial topics must be known. Although these horrible happenings may offend some, they cannot be erased from the past. Humans have a natural inclination to learn, yet we often resist it. Concealing the truth is not right.  People vary in their susceptibility to being offended. The crucial question is, ""Who determines what is offensive?"" Some believe that discussing @CAPS2 in the Christian religion is offensive, while others hold that any form of homosexuality is offensive. However, there are also those with opposing beliefs. Libraries must preserve all types of materials because their purpose is to store knowledge, not just what people want to know.  If we fail to recognize past events, how can we make better decisions in the future? Removing information from the library due to its offensive nature essentially deprives people of solutions to problems. All aspects of culture and history should be preserved so that we can understand our origins, the mistakes we have made, and how to address new ones. History is beyond human control.  In conclusion, libraries should not censor any of their materials. The past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions. By doing so, we deprive future generations of potentially useful information. We must never forget our identity as a people and our origins. Our knowledge and learning ability are our most valuable assets and should be cherished."
1237	4214	2	2	People of all ages have the right to access any material they desire. However, @CAPS1 or other family members may advise their children not to read about certain topics. Whether the children heed this advice is up to them. If they do not, action needs to be taken. Libraries should implement rules. Children do not need negative influences in their lives, and adults have the right to shield them from such information.  Library leaders typically divide libraries into different sections for children, teens, and adults. Each group has the right to choose the materials they want to read, watch, or listen to. It is believed that setting age limits for these sections can prevent children from accessing inappropriate information. Currently, children can access such information at any time, and adults should take steps to prevent this.  Children in libraries should be supervised. Many books deal with drugs, sex, or pregnancy, which can impart harmful information to children. Children are not mature enough to learn about sex, and @CAPS1 should be the first to have these discussions with their children. Young children are aware of drugs and their harm, as they learn about them from movies, books, and music. Many books also cover pregnancy, which can lead children to ask questions.  Children may also be exposed to information about gun violence. Reading about gangs can make them think it is cool, leading them to play with toy guns and pretend to be in a gang. This information is extremely harmful and should not be accessible to children. After some children read about it, they may involve their friends, and this information can spread throughout the school. Violence is detrimental to children.  Librarians are not in control of the materials people choose to read. However, if a library has offensive materials, it is their responsibility to prevent them from reaching young people. They should enforce strict age - appropriate material limits. If a child tries to check out a book that exceeds their age limit, they should be denied access. Sections with potentially harmful information should be off - limits to young children. Adults should help prevent children from accessing harmful information in libraries.
1238	4215	2	2	"I believe that libraries should have dedicated rooms for certain adult books, and access to these sections should be age - restricted. At the same time, libraries should offer a wide variety of books for everyone. Since people of all ages visit libraries, they should be open and stocked with all kinds of materials.  If a child or teenager wants to borrow an adult book, someone of age should accompany them and check out the book. Libraries are for the entire community, and not everyone reads ""nice"" books. People should have the right to borrow books of all genres without restrictions.  The only reasonable restriction should be an age limit on adult or ""naughty"" novels. If a book is particularly inappropriate, it should be kept behind the desk, and only those of age should be able to access it.  In conclusion, while there should be age restrictions for romance novels and other inappropriate materials, libraries should generally have a vast collection of books and magazines with minimal restrictions. People should be able to explore different types of literature according to their age and interests."
1239	4216	2	2	What is considered offensive? In a library, there are numerous materials that can be offensive to someone. For example, movies come in various genres such as horror, sci - fi, comedy, romance, and adventure, and each genre may offend a particular individual. If we were to remove all offensive movies, there would be no movies left on the shelves.  The question is whether we should remove all offensive materials or leave them for those who enjoy them. I firmly believe that we should leave these materials alone. It is not right for us to decide what a public library should or should not have on its shelves.  If a person finds an item offensive, they should simply ignore it instead of making a big deal out of it. Some people are good at keeping their opinions to themselves, while others are not. Those who judge based on their dislikes often make their views known.  In conclusion, public libraries should maintain a diverse collection of materials, and individuals should have the freedom to choose what they want to access. We should not let the sensitivities of a few dictate the content available in libraries.
1240	4217	2	2	Censorship is the most repugnant and terrifying aspect of society. Our lives have been overrun by political correctness to the extent that our voices are no longer truly our own. Until recently, we had the freedom to express our thoughts in any form of media, regardless of their nature. However, now, if something is deemed offensive in any way, it is effectively suppressed. Censorship restricts our freedoms, undermines our @CAPS2 as citizens and individuals, shields us from the world's truths, limits the knowledge we can acquire, and threatens to leave media barren in the future.  The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, the fundamental document of our country, guarantees the right of free speech. Censorship blatantly and violently violates this right. Our country was founded on the principle of free speech, but now it is being eroded. Our words are being silenced, and we are unable to express our opinions. Censorship ensures that no opinions are heard, no beliefs are questioned, and no one can think independently. Is this not the very essence of what freedom of speech is supposed to guarantee? We are supposed to be able to say whatever we want, even though there may be consequences. Allowing our ideas to enter the world fosters the formation of new ideas. Arguments may arise, but they enable people to see different perspectives and consider issues from new angles. When we hear or read others' opinions, we can view the world through different eyes and form our own opinions, which enriches our world with ideas and knowledge and promotes social progress. However, censorship aims to take all this away to please everyone, but it is impossible to satisfy everyone.  Censorship attempts to shield us from the harsh realities of the world. In a sense, this is understandable as we do not want our children to be exposed to the atrocities of daily life. However, if we do not allow people to confront these realities, they will never understand the world or be prepared for future experiences. Learning about the harsh realities of society educates people and empowers them to address these issues. For example, censoring information about rape does not eliminate the problem. It only prevents people from understanding it and taking steps to prevent it. By censoring such information, we ensure that future generations will be ignorant of these issues.  We rely on knowledge, and media is a primary source of it. Censorship gradually erodes our access to knowledge. Initially, the loss may seem insignificant, but over time, the gap will widen, and more knowledge will be lost. This is unfair, wrong, and harmful. Cutting off knowledge takes us backward and instills fear. It is human nature to fear the unknown, and as more knowledge is censored, our fear will increase. Censorship deprives us of crucial knowledge needed to function in society, which is immoral and unjust.  If censorship continues, it will have a catastrophic impact on society. Censorship is based on the concept of offensiveness, but almost everything in society can be offensive to someone. Therefore, if we follow the logic of censorship, all media and all forms of expression should be suppressed, resulting in a silent world with no knowledge or freedom. This is a terrifying future that we cannot allow. We cannot sacrifice ideas and knowledge to spare people's feelings. These are too important to be lost to censorship.  In conclusion, censorship is stealing our freedoms and @CAPS2, shielding us from reality, and harming society. It threatens to take away all knowledge and silence our voices. We must oppose censorship and work to restore our freedom of speech, the very freedom we are supposed to be guaranteed.
1241	4218	2	2	Offensive materials in libraries should not be removed from the shelves. People may need these materials for research or to gain knowledge. If someone finds a material offensive, they can report it, but library staff may not take action. Alternatively, they can simply ignore it. For instance, if I come across something offensive, I would just look at it to see what it says and then leave it be. There are others who might need it for research. If offensive materials are removed, it could be a problem for those who need them. I once had to do a research paper and went to the library, but couldn't find the relevant book or magazine. I had to wait over an hour to use the computer and then only had an hour to look up information. I couldn't finish in time and had to submit my paper late. While the internet can be useful, it may not have exactly what you need. Libraries have to stock certain materials as it's required. So, if people are offended, they can either report it or ignore it instead of demanding removal.
1242	4219	2	2	In life, everyone has to encounter something offensive at least once. It could be swear - words in a song or people's behavior. We're not perfect, and we must learn to tolerate others' flaws. The library is for all, not just one person. As @PERSON1 said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right...'. This is a valid point. I believe libraries should have some censorship, but only to a certain extent. The majority of library users are children, and parents have different values. What's offensive to one parent may not be to another. If every parent voiced their opinion on inappropriate books for their children, there would be no books left, as Katherine Paterson pointed out. Everyone has different morals, and one person's idea of what's right can offend another. I've had such disagreements before. If we all try to censor according to our own views, the library shelves will be empty. However, if a large number of people find a particular item offensive, it should be removed. Libraries are for information and enjoyment, and while we may find something offensive, we shouldn't be able to remove items just because they don't align with our morals. Excessive censorship in libraries can be a bad thing. After all, I'd prefer a library full of books and magazines rather than an empty one.
1243	4220	2	2	Libraries offer a wide range of materials like books, movies, music, and magazines. Offensive materials shouldn't be removed just because they contain a few objectionable elements. Everyone has the right to their own opinion, and through my experiences, I'll explain why I think offensive materials should stay on the shelves. A book that someone worked hard on shouldn't be removed just because it's offensive to some. Instead, offensive books can be placed in a separate section with a clear indication. Regarding music and movies, people have different tastes. Just because someone doesn't like a band that swears doesn't mean the album should be removed. Movies and magazines usually have ratings. For example, at my old library in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, rated @CAPS2 movies were in a separate section, and you had to be @NUM1 or older or accompanied by a parent to check them out. It's up to the individual to make the right choice, and the library shouldn't be blamed if someone picks up an offensive item. The library can make efforts to separate appropriate and inappropriate materials, but ultimately, it's the person's decision.
1244	4221	2	2	I think having separate rooms for adults in libraries is a good idea. In the Dunkirk library, there's a room with adult - only books, and kids can't enter without a parent. You can't check these books out. If I had a child, I wouldn't want them to see such content until they're older. As they grow and mature, they can enter and eventually check out and read these books. On the other hand, leaving offensive books on the shelf for kids to see could be a way for them to learn on their own. If they don't see it in the library, they'll see it elsewhere and may ask their parents about it. Some people agree with this, while others don't. Maybe there should be different rooms for different types of books with rules about entering, like needing a parent. I'm not sure what to do. A vote could be held, but that might make some people angry. In my opinion, it's better to keep the books and let kids find out on their own. Some may think I'm a bad parent, but would you rather your child learn about such things from other sources?
1245	4222	2	2	I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement. There's a balance between the right to read and the right to write. Authors, composers, and directors have a purpose for their works. While some items may be offensive to some, they have meaning for others. The right of free speech allows people to express themselves through novels, music, and movies. Even if there are inappropriate parts, it doesn't mean the whole work is inappropriate. Different people have different views on what's offensive. For example, the '@CAPS6' magazine may be offensive to many parents, but it's for adults, showing them products to enhance their appearance. The company has the right to publish it. The right to write serves all writers, composers, etc. I'm sure we've all loved a novel, music, or movie with some inappropriate content, but we wouldn't want it removed. For instance, a popular series I read in middle school had inappropriate sexual content, but it was very popular. If we remove all inappropriate items, there'll be nothing left to read, listen to, or watch. We rely on these materials to learn. Removing items from the shelves won't solve the problem of inappropriate content in society. Without books, it'll be hard for children to expand their vocabulary. Disagreeing with Katherine Paterson's quote is a way to exercise the right of free speech, and we should think about how our lives would be without these materials.
1246	4223	2	2	Books, magazines, movies, and music are all excellent sources of entertainment. Whenever I engage with these forms of media, I often wonder about the creative minds behind them. However, there is a concerning issue with some of the content available today. A lot of music contains negative elements such as derogatory language and curses. This is not a good image for both the musicians and the listeners. I firmly believe that such music should not be on the shelves and should be removed. Parents do not want their children exposed to this kind of negative influence, as it may have a detrimental impact on their development.  On the other hand, movies should generally remain on the shelves. Movies come in various genres like comedy, horror, and drama. Sometimes, offensive elements are necessary to make a movie engaging. For example, one of my favorite movies, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, features characters from the past, @CAPS1 and @CAPS4, who reunite for one last mission. Although it contains offensive content, it is still enjoyable due to its cool cars and well - developed characters.  In conclusion, while music with offensive content should be removed, movies should stay. People should be more discerning about what they listen to, and movie producers should continue to create high - quality films.
1247	4224	2	2	People visit the library to access specific materials. Some individuals find certain materials offensive and advocate for their removal. However, just because a material is offensive to some does not mean it should be removed, as it may be valuable to others. Offensive material can be historical, such as accounts of racism and slavery. Understanding these aspects of history is crucial as it helps us comprehend our past and the present social situation. This is why history classes are an essential part of education.  Not all offensive materials are historical. Some contain explicit content related to sex and violence. Libraries should label each section to inform patrons about the nature of the materials. If people are aware of the content and still choose to access it, they should accept the consequences. For instance, in history class, we learned about violent wars, which some classmates disliked, but it was important for us to know the truth.  Materials are created for a purpose and should not be removed simply because they offend someone. If we remove all offensive materials, we may lose valuable historical and cultural knowledge. Instead, libraries should use labeling to guide patrons.
1248	4225	2	2	I firmly believe that the decision to remove books, music, movies, or magazines from the shelves due to their offensive nature is not a straightforward one. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it will be offensive to everyone. There is no need to remove materials simply because some individuals are offended.  For example, if someone is offended by the content of a book or a movie, they have the choice not to read or watch it. No one is forcing them to engage with such materials. It all boils down to personal beliefs and lifestyle choices. A person who goes to church regularly may not choose to watch a movie like ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2,' but that is their own decision.  If we start removing materials based on individual complaints, there will soon be nothing left in the library or media stores. We cannot listen to every single person who claims to be offended. Moreover, it is difficult to verify whether something is truly offensive to someone.  In addition, if a person requests a movie that has been removed due to an offensive claim, they will likely be unhappy. We should consider both sides of the argument. If someone wants a material removed, but another person likes it, we should balance the interests of both parties.  In conclusion, offensive materials should generally remain available, and people should be responsible for their own choices of media consumption.
1249	4226	2	2	Movies are often associated with popcorn, and music with headphones. However, the innocence of the youth is being eroded by the subliminal messages in today's entertainment media. In our modern society, children are increasingly exposed to content related to sex, drugs, and violence in music, literature, and movies.  The music industry has seen a significant shift towards rap and hip - hop in recent years. Most of the songs in these genres contain references to sex, drugs, or violence. This kind of music breaks the sense of innocence in young listeners. Parents should be more vigilant about what their children are listening to and understand the impact of such media on them.  In the literary world, there has been a change from the clean and explicit novels of the past. Nowadays, @ORGANIZATION1 companies are more upfront about sexual, violent, or drug - related topics. For example, @ORGANIZATION1 magazines may have articles about sexual actions and ads for @CAPS1 cigarettes. Libraries should restrict children from accessing such magazines.  In the movie industry, subliminal messages about sex, drugs, and violence are prevalent. Action movies are filled with violence, and romantic movies often contain sexual content. These movies are easily accessible to children in libraries, which is morally incorrect.  Overall, library censorship is weak. The people responsible for allowing such media to be accessible to children need to address their moral issues. The more children are exposed to this kind of content, the more likely they are to think these actions are acceptable, which is a serious concern for the future of our society.
1250	4227	2	2	The question of why we should censor materials in a library is a valid one. Some materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines, are considered offensive, but the decision to censor them is not straightforward.  Censorship in libraries is not ideal because libraries are places where a wide range of literature is available for those who appreciate it. Instead of censoring, we should first determine the appropriate audience for offensive materials. If a material is offensive to adults, it should be removed from general shelves. Otherwise, it can be placed in the adult section.  Libraries should have well - defined sections for different types of materials. Books suitable for children should be in the children's section, and those for young adults should be in a separate section. By having these sections, we can ensure that only the appropriate audience accesses the materials, which almost eliminates the need for censorship.  In conclusion, using sections in libraries is a better alternative to censorship. Censorship may lead to a significant reduction in available materials, while proper sectioning allows for a diverse collection that is accessible to the right audience.
1251	4228	2	2	As a public - school student, I, along with many other students, have access to school libraries that are censored to a certain degree. However, I believe the public library should not be subject to such censorship. Censorship is a topic worthy of discussion because every published book is a part of history, and every author who has managed to get their work published should have their book available on the library shelves. School libraries are already censored according to the age group of students. In contrast, public libraries serve people of all ages, including adults, students, and children. The public, including individuals and their guardians, has the ability to decide what is age - appropriate. If someone dislikes a book, they can simply put it back and find something more to their interest. What may seem inappropriate to one person might not be so to another. As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone rated things according to their own taste, there would be nothing left on the shelves. Public libraries are divided into sections by interest, age, author, etc., while school libraries are organized by fiction, non - fiction, and author. Censoring public libraries is unnecessary. If more censorship is imposed on public libraries, their usage will further decline. Some content in public libraries is not available in school libraries, and adults need this content for their interests, jobs, or studies. Although certain content may seem inappropriate to some age groups, it can be beneficial to others. In conclusion, public libraries should remain uncensored to meet the diverse needs of the public.
1252	4229	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should not have excessive censorship, except for obvious things like pornographic and completely vulgar materials. However, opinions on this matter vary widely. Some parents think it's necessary to control every bit of information their children receive, while others are more lenient. The main problem with this issue is the wide range of individual restrictions. Many parents worry that politically incorrect information will corrupt their children for life, but this is far from the truth. In today's world, almost everyone experiences trauma, witnesses illegal activities, gets involved in drama, experiments with sex or drugs. Children have already been exposed to these things in real life. Reading a book with a few curse words or an intimate scene won't ruin them. In fact, such things might even be happening in their own homes, and there's no way to stop it. Trying to control children's lives too strictly will only make them rebel more when they get the chance. I suggest not worrying about library censorship, except for the obvious offensive materials like porn, sex novels, and racist books. If we treat more mature teenagers as adults instead of toddlers and stop hiding so much from them, they may be less likely to seek out “bad” things. Parents should stop thinking they can shield their children from the real world. If children are not aware of the mistakes and consequences, they won't know how to handle similar situations in real life. In conclusion, minimal censorship in libraries is the best approach to help children grow and make informed decisions.
1253	4230	2	2	Offensive media, including books, music, magazines, movies, and commercials, raises the question of whether it's appropriate to expose all ages to such content. I believe it's not. A wide range of people may be offended by the content these media contain. I think there should be a designated area for such content, or the most offensive materials should be removed so that people can feel at ease in the library or while watching TV at home. We must consider parents' concerns. Most parents don't want their children exposed to the negative effects of this offensive media. Some content is not suitable for younger kids. Whether at the movies or in the library, children are exposed to the violence and misbehavior in the world. Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a significant influence on kids today. It's our responsibility to protect them until they are old enough to make their own judgments. Religion also plays an important role in our views of right and wrong. I was taught to respect others and get along with them, but a lot of the offensive media contradicts these values. We tend to think that if our favorite actors or actresses do something on TV, it's acceptable. Movie theaters have ratings to protect younger kids from adult movies, but I don't think these ratings are enforced strictly enough. At the very least, libraries and movie rental places could have a separate area for adult - rated content. A few years ago, when my little sister was two or three, she watched a movie with curse words. She repeated them without knowing they were bad, and my parents were unhappy. Children may not understand the inappropriateness of what they see or hear. If they say offensive words to strangers, it can cause offense. Offensive media can be both harmless and offensive. To raise a respectful new generation, we should shield children when they are young so they can learn right from wrong. In conclusion, proper handling of offensive media is crucial for the healthy development of the younger generation.
1254	4231	2	2	The book @CAPS1 tells the story of a young @CAPS2 - @CAPS3 man who starts school at @ORGANIZATION1. In the first few weeks, he is bullied and mocked. To deal with this, he joins a boxing class and the wrestling team at his school. By the end of the book, he confronts those who bullied him. I personally think this book should stay on the library shelves because it offers a life - changing experience for young men. Some people, including me, have read this book multiple times. I hope more people will come to like or even love this book. In conclusion, we won't know if we like a book until we read it from start to finish, and this book is definitely worth a read.
1255	4232	2	2	When you enter a library, you'll notice the wide variety of subjects covered in books, some based on real experiences and some fictional. I firmly believe that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries. These forms of entertainment are created for people who are interested in them. If libraries face complaints about offensive materials, they can create a separate section. First, the purpose of books, music, movies, and magazines is to entertain us, expand our knowledge, and arouse our interest. Without these, life would be dull. I'm not saying we need offensive materials, but they allow us to think more broadly about different topics. Producers create “offensive” content to attract attention and be read, not to be hidden away in the back of the library. If you don't like such content, simply avoid it. Why should libraries prevent producers from making money? It's already hard for them to get their works on the shelves. There are many bad books that are a waste of time, but should they all be removed? Second, libraries can create a separate section for offensive materials. It may cost money, but it's better than losing customers. Libraries are large and can find extra space as they already separate items by genre. I understand that some cautious parents don't want their children exposed to offensive materials, especially teenagers who may get ideas from the language and scenes. There was a case where a man read a violent book and attacked his mother. However, I don't think the book should have been removed just because an immature and ignorant person misused it. In conclusion, no type of material should be removed from libraries just because it's considered offensive. A separate section is a better solution to meet the diverse needs of library users.
1256	4233	2	2	All terms of offense are based on personal opinion. Just because one person finds a particular word offensive does not mean another person will share the same sentiment. Parental strictness varies; some parents are more lenient, while others may not care at all. Gangster rap, which often contains references to drugs and objectifies women, is not suitable for children. Similarly, horror movies rated 'R' can cause children to have nightmares for weeks. At a young age, such as ten, children's mental states are not fully developed, and they struggle to distinguish between reality and fiction. They rely on trusted adults to guide their emotions, actions, and thoughts. Given their lack of maturity, children are ill - equipped to handle much of the content in the world. Rather than removing or hiding books from society, access should be at the discretion of the individual. Another option is to form a group to vote on age restrictions for specific materials. All information can be helpful, but not all is necessary. In today's world, it is extremely difficult to shield children and even some teenagers from harmful material. Society is becoming less sensitive, and eventually, people may become completely desensitized to 'harmful' movies, books, magazines, shows, and music. In conclusion, while it's challenging, a balanced approach to content access is crucial for the well - being and development of the younger generation.
1257	4234	2	2	Censorship in libraries has both positive and negative aspects. It is reasonable to have different reading materials for adults and children, as we don't want kids exposed to overly mature content. Libraries are widespread across the country. Some people argue that if a book is offensive, it shouldn't be in the library at all. However, an alternative approach is for parents to monitor their children's reading choices. Another option is to avoid sending children to a public library, which, by definition, is a place where the entire community can select reading materials. A public library is intended to offer a wide variety of books so that everyone can find something they enjoy. Although some content may be inappropriate for children, it doesn't mean it should be excluded from a public library. Parents should take responsibility for knowing what their children read. By doing so, both parents and children can have a positive library experience. In conclusion, public libraries are meant to be inclusive, containing both good and bad content, and people should accept this reality.
1258	4235	2	2	Have we ever considered the negative consequences of book censorship? Many individuals with diverse beliefs may take offense to books that oppose their ideas. When a book offends someone, the immediate reaction is often to censor it from libraries. In my opinion, if a book offends a particular group, they should simply choose not to read it. Why should others be deprived of the opportunity to read a good book just because it offends someone else? Banning books goes against the principles of our country. If we start censoring library books like some countries with authoritarian governments, it would fundamentally change our society. Imagine a world where all offensive books are removed from library shelves. There would be little left, as anyone can find something offensive in any book. I acknowledge that some book content can be disturbing and offensive, but that does not justify removing books from libraries. Censoring books is a short - term solution to a long - term problem. I firmly believe that if we constantly resort to book censorship, our society will become less creative. There are many people who genuinely want to read certain books but are unable to do so because they are censored. Censored books often stimulate imagination. Would we really want to live in a world lacking creativity? In conclusion, we should resist the urge to censor books and preserve the diversity of ideas and creativity in our society.
1259	4236	2	2	Honestly, if I were a librarian, I would display books and magazines on the shelves according to state law. If the state has no objections to certain materials being available, all students should be able to access them. Magazines can provide information about current events. Just as students may take a 'Reading Counts' test after reading a book, they could read an article from a magazine and write an essay about it, then submit it to the relevant department. This way, students can gain knowledge from different sources while also being accountable for their learning. In conclusion, a balanced approach that adheres to the law and promotes learning is the best way to manage library resources.
1260	4237	2	2	Various forms of media, such as books, music, and magazines, can influence children's behavior. However, I believe that all materials should remain in the library because there are more significant factors contributing to children's actions than these listed items. While some children may pick up behaviors from books, movies, and magazines, most of their behavioral patterns are shaped by what they watch on television at home. If parents do not monitor their children's TV viewing, children may assume that it is acceptable to watch anything. Therefore, the content watched at home or in theaters is the primary cause of behavioral issues. In my view, children should be allowed to read or watch legal content on television. In libraries, the decision about access should be based on age. Some materials are suitable only for adults because children can start arguments based on what they see, especially when they are with their friends. They may feel that it is 'cool' to imitate what they encounter, often from violent content in books they frequently read. In conclusion, a more age - appropriate approach to media access in libraries and at home is necessary to ensure that children are not negatively influenced.
1261	4238	2	2	I've read several books that I don't approve of, and I believe I have the right to remove them from the shelves. However, I'm not certain my opinion will have an impact. In fact, I don't think books should be removed from shelves or music banned. Instead, there should be stricter age limits for library books, and separate areas for music and similar items. I wouldn't want my child to leave the library with a book about sex, gangs, or inappropriate content. Rather than banning or removing such books, implementing and enforcing strict age limits would be a better solution. Although there are adult and kids sections, I've seen many young children leaving with adult books, magazines, and other items. I understand the difficulty of concentrating on a book, newspaper, or magazine when people are blaring their headphones. My stance on music in the library is the same as that on books. Instead of banning it from the library, it should be restricted to certain areas out of respect for those who want a quiet environment. I'm not one to take things away from people as everyone has their own interests and beliefs. However, I firmly believe in setting and enforcing rules. I think libraries can offer great value if they can restrict certain items to specific areas and strictly enforce age limits for borrowing books.
1262	4239	2	2	Certain books should be allowed to remain available as some, while offensive, can teach young teenagers about the past. For example, they might be about the KKK or @ORGANIZATION1. Some teens are interested in such books to learn about what people endured, and they could even be part of a school assignment. In my view, if your teenage child is interested in past history or violence, they should be allowed to read what they want. Books like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS6 are excellent for school assignments. These @CAPS6 books are very educational as they allow you to learn about history and wars simultaneously. I believe that if a child checks out a book from the library, they should return it within a week. The library should set a specific return - time limit, and if the book is not returned on time, charge a daily late fee. If the book is damaged, the person who checked it out should be charged. The book should be returned in the same condition it was borrowed so that others can borrow it later. The library should keep certain books, such as the Bible and college books, on - site. Also, the library should limit each person to borrowing @CAPS6 books instead of three or four. This would keep more books on the shelves and prevent loss. I think people under twenty @CAPS3 should not be allowed to check out movies or music and should be required to show ID to prove they are over twenty @CAPS3. There should be more rules in the library than just maintaining quiet. People should be encouraged to keep some books at the library and only take home @CAPS3 or @CAPS6 books. For example, I check out one @CAPS3 book every week and return the one I borrowed the same day I get a new one. I only borrow the books I really want to read, read them, and then return them. Magazines should never be checked out.
1263	4240	2	2	I think books shouldn't be removed from the shelves because everyone has different opinions. One person might find a book offensive, while another doesn't. Some people may find books with religious references offensive because it doesn't align with their religion. If every person removed the books they considered offensive, there would be no books left. People think differently; for instance, some may not like @PERSON1 books due to the violence and gore, but for others, these are their favorite books. It would be unfair to those who like the books that others dislike. There are many books out there, and not everyone will like them. The difference lies in individual thinking and what one considers right or wrong. In conclusion, removing books based on individual offensive opinions is not a good approach as it disregards the diverse interests and educational value of different books.
1264	4241	2	2	Censorship in libraries is a debatable issue. Should it be addressed as a problem, or is it beneficial? People from different cultures, backgrounds, and walks of life can be deeply affected by the content in library materials. Some books may be offensive to certain individuals, while others find them educational. Around the world, people have voiced their opinions on what they believe is right or wrong regarding library censorship. How many people think that library censorship is truly offensive and should be eliminated? When books and magazines are removed from library shelves, the real victims are the authors. If every offensive - looking reading material is removed, there won't be much left on the shelves. Different people may find different genres offensive. For example, a person who just got out of a relationship might find romance books hurtful, or someone who is miserable may not appreciate comedy. Such subjective opinions are not only bad for the library's business but also detrimental to education and history. People of different races and cultures have varying views on library censorship. Cultural and religious backgrounds can significantly influence one's perception of a book, magazine, or movie. For some, movies about past massacres or difficult historical events can be hard to accept, leading to anger or frustration. However, for others, it's an opportunity to learn, grieve, and support those who went through such times. Protests related to censorship are common worldwide. We've all seen or heard about them through various media. If people keep arguing about what should be on library shelves, what will happen to our understanding of the past and our prediction of the future? In my experience, I've seen people being attacked for expressing an opinion in the media. We shouldn't be so quick to remove everything from library shelves. These are often the reactions of people who have been hurt and don't want to relive those experiences. Overall, I believe that library censorship should not be completely eliminated. Everyone will face upsetting or hurtful things in various forms throughout their lives. We need to understand that different cultures contribute to our history, and removing content based on individual sensitivities would be a disservice to future generations.
1265	4242	2	2	As @CAPS1, we have the right to express ourselves and act within the law. If books are removed because they are considered racy or inappropriate, we are essentially preventing our children from learning about the history of our civilization. A great man once said, '@CAPS2 who do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it.' This means that by removing even the most obscure books, we are taking away historical knowledge from our children, and they may repeat our past mistakes. Removing obscene content from books will make our children ignorant of historical facts and the true nature of the past. '@CAPS4 @CAPS5's @CAPS6' is under criticism for its frequent use of the '@CAPS7 - word'. However, there's no reason to change the book as it reflects how people spoke and how things were in the past. Altering the book would mean changing history and depriving future children of the knowledge that slavery was an extremely harsh institution. When I think about library censorship, I see it as an attempt by @ORGANIZATION1 to distort the past and limit children's understanding of what really happened. Censorship should be applied to TV, movies, and music to protect young children from inappropriate content. But when it comes to library literature, it should not be censored because only literate people can understand the meaning and historical context. There should be no censorship in literature of the past, present, or future as it is essential for passing on knowledge and understanding of our history.
1266	4243	2	2	In my view, books, movies, music, and magazines should be available for critical assessment. Some of us prefer to consume content that aligns with our interests, like positive news, while others are interested in uncovering the realities behind the surface and expressing their views. However, they often refrain from doing so due to the fear of potential harm. Therefore, these media should not be removed from the shelves as they can inform us about global events and their impact on our lives. For instance, I once heard a Spanish song called '@CAPS1 The @CAPS2', which exposes the corruption in @LOCATION1. It depicts how the lower - class people suffer because the upper - class leaders are self - centered. The song also warns that if we let the leaders control us, they will take advantage of us, and honest workers struggle to provide for their families due to these leaders. It is a song that tells the truth, yet there are those who would like to see such content disappear. We should not let that happen, as these forms of media that show the real world are valuable.
1267	4244	2	2	I firmly believe that every individual's opinion should be presented fairly. Just because one opinion is considered correct doesn't mean others are wrong. What may be offensive to one person could be informative to another. I've read numerous books that parents might not choose for their children. Through these readings, I've learned that there is no allure in drug use or breaking the law. For some teenagers, such books can expose them to aspects of life they haven't experienced and make them realize they never want to. If a book is too explicit for children, it can simply be placed in a different section. I understand that there are books with graphic sexual details, and these should only be accessible to adults. Parents should be concerned about their children's innocence, and they should also monitor the books their children read to ensure they are not overly vulgar. Some @CAPS1 may contain profanity, sexual innuendos, praise and worship, or even screaming. Any of these types of music can be offensive to someone, but that doesn't mean we should hide all of them. Otherwise, there would be no @CAPS1 left. In this world, not everyone shares the same opinions, so there should be equal opportunities for people to read, watch, or listen to what suits them. I'm not advocating for a library to stock porn, but movies or books about less - accepted religions or beliefs should be as welcome as those about common ones. Everyone has different sensitivities. If someone finds the Bible offensive in a library, should it be removed? It's one of the world's most popular books, yet some people still take offense. Similarly, a Mormon, Muslim, or atheist might be offended if there is no relevant content in the library because of the concerns of others. The library is a place of knowledge, not judgment. I don't think certain books should be removed just because they offend someone. If you don't like something in the library, don't rent it. If you don't want your children to access it, don't let them. It's that simple. Everyone has the right to freedom of speech. Authors express themselves through books and articles, directors through movies, and musicians through their music.
1268	4245	2	2	I am of the opinion that materials with offensive language should not be freely accessible to those who are not fully mature. It is crucial to consider the impact of offensive language as we cannot predict when, where, or from whom a child might learn such words. Moreover, children may imitate and use these offensive words. Parents play a vital role in this regard. They should be mindful of their own words and actions because children tend to follow in their footsteps as they grow up. Additionally, if a magazine, movie, book, etc., contains content that involves judging people based on their origin, appearance, or speech, it can lead to negative consequences. In conclusion, both parents and the choice of reading materials matter. The books a child selects may have inappropriate content, and parents need to be self - aware of their own behavior to set a good example.
1269	4246	2	2	Every parent wishes to safeguard their child's innocence and prevent them from being influenced by certain things. However, the reality is that children will inevitably encounter such influences, whether from schoolmates, television, or the @CAPS1. Since it is ultimately their choice to make decisions, I believe libraries should not be censored based on the content of the materials. Firstly, no one is forcing individuals to pick up materials with offensive content. It is all about personal choice. There are plenty of other non - offensive options on the library shelves, but some people may want to access materials with such content. Removing these from libraries would be unfair to them. People should have the right to read and watch what they desire, and censoring libraries would violate this right. Secondly, if libraries are censored, eventually, there will be nothing left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This statement holds true. After one round of censoring, people may still find some topics inappropriate, leading to repeated censoring until libraries are empty. This would deprive people of the use of libraries as a resource. Finally, there is a difference of opinions. What may be offensive to one person may not be to another. It would be extremely difficult to decide what should be removed and what should be kept. It is much simpler to let people make their own decisions about what is suitable to read and watch. No one is forcing people to pick up offensive materials. If you don't like something, simply don't read or watch it. There are many reasons why library content should not be censored, and these three reasons are quite evident. Censoring libraries will limit people's choices, create problems in determining appropriateness, and ultimately render libraries useless. While parents want to protect their children, children will grow up and need to make their own decisions. Censoring libraries will not stop children from learning about offensive things. Parents can only raise their children well and hope to teach them the difference between right and wrong.
1270	4247	2	2	I believe that offensive materials such as books, music, and magazines should be restricted from those who are not yet mature, unless they have parental consent. Censorship can be beneficial for young children and adolescents. Young kids should not be exposed to negative content as it can have a detrimental impact on their character and personality. For example, no one wants to hear kids cursing in public because it can influence other children. My parents don't want me to say or do bad things around my younger siblings as it can have a stronger influence on them compared to when it comes from other kids. However, some forms of censorship may not be necessary for mature individuals, like high - school students. In high school, for materials that are inappropriate for younger kids, a parental signature can be required. Older people have matured and understand the importance of not being a bad influence on others. In conclusion, offensive materials should be kept away from those who have not matured, except with parental approval. Immature individuals should not be exposed to anything that can have a negative influence on them.
1271	4248	2	2	In modern society, the act of taking children to the library to select books is a common and beloved activity. However, a dilemma may arise when a child picks a book that a parent deems inappropriate. In such a situation, the question of what to do becomes pertinent. Should the parent take the book away or simply overlook it? It is important to note that libraries cannot be held accountable for having such books in their collections. Similarly, in stores like @ORGANIZATION1, one may encounter books, music, or movies that they find offensive. Yet, what one person finds offensive, another may not. This is because not everyone shares the same opinions. Some of these items may contain valuable information for others, and every book, piece of music, or movie serves a purpose. If everyone liked the same things, such as the same music, books, or movies, the world would be incredibly dull. Each individual has the right to choose what they enjoy in terms of reading, watching, or listening. Libraries and stores should also have the freedom to stock their shelves with whatever they see fit. It is true that some content may not be suitable for younger children, but as parents, it is their responsibility to shield their children from such material. Moreover, just because one person dislikes or considers something stupid does not mean that others will feel the same way. For instance, not every teenage girl will be interested in reading about house - building or listening to music from the @NUM1's, but that does not mean stores should stop selling these items. Different people have different tastes, as is evident in the popularity of fast rap music among younger kids today, which their parents may struggle to understand, but which holds meaning for teenagers. In conclusion, every song, book, or movie has its own meaning, and libraries and stores should not remove items from their shelves simply because one person deems them inappropriate.
1272	4249	2	2	I firmly believe that people should not have the authority to remove books, movies, magazines, and other such materials from library shelves. If an individual finds a particular movie, book, or magazine offensive, they should reach out to the author of the work and voice their complaints or share their thoughts. Everyone has their own opinions and beliefs about various aspects of life, and they have the right to express their agreements or disagreements. Additionally, most works have summaries on the front or back that give an overview of the content, allowing people to decide whether they want to engage further with the material. In a country where freedom of speech is a fundamental right, if someone takes the time and effort to have their voice published, others may be interested in hearing what they have to say. Disagreement is a natural part of human interaction; no one is obligated to agree with others. It is perfectly acceptable to have a different view, but everyone has the right to stand up and express their thoughts on a given situation. For example, when my coaches tell me that I'm doing something wrong in gymnastics or that a certain move doesn't look good, I listen to their feedback. I allow them to share their suggestions on how I can improve and gain more points. After they have finished speaking, I express my own thoughts and try to reason with them. This approach is not only respectful but also acknowledges that everyone can have different perspectives. Sometimes, by giving others a chance to speak, we may find that they are right. However, if one strongly dislikes a particular work, they can simply choose not to read or watch it. There is no need for rudeness. If someone has a strong disagreement, they can always write their own book or publish an article to express their own views, allowing others to either agree or disagree with them. In conclusion, all books, magazines, and movies should remain on the shelves as everyone has the right to express themselves and share their thoughts on a particular subject.
1273	4250	2	2	Censoring books, music, movies, or any other form of media from libraries or public access is a highly offensive concept. There are numerous things that can be considered 'offensive' to different individuals. Removing books or other materials from the shelves because they conflict with someone's morals or beliefs violates the writer's freedom of speech. This can also lead to serious conflicts between religious groups or people with different ideas, and it implies that the library, or even the country, adheres to a single set of ideas and suppresses those that deviate from it. One of the most significant concerns is the infringement on the freedom of speech. It may seem like a trivial matter, such as the case of '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?'. A mother had a particular book from the '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' @CAPS4 removed from the library shelf because her child was scared of the Halloween edition. The fact that something can be banned for such a minor reason is a terrifying thought. There were few instances of this specific @PERSON1 scene scaring all children, so there was no legitimate reason for the ban. When people find even the slightest flaw in something, they often want it banned, without considering that others may be interested in it. Another major issue related to censorship is its potential conflict with religion. The @CAPS5 is a published work, regardless of its religious nature. If someone from a different religion finds it offensive, there is a risk of it being banned. This could lead to more conflicts between religious groups, and ultimately, all religious works could be prohibited. The line between state and religion would become blurred due to censorship. If works related to Catholicism or other religions are banned, then works for Wiccans, Muslims, Buddhists, and other religious groups could also be at risk. This would leave religious and spiritual people without sources of comfort. Moreover, publishers and authors may be afraid to publish their works for fear of legal or social consequences, leading to a decrease in the discussion of religious and spiritual topics. Censorship will only create future problems. It could lead to the banning of not only religious books but also any content that goes against social norms. For example, if someone is homophobic, they may try to have the works of a gay author or books about the @CAPS7 community banned. These books provide a sense of security and comfort to the @CAPS7 community, and taking them away would be a great loss. Some books may even prevent people from falling into depression. Taking away someone's mental safety is more harmful than taking their physical safety. In conclusion, most people do not fully understand the problems that censorship can cause. Those responsible for making censorship decisions need to consider the broader implications. Censorship may seem insignificant at first, but it can have far - reaching consequences for the rights of individuals and the diversity of available information.
1274	4251	2	2	Devin @NUM1 @NUM2                                   @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The question of whether to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from library shelves when they are considered offensive is a long - standing argument. However, there are several reasons why such removal is not necessary. Firstly, in any town, there are usually multiple libraries. Some libraries have children's sections where all the books are suitable for young readers. Parents should also monitor what their children read. In @LOCATION1, there are at least twenty to thirty libraries, so people always have the option to choose a different library that better suits their preferences. Secondly, if someone sees a book or movie that they don't like, there is no need to complain. They can simply put the book down or avoid watching the movie, as someone else may be interested in it. People have the freedom to select the materials they want to engage with. Finally, as an @CAPS3 author, they have the right to freedom of speech. They can write whatever they want, and others do not have the right to blame the author for their content. Throughout history, many controversial books have inspired people. Without these books and the authors who wrote them, our society would be very different. In conclusion, I have presented three reasons regarding @CAPS1's view on library censorship. People have the choice of libraries, they can choose not to read offensive books, and authors have the freedom to write as they please.
1275	4252	2	2	In the harsh world we inhabit, I am firmly of the opinion that it is morally wrong for any program to conceal the harsh realities of our world from others. @CAPS1 will always be @CAPS1, and while an individual has the right to close their own eyes and enter a fantasy world, they have no right to do so for others. Personally, I am not afraid to delve into the history of human choices and shoulder the burden of the harsh knowledge I have acquired. I view the human race on this planet as a unified whole. This planet does not belong to a single race, nation, or culture; it belongs equally to every person. I have decided to take on the responsibility of understanding the past and using its lessons to shape a better future. Since the world belongs to everyone equally, my decisions will impact others as much as they impact me, and vice versa. It is a fact that every person's decisions have consequences for everyone, not just themselves. Many people believe that we should hide things that are considered 'offensive' to others, such as racism, world political issues, war casualties, and personal ethics. However, these subjects are very real and prevalent in our world. Just because they may be offensive does not mean that anyone has the right to make them disappear for others. In @LOCATION1, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression. But if people start removing expressed ideas and beliefs from the shelves of readers, how can these freedoms be effectively exercised? We all have the right to make decisions that affect our world, and since the world is owned equally by everyone, everyone's decisions carry equal weight. Therefore, we all have the right to know about the decisions, actions, and their consequences that people make every day. In conclusion, our world is both harsh and beautiful. Every person has the right to live and make decisions according to their own will. No one should make decisions for others. Everyone is responsible for their own lives and how their actions affect others. Moreover, no one has the responsibility to hide or change the world from others because it is the knowledge of the people that shapes the world, and the knowledge of the world influences people's decisions.
1276	4253	2	2	Author Katherine Paterson seems to convey that life should not be stagnant but rather proactive. It is advisable to take books from the library shelf, both for oneself and for children. Many books are already taken by others. I would go to the library and pick books for my kids and me. Mothers can select good books for children, such as those about body parts or grammar, so that children can start learning at a young age and begin to form sentences. On @DATE1, at Warsaw School, the principal decided to remove all items from the library because people did not borrow books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Most people put everything under observation. My question is why people did not borrow anything for their kids to start reading and learning from school. In my opinion, if I were the school principal, I would not remove anything from the library. I would keep everything so that kids can pick books from the shelf and borrow them to learn how to read and gain something special from their mothers.
1277	4254	2	2	"Dear @CAPS1, I have noticed a significant level of censorship in the libraries and strongly oppose these actions. Items have been removed from the shelves due to their content. Some content is vulgar, explicit, and offensive, but this does not justify their removal. Books, movies, music, and magazines are integral parts of people's lives and play a crucial role in personal development.  Firstly, books should not be removed from the shelves under any circumstances. These books are written and published because they hold meaning and can educate or inform people. Removing them is essentially shielding individuals, especially children, from valuable information. While some books discuss sensitive topics like sex or use offensive language, exposure to such content helps children understand what is wrong. For example, without reading about the treatment of slaves, children will never learn about this historical injustice. Similarly, they won't grasp the significance of cheating if they never read about a married woman having an affair. With common sense, readers can understand that these actions are wrong.  Movies should be treated in the same way. Modern movies, such as @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, showcase advanced technology. Although some movies contain vulgar language, offensive terms, or nudity, this does not mean they should be removed from the @CAPS1. However, movies with extreme content should be placed in an adult - only section, and pornography should not be on display. Other movies can teach history, even with graphic content, and show the consequences of immoral actions.  Magazines, like @ORGANIZATION1, are filled with educational information. Some educational magazines may have graphic content, but it can also help children understand the world. Magazines that show real - life situations, such as the plight of people in @LOCATION1, can teach children empathy. As long as they are not pornographic, magazines should be available.  Music is a powerful form of self - expression. While some songs have vulgar content, there are usually ""clean"" versions available. Only songs that cannot be cleaned up should be removed. Taking away music from people in a @CAPS1 is unjust.  In conclusion, censorship should be limited. Only extremely inappropriate items should be removed. Since these materials can be educational, they should remain accessible. People visit a @CAPS1 to learn, and books, movies, music, and magazines are important learning tools. Taking them away is wrong."
1278	4255	2	2	Have you ever read something that made you angry? Honestly, I can't recall the last time I entered a library and found something offensive. But I'm sure there are materials that can upset people.  I don't think offensive materials should be removed from library shelves. People go to libraries to acquire information. When checking out an item, one is aware that it might contain content they disagree with. Whether to read such materials should be a personal choice.  I'm not easily offended by what I see on library shelves, but I understand that some people are. If I come across something I disagree with, I simply won't read it. Before entering a public library with diverse reading materials, one should be prepared. What is offensive to one person may be amusing to another.  In short, don't get overly upset about what you read.
1279	4256	2	2	I believe that books are written with a purpose, and the words in them are integral to the overall message. However, I also recognize that some words can be offensive to readers. Nevertheless, I think it's rather silly to prevent people from reading books with offensive wording because the author intended those words to be there. Changing a single word can alter the entire meaning of the book.  For extremely offensive books, it may be appropriate to prevent people from reading them. One option could be to modify the book and then resell it. However, some readers may be unhappy with these changes, as they may perceive the book as saying something different, even though it's just worded differently. I support both allowing people to read these books and keeping them on the market.  Books with offensive wording can be wrong, but it's also wrong to assume that everyone finds them offensive. I'm certain that authors of such books did not intend to cause harm. I believe they would be sorry if they did. However, some people may struggle to read offensive words due to past experiences or personal dislikes. In such cases, they should stop reading when they encounter offensive content.  It's unfair to remove a book just because one person dislikes a single word. What is offensive to some may have no effect on others. I think books with offensive wording should have a warning on the back cover. This would help readers make informed decisions.  In conclusion, a book is a book. Readers should read the back - cover summary before buying. If the content is offensive and they don't like it, they shouldn't buy it. Don't judge a book by its cover. I find myself on both sides of this issue.
1280	4257	2	2	"Libraries are learning hubs that offer a wide range of information. There is no valid reason to remove offensive material. Before the internet, libraries were the primary source for research. Public libraries already have a good sense of what to place on their shelves.  As Katherine Paterson said, ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" This means that everyone has different opinions and may be offended by different things. If anyone could remove books they find offensive, there would be no books left in the library.  In the pre - internet era, there was no debate about removing certain books because libraries were the only source for research and entertainment. Today, people are spoiled by the internet. We can find information in minutes or even seconds without leaving home. We can also order or rent movies online. If people are concerned about library content, they should also worry about the explicit content on the internet.  When I visit the library, I rarely find a book worth questioning. Libraries are generally reliable institutions with good censorship. They have age - appropriate sections, and people usually stick to their respective age groups. I always read the books I choose from cover to cover.  In conclusion, libraries have a long - standing history. Their materials provide research and suitable entertainment for all ages. Whether or not we have the internet, libraries remain a dependable resource."
1281	4258	2	2	"I firmly believe that no CD, book, magazine, or any form of music should ever be removed from the shelves. If one does not like the content within these categories, they can simply choose not to watch, listen, or read. Just because an individual dislikes something does not mean others will share the same sentiment. Consider this: is there a CD, song, or passage so abhorrent that it must be taken off the shelves? I contend that there is not. Additionally, there may be individuals who have yet to read, see, or listen to that particular CD, song, or book. Moreover, a significant amount of money, time, and effort goes into creating a song, book, or CD. It can take nearly two years for a CD to be released, and when a new song comes out, consumers are often unaware as there is little promotion, such as announcements like ""Listen to Bullet for My Valentine's new song on [platform]."" When a new book is published, it is typically a well - known title like Harry Potter. In conclusion, no CD, book, music, or magazine should ever be removed from the shelves. @ORGANIZATION1."
1282	4259	2	2	There are specific books, games, and music that we are aware should not be available in libraries or stores. Children are the future, and every event in the future will be influenced by them. As members of @ORGANIZATION1, we should unite and remove inappropriate books, music, and movies from the shelves. Drugs, crime, violence, and other negative elements are prevalent in certain forms of media. Rappers often rap about objectifying women, killing people, etc. Even if they do not engage in these actions themselves, it has a negative impact on the majority of our children. Music is heard for @NUM1 hours daily through television, radio, and iPods. It has a particularly detrimental effect on the male gender, as they may learn to call women derogatory names and treat them poorly based on what they hear in music. Children either listen to this music or watch related content. Many problems stem from allowing children to watch movies with inappropriate ratings. Rated @CAPS1 movies are now accessible to children, increasing their likelihood of failing in life. This is the second issue with the media we allow our children to access from the shelves. The third item is video games. @PERCENT1 of children play video games. While we cannot stop the production of these games, we can prevent children from purchasing them at an inappropriate age. Most games involve sex, drugs, violence, and offensive language. Children take these games seriously and may believe they can replicate the actions in real life, leading to death, jail, drug use, school dropouts, and an increase in crime rates. By preventing children from accessing these inappropriate media, we can lower the crime rate, improve test scores, and brighten our future for ourselves and our children.
1283	4260	2	2	Suppose you enter a public library and come across a book that is racist or offensive. You have the right to remove it from the shelf. This applies not only to books but also to music, movies, and magazines. Authors have the right to freedom of speech, but there are valid reasons to consider removing offensive materials. Firstly, if a patron is offended by a book in the library, they may never return. For instance, I once visited the library and noticed a book making jokes about black people. I believe this is wrong because all people are equal regardless of appearance or beliefs. Secondly, offensive materials can cause the ratings of these items to decline. If someone is offended by a censored material, they will report it, leading to a lower rating. Libraries do not want to keep materials that have been reported by the community. Authors should not publish materials that are likely to offend others. Thirdly, it is necessary to get rid of offensive materials. No one wants to be exposed to something offensive. Imagine taking a movie home for the family and finding it contains inappropriate content. You would be offended and complain, which is bad for business, especially in a government - run library. In conclusion, I firmly believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they offend someone. There are three main reasons: the potential loss of patrons, the decline in ratings, and the need to eliminate offensive content. Now, what is your stance on this issue?
1284	4261	2	2	I firmly hold the view that censorship in libraries and other public media sources is wrong, immoral, and unfair. Authors, artists, photographers, etc., have the right to freedom of speech, and consumers should have the same right to choose what they are exposed to. Censoring public media not only violates basic American rights but also undermines the responsibility, originality, and self - expression of individuals. Parents should be responsible for protecting their children from inappropriate media. For example, when I was too young to understand the events of @NUM1, my parents shielded me from related stories. They turned off graphic or violent TV when I entered the room, considering such content inappropriate for a child of age @NUM2. Parenting involves ensuring a child's health, safety, and appropriate surroundings. So, @LOCATION1 should leave the parenting of children to the parents. As children grow into teenagers and then adults, they gain various privileges such as driving, voting, and drinking responsibly. If one is mature enough to choose a country's leader, they should be mature enough to choose their music. Artists and authors in @LOCATION1 have the right to freedom of speech and expression. Censoring publicly available products takes away this right. Some may argue that certain materials are too risqué or graphic, but the government should not have total control over what the public is exposed to. If this power is misused, @LOCATION1 could deviate from being a democracy and resemble a communist country like @LOCATION2. America prides itself on being a 'melting pot' and accepting. Restricting expression and originality would be contrary to this ideal. I would not want to live in a country where originality is stifled and acceptance is determined by the government. Although library - based media censorship is on a small scale, it is still a form of discrimination against creators and a removal of choice for the public. In conclusion, media censorship is wrong and should not be allowed.
1285	4262	2	2	Many people visit the library to borrow books, music, movies, and other forms of entertainment, with children being the most frequent users. The library is a place for relaxation and learning, and no one wants to encounter offensive materials. Therefore, certain items in the library should be censored. Movies with sexual content should not be available in libraries. If a child checks out an inappropriate movie, they may get in trouble with their guardians, and the librarian may be at fault. Magazines with exposed bodies can attract children. As children are easily influenced, seeing such content sets a bad example. Music in libraries should also be censored. Libraries should offer music that inspires and motivates. In my opinion, only influential music should be available for rental. Reading is crucial for success, so libraries should stock books that enhance vocabulary and educate, rather than those that discuss sexual topics. They should focus on history, math, and educational books. In conclusion, all content in the library should be censored to ensure it is age - appropriate. Since many children use the library, removing inappropriate materials can prevent them from being negatively influenced and reduce confusion.
1286	4263	2	2	I firmly believe that movies, magazines, books, and certain types of music should be removed from the shelves. These media often contain content that is inappropriate for all ages, especially for young children. Movies and magazines can expose kids to ideas that may not be suitable for their development. Books sometimes have offensive language, and rap music often contains inappropriate themes. The content in these media can influence people, particularly impressionable individuals, to mimic the actions and behaviors described. This can lead to negative consequences, such as early sexual activity and other irresponsible behaviors. Instead, people should engage with good - quality books, magazines, and music that are appropriate for all ages. To ensure a healthy and positive environment, it is essential to place only appropriate media on the shelves. This way, people can access materials that are beneficial and do not pose a risk of imparting inappropriate ideas. In conclusion, removing inappropriate media is a necessary step to safeguard the well - being and development of individuals.
1287	4264	2	2	I think this test is pointless. I really dislike reading and writing. The test should mainly focus on ensuring that students can read and write at an appropriate level. Many kids won't really try on this test until their @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade year. Moreover, a lot of teachers don't teach the tested material until the end of the year. Some aspects of the test, like the content and the duration, should be changed. It should be more focused on reading and writing levels. However, I do agree that the test should still exist as it helps distinguish between students who pass by cheating and those who pass through hard work. There should also be an alternative paper - based test because some kids perform better on paper than on a computer. This is how I feel about the test. I know I was supposed to write about offensive material, but this is what was on my mind, so I wanted to inform you. Thanks a lot.
1288	4265	2	2	Libraries house a wide variety of materials, including books of different genres such as mysteries, romances, comics, and biographies, as well as magazines, movies, and CDs. However, there are certain books and magazines that I would never pick up myself, let alone allow my future children to access. These materials contain content that is not beneficial for young minds. These books often depict sex, drug use, and use horrifying language. Young children are becoming interested in such books, obtaining them from school, friends, or libraries. They are easily influenced by the non - existent characters in these books. One of the main reasons I believe these books should be censored is that young people may imitate the actions they read about, thinking it's okay because fictional characters are doing it. This has led to serious issues such as ten - year - old children engaging in sexual activity, getting pregnant, and becoming young mothers. By the time they reach high school, they carry the burden of raising a child. Ten - year - olds are still children, and the human brain is not fully developed until around the age of twenty - five. They are not capable of discerning the wrongness of what they read. To prevent another generation from being negatively affected, we should remove these inappropriate materials from library shelves. Parents should have the opportunity to ensure their children have a chance at a happy future. In conclusion, censoring these materials is a necessary step to protect the well - being of children.
1289	4266	2	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I've recently visited several libraries and noticed a censorship problem in public libraries. While I understand the need to censor some mature or graphic novels due to children using the library, I don't think everyone should be restricted from accessing the books they need because of content issues. One reason against library censorship is that some people need to find information on specific topics, and the internet may not provide reliable information. High - school and college students may see their grades drop and fall behind in their studies if they can't access the necessary materials for assignments. Another issue is that the censored materials may be the only copies available nearby. Censoring a needed book could ruin the reading experience for someone. I believe that individuals over the age of @NUM1 should be able to borrow uncensored books. If some people are offended by the content of a book, they simply shouldn't check it out. There are countless people with diverse interests around the world. Library censorship may limit their ability to explore and research their topics of interest. By allowing access to a wider range of materials, people can gain more knowledge and potentially achieve greater things. In conclusion, library censorship should be banned as it causes problems and has a negative impact on people. This issue needs to be addressed promptly and effectively.
1290	4267	2	2	Imagine a library devoid of so - called offensive materials. In such a library, many of the great literary works that have shaped and influenced society @DATE1 would be missing. It's likely that there would be few books, magazines, or movies that everyone in the @CAPS1 deems appropriate. Some classic novels contain content that may be offensive to many. Offensive materials should remain in libraries @DATE1 because what one person finds offensive may not be so for another, who could be positively impacted by the banned literature. Music should also stay in libraries as artists create music for enjoyment, not to highlight offensive content. Moreover, offensive materials have long had an impact on society. Firstly, materials that one person finds offensive can be appreciated by many others. Some comedy and action movies are considered inappropriate by some but enjoyed by many. A movie, book, or magazine about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 may be offensive to those involved but can also educate others about the events. Children should get parental permission before accessing such materials. Secondly, all music should be available in libraries. Artists create music for entertainment, not to draw attention to offensive material. While some song lyrics are inappropriate for children, parents should monitor their children's music consumption. Finally, offensive materials have influenced society for ages. Many actions of the founding fathers of the @LOCATION1 were considered offensive at the time but were not wrong and contributed to the betterment of the @CAPS1. Banning all offensive materials would prevent them from having a positive impact. In conclusion, offensive materials should remain in libraries @DATE1. Although they may be controversial, they are valuable literary works that deserve to be read and studied. They contain important life lessons that can benefit many. If offensive materials were removed from libraries @DATE1, the @CAPS1 would resemble the @CAPS1 in @PERSON1's novel @CAPS4 @NUM1, where all books were burned and society was intellectually stunted.
1291	4268	2	2	I firmly believe that certain books containing offensive content or derogatory language should be banned from high - school libraries. In elementary schools, this might not be as crucial since young children may not understand the implications of such content. For instance, if a class reads an offensive book, it could lead to students from the targeted race feeling offended, potentially sparking a fight. High - schoolers can be more sensitive, and such situations can cause numerous problems. To avoid this, there should be a voting system to decide which books should be banned from classroom or school reading. Some may think banning books is a bad idea, but it would actually solve many issues. It all boils down to determining what is acceptable without hurting others' feelings. In class, there are often stories that mention race, making some students uncomfortable, and there's always someone who tries to make fun of it. If I were in such a situation, I'd do my best to ignore them to protect my grades and performance. If it got too annoying, I'd talk to my counselor. Schools generally don't tolerate such behavior, but there will always be such kids, and we have to ignore them. No one should skip school because they feel they don't fit in due to racial or appearance - based teasing. Just ignore or report it, and hopefully, the problem will be resolved.
1292	4269	2	2	I'm an avid reader and enjoy all types of books. I'm aware that there are books I've read that my parents might not approve of, but that hasn't stopped me. I think that after a certain age, people should have the freedom to read whatever they want. If I feel I'm not mature enough to read a particular book, I simply won't pick it up. When it comes to music, movies, and magazines, the situation is different. Music is similar to a book, but it engages a different sense as it's listened to rather than read. In my view, movies should be judged more carefully because they're like a form of show - and - tell. If children or teens take them too seriously, it can lead to problems. I believe that we shouldn't judge all materials based on assumptions. Everyone has different opinions and preferences. So, materials shouldn't be removed from library shelves if there are people who like or support what they offer.
1293	4270	2	2	When one thinks of a library, the first thoughts are often of quietness, peace, and calm. However, once someone starts reading a book, magazine, movie, etc. in a library and comes across something offensive, this perception can change. I firmly believe that offensive materials like books, magazines, and movies should be censored and removed from libraries. Although everyone has the right to their own opinion, a library is supposed to be a place of peace. Having offensive literature makes the library seem unkempt. If people want to read offensive materials, they should look elsewhere. When I was young, I participated in library events like reading - contests. I loved exploring the library. I remember that there were always many magazines on the shelves, some showing half - dressed people. While I understand people want to stay informed, they can find such magazines elsewhere. Having these offensive magazines in libraries where children can see them is inappropriate and can upset parents. Another reason for censorship is that offensive materials can influence teens to do bad things. For example, books about drugs and smoking can make teens think these actions are okay. Removing such books from libraries would likely reduce the negative influence on teens. In my opinion, censoring library materials would make people happier and the world a better place. If someone wants to read offensive content, a library is not the place to look.
1294	4271	2	2	My stance on censorship is that it's a complex issue. I believe that if a book, movie, etc. discriminates against one or more groups of people, the public should have a say in whether it stays on library shelves. If the materials use offensive language or actions to harm or discriminate against a race, they should be removed. However, if they are part of the world or national history, they should remain for future generations to learn from. Most materials in libraries don't aim to discriminate. Censorship can go either way, depending on the situation and the material. Just because someone thinks something is offensive doesn't make it a fact. If a book is popular in the library, I'd be hesitant to remove it as people have different views on what is offensive. If I were a parent today, I'd let my child read a so - called offensive book if it was part of our country's past. My intention would be for my child to learn about history, not to act on the content. In conclusion, my view is that censorship depends on the situation and material, and these are just my personal opinions.
1295	4272	2	2	I do not believe that offensive materials such as books, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, if anyone could remove books they find offensive, libraries would become useless. Students would have a harder time learning about various topics in the world. For example, a mother didn't want her sixth - grade daughter to learn about sex education because she thought her daughter was too young. But by doing so, the daughter may miss out on learning about diseases related to underage or unprotected sex, which could lead to serious consequences that could have been prevented through library books or school classes. Secondly, removing books from the shelves is disrespectful to the authors and everyone involved in writing them. Just because we don't agree with the content doesn't mean we can discard the hard work. It defeats the purpose of freedom of speech as it restricts authors from writing and publishing what they want and expressing their opinions. This problem can be easily solved. For example, offensive materials can be placed in a separate section of the library and made available only to adults of a certain age. They can also be rated like movies. In conclusion, I strongly oppose giving citizens the right to remove offensive materials from library shelves as it can have a negative impact on the community, is disrespectful to authors, and there are simple solutions to address the issue.
1296	4273	2	2	I firmly believe that offensive and inappropriate books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves. While people have the right to freedom of speech, it should not be expressed in an offensive way. If individuals wish to have their works, such as movies or music, presented or heard, they should ensure they are appropriate. Just because others engage in inappropriate content does not make it acceptable. Some people may lack the judgment to avoid imitating the actions depicted in movies or songs. Many individuals are attracted to songs that promote negative behavior, perhaps to gain attention. I recall that when I was younger, I was influenced by the media and engaged in foolish actions, thinking they were right. People often desire to express themselves, but it should be done appropriately. Some artists and actors may not intend to convey negative messages to children, yet they feel compelled to create offensive content to gain public attention. I learned this the hard way and now understand that the only way to be heard is by saying and doing appropriate things. In conclusion, we should uphold appropriate standards in media content to avoid negative influences.
1297	4274	2	2	Censorship has been a long - standing issue, and many people advocate for censorship in various media, including television, books, and magazines. However, there is a problem when it comes to older teens. They are not young children and should not have everything censored. For example, the requirement to be accompanied by an adult to watch a rated movie is an over - reach for older teens. For young children, censorship is necessary as they are too young to be exposed to bad language and inappropriate content. Parents should also be vigilant about what their young children read and hear. Some parents are negligent in this regard, and their children may pick up bad language and habits, which can lead to trouble at school. Younger kids are like sponges, and those around them act as role models. On the other hand, older teens, such as those aged @NUM1 and @NUM2, are more mature. They are likely to encounter bad language in their daily lives, so censoring books in the library may be unnecessary. Books are meant to provide real - life experiences and knowledge. Everyone has different opinions, and in my view, high - school materials like books and magazines should not be overly censored. As people grow older, they become more aware of what is right and wrong. Therefore, we should respect the maturity of older teens and not impose excessive censorship.
1298	4275	2	2	Imagine walking into your favorite library and finding that your favorite book or movie is missing. The librarian tells you it was removed from all public libraries because it was considered offensive. This would surely be frustrating, especially if you had read the book and found nothing wrong with it. Of course, there are some materials that children should not access due to offensive content, but complete removal is not the answer. There are alternative solutions that can satisfy everyone. One option is to restrict access to offensive material. Only the librarian would have access, and they would be responsible for determining whether a person, child or adult, can view this content. Another solution is to have a separate building for offensive materials. Only those over @NUM1 would be allowed entry, and they would need to present an ID and a library card. This would prevent underage individuals from obtaining inappropriate items. A third solution is to require signed permission from a parent or guardian for underage users. When a child applies for a library card, the parent must be present and specify what the child can and cannot borrow. I believe that removing books, movies, and music from shelves violates the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. If someone can control what others read, see, or listen to, it could lead to the erosion of our rights. However, I also recognize that certain age groups should not have access to certain materials. By implementing these alternative solutions, we can strike a balance between protecting individuals from inappropriate content and upholding the principle of free speech.
1299	4276	2	2	In my opinion, what one person finds offensive may be valuable to another. All types of books, music, and magazines should remain on library shelves. Different books offer diverse perspectives, and some people have a deep connection with certain books that others may not understand. Removing certain books can hurt people's feelings. Taking away music would be even worse, as many people use it to escape from their problems. Losing this form of escape can leave them feeling helpless. Movies are also popular as they help people understand different viewpoints. Banning movies would deprive people of entertainment. While some movies may be offensive, it is not up to others to decide. Magazines are a source of news, and although much of the news can be offensive, it reflects the real world. Removing magazines would prevent people from staying informed about the latest news and gossip. Taking away the things that people use to connect, escape, be entertained, and stay informed is likely to cause negative reactions. Everyone is different, and what one person finds offensive may be important to another. If someone thought what you liked was inappropriate, you would surely feel unfair. Therefore, we should respect everyone's preferences and not remove materials based on subjective judgments of offensiveness.
1300	4277	2	2	Titles like 'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2', 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4', and 'The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2' are well - known literary masterpieces that have been enjoyed by many since their publication. However, these books have also been banned from certain libraries across the country and the world. When parents send their children to school, they expect them to receive an education that aligns with their values. But some parents become outraged when they see books in the school library that they consider immoral and do not want their children exposed to such content. In reality, this form of censorship is not helpful. By keeping students away from certain books or subjects, the censors limit what students can learn. Censorship not only shields people from shocking ideas but also from ideas that can stimulate thinking. If a person cannot think independently, they cannot draw their own conclusions. A person who cannot think or make decisions for themselves cannot be considered a free individual. Infamous dictators like @PERSON1 burned books to control what their citizens thought. Similarly, when a parent bans a book in a school library, they are preventing their child and other students from accessing certain ideas. Instead of trying to remove books from the school library, parents should teach their children to be discerning readers. If they do not want their children to read a particular book, they should simply tell them so. Parents should guide their children to follow moral guidelines, and if certain books may lead to independent thinking that goes against their wishes, they should talk to their children privately rather than causing a general ban. In conclusion, we should encourage independent thinking and proper guidance rather than censorship in schools.
1301	4278	2	2	Some books, movies, music, and magazines in libraries should be removed due to the content they present to younger children. Firstly, certain materials are racist, which can teach young children incorrect values and wrong attitudes towards different cultures. Secondly, some of these media contain inappropriate content such as killing, drug - dealing, and profanity that young children should not be exposed to. This can give them the wrong ideas and make them think such behaviors are acceptable. Finally, there are items that simply do not belong in libraries or should be restricted to areas where young kids cannot access them without adult supervision. In conclusion, libraries should not have such offensive or inappropriate materials as they can mislead children and give them the wrong impression, so these items should be removed.
1302	4279	2	2	The purpose of libraries is to allow people to read what they desire. If I owned a library, I would keep all materials on the shelves because people have diverse preferences. It's not just about a few individuals; we need to consider everyone's feelings. If we start removing certain items from libraries and bookstores, the situation could get out of control. For example, if someone wants to learn about a controversial topic like slavery, removing related materials would be unfair, even though some people might find them offensive. Everyone has an opinion, but we shouldn't suppress materials that don't cause physical or emotional harm. If we were to accommodate every opinion, the world would become dull and chaotic. People have different interests, and taking away long - held materials would only lead to conflicts and change people's daily lives. The chances of this change being positive are extremely low. Since what is offensive to some is interesting to others, we should keep everything on the shelves. Unless a large number of people object, a few complaints are not a big deal. It's unlikely that everyone in the world will ever agree on what should be removed, so we should leave the materials for those who enjoy them.
1303	4280	2	2	We all enjoy reading books, watching movies, listening to music, and reading magazines. It's difficult and almost impossible to stop people from accessing these forms of media as they are available everywhere, including movie stores, malls, gas stations, yard sales, and public libraries. However, the issue of censorship arises. Censorship is important to many parents, especially when it comes to the public library in their area. Parents want to take their children to the library to get books, movies, etc., but they worry about inappropriate content such as nudity, violence, racial pictures, or profanity. These things can be offensive not only to parents but also to anyone. As a parent, I would not want my children to be exposed to such 'bad things' at a young age. I believe that censoring is a great idea. Libraries and other places with media should either censor their materials or categorize them into groups like 'adults', 'young adults', and 'kids'. This way, parents can know where to look and won't have to worry about inappropriate content. Censorship should be implemented everywhere.
1304	4281	2	2	Censorship involves the removal or blocking of certain media or readable content, and the decision often lies with the distributor rather than the creator (author, director, or publisher). Creators make content based on their own interests, while distributors have the right to decide whether to publicly display it. Libraries have a wide range of materials on their shelves, but the display of graphic content is restricted by educational rules. All content is a form of art created by an individual, and it should not be changed without the creator's permission. However, distributors can choose whether to showcase the content. Libraries display media for the public, as long as the audience meets their criteria. Sometimes, the audience may encounter unexpected media, but it's their choice to accept it. It's not the creator's responsibility to ensure where the content is displayed, but the audience's choice to view it. When we have options in front of us, it's our decision to read or see what we want. We shouldn't force libraries to remove books just because the censorship level doesn't meet our expectations. Everyone has different views on content, and it's not our place to force our opinions on others. As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone has the right to remove books they dislike, there will be no books left on the shelves.
1305	4282	2	2	Nowadays, people can be easily offended. Readers, listeners, and writers are often focused on getting what they want rather than considering the consumers. Even if some stories, books, or articles are completely false, we shouldn't let others' opinions ruin things for everyone. People are quick to take offense and feel the need to act, but this isn't always a good or bad thing. The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, which means people have the right to read, write, and say whatever they want. Fake and false writings are a minor issue for readers and writers. In recent times, people tend to believe everything they read, write, or hear, and it's difficult to distinguish facts without personal experience. Opinions are a significant factor, but they also fall under the umbrella of freedom of speech. Reading and writing are wonderful activities that have a long - standing history. We shouldn't let other readers' opinions interfere with our enjoyment of these activities.
1306	4283	2	2	Controversy surrounds the issue of offensive or inappropriate materials in various forms of media and publications. Author Katherine Paterson astutely pointed out that if one person has the right to remove a book they abhor from the shelf, then everyone else has the same right, which would ultimately leave no books available. There is an equal amount of good and bad in publications, and determining what is good or bad is highly controversial. Each creator of a song, movie, magazine, or other publication targets a specific customer base. For instance, Playboy magazine is not intended for five - year - olds but for a particular adult demographic, while certain children's content is made for young kids. Usually, the intention behind these products is not negative.  It is disheartening to see the increasing number of people of different ages getting involved with pornography. I firmly believe that the concept of pornography is wrong, degrading, and utterly disgusting, yet others strongly disagree. Some religions consider certain series blasphemous and evil, while others have no such view. Controversy pervades our culture, and everyone has their own opinions and choices.  As for the right to restrict a child's reading, my mother wouldn't let me read certain books when I was younger as she thought they were from the devil. This only made me more eager to read them. When I reached middle school, I read those books and found that they weren't as bad as she had thought. Instead, they explored the theme of good vs. evil, which I saw as a battle between the forces of good and Satan. My views were very different from my mother's.  If I had read those books at a younger age, my perspective might have been different. I think my mother was trying to protect me from potentially harmful content. It is perfectly reasonable for parents to set rules and boundaries to protect their children. However, parents should be aware that as children grow older, they will make their own choices.  In conclusion, books are placed in either the kids' or adult sections for a reason. We should use our judgment and trust our kids to make good decisions about what they read and allow to influence their thoughts.
1307	4284	2	2	I firmly believe that there should be no censorship in libraries. The reason we have freedom of speech is to allow for a diverse range of ideas and information. While it's true that some materials may not be suitable for certain individuals or age groups, in life, everyone will inevitably encounter things they don't like, enjoy, or agree with.  Censoring library materials would go against the principle of free access to knowledge. By allowing all types of books, we enable people to form their own opinions and make informed decisions. If we start removing books based on personal sensitivities, we limit the educational and intellectual growth that libraries are meant to foster.  In conclusion, maintaining an uncensored library environment is essential for the free exchange of ideas and the development of a well - informed society.
1308	4285	2	2	The question of whether people take offensive books seriously is a complex one. There is a significant amount of content in books that some people find offensive, while others have a different view. I'm quite certain that libraries have censored sections, but even if they don't, people shouldn't be overly worried about it, and here's why.  Young people are exposed to various materials in books, music, and movies at the library. They also observe what is happening around them and what their mentors and parents are doing or watching. The author, Katherine Paterson, cannot solely blame libraries for the exposure to potentially offensive content.  In today's 21st century, parents often don't closely monitor what their children are exposed to. Kids are naturally curious and will explore what they first encounter. If parents don't want their children to see offensive material in libraries, they should be more vigilant and keep a closer eye on their kids' activities.  Personally, I don't pay much attention to offensive content on library shelves. We are living in a better world than before, and getting angry over such petty issues seems unnecessary. As children grow older, they will inevitably come across content that was previously restricted.  We shouldn't be overly sensitive to offensive books. After all, they are just words on paper. I believe that offensive materials should remain on library shelves because some people may need to know the truth to better understand the world.  In conclusion, instead of getting worked up about offensive library content, parents should take more responsibility for their children's exposure, and we should recognize that these materials can serve a purpose in our learning and understanding.
1309	4286	2	2	I strongly believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and other such items should not be removed from library shelves. If you find something offensive, the best course of action is to simply walk away and ignore it. What one person finds offensive, another may like. The world doesn't revolve around individual sensitivities, so it's wise to take a step back.  When I was younger, I used to see books with titles like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc., and I thought they were funny, but the adults didn't share my view. These materials are placed in the library for people to read, not just to look at. They are not intended to offend anyone.  If you come across something offensive, you should move to a different area of the library to avoid being offended. Different people have different tastes, and libraries offer a wide variety of options. There may be things that really offend you and things that you love. You need to make a smart choice and stay away from what might upset you.  Libraries have the right to display any and all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., because it is their facility. They shouldn't have to worry about people being offended. In fact, most of the time, the materials they put up are not bad at all and may even be helpful, although one person may find them harmful or offensive.  In conclusion, libraries should be able to shelve whatever they want. In the real world, we don't always get what we want or like what we see, and we need to learn to deal with that and make appropriate choices.
1310	4287	2	2	A library is a haven, a place where people can escape the world and immerse themselves in knowledge. It is a repository of diverse information, presenting various viewpoints on every subject. Information in libraries should not be censored, even if it is considered offensive.  A library should maintain an unbiased stance. Removing certain information would show bias towards a particular group that believes in that knowledge. Just because something may be offensive doesn't mean people are obligated to read it. Katherine Paterson's point is valid: if everyone could remove books that offended them, there would be no books left in the library.  There are numerous perspectives on different subjects, and everyone should have the opportunity to be educated about others' viewpoints. For example, the world has a multitude of religions, each with conflicting views that may offend one another. However, this doesn't mean we should withhold information about different religions. Every person visiting a library should have the right to learn about other religions. If we censor books that might offend people, we would create an uneducated society.  A library is a place for education and learning. It allows people to explore any subject they choose. If libraries start censoring information, they will lose their unbiased nature and become a place that caters to a specific group. This would undermine the library's role as a safe haven for all to escape and learn.  In conclusion, censorship of books and other materials in libraries would have a highly negative impact. It is crucial to preserve the library as a place where diverse ideas can be freely accessed and explored.
1311	4288	2	2	My name is @CAPS1, and I'm writing this article to discuss items that don't belong in libraries. There are numerous things that should not be exposed to children, such as sexism, racism, inappropriate @CAPS3 content, and pornography. First, books containing racist remarks should not be accessible to young children. This sets a poor example, potentially leading them to believe they can imitate the actions and words in the book. Similarly, books with sexual content have no place in public libraries. Many stories discuss sex and related topics, which are inappropriate for young readers. Second, @CAPS2 - @CAPS3 movies, including horror and pornographic films, should be excluded. Exposure to such content at a young age can damage a child's mind and teach them things they should learn later in life. Finally, @CAPS4 magazines, which often feature explicit and naked photos, should not be available to children. Young girls might think it's acceptable to take and share such photos. In conclusion, all these items should be banned from libraries for various reasons. The @LOCATION1 authorities should consider these points and think about the consequences if their own children were exposed to inappropriate materials.
1312	4289	2	2	As a child, I vividly remember my mother reading me bedtime stories. One book, 'A light in the @CAPS1' by @PERSON1, stood out the most. The other day, when I visited the public library, I noticed some books had been censored for promoting mistreating parents, using offensive language, encouraging bad habits, and other similar issues. I was angry that this particular book had essentially disappeared from children's literature because a few people @CAPS2 that it conveyed a negative message. But think about it: when we're children, whether being read to or reading on our own, do we really pay attention to such minor details? I firmly believe that books and music should not be censored. Society is capable of distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable content. While I understand the concept of warning labels, I think censorship goes too far. The incident I described actually happened to me. I still can't see the reasons for censoring that book, even when I read it now. It was unjustly censored, meaning many deserving children will never have the chance to experience this wonderful book. Over the years, many things have been censored. Some had valid reasons, while others were perhaps censored because someone didn't like the way a book was written. People should have the right to choose what they borrow from public or school libraries. Instead of censorship, a simple warning about potentially inappropriate content for a certain age group would suffice. When we look back on our childhoods and the books we loved, how many of them were senselessly censored? This is why I believe there should be no censorship.
1313	4290	2	2	Nearly every city in the @LOCATION1 has a public library, a place where citizens can borrow books, music, movies, magazines, and more. Libraries are divided into different sections, such as kids', adult, and fiction sections. A common question arises: should we remove offensive items from library shelves? Libraries have existed for years, and uncensored materials have been accessible to children during this time. As children, we're naturally curious and want to explore everything. Bad things are always present as obstacles, forcing us to make the right choices. Just like in stores, offensive items can be found everywhere, including libraries. However, libraries are for everyone, and not all patrons are the same. Therefore, libraries offer a wide variety of materials. In my opinion, libraries should not be blamed for having content that's inappropriate for children. Most libraries are well - organized into categories. If children are separated from adult materials, there's no issue with having these items on the shelves. When I visit a library, these materials are out of reach for children. Society knows what's suitable for children and ensures they can't access inappropriate content. Author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' This is a valid point. If I have a child in the future, I'd hope they never encounter certain materials. But it's a parent's responsibility to protect their children. As a teenager, I was oblivious to the bad things around me at a young age. Most children can't access uncensored items, and even if they did, they probably wouldn't understand them. There are far worse things for children to encounter than briefly seeing something inappropriate at a library. Concerned parents should focus more on what their children are exposed to in stores, the people they interact with, and the media they consume. The internet is the most uncensored place a child can access. Compared to real - life threats, libraries should be the least of their concerns. I firmly believe that children should never be exposed to uncensored adult content. But if these items are placed where only adults can access them, there's no problem. Children will always encounter inappropriate things in life, but that's a part of growing up. As long as libraries keep such items out of children's reach, there's no need for censorship.
1314	4291	2	2	The question of censorship, whether it's @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, is a complex one. I can understand why libraries might choose to exclude certain books. Libraries are places for learning and work. If you're sitting in a public library and someone nearby is reading smut, it can be extremely awkward. Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive, others disagree. Imagine you're a mother with a young child in the library. Your child discovers a '@CAPS3' magazine. This is not something you'd want to explain to your child. If the library hadn't stocked the magazine, this situation wouldn't have occurred. Libraries are public spaces that should be treated with respect. If people want to access inappropriate content, they can easily find it elsewhere in the modern world. It's therefore reasonable to keep certain materials out of libraries. How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, books with rude language, and scandalous themes? When trying to work or learn in a library, these distracting items on the shelves can make the process more difficult. Libraries are serious institutions and should be treated as such. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a necessary measure to maintain a proper and respectful environment.
1315	4292	2	2	There should be age - restricted sections in libraries, similar to the adult section. There's no need to remove these materials from the shelves. I understand that young children might be offended or scared by certain content, which is why creating a separate section for older and more mature individuals is a good idea. What offends people varies. Some content is clearly inappropriate for children, but as long as it's out of their reach, there's no problem. The only time I'd support removing an item is if it's extremely offensive, like content promoting racism. In my opinion, censorship in libraries is a positive thing. Some people may not approve of the materials available in libraries. Therefore, I firmly support censorship in libraries to ensure that the content is appropriate for different age groups and to maintain a suitable environment for all library users.
1316	4293	2	2	There are numerous books, movies, and magazines on the shelves that can offend people in various ways. These may include books about war, slavery, and religion, which can aggravate individuals and prompt them to remove such books from libraries without hesitation. While there are indeed many books that can be offensive and discriminatory, the question arises as to whether they should truly be removed.  I firmly believe that books serve a purpose. Each book and magazine contains factual information about what is happening or could happen in the world. Even unrealistic books are created for a reason and should have a place in the library.  Libraries offer thousands of books and movies to choose from. If someone finds a particular book offensive or discriminatory, they can simply pass it by and select one that suits their preferences. It is an individual's choice what they want to read or watch, not the fault of the books or movies.  Books and movies are categorized into genres. If one does not wish to view a certain type of content, they can skip the relevant section and choose something they are comfortable with.  There are also many books and movies that may seem discriminatory but can actually teach valuable life lessons. For instance, when I was a child, I read a book about a girl who had a car accident and lost everything because she was driving drunk. My mother was against me reading it, but it taught me the crucial lesson of never drinking and driving. The story left a lasting impression on me, and I am certain I will never engage in such dangerous behavior.  This demonstrates that even seemingly discriminatory and wrong books or movies can educate people about life's dangers.  Even if we were to remove offensive magazines, books, and movies with no potential, people would still find ways to access the content they seek, whether from the library or elsewhere. There are many misguided individuals in the world, and banning certain books from libraries may not deter them from their actions.  Music is another aspect that should not cause excessive concern. Some people listen to specific types of music to calm their nerves. Take the @CAPS1 rapper @ORGANIZATION1, for example. His songs are filled with sadness and frequent profanity, but they also convey messages that resonate with others. Listening to his songs may prevent some individuals from engaging in illegal activities or even committing suicide. His music can represent their lives and make them realize they are not alone.  In conclusion, I believe that every book, movie, and magazine may contain something offensive to someone. If we start removing everything that someone finds offensive, there may be no books left on the library shelves. The books we read, magazines we glance at, and movies we watch may have offensive elements, but I do not think they should be censored or removed, as they may offer valuable insights and lessons in the future.
1317	4294	2	2	Freedom of speech and the freedom of the press are privileges that we, as @CAPS1, are fortunate to possess. I am firmly against censorship in libraries. Authors, publishers, editors, and directors have the right to express their opinions in their work. If they choose to incorporate adult - themed subjects, it is their prerogative. They have the freedom to present their books, magazines, and movies as they see fit.  We all have the autonomy to select the books and movies we want to borrow from libraries. Movies are rated to inform the audience about the appropriate age and maturity level for viewing. For example, if a @NUM1 - year - old wishes to borrow a movie rated @CAPS2, it is not a suitable choice. Movies rated @CAPS2 are intended for a mature audience over the age of @NUM2.  When it comes to books, I often use a book review website to assess the content. If I find that a book contains material I do not want to read or that is too mature for me, I simply avoid it. I have the power and responsibility to choose books that match my age and maturity.  There are multiple ways to evaluate the content of library items. Just because a movie or book is released does not mean we have to consume it. We make choices every day, and selecting a book or film from the library is a relatively minor one, but it is still our decision based on our capabilities.  Authors, directors, and editors should not have their work penalized if some people disagree with the content. Everyone's opinion on what is right and wrong varies. Therefore, if someone believes a particular work is inappropriate, they have the option not to read or watch it.  I am grateful for the freedom of opinion and speech. While we should not abuse this freedom, we also have no right to dictate how others use it. Just as we can choose what to read, authors can choose what to write. Libraries should not deprive us of the freedom to make our own decisions about what we view and read. In conclusion, maintaining this freedom in libraries is essential for a diverse and informed society.
1318	4295	2	2	Have you ever felt that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., can be offensive at times? In my experience, listening to music and watching movies can sometimes be offensive without us even realizing it. I've listened to rap music with a lot of cuss words and watched movies that feature only white or black people. So, I think some music, movies, etc., might seem offensive.  However, when I encounter something that seems offensive, I usually don't take it seriously. I do this because I watched @CAPS1 The @CAPS2, where white and black people initially had conflicts but then got along after playing football together and even won the championship. This shows that people can overcome offensive situations and become friends. So, I don't take @CAPS3 as offensive.  How can we be sure that the actor or the writer is referring to us? I see it as a minor issue. I actually enjoy @CAPS3 as a form of entertainment. It can also help us learn about what's happening in the world and our achievements. So, I really don't find @CAPS3 offensive. But other people may take it that way, and that's their problem. There's nothing we can do about it once it's out there.  If something is offensive, we can simply choose not to listen, watch, or read it. We shouldn't pull it off the shelf and condemn it. There could be a good meaning behind it. There are many great movies, songs, and books in the world. So, don't hate it; just move on with life and don't let @CAPS3 affect you.  In conclusion, I don't think it's right to remove something just because it might seem offensive. It's not necessarily a bad thing to not take @CAPS3 as offensive. We should be more open - minded and look for the positive aspects in such works.
1319	4296	2	2	Dear Newspaper,  I would like to begin by stating that books, magazines, music, movies, etc., are beneficial for high - school students in the library. It's a great activity for them when they have free time. However, while some things in the library can be educational, some of the content is inappropriate.  In high school, students are exposed to a lot of information just by walking down the hallways. Libraries should not further encourage this by stocking books about drugs, alcohol, and sex.  Books about drugs have a place to an extent. Reading about medications, doctor's visits, and prescriptions is acceptable. But books about pot, weed, crank, or meth are going too far. We need to learn about the dangers of these drugs, but we don't need to know how to make or use them.  The same goes for books about alcohol. We should be aware of the risks of drinking, but we don't need to read about teen parties and activities while drunk.  Advertisements and magazines are the worst for us students. They often contain content related to drugs, alcohol, or sex, which can influence us to engage in these behaviors in high school. The front covers of magazines often feature stories about people caught with drugs, their dating lives, etc. While we will and need to know these things eventually, I don't think we should read about them in books, as it may make us want to try these things.  I believe that books that cross the line regarding alcohol, drugs, and sex should be removed from libraries. This way, students can have appropriate materials to learn from and discuss with their parents. I've been in libraries, and I know that the first books I'm drawn to often involve one of these three topics because they're interesting. But when I read them, I start to think about going to parties and having fun, which is not always a good influence.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that these inappropriate books should be removed from libraries so that students can have a more positive and educational experience.
1320	4297	2	2	Do you visit libraries? People around the world go to libraries for various reasons. When you visit a library, you usually have a purpose, and you must also maintain silence. Libraries are fascinating in many ways.  Some @MONTH1 may wonder what a library is. It's a great place to go. People visit libraries for different activities. Most commonly, they go to borrow books. But libraries also offer school tutoring, a quiet place to read, and a place to access information. There are many things to do in a library.  Why do people go to libraries? I personally don't visit libraries often, but many others do. People who love reading go to find the books they want. I would go for school tutoring as I really need it. It helps a lot with homework. My mother goes to the library on occasion to get information from books or the computer. There is a wealth of information available. There are also those who use the library's internet for video games, though I use it for other purposes.  My eight - year - old sister loves going to the library. I mention this because there are rules for underage children. If you are under a certain age, you need your parents' permission to borrow a book, and you also need a library card. I know these rules may seem strict, but they ensure that children borrow age - appropriate books. I always have to make sure my sister borrows books at her grade level, or the library staff will scold us. I think these rules are beneficial for most kids.  In conclusion, I hope you've learned something about libraries from this. They are excellent places to obtain information, borrow books, or find a quiet spot. You can easily find a library nearby; there are plenty of them. However, if you don't like reading or being in a quiet environment, libraries may not be for you. It's up to you to decide.
1321	4298	2	2	In @LOCATION1, people enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Some prefer going to the movies, while others opt for a pleasant stroll in the park. Currently, there is a growing sentiment that we should shield ourselves from unpleasant, offensive content. However, I firmly believe that individuals should have the freedom to access whatever they desire.  The primary reason for this freedom is that it is our right. There are numerous restrictions in life, but reading should not be one of them. We should not have to seek permission to read a particular book. It is unfair to those with a genuine interest in reading. I find such restrictions utterly absurd.  Secondly, the principle of “if you don't like it, don't read it” is straightforward. Nowadays, people are overly concerned about others' actions. If something is unappealing to you, simply avoid it. For instance, if I know a book is offensive to me, I won't read it. It's that simple.  Lastly, what others read is none of our business. People today are excessively preoccupied with others' choices, which is quite irrational. If we focus on our own interests, we would be better off. If I come across an offensive book, I would not go around advocating for its removal from the shelves. It is neither right nor fair.  In conclusion, we should have the right to read whatever we want. It is our fundamental right, and the “if you don't like it, don't read it” principle should prevail. People need to stop being overly concerned about others' reading choices. If someone wants to read a book that you find offensive, there is nothing you can do about it. That is the nature of life.
1322	4299	2	2	If certain literature offends you, it is advisable not to read it. Before picking up a book or magazine, consult your friends or conduct some research. Sometimes, the cover can be misleading, so read the description first.  Many people misinterpret certain literature in @MONTH1 and take offense. However, the more you understand a piece of writing, the less likely you are to be offended. You should at least try to accept some of the ideas presented, as they may be useful in the future.  When you first read something in @MONTH1, you may get upset and fail to realize its potential benefits. Taking time to think about the content is an effective way to deal with being offended. Try to view the situation from different perspectives, as both sides may have valid points.  If you are still offended, avoid such literature. Steer clear of books and magazines with offensive content. Ignore offensive advertisements on TV or the internet, as they can make you feel worse or even cause stress.  In conclusion, if something truly offends you, the best course of action is to avoid it. This approach is applicable in various situations, not just when dealing with offensive literature. By ignoring such content, you can reduce stress and focus on more positive things.
1323	4300	2	2	Books have the remarkable ability to transport us to new worlds and introduce us to novel ideas that we may never have considered before. However, the question arises: are there books that are too extreme and should not be made available? While opinions may vary, I firmly believe that all reading materials and media should remain on library shelves. People have the right to be aware of the real world, including its negative aspects.  Media diversity in libraries is crucial. People need to be educated about all aspects of the world, including the unpleasant ones. By being informed, they can make more informed decisions and potentially combat evil. Moreover, it is their right to choose what they want to read, as every individual should have the freedom to shape their own identity. We can only hope that by providing people with knowledge, they will act responsibly.  Even in education, there are attempts to restrict certain areas of knowledge. However, in the long run, does this truly benefit people? If individuals were well - informed and had access to a wide range of resources, they would be less likely to seek information from unreliable sources out of curiosity. Each person should have the right to learn what they desire without any restrictions. Otherwise, they may never discover the truth behind a topic, which goes against the purpose of learning.  Knowledge seekers should have the freedom to explore as they wish. With proper education, they can make new advancements for the benefit of all. However, this can only happen when they are exposed to both sides of an issue. Without a comprehensive understanding, people may lack the substance in their arguments and even impede others' learning.  Another reason against censorship is that in @LOCATION1, and hopefully globally in the future, we have the right to pursue happiness as long as we do not hinder others' dreams. People need to be true to themselves to contribute to the world. If we were not allowed to be individuals, there would be no progress. For example, Harry @CAPS1 argues in his popular book series that we must know our enemy to fight them. This shows the importance of having access to all information.  In conclusion, people should always have access to all types of media, especially in libraries. These resources help shape individuals and enable them to make contributions to the world. Although there is bad media, understanding it can help us combat it. Removing knowledge would only hinder our progress. By allowing people to access information freely, we can hope for continuous advancement and a better world.
1324	4301	2	2	I believe that if people find certain books or movies offensive, they should be able to request their removal from the library. Libraries should respect the preferences of their customers and remove offensive items.  Some parents allow their children to browse books independently in the library, just as my @CAPS1 did when I was a child. Without adult supervision, children may wander into the adult section and encounter inappropriate content. They may also purchase magazines that appear innocent on the outside but contain offensive images inside.  When I was ten years old, my family and I were on vacation in @LOCATION1. One night, during a commercial break of a baseball game, we were channel - surfing. An offensive adult image suddenly appeared on the TV, which none of us, especially me as a child, wanted to see. This incident highlights the need for libraries to be more cautious when stocking books and magazines. While they may make a small profit, they are negatively impacting children's lives. Similar situations can occur in libraries, as young children may not be able to distinguish between children's books and adult magazines. They may also ask for music with offensive content, as the cases may look normal on the outside.  If library visitors find something offensive on the shelves, they should be able to ask for its removal. Although the library may not comply every time, removing offensive items would make libraries safer and more enjoyable for children. Failure to do so could have a negative impact on the library's business. However, the library should only consider requests from regular visitors, as they are more invested in the library's environment.  In conclusion, all offensive items in the library should be removed. Libraries should listen to their customers, not only to protect their business but also to ensure a positive and safe experience for children.
1325	4302	2	2	Nowadays, many libraries contain violent and offensive books. The question is whether libraries should remove these books, movies, and music from the shelves.  Libraries should not be required to remove such items. Instead, they should create separate sections for offensive materials. For example, books with violent content can be placed in a dedicated area.  Regarding rated @CAPS1 movies, they can be available in the library, but patrons must be over @NUM1 years old. To rent a rated @CAPS1 movie, parental permission is required, and the movie should be watched with an adult.  For music with an @CAPS2 sticker, patrons must be over @NUM2 to rent it. If parents do not approve, they should not allow their children to rent it. The music cases with offensive content should be placed behind the counter to prevent young children from seeing them.  Children under a certain age should not be allowed to access offensive books without parental permission. If they wish to rent such a book, they must obtain their parents' consent.  In conclusion, rather than removing offensive books, movies, and music, libraries should organize them into separate sections with appropriate age restrictions and parental consent requirements. This way, patrons can make informed choices, and children can be protected from inappropriate content. If you were in charge of a library, you would need to balance the need for access to diverse materials with the responsibility of protecting young patrons.
1326	4303	2	2	Rewrite of the first item Reading is highly popular, serving as an activity both at home and in the classroom. School libraries are stocked with a wide range of books, magazines, and similar materials. Some of these materials may be considered offensive by certain individuals; however, these books should not be removed from library shelves.  There are books that some people find so offensive that they cannot continue reading them. Whether the offensive content is sexual or political, readers who find it offensive will simply stop reading. There are books that contain detailed sexual descriptions, and many parents do not want their children to read such books. Nevertheless, this is not a valid reason to remove these books from library shelves. While the content may be offensive to some, there are others who can handle such stories and would like to read them. Parents should ensure that their children do not read these books, but libraries should not deny access to those who enjoy them.  There are also political books. Most people have strong political beliefs and are reluctant to change their views during discussions. When a reader encounters a book that contradicts their political stance, it can lead to problems. Politics is a serious topic, and many people, especially politicians, may overreact when their beliefs are challenged. However, many authors write about political matters, and some books can educate readers about perspectives they have not previously considered. If a reader disagrees with the author or finds the content offensive, they should choose not to read the book. There are other readers who are interested in learning more about politics and would like to read these books. Readers who know that certain content will offend them should avoid picking up such books.  Many libraries offer music, movies, and magazines for borrowing. It is true that some movies or song lyrics may be offensive to some people. In such cases, these individuals should refrain from borrowing these items. Many people enjoy music or movies that contain offensive language, as it can add to the overall experience. People should be aware of their own limits and avoid content they find offensive. As long as there are readers and individuals who appreciate these types of books, music, and movies, they should remain on the library shelves. Removing them would reduce the number of library visitors. For example, some people visit the library specifically for the music section, and removing the music would eliminate their reason for coming. The music and movie sections should remain in libraries, and borrowers should be mature and responsible enough to make appropriate choices.  In conclusion, libraries should not remove books, movies, and magazines that some people find offensive. While some materials may be offensive to certain individuals, this does not mean they will be offensive to everyone. Libraries need to provide a diverse range of materials for all types of readers. Reading is a very popular activity, and readers want a wide selection of books, music, and movies to choose from.
1327	4304	2	2	In schools and libraries, many people come across books that do not suit their taste. Everyone has their own opinions, and what one person finds offensive may be of interest to another. The question is whether we should remove books that the majority of people consider offensive or keep them on the shelves. Here is my stance on this issue.  Books are intended for learning and enjoyment, not to offend anyone. Each book has its own purpose and was written for a reason. There are numerous books that many people dislike, but this does not mean that no one else appreciates them. We should keep these books in schools and libraries because they may be beneficial to someone. If these books were removed, how would that person access the information they need if no other resources were available?  One solution is to categorize books by genre. This way, people will know what they are looking for and are less likely to stumble upon offensive books accidentally. Categorization also helps to keep the library organized. When visiting the library, patrons can go directly to the section they need and avoid sections that may contain offensive material.  Libraries and schools aim to keep books on the shelves. This is the primary function of libraries, as they provide access to information that may not be available elsewhere. If libraries removed every book that someone complained about, there would be little left in the library.  In summary, everyone is entitled to their opinion and may find a book offensive. However, books are written for a reason, and if the library or publisher thought the content would cause a significant problem, they would not have made it available. Therefore, we should keep the books on the shelves.
1328	4305	2	2	Visiting the library can be challenging because there is a vast array of genres to choose from. In addition to books, there are also music and magazines. Among the books, there are various subjects and categories, including children's books, biographies, and autobiographies. There is also a wide variety of music to suit different tastes. Some people may find certain books or music offensive or inappropriate. However, I believe that there is no problem with avoiding materials that one finds offensive. Therefore, I do not think that certain books or music should be removed from the library shelves based on a few individual opinions.  Just because one person finds a book offensive does not mean it should be removed from the shelves. Another person may find the book to be a valuable resource and may need it for their work or studies. People should know what they are looking for at the library, and if they think a book may be offensive, they should avoid borrowing it.  This issue is similar to others around the world. For example, when going to the mall, people visit the shops they like and avoid those they dislike or find offensive due to the items they sell. This does not mean that these shops should be banned from the mall, as some people may find them interesting and want to purchase their products. The same principle applies to books and materials in the library.  One way for libraries to address this issue without removing books from the shelves is to conduct a survey among local visitors. By asking for their opinions on different book genres and music styles, the library can then categorize and section the materials accordingly. This can significantly help solve the problem, as people can avoid sections they find offensive and more easily find what they are looking for.  Personally, I do not always read the most popular subjects. I enjoy reading about murder cases, drug busts, biographies, and autobiographies. When it comes to music, I listen to a wide range of genres, including hip-hop, country, alternative, and rock. Some people may find my interests unusual, but this shows that not everyone has the same reading and music preferences. Therefore, libraries should maintain a diverse selection of materials to satisfy all readers.  In conclusion, libraries should not remove books or music based on a few individual opinions. People should have the freedom to choose what they want to read and listen to, and libraries should provide a wide range of options to meet different needs.
1329	4306	2	2	In my opinion, libraries should not remove any of the books currently in their collections. If parents or individuals do not want to read certain types of books, they can simply choose not to. However, these books should not be removed from the shelves. I acknowledge that some books contain inappropriate language, but this is part of the story and how it was written. Once a book is published, it should not be altered.  If a reader finds a particular scene in a book offensive, they should put the book back and select another one that they consider appropriate. Some people enjoy reading detailed stories to visualize the events in their minds, and I am one of them. Libraries have books with inappropriate language and scenes, but they are usually restricted to readers of a certain age, typically thirteen or older. This is a good policy, as by this age, readers have a better understanding of the world, and parents do not need to be overly concerned. Therefore, I do not think these books should be removed from libraries.  On the other hand, movies that contain disturbing scenarios should be removed. Movies are different from books because they show the content being described, and I do not think teenagers should watch such material. It can be very inappropriate and disturbing, and I would not want to watch it in front of my parents or younger siblings. Of course, this is just my opinion. If parents are comfortable with their children watching such movies, then it may not be a problem.  Music is not as bad. Many parents do not want their children to listen to certain types of music due to their religious beliefs or personal values. I completely understand this. My parents initially did not allow me to listen to music that contained excessive references to sex and cursing. As I got older, they became less concerned because I listened to such music less frequently. As a teenager, I also believe that some of today's music is not appropriate for anyone at any age, as some of the lyrics do not make much sense. In libraries, I think they should only stock music that is related to the books in some way.  Magazines are generally not a problem. Most magazines focus on beauty and fashion tips, horoscopes, and celebrity news. They are mainly aimed at older teenagers and adults. There are also more appropriate magazines for younger teenagers and children that feature younger celebrities.  In conclusion, this is my perspective on the matter. I know that not everyone will agree with me, but this is what I believe. I also expect that there are many people who share my views and will provide similar reasons to support their stance.
1330	4307	2	2	"The question of whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from library shelves if they are offensive to some people is a complex one. In my view, we should not remove these materials. If we were to remove every book that someone found offensive, there would be very few books left on the shelves.  I know from personal experience that different people react differently to offensive materials. For example, in school, some students do not want to say the pledge because of the phrase ""one nation, under [a certain concept]."" Everyone has different opinions and will respond differently in such situations. However, this does not mean that we should remove something just because one person finds it offensive, as others may find it appropriate.  Observing how people react in offensive situations can help us find a solution to this problem. Removing the materials that some people find offensive is not the answer, as many people will continue to disagree. Instead, library censorship should be based on separation. Materials should be categorized and placed in different sections according to their content. This way, people can easily find what they need without being offended.  Our constitution guarantees the freedom of all [people], especially the freedom of speech. All materials are written by someone expressing their opinions, and by removing their books from the shelves, we are taking away their right to free speech. It is a form of self - expression. If someone finds a book offensive, they should simply choose not to read it. Removing the material may frustrate and offend the author and other readers.  In conclusion, we should not remove certain materials just because someone finds them offensive. Library censorship should be based on separation rather than the sensitivity of individuals. People should have the right to choose what they want to read or watch. So, what is your stance on this issue? Should certain materials be removed?"
1331	4308	2	2	In my view, the library should not censor materials. In the United States, a country that upholds freedom of speech, there should be no place for censorship. For instance, a band was banned in @LOCATION1 for their music, which is a contradiction in a land that prides itself on freedom. We can't truly understand what's good without being exposed to the bad. I recognize that some parents may not want their children to access certain movies or magazines. Instead of censorship, we could implement an age - restriction system in libraries. That way, the materials remain available for those who are of appropriate age. Censorship goes against the spirit of a free - speech country. If we censor everything, we can't rightfully call ourselves the land of the free. Therefore, I firmly believe that there should be no censorship in @LOCATION1.
1332	4309	2	2	I firmly hold the opinion that certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines shouldn't be removed from the shelves just because someone finds them offensive. One person's distaste for these items doesn't mean others who like them should be deprived. People have diverse preferences. If you find something offensive, simply don't engage with it. Stick to the music, movies, and reading materials you enjoy. Don't try to take away what others like just because it doesn't suit your taste. People vary greatly, and we should allow individuals to express themselves through their likes and dislikes. Censorship has long been a contentious issue. I believe that if people focus on their own interests and leave others alone, things would be fine. I understand that some may find certain shelf - items offensive, but they should just ignore them and stay with what they know and like. After all, the world is diverse, and we're not all the same.
1333	4310	2	2	Do you think that removing a book from the shelf will shield you or your kids from offensive material? If so, you're mistaken. You can't isolate your family from the world out of fear that they might encounter something bad. Every day, whether they read a book or not, people are exposed to vulgar behavior. We all can think of a book we'd rather children didn't pick up. But if I have the right to remove a book I detest, then everyone else has that same right, and soon there'll be no books left. As Katherine Paterson said, “If someone were to take a book off of a shelf at their home, a public library, or maybe even a store that they found offensive at any point in the book, then there would be no books left for children and even adults to read.” Every book has some content that some people may not like. Kids hear offensive things daily, even at school under supervision. You can't protect them from every minor encounter. Some books are more offensive than others. Would you give a child a vulgar - language book or one about @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 running out of honey in his jar? Most children are supervised at libraries or stores if their parents are cautious about books. So, parents will likely prevent them from getting obscene materials. If a book is on the shelf, it's for those who enjoy it. Since you can't make the world kid - safe, there's no point in trying to make the library so. There are people who find the very materials you find offensive fascinating, and libraries should meet everyone's needs, not just children's.
1334	4311	2	2	I don't believe that certain materials should be removed from library shelves. Patrons have the freedom to select what they want, and librarians do not coerce them into choosing any particular item. In a free country, individuals should have the right to make their own choices. If someone doesn't like a particular item, they can read the back of the movie or book before making a selection. Removing materials based on the preferences of a few would limit the freedom of choice for others. In conclusion, the current system of allowing people to choose for themselves is the most appropriate way to manage library resources.
1335	4312	2	2	Have you ever wandered through the library in search of a good book, magazine, or CD that is free of inappropriate content? It's like being a child in a mall, impatiently looking for a specific toy that never seems to appear. You spend time pacing between shelves, and when you finally find something and open it, you might encounter inappropriate pictures, vulgar language, or offensive text. I love reading and visit the library after finishing each book. However, my interest in reading has declined recently, not because I'm involved in other things, but because most of the books I pick up are offensive. For example, when I asked a librarian for a new book recommendation, they directed me to a best - seller. But after reading the first paragraph, I was repulsed by its gory content and the way it downgraded women. This isn't an isolated incident; my friends and I have had similar experiences. Magazines, which I used to enjoy as a light read, have also changed. Now, I often see half - dressed girls, inappropriate advertisements, or excessive displays of affection. These images make me not only turn the page but also reluctant to open magazines again. Music, which is like a drug to me, has also become a disappointment. When I check out new CDs from the library, most of them are full of curse words. I'm furious and disappointed that such music is sold. I listen to music to relax, not to learn inappropriate vocabulary. I know there are good books, magazines, and music out there. I hope the library can get rid of offensive, vulgar, and unnecessary items. I believe many others would also appreciate it. We want reading materials that are worth our time, magazines that are pleasant to look at, and music that won't pollute our minds.
1336	4313	2	2	I firmly believe that there should be a debate about removing certain forms of media such as movies, music, and books. Nowadays, people are engaging in behaviors they never would have before. Take music, for example. It has a powerful influence, motivating people and making them deeply engaged in the songs. Individuals often imitate the actions of their favorite artists or actors. I've heard songs that discuss illegal activities, and I've noticed children talking about these things and asking their parents about them. Parents may not want to tell the truth, but as these kids grow older, they'll learn the reality and decide whether to follow that path. The singers present these ideas in a way that seems harmless, but in fact, kids are unaware of the consequences.  Similarly, many books contain offensive language that kids read without people even noticing. This can get kids in trouble at school. Out of curiosity, they learn new words from books they may not fully understand due to their age. This early exposure to inappropriate content can lead to negative development as they grow up.  I think our country should establish age - appropriate sections for reading materials. School libraries, catering to different age groups like elementary, middle, and high school students, often have movies with offensive language and inappropriate scenes. Elementary students should only watch PG movies, middle - schoolers should be limited to PG - 13 and below, and high - school students, while they should have more freedom, need to be mature enough to handle it. The reason they may not have unrestricted access to all movies is that some may not be able to control themselves.  In conclusion, I strongly advocate for the regulation of movies, music, and books. Kids are learning things that are better left for later in life. These forms of media have a significant impact on the world, with many of the effects being negative. These are my well - considered opinions.
1337	4314	2	2	There are numerous issues related to offensive materials used for entertainment. Items such as movies, books, and magazines can be highly offensive to people of different races or religions, and sometimes they should not be readily available.  Censorship can be a solution to this problem. In the book Fahrenheit 451, for instance, censorship was used to completely eliminate books, aiming to prevent society from being offended or from thinking critically. However, currently, the situation is the opposite. There is an abundance of negative material, and people seem unconcerned about its impact on others or the potential harm it can cause.  This situation can also be debated. People who are offended by the material, whether due to religious or racial reasons, don't necessarily have to be exposed to it. For example, if offensive material is in a library, those who are offended can simply avoid going to the library.  In conclusion, individuals who are offended by offensive materials can choose to stay away from them. At the same time, people should also show more kindness and consideration when dealing with such issues.
1338	4315	2	2	"In my personal view, I have no issues with the content found in libraries today. It's inevitable that there will be things one disagrees with, but if it's not causing any harm, it's best to simply ignore it. Kids usually stay in the children's section of the library and don't wander into the adult section, so there's no need to worry about them being exposed to inappropriate content.  Today's kids are maturing at a younger age. I believe libraries are valuable places where one can access a wealth of information. Removing so - called ""controversial"" information would be a disservice. Libraries are inclusive spaces for everyone, regardless of age or appearance, and are often used for educational purposes.  For example, some may think a certain historical figure like Hitler is someone whose information shouldn't be accessible to kids. But as a person with a particular cultural background, I want to learn about all aspects of my culture, even the unpleasant parts. Just because a group of people don't like a book doesn't mean everyone feels the same way. Everyone has the right to learn about themselves and their origins.  Overall, libraries should remain as they are. They are places where people can freely explore knowledge, and no one should take away that opportunity."
1339	4316	2	2	I don't think people should remove books from library shelves. Town libraries offer a wide variety of books, and everyone should be able to enjoy reading different types of literature. Different age groups have different preferences: little kids like fantasy and picture books, teenagers are into romance, and others prefer non - fiction. What others think shouldn't matter.  If books are removed from the shelves without considering others' preferences, it will lead to a loss of customers. Before taking such a step, one should survey and record what other people like instead of acting based on personal opinions.  To prevent children from reading inappropriate books, libraries can issue permission cards with parental consent. If that doesn't work, an age limit can be set. Parents can be asked to show their children's birth certificates. A restricted section can be established in the library, and parents should sign a note allowing their children to borrow books from this section.  Children aged thirteen and under should not be given magazines, while those aged fourteen and above can have access. Music shouldn't be a concern for parents, and if parents buy movies, there shouldn't be an issue either. Other details can be sorted out on an individual basis.  This is my view on how library books should be managed. I've explained how a library should operate and what I think is appropriate. My advice is to think carefully before taking any action regarding library books.
1340	4317	2	2	I believe that all materials should be allowed in libraries because every individual has the right to choose what they read, listen to, and watch. Even if some books are banned from libraries, people will find other ways to obtain them. As citizens of America, we have the right to live freely, which includes the right to read freely.  However, when it comes to music and movies, we've gone a bit too far. We've made pornography easily accessible, and there is a lot of music that promotes sex, drugs, violence, and alcohol. The only thing that keeps us somewhat in check is the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and its ratings for movies, music, and television.  Magazines present a more complex situation. They have their own set of standards. We're familiar with well - known magazines like Playboy, but there are many others that are kept private and rarely seen.  In conclusion, while libraries should uphold the principle of free access to materials, we need to be more vigilant about the content of music, movies, and magazines. We should find a balance between freedom and responsibility to ensure a healthy cultural environment.
1341	4318	2	2	The creative output in the forms of books, magazines, movies, and music showcases a vast diversity. Literature encompasses numerous categories such as fiction, @ORGANIZATION1, horror, fashion, science - fiction, and more. There is undoubtedly something for everyone to enjoy. One should consider the situation where they are deprived of the choice to read, listen to, or watch their preferred materials due to the negative opinion of others.  Everyone holds their own opinions, which can either be in favor of or against something. In my view, every book, movie, magazine, and other literary works deserve a place on the shelf. Although some content may be offensive to certain individuals, it does not mean they have to engage with it. What one person finds offensive, another may enjoy, as it is purely a matter of personal opinion. The opinion of a single individual should not determine whether a material can be placed on the shelf.  If one were to enter a library and see shelves filled only with books that everyone has a positive opinion of, the shelves would appear rather sparse. It is difficult to get two people to agree on the same thing, let alone getting everyone to concur on the literature in a public library. While censorship has its merits to a certain extent, I believe libraries should categorize and section their literature. In these categories and sections, people can search for the materials they desire and avoid the offensive ones.  Libraries stock rated @CAPS1 movies. Many may find these movies offensive, but there are also those who enjoy watching them. It is a tough decision to determine whose preference should prevail. I firmly believe that libraries should carry these movies, and those who find them offensive simply need not watch them. The same principle applies to books, magazines, and music. If something is offensive, one can choose not to read or listen to it.  There exists a wide variety of writing styles, movie plots, song lyrics, and magazine covers. This diversity stems from the fact that everyone has different opinions about lyrics, covers, styles, and plots. Censorship should not be implemented just because some people find certain things offensive, as others may appreciate them. One should ponder what they would do if their favorite book were not allowed in the public library. In conclusion, the rich diversity of creative works should be preserved, and individual preferences should not be used as a basis for censorship in libraries.
1342	4319	2	2	I firmly believe that books, movies, music, magazines, and other such materials should not be removed simply because some people do not like them. There may be others who actually enjoy and want to read or engage with these materials. There is no valid reason for one person or a group of people to try to remove something from a library shelf just because they find it offensive.  People have a wide range of interests. Sometimes, the things we read or consume may affect others, but often, we are only concerned with our own preferences and what we find offensive. Consider a situation where what you are watching, reading, or listening to is offending someone else. Would you care? Would it bother you if someone told you it was offensive to them? Everyone has different likes and dislikes, and it is normal that others may not always agree with our interests.  In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of preferences and not let the negative opinions of a few lead to the removal of materials that others may enjoy. Everyone has the right to their own choices in reading, watching, and listening, and we should not impose our views on others.
1343	4320	2	2	The question at hand is whether certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. I will delve into this topic, covering the introduction, main body, and conclusion.  I firmly believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and any other offensive items on bookshelves or other shelves should be removed. The rationale behind this is that no one should be subjected to offense. Everyone should be able to live without being offended by anything or anyone.  In conclusion, after careful consideration, I maintain that offensive items on shelves should be removed. This approach ensures a more comfortable and non - offensive environment for all. By removing such materials, we can strive towards a space where people are not exposed to content that may cause them distress or offense.
1344	4321	2	2	It is well - known that libraries allow people to rent books, movies, music, and magazines. However, it is also a fact that some of the materials in libraries may be offensive or inappropriate. While some individuals advocate for the removal of such items from the shelves, I firmly believe that books, magazines, movies, and music should remain on the shelves. People should have the freedom to read, listen to, or watch whatever they desire. If someone does not want offensive material in their home, they simply do not have to rent it. Just because something seems offensive does not mean it cannot be enjoyable.  The primary reason I oppose the removal of seemingly offensive items from library shelves is that people should have the right to consume whatever content they prefer. Everyone is entitled to their own preferences. Some people like @CAPS1 rated movies or music with explicit content. If that is what they are interested in, so be it. No one should be forced to stop renting something they want just because others do not approve.  Moreover, if someone does not want offensive material in their home, they can simply refrain from renting it. No one is forcing anyone to listen to or watch something they do not like. It is a straightforward choice. People do not have the right to tell others what they can or cannot watch or listen to. If someone does not prefer a particular item, they can just avoid it.  Finally, the fact that something appears offensive does not mean it lacks enjoyment. For instance, many @CAPS1 rated movies have won @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and other awards, indicating that they have a good story or moral. Another example is the singer @ORGANIZATION1. Although their music may be offensive to some, many people enjoy it. Clearly, what offends one person can be appealing to another.  In conclusion, no one has the right to prevent others from renting what they want from a library. People should respect each other's choices and focus on their own preferences. Just because some people find certain books, movies, music, or magazines offensive does not mean they should be removed from the library shelves. After all, it is a matter of personal taste, and the diversity of content in libraries should be maintained.
1345	4322	2	2	"Should books or other materials be removed from the library shelves? The answer is no. These books or materials are not suitable for everyone. For example, libraries should have a kids' area. The reason kids should stay in this area is to prevent them from picking up inappropriate books. They should be reading children's books. If a child picks up a @CAPS1 book, an adult should explain to them that it is not meant for them. Some books are clearly not suitable for kids, which is why they have their own area in the library. Kids should not leave their area to access @CAPS1 books.  In addition, I think kids should listen to appropriate music in the library. The @CAPS1 books and materials are not for kids, so they should stay away from that area to avoid picking up inappropriate books. In my opinion, there are no truly ""bad"" books. If you don't like a book, someone else might. The same goes for movies, music, and magazines. They should not be removed from the library shelves because if they were truly inappropriate, they would not have been in the library in the first place.  Everyone has different tastes, and it is impossible for everyone to like everything. That's just how life is. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a proper layout with separate areas for different audiences, and materials should not be removed simply because some people do not like them. After all, a diverse collection of materials can cater to the various interests of different people."
1346	4323	2	2	The question of whether there should be censorship in libraries is a matter on which many people hold personal views. It is reasonable to expect that individuals should be aware of their own boundaries regarding what is appropriate to view. Libraries should not be compelled to remove materials they have purchased. The idea of censoring these materials seems unjust. Libraries could set aside a section for censored materials, out of sight from the main area. This section would be accessible to those who wish to check out relevant items. The library is a place where people can escape the troubles of their daily lives and simply read. Not everyone visits the library for books; some come to listen to music or read magazines. Removing materials would likely discourage customers from returning. The internet and other sources can be far more offensive than library materials. If libraries are required to censor, then all other entertainment industries should follow suit. Ultimately, each library should have the autonomy to decide what is best for its facility. In my opinion, the solution is to relocate the materials to a separate area within the building, allowing individuals to choose whether to access them. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion on this matter, and I have shared mine.
1347	4324	2	2	In my view, all books and movies should be accompanied by warning signs. This ensures that people know what to expect before reading or watching. Some movies and books should also have age restrictions. What one person finds offensive may not bother another. Removing all potentially offensive content from movies and books could lead to a decline in viewership and readership. Similarly, some music may contain offensive elements. If you dislike the lyrics of a song, simply choose not to listen to that artist. There is a wide variety of music available, so you can always find something you enjoy. It would be challenging to censor movies and music, as it might remove much of what audiences want to experience. Many people, including myself, enjoy reading magazines for the truth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies. If parents are concerned about their children reading certain types of books, they can purchase suitable alternatives. In conclusion, while some form of warning and age - appropriate guidance is necessary, over - censorship should be avoided.
1348	4325	2	2	My name is @CAPS1, and I believe that offensive materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves. Although I have never encountered offensive materials myself, others may have been deeply offended. I am not one to start an argument, but I will express my honest beliefs. Some people worry that removing certain books will leave few options on the library shelves. However, there are other places to buy books, such as @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2. I don't read extensively, and among the books I've read, I've never found any that I thought should be removed. Books containing content like instructions on self - harm or pregnancy details can be taken off the shelves. Children should be in the kids' section of the library, not the adult section. I've never heard of a kids' book that is so bad it needs to be removed; most authors are more responsible. Regarding music, if you don't want your kids to listen to adult music, simply don't expose them to it. I grew up listening to rap music, but when I have children, I'll be selective about what they listen to. Movies are a major concern for me. In libraries, @ORGANIZATION1, and bookstores, movies are often displayed without proper consideration for their suitability. Movies with inappropriate covers or content, like the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' movies, should be removed from public display. Magazines in libraries are generally fine, but some bookstores may have inappropriate ones, which are usually placed out of children's reach. In conclusion, based on my experiences and opinions, there should be appropriate censorship for materials in libraries, especially for movies, and parents should take responsibility for guiding their children's media consumption.
1349	4326	2	2	I firmly believe that there should be no censorship in libraries. There are three main reasons for this stance: parental supervision, librarian supervision, and personal common sense. Parents play a crucial role in monitoring their children's reading. If they want their children to read educational books, they should keep an eye on their choices. When they notice their child in an inappropriate area of the library, they should move the child to a more suitable section. Librarians also have an important responsibility. Although they may not know a child's exact age, if they see a child in an inappropriate area, they can guide the child to a different bookshelf. Librarians, being book - lovers, may even find an interesting adventure book for the child. Personal common sense is another key factor. Most people are aware of their age and the appropriate books for them. If they find themselves in an unsuitable area of the library, they should move to another section. In summary, censorship in libraries is unnecessary. Parents should observe their children's reading, trust librarians to guide them, and expect their children to use common sense. This way, libraries can remain a free - access space for all.
1350	4327	2	2	I think it's acceptable to restrict access to @CAPS4. If they are truly inappropriate, individuals should be at least @NUM1 years old to borrow them from libraries or stores. Similar to movies rated @CAPS1, @CAPS4 should have some form of warning. I've read some great books that are not suitable for kids. For example, I read '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', which is a sad story about a @CAPS2 and his childhood experiences. I liked the book, but it's not appropriate for all ages. I read it because people were talking about it. Some parents restrict their children's TV viewing because they consider certain shows bad. My grandma didn't want me to watch a particular show, but as a @NUM1 - year - old, I believe I should have the right to choose what I watch. She may dislike the show because of the yelling, and she thinks it makes me yell too. Some movies are more enjoyable when they contain edgy content, as it can make them funny. I prefer funny movies over kid - friendly ones, although I've watched kid movies in the past. In conclusion, while age - appropriate access to @CAPS4 is important, personal preferences also play a role in media consumption.
1351	4328	2	2	The books and other materials should not be moved because anyone could be interested in them. A person might come to the library looking for a specific item, only to find it missing due to the library's removal. There is no valid reason to remove the books unless a significant number of new materials are incoming. People have diverse interests in different types of materials. Removing items could lead to people complaining or taking their business elsewhere, causing the library to lose customers. If the library loses business, it may be forced to close. This would leave regular patrons, especially those without transportation, without a place to study or work. The library owner would also lose money as many people rely on the library for research and book rentals. Additionally, some people visit the library for peace and quiet. If children can't find the books they want, they might cry and disturb others, leading those disturbed to leave and not return, resulting in lost revenue. Students may not find the books they need at school and turn to the library; if the library doesn't have them, the students are left without resources. In conclusion, there are multiple reasons why the books and other items should not be removed from the library as someone may be genuinely interested in them and unable to find them if removed.
1352	4329	2	2	You are a parent taking your young child to the library. While there, you notice a bright and flashy advertising sign for a new book. Upon reading it, you discover that it's promoting a book and some movies that you consider highly inappropriate and offensive for a public library where children of all ages come to do their homework. In my opinion, if you encounter something offensive, you should speak up. Approach the librarian and explain your concerns. Having offensive materials in a public library is simply wrong. Imagine a library with no restrictions on what can be checked out. Many children could borrow inappropriate items without understanding their content. It would be a disaster if your child brought home a book, magazine, or movie that was far beyond their appropriate viewing or reading level. I don't have children, but I have younger cousins, and I know their parents would have a serious conversation with the librarian if they brought home something offensive. Libraries should implement strict restrictions on what can be checked out by whom. For example, my library offers three types of library cards. One is for regular book check - outs, another allows for the check - out of movies, music, and books, and the third is for accessing the adult section at the back of the library, which requires the cardholder to be 18 or older. I firmly believe that if a library has offensive materials, they should be kept in a separate area, like a small room at the back or behind the librarian's desk. Those who want to access these materials should provide proof of being 18 or older, making it easier for the librarian to monitor who checks them out. Also, if someone finds an item offensive while others don't, at least two or three people should voice their concerns before the item is removed from the general shelves. If multiple people complain, the item should be placed with the other age - restricted offensive materials. My neighborhood library follows these practices, and I believe it serves as a model for all libraries looking to implement more restrictions. If all libraries had stricter rules, it would benefit everyone. Parents wouldn't have to worry about their children finding inappropriate content, and older teenagers and young adults could study without distractions. In conclusion, I hope you take these points to heart and write an article about library restrictions and how they would improve the situation. Thank you for reading.
1353	4330	2	2	I believe that some materials in the library should be removed. Some music contains bad language, and we don't want young children exposed to it. If a child were to learn and repeat such language in public, it could spread quickly. Most books are fine to read as they don't have offensive content, but some with inappropriate language shouldn't be in the library. However, they can remain as some people may want to read them. Those who don't find them suitable should simply avoid borrowing them. Some movies also have inappropriate content. These should be removed because many people don't want to watch such movies, and if a child were to borrow one and the parent found out, the library could face legal issues. The library can keep children's movies as they are safe. If I worked at a library, I would remove most magazines. Sports magazines are okay to keep, but many others have offensive content, and I wouldn't allow people to borrow them, so I'd remove them from the library. Different people have different preferences. Some like reading books with drama, while others don't. Some may want to read or watch offensive materials, while others don't. Libraries vary in what they offer. If you like offensive materials, go to a library that has them; if not, choose a library without such content. In conclusion, considering these factors, libraries should make appropriate decisions about which materials to keep and which to remove based on the potential impact on different patrons.
1354	4331	2	2	I've noticed some truly offensive books on library shelves. It's concerning to think about what might happen if a young child were to look at these books, as this is the stage when their minds absorb the most knowledge. What if this knowledge is offensive to a particular race or religion? Children are the future of our species, and such content in libraries should be censored. Imagine if a child were to look at books written by Hitler and other Nazi members during the Nazi regime. Or perhaps they come across a book by a famous killer like Ted Bundy. They might even see a photo - book about the massive Jewish death camps in Europe. There are also movies that show war - torn battles, such as those in Vietnam, Iraq, World War II, or World War I. The famous movie 'Schindler's List' depicts the cruelty of the Nazis and the Holocaust. In my view, there should be censorship to protect children from offensive content in books, music, movies, and magazines. All materials that children can access should be censored. Just think about a world where there were no controls on what could be presented in the media. In conclusion, censorship is necessary to safeguard children from inappropriate and offensive materials in libraries and other accessible media.
1355	4332	2	2	The library is a public space where everyone has access. It provides people with the information they seek. There are various forms of information and entertainment in libraries, including books, music, and movies. Censorship in libraries should not be permitted. Genres exist for a reason. Music, for example, is categorized into different types such as classical, rock, and blues. Since music is classified in this way, there's no need to remove certain types from library shelves. If someone finds a particular genre offensive, they can simply avoid that section of the library. In the United States, people are granted many rights that are often overlooked. The freedom of speech is a crucial one. Losing this privilege would have a detrimental impact on the nation. The freedom to speak also encompasses singing, so certain music on library shelves has the right to be there. Just because some individuals find a type of music offensive doesn't mean everyone shares that view. Therefore, any genre of music can be available in libraries. Another important right is the freedom of the press. Anything written on paper is legal, whether it's criticizing the government or having school - related fantasies. Books can be offensive to many, but like music, they have different categories. Whatever is in those books is allowed, regardless of its content. Movies are also available in libraries and are categorized like books and music. The saying 'Don't judge a book by its cover' can apply to movies too. The title of a movie or book can give an idea of its content. Some movies not suitable for children are rated R or PG - 13. These ratings provide a certain level of censorship. It's not illegal for a library to have an R - rated movie, but it's illegal to check it out to a young child. In conclusion, censorship should not be allowed in libraries. All types of entertainment genres can be found in libraries, with ratings and genres to guide patrons. If someone is offended, they should avoid the relevant section. As long as no laws are broken, there should be no issue with having different types of materials in libraries.
1356	4333	2	2	Do I believe certain materials should be removed from library shelves if they're found offensive? I think it doesn't matter whether the library has music, movies, or magazines. Some people come to the library to relax, read magazines, or listen to music. What others do there shouldn't bother anyone as long as it doesn't cause a disturbance. I've seen people reading books while listening to music, and it doesn't bother me. It's a way for them to immerse themselves in a good book. There's only one reason to keep certain materials out of the library: when some people are too loud while looking at magazines or playing music. Otherwise, I don't think these materials should be excluded. As a reader, I like to read in peace and often listen to music while reading. I also enjoy reading magazines occasionally; it's very relaxing. These are my reasons for believing it doesn't matter if these types of materials are in the library.
1357	4334	2	2	Do I think books, movies, music, or magazines should be removed from the library? No, I don't. Removing them would likely lead to a loss of customers. To be honest, most people like to read. I sometimes read for study purposes, and if the books I need were removed, I'd be at a loss. Even teachers visit the library to study, borrow books for themselves, or for their grandchildren or children. Parents do the same. Music helps people at various times. I know people who listen to music to concentrate on homework, regular work, or to relieve stress. There are numerous ways music benefits people. If someone takes offense at this, there's something wrong with them, as there have been no complaints over the years. I've never borrowed movies or magazines from the library, but people do it for their kids or grandkids. It's not a big deal since most of the movies are for kids and not inappropriate. Why would anyone want to deprive kids of such things? It makes me angry because I like kids, and they don't harm anyone. In conclusion, these materials should stay in the library.
1358	4335	2	2	Libraries are a treasure - trove of resources, housing books, movies, music, magazines, and more. They're the perfect place to go for research or projects. If you come across something you don't like, simply move on. I firmly believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves just because they might be offensive to some. If something offends you, it's best to ignore it, as that very thing could be useful to others. So, if you ever see something unappealing in the library, walk away. It could benefit both you and others. If we let our personal sensitivities dictate what stays in the library, how will others learn? We should think beyond ourselves and consider the needs of the wider community.
1359	4336	2	2	I don't believe we should censor or remove any material from library shelves just because it might seem offensive or inappropriate. However, I wouldn't recommend certain content for children who aren't ready for it until they reach an appropriate age. The reason is that people will inevitably encounter such content and experiences in their lives. Many have gone through difficult events, and these are part of the real world. We should be aware of what happens around us so that we know how to handle situations. For example, if a person of a certain race is minding their own business and is verbally offended by a group of racists, they shouldn't be overly worried. Words from such weak - minded people are just an attempt to get on their nerves and usually won't lead to physical harm. There are many things that people dislike and try to hide, but this only makes matters worse. If people are exposed to what's being hidden, they'll be left clueless. We shouldn't keep the truth from others. Everyone who is ready should have access to information, no matter how cruel or painful it is, so they can learn to take care of themselves when they face such situations.
1360	4337	2	2	Censoring our cultural heritage is a grave mistake. Language is the cornerstone of human legacy, and every word spoken or written is a part of our collective creation. We have a duty to preserve the cultural expressions we've developed. If something is forgotten, it's as if it never happened, and history, whether good or bad, is likely to repeat itself. Hiding words from our children is unjust. Even if not through books, they'll discover the same things through word - of - mouth. More importantly, hiding the truth serves no purpose. When people say, 'Let us not forget,' we should also ensure that the youth learn. There's no information in print that can't be conveyed through other means of communication. Our cultural heritage is inscribed in literature. The books we read belong to all of humanity and should be accessible to everyone to learn from our mistakes and triumphs. A well - known example in the censorship debate is 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.' This novel depicts the harsh racial realities of a particular time. Some may object to the frequent use of the offensive 'n' word. However, it also shows a remarkable friendship between a black man and a white man, which was revolutionary for that era. Is it more important for a child to learn about an offensive word they'll eventually encounter, or to understand that skin color doesn't define a person? We shouldn't deny children the chance to learn what truly matters. Removing one book sets a dangerous precedent. Censoring one piece of literature opens the floodgates for debate on every other work. History has shown the consequences of censorship. During Hitler's dictatorship, almost all forms of media were censored, leading to the brainwashing of the people and the suppression of truth. We mustn't let such a situation happen again. Censoring media and literature deprives us of education and freedoms crucial for future generations. We should let our words flow freely and allow our cultural legacy to thrive.
1361	4338	2	2	Author Katherine Paterson once remarked, 'We all envision a book we'd prefer no child to pick up. However, if I possess the right to remove a book I detest from the shelf, then everyone else has that same right. Eventually, there would be no books left for anyone.' I firmly believe that certain materials, such as music, books, and movies, should be placed on adult shelves rather than children's ones. I am of the opinion that every author has the right to self - expression and should be accepted for it. We all hold our own beliefs and standards, and we expect others to respect them, even when we disagree. If every offensive book were removed from the shelves, soon there would be none left. This is because everyone finds something offensive. Many children are interested in various things, and we should not restrict them unless the content is inappropriate or goes against family morals and values, like religious beliefs. It is advisable to monitor what your children read, watch, and listen to. On the other hand, adult shelves will contain a wide range of materials that may offend different people, unlike children's books. Writing is a means of expressing one's thoughts and values, even if it may not appeal to everyone. If we write a book and someone dislikes it, it would be disrespectful if they removed it from the shelf. We should stand firm in our beliefs and also learn to respect others. Children should be surrounded by safe, family - friendly books, music, and magazines.
1362	4339	2	2	I'm against censorship for valid reasons. While many people support censorship, I have a different view. If you're not old enough to access a movie or a book, there's a valid reason for it. Conversely, if you are of the appropriate age, it shouldn't be an issue. People should have the freedom to make their own choices. If they want to buy a rated @CAPS1 movie and watch it with their kids, that's their decision. It's definitely not the responsibility of movie - makers to censor swear words and such. That's why edited CDs are available for purchase. People hold different beliefs, and things should be allowed to proceed according to their individual convictions. If someone with different beliefs doesn't like it, they should express their views, just as I'm doing now. Moreover, if people keep demanding everything to be censored, eventually, there will be nothing left to read, watch, or listen to. So, to all those who advocate for all - encompassing censorship, I hope you're satisfied when the world becomes a dull place because of your demands.
1363	4340	2	2	Censorship is crucial for the future of American children. Personally, I've read some disturbing books, watched grotesque and twisted rated @CAPS1 movies, and heard a lot of messed - up music in my life. A significant portion of today's music revolves around sex, drugs, money, violent crimes, and gangs. Movies have a rating system that helps protect young children. However, books are freely available in public libraries, and some contain content about murder, rape, gang violence, and the horrifying realities of the world. Although I don't have a child, if I did, and my child read a bad book, listened to a song with inappropriate lyrics, or watched a rated @CAPS1 movie, I would file a complaint. I don't want my child to grow up with a warped mind and a foul - mouthed vocabulary. I also wouldn't want my child to kiss me with such offensive language on their lips. The @ORGANIZATION1 should keep such inappropriate materials away from children until they are old enough to access them independently. For instance, a child should be @NUM1 years old to watch a rated @CAPS1 movie. This is how it should have always been.
1364	4341	2	2	I firmly believe that materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves just because they are considered offensive. Some @CAPS1 enjoy the offensive content available in the library. Some @CAPS1 are curious about certain offensive topics. Different @CAPS1 find different things offensive. What may be offensive to you might not be offensive to me. @CAPS1 who don't like offensive materials should simply avoid checking them out, while those who do can choose to borrow them. We can't remove offensive materials just because some @CAPS1 don't like them. Everyone has the right to their own preferences, and some @CAPS1 actually like offensive things. I once read a book that offended me, but it taught me how to react to difficult situations and overcome them. Sometimes, offensive things can offer valuable lessons. That's why I think offensive books should not be removed from the shelves.
1365	4342	2	2	When entering a library or a bookstore, you're bound to come across @CAPS3 that you like and dislike. Your opinion may differ from others'. Sometimes, you may feel uncomfortable with the situation and the way things are presented. People have diverse views on different @CAPS3 in this context of @CAPS4. You'll encounter good @CAPS3, bad ones, happy @CAPS3, sad @CAPS3, @CAPS3 you agree with, and @CAPS3 you disagree with. I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials should not be removed just because they offend someone. The reason is that what offends one person may not offend another. Different people have different interests in various @CAPS3. So, there's no valid reason to remove these materials from the shelves, especially if they don't cause physical harm. From personal experience, I've often been offended by certain @CAPS3. For example, I think abortions can be harmful to an unborn @CAPS4. Killing a child who hasn't experienced life is wrong. However, my views may differ from others'. Who am I to tell someone else what they can or can't do? It's all about expressing one's opinion. You can't change the way others think or feel. If you find a book or other material difficult to deal with, it's not practical to demand its removal. Consider the @CAPS2 situations you may encounter that are offensive to you. There will be many times when you disagree or have an opinion but can't change the situation. Life will be easier and less stressful if we learn to deal with difficult @CAPS3 in @CAPS4.
1366	4343	2	2	CDs, books, and other items should not be removed from store shelves. They should remain on the shelves. Only old video games, books, and music should be removed, and nothing else. In conclusion, keeping these items on the shelves allows for a wider selection for customers.
1367	4344	2	2	In numerous libraries across the nation, many books, magazines, movies, and music are not provided because they are deemed offensive. I firmly believe this should not occur. Everyone is unique and may find different types of works offensive. Who has the authority to decide which items are removed from libraries, and why should they be the sole arbiters of what stays and what goes? People have diverse interests and opinions. Some are athletic, gothic, preppy, or nerdy. The library is open to all. Suppose those choosing library content dislike scary books and remove them all. What will a person who only reads scary books do? If that person could decide, the library would only have horror. No one should have the right to censor library content. Since everyone has their own opinions and interests, libraries should offer everything. The name of these libraries implies they are open to all. There should be a wide variety of genres to read and movies to choose from. Just because one person dislikes a genre or deems it inappropriate for a certain audience does not mean it should be removed. That's why libraries have sections. For example, @PERSON1, a popular author, writes horror with gore and sexual content. If library - selectors find it offensive, they should place it in the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' or '@CAPS3' sections. It's up to parents to decide what their children read, not the library. In conclusion, due to the individuality of people's opinions and interests, no one should have the power to censor library content.
1368	4345	2	2	Should books, magazines, etc., be censored and removed from library shelves just because someone might find them offensive? Some readers may say yes, but what's the reason? My answer is no. A library is a public place for all ages, and each area should be labeled with the genre. I read almost everything, and many others do too. I understand that if something is offensive to you, you may want it censored, but what about those for whom it's not offensive? How would you explain the offense? And how would you react if they opposed your decision? If one of my favorite books or series was censored because of a few people, I'd be very angry. Books are for everyone. People shouldn't be denied the books they love just because they're taken off the shelf. Those who find a book offensive should just ignore it and find another. Books will always be offensive to someone as they often target a specific group. For instance, if someone found romance novels offensive and had them removed, those who only read romance would have nothing to read. Books are written to teach, provide an escape, stimulate imagination, offer hope, mystery, and excitement. They shouldn't be removed from library shelves. Yes, there are books you may not want your kids to read, but you can't censor every such book. If you did, there'd be no books on the shelves. So, before having a book removed, think about whether you want to upset others. You never know when it could happen to you. In conclusion, books in libraries should not be censored based on individual sensitivities.
1369	4346	2	2	I do not believe that any materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from library shelves because almost anything can be considered offensive. For example, if someone needs to research @NUM1, they won't be able to if all related books are removed due to someone finding them offensive. Nowadays, many things can offend someone. People need to accept that things are as they are. If you're not directly involved in a particular issue, there's no need to be overly concerned. The world today has many negative aspects, and there will always be things that make people feel offended, like earthquakes. Some may be offended by them, but a college student might want to learn about earthquakes to help others. People are suffering, and our role is to help the poor and the sick, not to judge. In conclusion, we should not remove books, music, movies, and magazines from library shelves.
1370	4347	2	2	When I visit the library, I usually conduct research on a specific topic. I need factual information about what actually happened. This would be impossible if all materials that offended someone were censored. Keeping libraries uncensored allows us to fully experience what we're reading or researching. It's crucial for readers and researchers to absorb all the information, which keeps us engaged. Authors write for a reason. Removing their hard - work from the shelves because of a minor offense is unfair to them. Moreover, the author will be offended if their work is removed. As you can tell, I'm against censoring libraries. In my view, if something offends you, simply avoid it. In conclusion, libraries should remain uncensored to respect the work of authors and meet the needs of readers and researchers.
1371	4348	2	2	I firmly oppose library censorship. Every individual should have the right to express their beliefs and ideas. If all books that some people find offensive were removed from libraries, there would be little left to read. If parents are concerned about what their children borrow from the library, they should read the books first to determine their appropriateness. In my view, children should be free to read what they like, as reading can teach them a great deal. Books also offer children an escape from daily life. While children shouldn't use reading as a constant means of avoidance, occasional escapes are beneficial. I recall that as a young child, when things were tough, I could always turn to reading to distract myself from negative thoughts. Allowing children these escapes can improve their school performance and social skills. Reading can stimulate a child's imagination. Research shows that children who read regularly tend to have better prospects in life. No one wants to be boring, and a vivid imagination can prevent that. Online polls indicate that parents whose children have access to a wide range of books report that their children perform better in school and daily life. Reading helps children expand their vocabularies, making learning easier and enabling them to excel academically. In conclusion, censoring certain books from libraries would deprive children of valuable reading materials. Children need books to escape, develop their imaginations, and succeed in school and life. Therefore, libraries should not censor books.
1372	4349	2	2	Some library materials contain information that may be offensive to others. The question arises: should these materials be removed if they are found offensive? Some people believe that removal should depend on the severity of the offense. Materials should be removed if they involve sexual, racist, or life - threatening content. Some materials may contain sexual offensive comments. If the content is excessive and the author or artist has overstepped boundaries, there is a valid reason for removal. Such content can evoke negative emotions in readers, making them feel violated and offended. There are also materials with racist comments. Racism is a significant global conflict that causes fights, arguments, and emotional distress. If a material contains excessive racism, it should be removed. Additionally, some materials may present life - threatening offenses. For example, if a book about a nation contains content that implies the nation is in danger, some readers may be offended and demand its removal. Materials with excessive threats can make people feel their lives are at risk. In conclusion, offensive materials should be removed from library shelves. If they are sexually explicit, life - threatening, or contain racist comments, removal is necessary to prevent individuals from experiencing such harmful content.
1373	4350	2	2	Removing 'offensive' books from library shelves is equivalent to infringing on the right of speech. There is no valid reason for it. In this country, people have the right of speech and the right to be heard. An author's opinions may be offensive to some, but that does not mean they should be silenced. Writers draw inspiration from society, and taking away these books will not change people's thoughts and feelings. Moreover, citizens have the right to make their own choices. If someone doesn't like a book, they can simply choose not to borrow it. Writers may state things that, to some extent, may offend a small number of people. However, others view it as an exercise of freedom of speech and writing. An author who writes a story involving sex is not targeting second - graders. But if someone has an issue with an author's worldview, they will encounter similar things in the real world. Some books may be fictional, but they still draw ideas from society. When writers create books with 'inappropriate' actions, they reflect real - world behavior. Banning books with sex scenes or provocative language does not stop people from having sex or using curse words. Kids learn about these things from their parents and peers. Reading about them in a book does not change the fact that they are exposed to such content through other means. Removing swear - word books from library shelves will not change society, as there is no perfect society. Placing a book with offensive language on the shelf does not harm anyone. If a reader dislikes an author's expression, they can choose not to read the book. No one is forced to read offensive books. Banning a book at the request of an unhappy parent is a waste of resources and intelligence. The library is not responsible for readers' feelings. If a reader doesn't like a book, they can simply close it. In conclusion, banning books from public libraries is not an effective solution. It does not change society, and people should have the freedom to choose what they read.
1374	4351	2	2	It is understandable that some people advocate for library censorship to remove rude, unwanted, or offensive media. However, as Katherine Paterson pointed out, if one person has the right to remove a book from the shelf, then everyone does. Considering this, is library censorship really a wise idea? If everyone could decide which books to remove or which music to ban, there would be nothing left in libraries. It is impossible to please everyone. There are, of course, benefits to censorship. No parent wants their child exposed to certain materials at a young age. But libraries should not be censored. Responsible parents who want their children to avoid a particular book or movie should handle the situation themselves instead of having the book removed from the shelves. Removing a book also means condemning the author. As an author, one has the freedom of speech, which extends to media. An author has the right to write a book that some may find offensive, and no one has the right to take away this right. In the classic novel Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, the protagonist lives in a future world where books are banned and burned. The story contains a disturbing undertone, suggesting that such a 'future' may be closer than we think. The protagonist, a bibliophile, works as a fireman whose job is to burn books. Despite his love for literature, he is forced to participate in this practice. Throughout the novel, he tries to end the madness but is ostracized from society. The book highlights the harsh reality of censorship, which is prevalent everywhere. While we don't need to worry about Bradbury's futuristic nightmare becoming a reality soon, we should be aware of the dangers of censorship. No one person has the right to remove a book they find offensive from the shelves, let alone ban it completely. Banning books is a violation of freedom of speech, ideas, and thought. In conclusion, libraries should remain uncensored, and parents should take personal responsibility for guiding their children's reading choices.
1375	4352	2	2	There are numerous books that parents may not want their children to read. However, using censorship in libraries is not a good idea. Although some books may not be suitable for children, they can help children make better real - life choices. We also cannot overlook the principle of freedom of the press. With freedom of the press, anyone can write about anything, including the good, the bad, violence, crimes, love, and romance. Everyone has their own writing style and imagination. Without imagination, there would be no fictional books for children to read. Censorship would leave library shelves bare, as every book has something that could potentially be censored, whether it's swearing, guns, killing, romance, or love. If libraries were to censor books, there would be nothing left to read, and children's intelligence would decline significantly. Children read for various reasons, such as expanding their minds and entering a fictional world. Reading also enhances their vocabulary. When children read, they learn new words and are exposed to different perspectives, which helps them in everyday situations. If libraries censor books, children would be left with limited and un - stimulating reading materials. They would read the same books repeatedly and fail to learn new things. This is not what we want for our community. In conclusion, library censorship is not a great idea as it would deprive children of valuable learning opportunities and limit their intellectual growth.
1376	4353	2	2	There is a scary book that one would not want their children to pick up from the shelf. In my view, if kids read it, they might get scared and have nightmares, which parents would likely want to avoid. If parents have the right to move such a book, children may follow suit as they tend to imitate their parents' actions. So, it's advisable to move the book when the children are not around. I firmly believe that certain materials should be carefully managed to safeguard children from potential harm.
1377	4354	2	2	Have you ever come across offensive material in a library? Would you want your children exposed to offensive content? I believe no parent desires that. Consider how children access such things. Is it readily available, or do they actively seek it out? Not every child in @LOCATION1 can be shielded from inappropriate materials. After school, children often stay indoors and engage with TV, computers, and music, thinking there's no need to go outside. They are constantly exposed to harmful content from various sources, as there is little censorship today. Nowadays, the focus is on sales rather than the appropriateness of materials. This is wrong; everyone should strive for the best for children and teenagers. The prevalence of violence, bad attitudes, and crimes can be attributed to the easy access to such content. Schools can play a role by removing offensive materials from library shelves. It's regrettable that such materials are present in schools, but that's the reality of today's generation. A library should be a place for learning, reading, and using computers for educational purposes. It should not allow children to play games, listen to music with offensive language, or access inappropriate magazines. Reducing offensive materials in the school environment is a step towards solving this problem. Censorship is urgently needed everywhere as it would greatly benefit children.
1378	4355	2	2	The well - known adage 'knowledge is power' aptly describes the current situation regarding library censorship. Censoring libraries, which are intended to provide free access to diverse media materials, deprives people of the opportunity to empower themselves through knowledge. There are multiple compelling reasons against censoring library media, including its unconstitutionality, the lack of a proper definition of 'offensive', and the fundamental conflict with the essence of a library. First and foremost, censoring library materials is unconstitutional. The freedom of speech and the freedom of the press are cornerstones of the nation's founding constitution. Authors, illustrators, journalists, and other creators of library materials exercise their right to free speech through their works, and they are constitutionally protected in what they express. The freedom of the press allows them to share their ideas globally. Censoring library materials would limit the means by which artists can communicate with the citizens of @LOCATION1, clearly violating citizens' rights. Therefore, library censorship cannot be justified on constitutional grounds. The constitutional principle of equality also comes into play. There is no clear legal definition of 'offend'. People can be offended by a wide range of things, from serious personal attacks to minor distastes for certain ideas. Since all individuals are equal, we must respect all forms and degrees of 'offense'. This makes every library - provided work, whether a book, movie, or magazine, vulnerable to the subjective definition of 'offensive' and the personal feelings of each individual. Allowing individuals' offense to mark a work as 'offensive' and lead to its removal from libraries would enable some citizens to undermine the rights of others, which is unacceptable in libraries. Finally, there is a fundamental clash between the nature of censorship and the purpose of a library. Censorship aims to create a politically correct and non - offensive environment by restricting access to materials. Libraries, on the other hand, are meant to offer public access to works that challenge and expand people's knowledge, beliefs, and ideas. Implementing censorship would conflict with the core purpose of a library. For example, a library could not provide new information if someone disliked it, or challenge individual beliefs if someone was offended. In summary, censorship would destroy the system that libraries operate under, and thus, it should not be introduced.
1379	4356	2	2	I firmly believe that kids should have the freedom to read what they want. Learning should never be restricted, and there are no truly bad books that kids would encounter at school. Why should kids be prohibited from watching and reading what they desire? This is how they learn and grow, as long as the content is not of an adult nature, which is illegal for them to access. We shouldn't waste children's minds by forcing them to read things they don't like. When a child starts to dislike their schoolwork, it can lead to a chain reaction of hating school and the books in it. So, we should respect kids' choices in reading to foster their love for learning.
1380	4357	2	2	In my opinion, certain materials in books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves as everyone has the right to express themselves. However, I also recognize that some content suitable for high - school students may not be appropriate for elementary - school students. What might be highly offensive to elementary - school students may not be as offensive to high - school students, depending on what they are reading, watching, or listening to. Personally, I've never encountered offensive content in the books I've read, but I have come across it in music. When I heard an offensive rap song, I just thought it shouldn't have been written, but I didn't make a big deal out of it. While I think a lot of offensive rap music should not have been created, I still uphold the principle that everyone has the right to say what they want. In conclusion, while we should respect freedom of expression, we also need to be mindful of the different sensitivities of different age groups.
1381	4358	2	2	"We all have our preferred books, while some others don't appeal to us. Have you ever entered a library hoping to find that long - forgotten all - time favorite book or a book recommended by a friend? What if, upon arrival, you find that the book has been censored? Most of the books in public or school libraries are well - liked by many. Books open up new worlds for everyone and should not be removed.  First, let's discuss some issues in libraries. Some people believe that library books and magazines should be censored and removed from the shelves because they might contain racial slurs or comments that could offend certain individuals. This is a significant problem. For instance, a book like [@PERSON1] might be considered offensive today, but it offers a glimpse into what was happening during that time period. Without such books, some people would never know about past events, and we would be unable to learn from those mistakes and make better future choices.  Moreover, many censored books have great educational value. Everyone has their own book preferences, and what some think should be removed might not be a problem for others. If all so - called ""bad"" or offensive books were taken off the shelves, eventually, there would be no books left. We have the right to read any book, no matter how unpleasant it might seem. After all, one can find more controversial content in religious texts than what is being censored from libraries. If we couldn't read classics and other potentially offensive books, we would lose out on their educational value. Before starting a book, readers should check the back cover information to see if it suits them.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that no book should be censored. Books should have the freedom to sit on the shelves and be read by anyone interested. Censorship doesn't protect anyone; instead, it makes the situation worse. If someone is offended, they have the choice not to read the book. I hope I have convinced you that everyone has the right to read what they want, and no book should be censored."
1382	4359	2	2	Killings, murders, and books related to homosexuality can be offensive to some people, but that doesn't mean they should be removed. It's like saying one is offended by homework and wants it removed from [@ORGANIZATION2]. I think some of the most interesting books to read are about murders. If such books were taken out, teenage students in [@ORGANIZATION1] might lose interest in reading. Teenagers enjoy mystery and romance. For example, one of my favorite books, [The @CAPS1 @CAPS2], might offend some because it has murder in it, but it was a great and interesting read for me. People can simply ignore these books and choose another one.  If you want to keep [@ORGANIZATION2] students engaged in reading, you shouldn't remove books that might offend someone. Removing certain books won't make everyone happy. Some students might stop reading altogether if the best books are taken out of the library. Every book, in some way, could offend someone. They just need to overlook those books and pick a different one. I've seen books in my [@ORGANIZATION2] library that offended me, but I didn't ask the librarian to remove them because another student might have loved to read them.  Everyone has different opinions. If all offensive books were removed, there would hardly be any books left. The only remaining books would be [@PERSON1 the @CAPS3] and children's books. I don't think any [@ORGANIZATION2] student would want to read [@PERSON1 the @CAPS3] and give a class speech about it. Teachers would also have a hard time with book reports since most of the books read in class could potentially offend someone.  In conclusion, books that offend someone shouldn't be removed from schools and libraries. These books keep students reading and learning. Without them, I wouldn't enjoy reading as much. So, let's be mature and keep all the books on the shelves, ignoring the ones that offend us.
1383	4360	2	2	Censoring any form of media, such as books, magazines, movies, or music, from a library is unjust. A library is a vast repository of information, a common place where people can seek knowledge. When something is deemed offensive, it should not be hidden away as if it never existed. Instead, it should be the individual seeking the information who decides whether to use it.  For example, when a child encounters something offensive, the immediate reaction is often to remove it from the library or television. However, a better approach is to explain to the child what they are looking at. Eventually, they will understand why it might be offensive. But the question remains: who determines what is offensive? Just because one or two people find something offensive doesn't justify its removal.  Decisions about offensive media should be made through group discussions. If a book or magazine on the shelf might be offensive, the people around that type of information should decide whether to remove it, rather than simply hiding it.  In conclusion, censorship of media in libraries should not be a hasty decision. It is important to respect the right of individuals to access information and make their own choices. By engaging in discussions and allowing people to decide for themselves, we can ensure that libraries remain a place of free knowledge and exploration.
1384	4361	2	2	Are offensive materials offensive to everyone? Do all people consider the same materials offensive? Who has the right to determine what is or isn't offensive? Offensive material can be whatever someone deems it to be. Whether we remove offensive material or not, children will encounter it. Offensive material, like cursing or expressions of rage, is a form of self - expression and a way to relieve stress. It can also convey anger, hate, and depression.  Children will inevitably see and hear offensive things. Currently, parents try to shield their children from such content, which only makes children more curious. Offensive things are part of daily life, and the more we try to hide them, the more children will seek them out.  In movies, books, and music, offensive material is a form of expression. It helps relieve stress and rage and presents a true picture of what is happening. For example, in a book, if a character says, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You don't know what you have done!'...', it's difficult to fully understand the character's true anger. However, if the character says, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You will perish! You don't know what you have done! Death will come!'...', we can get an idea of how the author will develop the story, how the character truly feels, and we can see the foreshadowing. The author might be hinting at the death of a good man who could have stopped evil or the death of an evil man and the subsequent revenge.  Some people might find such examples offensive. To me, cursing isn't offensive. Offensive material shows how a character, writer, or singer feels without having to explicitly state it. It can also convey grief, amplifying the story and allowing the reader, viewer, or listener to expect more.  Only a specific group of people, like family, friends, or a close - knit group, might agree on what is offensive. Offensive material adds elements like foreshadowing, interest, anger, grief, and sometimes passion to a work. Since children will see offensive material if they want to, there's no point in getting rid of it. It interests them and encourages them to read more, watch or make movies, and listen to or create music.  In conclusion, offensive material, despite being offensive to some, has its place in various forms of media. It enriches the content and allows for a more in - depth understanding of characters and stories. We should not try to eliminate it just because it might be offensive to a few.
1385	4362	2	2	Do you think a book should be removed from the shelf just because it offends someone or you don't like it? Just because one doesn't approve of certain reading materials doesn't mean they should be taken away. If that were the case, as of [@DATE1], there would be no reading materials, books, or magazines left.  In my opinion, if a book offends you, the simple solution is not to read it. There are thousands of books, magazines, and newspapers that can potentially offend someone every day.  I don't intend to be harsh; this is just how I feel about the situation. It's my personal opinion that we should not remove books just because they might be offensive to some.  In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of reading materials and the right of individuals to choose what they read. Removing books based on individual offense is not a practical or fair approach. We should allow everyone to make their own decisions about what to read and keep a wide range of books available for all.
1386	4363	2	2	Have you ever pondered why teenagers change daily? Sometimes, parents fail to notice the reasons behind this change, assuming it's due to their children growing up, seeking more freedom, or needing more time. As time passes, they stop and wonder what has happened to their kids and why they are changing so much. However, they don't understand our behavior. You need to address this because we change based on what we see in magazines, movies, books, and music. Sometimes, music contains offensive words that we pick up. Music, books, magazines, and movies can be beneficial, but only when they are free of offensive content. Sometimes, they have a positive impact, but more often, they have a negative one as we learn bad things from them. Sometimes, young children read books with bad and offensive words. I recall when my friend and I were @NUM1 years old, she started reading books with offensive words, and her mother got angry with her. After that, she began insulting her mother and calling her names, and her mother felt terrible but didn't know why her daughter was acting out. The next day, I went to their house and told her mother that she was reading bad books and watching movies with offensive words. I also told her mother where she was hiding all those books and movies. When she got home and saw me there, with her mother holding all the books and movies, she gave me a dirty look and said I was a bad friend for telling her mother. I started crying because she made me feel bad, but she didn't realize I was doing it for her own good. Before I moved to @LOCATION1, she came to my house and apologized, saying she was sorry for how she treated me. I told her I did it because I loved her and she was like a sister to me since we were little. We both started crying. Now, we are still best friends. Nowadays, young children know everything because of what they watch and see. You can help us by removing all the bad and offensive words from books, movies, and magazines. Help us become important people in life.
1387	4364	2	2	Some books and magazines can be really offensive. For instance, I read a sports magazine that talked about some athletes and their accidents. One article was about @PERSON1 playing basketball while having the stomach flu, and it described how he had a hard time playing because he had to use the bathroom a lot. I mean, who would want the world to know about something like that? It's just not right. Another issue is that libraries have books with sexual content. There are quite a few books like that, such as 'Wake'. It's about a girl who gets pulled into other people's dreams, and some of those dreams are sexual. The book also has a lot of cursing. I did enjoy reading it, but I think it should be removed from the library because there are kids who aren't old enough to read such things. Parents should pay attention to what their kids are reading these days. You might be shocked by what you find. In conclusion, we need to be more careful about the content available in libraries to protect the younger generation from inappropriate material.
1388	4365	2	2	Katherine pointed out that if everyone had the right to remove a book from the shelf, there would be no books left. What she means is that what one person considers inappropriate, another might find acceptable. Censorship is a significant issue today. No parent wants their young children to read about drugs or violence. I have several opinions on this matter. First, I believe that books, movies, and magazines with inappropriate content, such as drugs, sex, violence, and other things unsuitable for young children, should be removed from the shelves. As a parent, I wouldn't want my child reading about violent murders or gangs. On the other hand, it is also the people's choice to read or watch inappropriate material. As a growing - up kid myself, I wasn't very fond of reading, but some of the best books had violence in them. Even if a book is inappropriate, children should have a say in what they read. We also need to consider mature kids. If all inappropriate books were removed from the shelves, kids who enjoy reading as a hobby might have nothing left to read in their preferred style. This also applies to parents. If there are inappropriate books at home, children can easily pick them up and read them. Bookstores, libraries, and movie stores should set an age limit on books and movies. There is an age limit for @CAPS1 - rated movies, but there doesn't seem to be one for explicit books. They could also require a letter of parental consent for children to get such books or magazines. Maybe parents should come in and get the books or movies for their children. Libraries and stores could also put a warning on the cover to indicate that the book might be inappropriate for some. Ultimately, what children read depends on the child and the parent. If a parent doesn't mind their child reading or watching inappropriate material, then it's not a problem. In conclusion, to maintain the buying and selling of books, there should be an option for obtaining inappropriate ones. With parental consent, kids should have the option to check out or buy most things, as reading is always a good thing, even if the material is explicit.
1389	4366	2	2	I agree that some of the material displayed on the shelves at our local library is inappropriate or even vulgar. In today's world, too many people get away with too much. Our society is in a complete mess, and something needs to be done to stop this madness. It seems inevitable that if a librarian puts an inappropriate book on the shelf, a child or an irresponsible person will find it. Yet, we still see children reading or looking at media or entertainment that is not suitable for their age group. Sometimes, adults also find books that are unappealing. So, why do we put such books on the shelves for public display? This is a question I haven't found an answer to. A couple of days ago, when I got home from school, I heard hip - hop music coming from my nine - year - old sister's room. I listened to the lyrics, and they were terrible. The singer was talking about drugs, sex, and alcohol. I went into her room, turned off the music, and asked her where she got the @ORGANIZATION1 from. She said 'the library.' This is just another example of the problem I'm talking about. If a nine - year - old can check out something like that from the library, imagine what's available to a sixteen - year - old like me. Adolescents don't need such thoughts and words in their vocabulary. I'm really worried about the next generation. What will they be listening to and reading? And it's not just the library; this problem is everywhere. In our society, we can't go a single day without hearing something bad on the radio, TV, or in public. Everywhere we turn, there's something inappropriate. We need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our act. We should stand up for what is appropriate and right. In conclusion, we must take action to protect the younger generation from this inappropriate content.
1390	4367	2	2	I firmly believe that we should not remove books, music, movies, magazines, and other media from libraries for several reasons. This is the real world, and the things we read about or watch in movies may not be what we want our kids to be exposed to. But life is about learning new things, and often, we learn about different ideas through reading or watching. The only time I would support removing such items is if they would seriously harm people or have a negative impact. If I walked into a public library and saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would turn away, even though many kids read such books today. Of course, libraries have books on all kinds of topics. If you're a parent worried about your child reading such things, well, that's life. Most books have true stories behind them, and I think everyone needs to learn about these things at some point in their lives. A lot of what we learn today comes from the books we read. Music is also a big part of our lives. We use it to relax and have a good time, whether we're in a car or at a party. Many of today's songs contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean we have to listen to them. Older people may not like these songs, but they are popular among kids. What many people don't realize is that these songs have a real meaning and are a part of life. Finally, magazines, movies, and other forms of media should not be removed from libraries. People read magazines to relax and learn about the latest fashions or their favorite athletes. We watch movies to relax and have a good laugh. No one should remove these sources of entertainment, even if some people think they are inappropriate. In conclusion, removing books, magazines, movies, music, and other media from libraries would have a negative impact on many people. It would take away sources of entertainment and learning. How would you feel if you went to your local library and most of the materials were gone? What would you do if you no longer had access to these things?
1391	4368	2	2	I firmly believe that books that no one reads should not occupy the shelves of bookstores. Moreover, if adults can read a particular book, it doesn't necessarily mean children should have access to it. Similarly, certain music on store shelves should be removed. Children under the age of @NUM1 should not have the means to obtain rated - R music. Such music should not be readily available for young kids.  When it comes to movies shown in theaters, no child under @NUM1 should be allowed to watch half of the content. Children should not be exposed to things typically meant for adults. This exposure is one of the reasons why young children may engage in inappropriate behaviors. The creators of certain movies need to consider how children might react to their works.  Most magazines sold today give children the wrong ideas. Magazines filled with gossip make kids believe such behavior is acceptable. This sends the wrong message to the younger generation. Kids these days tend to believe whatever they think is right, and many magazines make things seem very real. In conclusion, we need to be more cautious about the content available to children in books, music, movies, and magazines.
1392	4369	2	2	I think books from Mexico are important. Reading books is a great activity, especially during family time. Many people enjoy reading and often go to bookstores. When I was in school, I didn't read much initially. Then I went to my room and started reading a book, and I found it really good.   When I went on vacation, I packed two books to read at the beach. When I returned to school, I continued to enjoy reading. I saw that my family members also liked reading. Reading is a wonderful pastime, and everyone should have the opportunity to experience the joy of getting lost in a good book. In conclusion, books are a source of knowledge and entertainment, and we should encourage more people to read.
1393	4370	2	2	As an @CAPS1 citizen, I do not believe that any materials should be removed from libraries or stores. There are three main reasons supporting my view.  First, @LOCATION1 is known as the land of the free and the home of the brave. When someone removes a book or movie from a library because they find it offensive, they are infringing on my right to freedom. I should have the freedom to access any book in a library or rent any movie from a store. Restricting my access to these materials is an unacceptable violation of my rights.  Second, people have the choice to read or watch a particular item. Just because a book or movie is available doesn't mean one has to engage with it. If some individuals find a book or movie offensive, they can simply ignore it. They do not have the right to deprive others of the opportunity to enjoy these materials. There may be many people who love a particular book, so it's unfair to remove it for the sake of a few.  Finally, the argument that a book or movie should be removed because it's inappropriate for children is unfounded. It is the parents' responsibility to ensure that their children do not access inappropriate content. People do not have the right to completely remove materials just because a child might get hold of them.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that libraries and stores should not be censored. We all have the right to make our own decisions about what to read and watch, and this freedom should be respected.
1394	4371	2	2	People have diverse views on various things, and it's impossible to please everyone. I don't think libraries should remove materials just because some people find them offensive.  Firstly, removing offensive materials won't make everyone happy. Just because some individuals are offended by certain books doesn't mean others are. People have the choice to read or not read a book. A 'suggestive' book cover might make some people take offense, but that's not a valid reason to remove the book.  Secondly, offensive materials are enjoyable for some people. If a book or magazine is in the library, it's because someone reads, listens to, or watches it. If it were never checked out, the library would likely get rid of it. Removing so - called 'offensive' materials won't solve the problem of people getting offended easily.  Thirdly, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because some people think there are offensive materials in the library doesn't mean others share the same view. Removing such materials is like taking away freedom, similar to making kids wear uniforms at school.  In conclusion, the world is imperfect, and people will always be offended by something. Removing offensive materials from libraries won't make the world a better place, and we should respect everyone's right to access the materials they choose.
1395	4372	2	2	Some books may be offensive, but not all of them. Unfortunately, some libraries have started to censor their book collections by removing books they consider offensive. I firmly believe that there should be no censorship in libraries.  One reason is that a lot of good books are lost due to censorship. For example, some libraries don't carry @PERSON1's books because of curse words. Instead of removing them, they should just warn people about the language.  Another reason is that books on different religions are often removed. I once witnessed a librarian throw away a book about the @CAPS1 religion. This is a terrible act as the @CAPS1 religion is very interesting, and many people will now never learn about it.  Also, removing a book may end up offending some people. I heard about an @CAPS3 family complaining because a library removed a book about their religion. Everyone should have access to the books they want.  I propose that libraries separate books by subject and genre and put up warning signs. This way, people can get the books they want, and libraries won't have to worry about offending people. In conclusion, libraries should refrain from censorship and find better ways to manage their collections.
1396	4373	2	2	Throughout history, people have attempted to censor or ban materials they find offensive, which may stem from their upbringing or personal beliefs. However, I firmly believe that individuals should only have the right to decide what is appropriate for themselves. Everyone has one life, during which we form our own opinions and beliefs about right and wrong. Since we are unaware of the values of many people in our lives, claiming to know what should be banned for everyone is presumptuous. For example, if I bring a book to school that I find relevant and not exploitative, I should be able to read it as long as I don't force others to do the same. Suppose another student, raised in a household where the content of my book is considered offensive, sees me reading it. I don't think they should be able to ban the book based solely on their upbringing. While there can be a consensus, there is also the risk of mass ignorance. To claim to know what should or should not be shown to others is, in my view, ignorant. I believe the only justifiable form of censorship is parental control over their children. Parents have the responsibility to guide their children in distinguishing right from wrong. By censoring certain content for their children, they are fulfilling their duty as caregivers. In conclusion, while censorship may have its place in parental guidance, it should not be imposed on others without good reason.
1397	4374	2	2	At Jeffersonville High School, students do not have the right to remove a book from the library shelf. If a book is not suitable for you, simply don't choose it, just like you wouldn't watch a bad movie or eat a bad lunch. There's no need to take a book off the shelf just because you don't like it. In a school library, the collection should be diverse to meet the needs of different students. Everyone has different interests, and a wide range of books allows students to explore various topics. By not removing books based on personal preferences, the library can provide a more inclusive and educational environment. In conclusion, it's important to respect the diversity of books in the school library. Instead of trying to censor or remove books, students should be encouraged to make their own choices and learn from different perspectives.
1398	4375	2	2	Censorship occurs when a group of people, typically parents and educators, deem certain books, songs, movies, or magazines offensive and take steps to remove them from school libraries. The practice of censorship originated during the [specific period] in [specific location] with [specific group]. Its initial purpose was to conceal information from the public by eliminating all accessible records. In [specific location], a democratic society, censorship is still employed to withhold certain information from particular individuals. Some parents view books as educational for children, while others believe they may promote homosexuality, use inappropriate language, or depict drug use. However, in most cases, these elements are part of the story rather than the intended message. If we shield children from all negative aspects of the world, they will lack the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate real - life situations. For example, instead of hiding drugs from children, we should educate them about the harm drugs can cause and how to avoid them. Many so - called “harmful” books actually teach valuable lessons that parents may overlook. When children encounter inappropriate language in a story, it presents an opportunity for parents to explain the meaning and discourage its use. Censorship in [specific location] is a growing concern. While it can protect children from explicit sexual content, it can also do more harm than good by limiting children's exposure to different aspects of life. When forming an opinion on censorship, we should consider what is truly best for children. Knowledge is crucial, and children need to be prepared for the real world. In conclusion, a balanced approach to censorship is necessary, one that takes into account the educational value of materials and the need to protect children without over - restricting their learning.
1399	4376	2	2	Visiting the library is an excellent way to explore new ideas and knowledge. However, not all library materials are suitable for everyone. Certain books, movies, magazines, and music contain content that may be inappropriate for some individuals, especially children. Removing such materials from the library is not a good solution. Popular and best - selling materials should be available in the library to meet the diverse interests of patrons. Many books that are inappropriate for children are perfectly suitable for adults. To address this issue, libraries can create an adult - only section. This section would restrict access to explicit materials to adults and those over [specific age]. In addition, having a children's section in the library can keep young patrons away from adult - oriented materials. Library users often pick up books without knowing their content, and children may accidentally encounter inappropriate material. Parents should feel confident that their children can safely browse the library without being exposed to offensive content. Library staff also have a responsibility to ensure that adult materials remain in the hands of adults. Taking adult materials out of the library would reduce its popularity and limit the range of information available. The library should strive to be user - friendly, providing a safe and welcoming environment for both children and adults. By creating separate sections for adults and children, libraries can balance the need for diverse collections with the protection of young patrons. In conclusion, implementing adult and children sections in the library is an effective way to ensure that all users can access appropriate materials.
1400	4377	2	2	I firmly believe that not all books should be banned, but there are some that should be. Some books are banned simply because they contain a little profanity, but this is no worse than what children may hear on television. However, books that promote hate against other races or speak negatively about someone's religion should be prohibited. For instance, I once wanted to read the very famous book “The [Title] of [Person]” by [Author]. It was banned in my [school - related institution], so I had to go to a different library to get it. I don't understand why this book was banned. It tells the story of a mischievous youngster who runs away, engages in various activities, and even smokes, but this is no more harmful than what is shown on television. As an administrator in a [school - related institution], I would evaluate a book based on its underlying message. If a book is offensive, such as one written by [offensive person] that promotes hate, it should not be on the library shelf. On the other hand, a book about [historical topic] and [organization]'s view on slavery can be acceptable as it is part of our history and shows different perspectives. In conclusion, we should not judge a book based on its language or the events it depicts but rather on the message it conveys. While some books may contain content that is not to everyone's liking, we should be open - minded and consider the educational value. At the same time, we must ensure that books promoting hate or offensive content are not available in public institutions. I hope that [school - related institution] administrators will re - evaluate the books on their shelves and make more informed decisions about censorship.
1401	4378	2	2	Nowadays, violence is evident in every store around the globe. Children, as the future of our world, are exposed to such negative influences. Many kids and young adults are drawn to the offensive materials prevalent in society. I firmly believe that offensive items should be removed from general store shelves and only sold in stores catering to adults aged twenty - one and above. If these offensive products are accessible to young teenagers, we are putting ourselves at risk.  The other day, I visited a bookstore and was shocked to see inappropriate magazines. I couldn't understand how they could be sold there. After all, it's called a bookstore, not a movie, music, or magazine store. If students are exposed to offensive books, music, or movies, they may grow up thinking such behavior and attitudes are acceptable.  When I was a child, I often went to the bookstore with my mom. I'd pick up any book to read, but many times, my mom would take the offensive ones away from me. At that time, I was too young to understand. In today's society, kids are growing up too quickly, which is not a good thing. They should be able to enjoy children's books and have a care - free childhood.  Middle school and high school students generally don't read much, so the main concern is elementary school kids. They are eager to learn how to read, and if offensive books, like those about drugs, are on the shelves, they will read them and become curious about the effects of drugs.  In the end, it seems that my opinion may not matter much because publishers and authors are mainly driven by profit. They will keep producing all kinds of books, whether positive or negative. However, I still think offensive books should have age - restricted sections in stores to protect children from inappropriate content.
1402	4379	2	2	There are numerous topics that can be considered offensive, and it ultimately depends on an individual's personal judgment. In my view, materials should not be removed because people have diverse views and opinions. For example, someone from a different country or religion may perceive topics like abortion and racism very differently. I believe that having a wide range of topics in materials can expand readers' thoughts and enable them to see things from different perspectives.  If, in the future, one of my elementary - school children brings home a book about abortion, I would be worried. However, I don't think schools would allow younger children to access inappropriate reading materials. For middle - school or high - school students, their maturity level is usually sufficient to handle such content. Removing these materials from schools may not be the right decision as they could actually be beneficial.  In the book 'A @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', there are many detailed events. Some may argue that it is too graphic for children, but these events are a part of today's society. Reading this book really opened my eyes, and I'm glad I read it. It made me want to help children growing up in similar difficult situations, and I believe it may have the same impact on others. Some children may even be inspired to help those in need in the future.  Libraries should offer a variety of books. I'm not suggesting that libraries should stock books about murder, but they should have materials that can expand children's minds and potentially change their lives. Some books deal with sensitive topics, but no one has the right to dictate what others should believe. It is more meaningful for people to form their own beliefs rather than being told what to think.  I recently read a book titled '@CAPS6', which is about the government allowing parents to 'unwind' their children and use their body parts for those in need. While the concept may seem cruel, the author's underlying message is valid. A quote from the book, 'On one side you have people killing abortion doctors for the right of life and on the other you have people getting pregnant just to sell their fetal tissue', shows that people will always have different opinions on various issues. This book changed my perspective on many topics and helped me see things from different angles.  Whether it's racism, abortion, @CAPS3 abuse, or 'unwinding' children, some people will support certain views while others will oppose them. I think it's time for children around the world to discover their own beliefs. Removing 'offensive' materials from libraries won't help in this process. In conclusion, I strongly advise leaving the materials as they are, as the authors had valid reasons for writing them, and a generation of children with their own true beliefs is the key to a better future.
1403	4380	2	2	Since the beginning of time, there have always been individuals offended by certain forms of media, with books, movies, and music being at the center of this controversy. The disputes over media have been so intense that they have even reached the court. Those who are upset about media have led to the implementation of certain censorship measures on these materials.  I firmly believe that there should be no censorship in media. It's true that there are books, movies, and other media products that may offend someone or a group of people. Therefore, these products should have labels or at least a description on the back explaining what might cause offense. If something is considered too vulgar for the general public, it should be placed in a more discreet location, but not removed from the shelves. Media is a form of free expression, and the goal is to share ideas with the world. With around @NUM1 billion people in the world, it's likely that someone will enjoy the same type of media as you.  A prime example of a media material that is constantly challenged worldwide is the Bible. It is one of the oldest books in the world and is still in print. People of different religions may find the prevalence of Bibles offensive compared to their own religious books, leading to significant controversy. However, these diverse movies and books are valuable because they are unique and represent freedom of expression. The world needs people who question ideas and religions. Every person is unique, and it's great for individuals to share their opinions so that others can gain new perspectives or at least think about different viewpoints.  Society has already imposed parental advisory warnings on CDs, ratings on movies, and labeled books as 'challenged'. These measures only restrict the public from exploring new ideas and forming their own opinions. I believe in the freedom of thought, which is our most valuable asset and what sets us apart from one another. Media should be free so that people of all ages and from all over the world can express their uniqueness. Censorship will face challenges in the future, and I will actively participate in these challenges to ensure that everyone can enjoy the freedom and happiness that comes with free media.
1404	4381	2	2	Library materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines, should generally be appropriate. However, it can be beneficial to have some offensive literature as people can learn from it. Nevertheless, there should be an age limit for borrowing such items. I firmly believe that offensive literature should remain on the library shelves, but within certain limits.  Libraries today are filled with a vast number of books and other forms of literature. For some, the quiet environment of a library may seem boring. When I visit a library, I'm drawn to the books and magazines that interest me. However, what I find interesting may be offensive to others. For instance, a comic book might contain something that someone could take offense to.  Libraries can't satisfy every patron. Just because someone doesn't like the offensive materials in the library doesn't mean they should be removed. There are people like me who enjoy these types of books and magazines. Offensive content exists all over the world, and it can't be avoided everywhere.  Keeping offensive literature in libraries can have a positive outcome, mainly for the purpose of learning. While it may be offensive to some, others may be interested in learning about these topics. They may not be aware of the content in these books unless they are available on the shelves. Libraries should have a separate section for offensive books, magazines, music, and movies. If an item is offensive, it should be placed in this section, and borrowers should be at least @NUM1 years old.  There may be some drawbacks to keeping offensive materials in libraries. However, one can't avoid offensive content throughout their life. Instead of learning about it the hard way in the real world, one can go to the library, pick up a book, and learn how to deal with such issues. Offensive material is a part of life, and people can't be sheltered forever.  In my opinion, offensive materials should be kept in libraries as they can provide a valuable learning experience.
1405	4382	2	2	I disagree with the idea of exposing young children to certain offensive books. However, I firmly believe that books in libraries should not be removed or censored. Removing or censoring books might lead to the loss of some important ideas and prevent people from getting a complete understanding of different aspects of life.  Books are a form of free expression, and they can cover a wide range of topics, including those that some may find offensive. By removing these books, we are limiting the diversity of knowledge and ideas available to the public. Instead of removing them, libraries could implement age - appropriate policies. For example, offensive books could be placed in a restricted section where only adults or older students can access them.  In conclusion, while protecting young children from offensive content is important, we should not sacrifice the freedom of access to knowledge. By finding a balance between protecting the young and maintaining the integrity of the library's collection, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow.
1406	4383	2	2	I firmly believe that library censorship should be relevant. For instance, when someone wishes to borrow an adult book, they should be required to present identification at the front desk. Many children exploit this loophole by renting books and games that their parents would never permit. Implementing a censorship system should be a relatively straightforward arrangement for public library systems. Private libraries have the freedom to operate as they see fit since they are not bound by state laws. In contrast, public libraries are subject to state and city regulations and should not expose children to adult content. For example, in numerous US libraries, there are books known as manga or anime, many of which depict partial nudity and other graphic elements unsuitable for younger children, yet are only rated 13+. I think the library systems could undergo several changes, and it's up to you whether you want to initiate those changes. In conclusion, a balanced approach to library censorship is crucial to ensure that both adult and child patrons can access appropriate materials.
1407	4384	2	2	I don't think library materials should be censored. Parents who don't want their children exposed to inappropriate content should closely monitor their activities. By keeping a closer eye on their kids, parents can control what they read, view, and listen to. There's a lot of inappropriate content out there, and parents need to do a better job of teaching their children what's acceptable. It's rare to stumble upon inappropriate material in a library unless you're specifically looking for it. It's easy to distinguish between good and bad content. Usually, in libraries, more mature books and magazines are separated from children's books, which is how it should be in all libraries. In my experience, I've never accidentally encountered inappropriate content in a library. A library is a place for people of all ages and shouldn't be restricted to a single age group. If libraries were censored, many people would be unhappy. It would be like a store stopping the sale of your favorite product because one person didn't like it. A lot of adults probably wouldn't visit a censored library, and it would then become mainly a place for children. Since most young children don't even go to the library, it would become almost useless. Throughout my life, I've never heard of anyone being deeply offended by something in a library, whether it was in a magazine, on the news, or through word - of - mouth. Most parents do a good job of monitoring their children's reading and viewing. They shouldn't be deprived of the privilege to access adult - rated materials if they choose. Just because one irresponsible parent fails to monitor their child doesn't mean all parents should be punished. In conclusion, the library should maintain materials for people of all ages, as it is a place for everyone.
1408	4385	2	2	In my view, it's unfair to censor books in libraries just because a certain group finds them offensive. A good library is diverse, offering materials that people from different backgrounds can enjoy. Finding a compromise isn't as difficult as some might think. An excellent alternative to full - scale censorship is to regulate books and other products by setting age limits based on their content and maturity level. Take the author [Author's Name] as an example. His books contain offensive language and themes that are clearly inappropriate for most younger readers. However, censoring the language in these books wouldn't solve the problem. If a young person has the ability to read such a book, they'll still understand the ideas presented. Removing mature - level books from libraries isn't a viable solution either. If a library sacrifices its diversity, it will also lose its diverse customer base. Consider a movie store. If it only sold G - rated and PG - rated movies, fewer people would visit, and it would turn into a children's store. Even censoring movies wouldn't be effective as it would take away the essence of unfiltered art. My solution is clear. Since movies are rated according to their maturity content, books should be too. Books with controversial content shouldn't be placed next to young readers' books and should be labeled as containing material unsuitable for minors. It's understandable that people want to censor entertainment for the well - being of their loved ones, but we can't shield them from reality forever. In conclusion, libraries should adopt a rating system for books to ensure that materials are accessible to people of all ages while protecting younger readers.
1409	4386	2	2	I believe that if we allow people to remove items from store shelves just because they don't like them, there'll be nothing left. There are different types of parents. Some are overly protective and don't want their kids exposed to any inappropriate content, fearing that it might influence them to do wrong and get into trouble. Others don't really care as long as their kids leave them alone, and some are extremely over - protective. Yes, there are certain items that should be removed from shelves because they're highly inappropriate. Some materials talk about drugs and alcohol, trying to entice young kids to try them and get addicted so that businesses can make more money. These kids often end up getting hurt or even dying. Some companies make the packaging of these harmful products look cool to attract young customers. While most kids might be tempted, some resist to avoid trouble or self - harm. There are also songs that shouldn't be allowed to be played due to their lyrics. If parents listen to such songs in the car with their kids, the kids might sing them at school and get in trouble. Many things in the market should be different, but businesses are only focused on making money and don't care who buys their products. This is the wrong approach; they should care about people's lives and families. Some magazines contain inappropriate pictures to attract men. Sometimes, a young boy might take a magazine to school and get in trouble, embarrassing his parents. In conclusion, I think some items shouldn't be on store shelves. Parents should also be more careful about leaving inappropriate items within their kids' reach.
1410	4387	2	2	Do you think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that might be offensive should be removed from the shelves? I believe they shouldn't. People have diverse preferences when it comes to buying books, movies, etc. If companies that produce these items can't offer a variety of products to meet different tastes, they'll lose money. Without sufficient funds, they may go out of business, and then consumers might be unable to find what they're looking for. Everyone has their favorite things, and it would be frustrating if a store stopped selling your favorite candy just because someone found it offensive. The same goes for other products. If offensive items are removed, what will replace them? Stores need to fill their shelves. Should they just stock more candy and make the world overweight? If you come across something offensive, simply ignore it. Others may like it, just as you like your favorite candy. There are plenty of other options to choose from. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of consumer preferences and not rush to remove items from the shelves just because they might be offensive to some.
1411	4388	2	2	I firmly believe that no knowledge source should be removed from library shelves just because a few individuals find it offensive. In my view, what one person deems offensive, another might consider reasonable. People can't assume that their personal sense of offense applies to everyone. Some of the best books on our shelves are the ones that might be considered offensive.  Take *Of Mice and Men* for example; it contains some racist and sexist comments. But if everyone got upset about that, a great book wouldn't be read by the future leaders of our country. All the older books would likely disappear, and we'd lose knowledge of what happened in the 1930s. Also, some of the TV shows people watch are far worse than the books. If you find a book offensive, simply don't read it!  When I hear about a book being offensive, it actually makes me want to read it. It adds character and humor. We can't just have the same old, unchallenging books. Sometimes, these so - called offensive books teach us about ourselves. They can bring out the best in people, and that's the beauty of reading.  Libraries are a place where we can access all kinds of books, and no one should take that away. I want my kids to have the same choices I had growing up, plus all the new books. It's just not right to deprive others of their choice of knowledge. That's my strong opinion on removing books from public library shelves.
1412	4389	2	2	"I'm of the opinion that things shouldn't be removed from shelves just because a few people are offended. There may be some who dislike something, but there are always others who like it. For instance, a book might seem offensive to one person because it portrays females in a certain way, but it could be reasonable to another.   My friend gets offended by movies where the black guy always gets in trouble or dies first. If we removed every movie that offended him, there'd be hardly anything left. I feel offended when magazines portray girls as only being valued for their looks, as it makes people insecure. However, I won't request their removal because some magazines offer useful tips and help people feel better about themselves. Taking them away could cause problems.  Items should only be removed from shelves for a good reason. For example, I'd understand removing a magazine with nudity to protect kids. Some libraries remove things that could cause major issues. Like a newspaper reporting on a disaster that causes people to swarm the stand and fight. This could lead to people getting hurt and the library being sued.  Yes, I know some people will request things to be removed, but you can't always get your way. People might say it's not fair, but the saying ""life isn't fair"" is true. So, the next time you hear someone wanting something removed, tell them this, or refer back to it when you want something removed yourself.  In conclusion, things shouldn't be removed unless absolutely necessary. When someone gets offended, it's their problem. You can simply walk away and not look or listen."
1413	4390	2	2	"I firmly believe that materials like books, music, movies, and magazines exist for a reason – people enjoy them. There may be some that some people find offensive, but that's okay. You don't have to engage with them; there are plenty of other options. These materials are our entertainment; they bring us joy and smiles. They're also important educational tools for children.  As a teenager, I can say that many of us love music and books. They shape our character. Authors and publishers don't create these materials to gather dust on shelves; they're meant to be read and experienced. I understand that some people have strong opinions about removing certain materials, but I don't agree with them. Children, as well as adults, need to learn in various ways, and some of these so - called ""offensive"" materials are part of that learning process.  If people start removing these materials, it could turn into a never - ending battle. One thing will be removed, and then another, and another. It shows the differences in opinion within our communities. Everyone is entitled to their own view, but in this case, I completely disagree with getting rid of these tools that can improve our world."
1414	4391	2	2	"Do I think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they're considered offensive? Absolutely not. I strongly oppose such an idea.   You know there are multiple radio stations, right? One person can't speak for everyone. I love all genres of music and books. They're pretty much my life. When I'm offended by a song, I change the station. When I don't like a book, I put it down. It's not your job to make decisions for me. I live my own life, and you should live yours.  Books, movies, plays, games, and magazines are for our entertainment. If we start removing them because of vulgar or offensive content, then what's the point of having freedom of speech? People who are offended should put the material down and move on. Just because a few people are offended by the things we use for amusement doesn't mean they should be taken away.  Authors and directors spend a long time creating movies and writing books to entertain us and feel fulfilled. If we start removing these works from shelves and screens, people will lose their jobs. Take the *Shakespeare plays* for example. They can easily offend someone, but they're brilliant pieces of art.  I love suspenseful books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books they can relate to, and some can relate to so - called ""offensive"" books. I once read a book about drugs and violence that I could relate to. It helped me realize that certain actions aren't always right.  People need to understand that the so - called ""offensive"" books, movies, and magazines are a part of reality. No matter what we do, people will encounter these things in their lives. Violence and drugs are seen every day. If these things are offensive to some, they need a reality check. These books can actually influence kids to make the right choices. For example, a kid who reads about a drug addict in prison might think, ""I'm never going there.""  If parents are worried about their kids being exposed to such content, they can remove it from their own homes, but not from everyone else. I believe people can tell right from wrong. These ""offensive"" books, movies, and magazines are enjoyable to me.  This whole situation reminds me of drama. People say they hate it, but it's everywhere and always will be. If you can't handle being offended occasionally, how will you survive in life? Taking away these things is a mistake. If people are against them, they should focus on themselves and leave others alone. They can make their own choices. That's the essence of literature and art. The author or director knew what they were creating and knew not everyone would like it.   Just because someone is offended by a book doesn't mean it should be removed from shelves. Grow up, put it down, and walk away."
1415	4392	2	2	A curious child enters the library for the first time, eager to find a story. But when she reaches the children's section, the book she wants is prohibited because it's said to promote certain ideals to children. She turns to her older sister for help, but the sister is too busy searching for her own book on a liberal topic. Unfortunately, the sister can't find the book she wants either, as the library has censored it.  This makes me wonder: why censor libraries when we have the freedom of the press and speech? Censoring libraries restricts what we can read, which is taking away a part of our freedom. The press can print anything, and we read it. Will the press be the next thing to be censored? A book is like a newspaper, relaying a story to entertain the readers.  Censoring libraries also takes away the freedom of speech. Writing is a form of self - expression. Authors share their thoughts and feelings through writing, hoping to touch others' lives. Whether it's helping a reader escape a bad day or answering a teenager's questions, books are valuable. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life. The *Harry Potter* series allowed me to use my imagination and enter another world, leaving my chores behind.  Some people say offensive things should be censored. But in our culture, almost anything can be considered offensive. If we don't learn about these so - called offensive things, how can we understand history? There have always been rude things said, and we should be exposed to them to learn from them. By censoring these items, we and our children will never learn about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.  Instead of censoring, we can have a system where certain items are restricted and red - flagged. Restricted items would be for people over a certain age, so children's minds aren't polluted, but we can still be exposed to different ideas. Red - flagging would let readers know that an item contains potentially offensive material, so they can choose whether to engage with it. This way, the books can stay in the library and be used, with a warning for those who don't want to be exposed.  In conclusion, censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech and makes us ignorant. A warning system is a fair alternative that allows everyone to make their own choices.
1416	4393	2	2	In this world, one can never predict what someone might write. There is a vast amount of material available, some of which, in my opinion, is inappropriate for certain audiences to read, watch, or listen to. You might think that individuals have the autonomy to decide what they consume. While I concur with this view, I firmly believe that some materials are not properly rated according to age. I am of the opinion that certain materials should be restricted from minors, some from children, and others from the general public.  You may argue that there is nothing wrong with books, music, movies, etc. However, I find some materials offensive and improper. I have come across numerous materials that I consider unsuitable for under - age individuals. For instance, the ratings of some movies are inaccurate as they contain excessive violence or inappropriate language. You may not perceive this as a significant issue, but I do. I believe that some materials are under - rated and should not be accessible to those under a certain age.  It doesn't surprise me that kids are now yelling, hitting, or acting rebelliously towards their parents. Many of these behaviors are learned from books, music, movies, etc. This is one of the main reasons why some materials should be banned from children. Kids are in the learning phase and tend to imitate what they see, hear, or read. They often act without thinking and assume that their actions are acceptable. I think parents should be vigilant about offensive materials on the shelves and advocate for their removal.  Why should some materials be banned from everyone? Firstly, why would we want to engage with content that is morally wrong? You might think that we do it for entertainment, and there is nothing wrong with that. While there is some truth to this, some content is simply too extreme. I believe that people's crazy actions today are often influenced by what they encounter in books, music, movies, etc. If a book contains highly offensive content, it should be banned for everyone. This is the right course of action.  If we don't want the world to become more chaotic, we need to take action against offensive materials and ban them permanently. We don't want to see our kids misbehaving or have crazy people causing harm because of what they've learned from such materials. In conclusion, I firmly believe that some materials should be restricted from minors, children, and the general public.
1417	4394	2	2	A place rich in knowledge should be a hub where one can access all the news that shapes the world today, and it should also allow people to explore the past. A library is a repository of various items, including books, magazines, movies, and in some cases, music. The books range from encyclopedias to works by @PERSON1, offering an extensive variety of information.  However, along with the wealth of positive information, there is also a negative aspect. Given the prevalence of profanity in society, one would not want a child to be exposed to it in a public library.  Books are placed in libraries to provide people with the opportunity to read and expand their knowledge. The idea of a younger person entering the adult section can be disconcerting. But then again, who can say that an individual is not permitted to read an article or magazine with more mature - level information or language? I believe that people will seek out what they want to see and read, and they have the right to do so.  Both young and old need to be educated about the world's past history and current news. One reason is to prevent past mistakes from recurring, and another is to keep individuals informed about what is happening around them.  Libraries should display banners or flaps indicating the content of specific sections, allowing people to decide whether to visit those areas. What one person deems inappropriate may not seem so bad to another, as it is a matter of personal preference. Nevertheless, materials should remain available for public access.  Ultimately, the decision to visit a library is an individual one. A library should be a place where people can acquire knowledge, regardless of the type of information. People should be able to access information without facing censorship from others. In conclusion, libraries should balance the need for diverse information with the protection of younger readers, and individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices.
1418	4395	2	2	I believe that parents should be required to sign a document indicating whether their child is permitted to access a particular section of the library. It is up to the parents to assess how their children will handle the content.  One side of the library should be designed for a more mature audience. Of course, it should not contain pornographic material, but rather content that is not considered @NUM1. Kids aged fifteen and older should be able to understand this type of content, and they may also need to be accompanied by an adult.  The other side of the library should be a children's area filled with children's stories, targeting kids fourteen years and younger.  There should be an attendant at the dividing line to check the passes indicating whether entry is permitted. This system may be a bit challenging to implement, but it would satisfy both the needs of mature readers and the protection of younger ones.  It is the parents' responsibility to decide if their children are ready to read materials with certain language and descriptions. However, the child must be at least @NUM2 to obtain a pass from the parent.  I wholeheartedly agree with Katherine Paterson. Eventually, kids will discover the realities of the world. I would prefer my kids to learn from books and ask me questions rather than finding out on the streets, where they could get hurt or in trouble with the law. They could also attend a party and engage in dangerous activities that could be life - threatening. In conclusion, a well - regulated library with parental guidance can help children learn in a safe and controlled environment.
1419	4396	2	2	Do our rights end where others' begin? In a diverse society, conflicting opinions are inevitable. Does this mean that we should violate another person's rights simply because we disagree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle?  Everyone in the world is entitled to their own opinion. What is considered wrong by some may be right for others. For example, one family may find their children using curse words offensive, while another may not see it as a problem. The diversity of beliefs does not justify censoring society from cursing, religion, or violence discussed in published works. These issues exist in the real world, and censoring them will not make them disappear.  It is well - known that the world contains both good and bad. Removing materials from library shelves will not change this fact. Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media denies people the opportunity to view ideas from all perspectives. Whether we shield young children from different viewpoints or not, the good and bad still exist. The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can be applied to the acceptance of different ideas and opinions. As children grow, they will learn about the censored materials.  In some situations, such as in the classroom, our rights may be limited to respect others'. When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone should have the freedom to choose what they read. The definition of 'offensive material' is highly subjective. In conclusion, while we need to respect others' rights, we should also be cautious about over - censoring and allow for the free flow of diverse ideas.
1420	4397	2	2	Do I think that certain materials like books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from library shelves? No, I don't. Nowadays, kids read about topics like gang violence and non - school - related subjects because they find these books interesting. However, I do think that very young students should not be given access to such books, as some are above their reading level.  Sometimes, kids are interested in content that others may not read. Books on gang violence and drug abuse fall into this category, and some children may not be ready for them. I believe that kids under a certain age should not read these books due to their content. Kids are drawn to these books, movies, and magazines because they reflect real - world events. While it's not necessarily a good thing, many of the things they encounter in these materials are part of everyday life.  When I was younger, I visited a library in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. Whenever a kid selected a book that was not suitable for them, the librarian would say that they needed their parents' permission to check it out. Once I understood the reason behind this policy, I thought it was a great idea. I think all libraries should adopt this approach to prevent kids from reading age - inappropriate materials and encourage them to find suitable alternatives.  In conclusion, I don't think these materials should be removed from library shelves. If they are removed, some kids may stop visiting the library because the books they find interesting will no longer be available. Instead, I suggest leaving them on the shelves and implementing proper age - verification measures.
1421	4398	2	2	Do you think certain books, movies, or magazines in libraries should be removed due to censorship? It's common to hear parents tell their children not to look at a magazine because of the vulgar content inside or not to watch a movie with inappropriate scenes. We often face such situations, unsure whether to pick up a magazine or leave it on the shelf. In my view, libraries should remove all vulgar materials. Libraries encourage kids to visit, but not if there are vulgar items on the shelves.  Parents, teachers, and other adults frequently tell kids to go to the library to do homework, read, or study. However, if kids are distracted by a book with vulgar content while looking for the one they want, their curiosity will be piqued. The main reason I oppose having vulgar materials on library shelves is for the sake of young children. They don't need to be exposed to inappropriate content at their age. It's difficult for a child to resist a movie or magazine they've never seen before.  In most libraries, the adult section is separated from the children's section. But this doesn't prevent children from overhearing or seeing what adults are engaged with. The children's section is meant for fairy - tale stories and kid - friendly movies, yet if the adult section has inappropriate content, children can be affected. If children and adults are in the same library, it should be made impossible for children to access the adult section.  Another reason libraries should censor more is for the teenagers in the community. Many teenagers in our community like to go to the library after school. If it's a good environment for them, why can they download bad music with cursing and vulgar language from the library's internet? Libraries should prevent teenagers from doing so. If they want to download such music, they should do it elsewhere where younger kids can't access it.  My final point is a reminder for parents. Parents should check what their kids are looking at in the library. You might think your child wouldn't look at vulgar materials, but kids are naturally curious. I would accompany my child to the library a few times to see what's available and tell them not to pick up bad - looking items.  Some libraries can't remove every bad or vulgar item. As the quote says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I can think of books and magazines I'd never want children, especially young ones, to look at. Libraries should be more committed to removing vulgar materials so that younger children can't access them. It's one thing for a child to see inappropriate content outside the library, but in a library, it's unacceptable.
1422	4399	2	2	There are certain books that no child should read, yet some libraries seem indifferent to the content on their shelves. They don't seem to care if a young child picks up a book full of curse words and profanity, as long as the child is reading. Even though libraries have a kids' section, it doesn't stop a child from wandering over and grabbing an inappropriate book.  When I was a child, I was often in the library, and it was easy to get a book with bad language. We even found it funny when a book had curse words and would repeat them. I remember in school, the teacher would read books with curse words to us, and we'd all laugh, and even the teacher thought it was funny. But if we repeated those words outside of reading, we'd get sent to the office, even though we thought it was okay because we read them in a book.  I believe books with bad language should not be accessible to kids. I think it's acceptable for books with curse words to be available in junior high, but elementary school is too early. Such books are meant for adults because some books do sound better with curse words. My parents thought it was wrong when I brought home a library book full of curse words or slang. However, they never said anything to the library because they knew I'd hear such words as I got older.  In conclusion, these are the reasons why I think books with curse words should not be made available to young children.
1423	4400	2	2	Billions of books circulate on library shelves daily, encompassing both fictional and non - fictional works, as well as horror and comedy genres. Writers from all corners of the world create works based on complex life experiences or simple dreams. As authors have the right to freedom of speech, story plots can have endless combinations, and each reader has different preferences.  Libraries are filled with books that reach up to the ceilings, covering every possible kind. Books are categorized according to truth, genre, and cover, with each category having about four options. Censorship should never be a necessary measure. Writers create for diverse audiences. It's not legitimate for some to label a work as 'right' or 'wrong' and have it removed from the shelves. If books had ratings like movies, a restricted cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to access vulgar content. However, taking away the enjoyment of some readers through censorship is unethical.  Censorship, whether for books, music, or magazines, is unnecessary. Those who create entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression or interpretation. If the concern is about youth, parental guidance should be in place. Banning content can affect those who relate to it, so all options should be considered. Everyone should have the freedom to choose their own entertainment.
1424	4401	2	2	Censorship, the ability to control what is seen or heard, is interpreted differently by different people. Music can be censored or banned if it is considered offensive or inappropriate. Some magazines found in grocery stores, libraries, and even airports use covers to visually censor their front pages. Movies are rated based on their explicit content, and when shown on basic cable, they may have silenced words or more appropriate words inserted. Books, though rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored globally. Some previously censored books have been uncensored and returned to libraries.  In my opinion, censorship should be based on the public's viewpoint rather than a single person's view. Growing up, my parents carefully monitored what shows I watched, what music I listened to, and what magazines I read.  When I was a child, I loved professional wrestling. I enjoyed watching tall, intimidating men hitting each other with steel chairs, crashing through tables, or being thrown off twenty - foot steel cages. My brother and I had a favorite wrestler, @PERSON1 @CAPS1, who could intimidate any opponent. As time passed, professional wrestling started featuring beautiful women in lingerie, which became eye - candy for male viewers. One day, when my mom saw two half - naked girls fighting in a match, she turned off the TV and said professional wrestling was too adult for me. At twelve, I didn't want to argue with her. This shows that censorship can be based on parents' and guardians' ideas and viewpoints.  In grade school, I loved the show '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6.' It's about four eleven - year - old boys going on unintentional adventures to save their @CAPS4 @CAPS5. The boys use curse words that even some adults are hesitant to use, and the show's controversial behavior led to the banning of a few episodes. My dad liked the show and tried to get my mom to like it too. But when my mom saw it, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content. As a child, my parents decided what was appropriate for me, but now that I'm older, I can make my own decisions.  I grew up listening to various types of music. My brother listened to rap, alternative, and musical songs as he was in show choir. My dad introduced me to classic rock, and my mom loved soft rock. I developed a love for my dad's and brother's music. I enjoyed music from artists like @ORGANIZATION4, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, etc. One day, when I heard unfamiliar music in the living room, my dad and brother told me to go to another room. The song was by @ORGANIZATION2. This shows that parental and guardian - based censorship is necessary.  Although some people may find certain content offensive, it doesn't mean the whole world should be banned from it. If someone wants to avoid it and protect their kids, they can. Censorship by parents and guardians is the best approach. No material should be banned from libraries, music stores, or other places that sell such items. Censorship is important, but an outright ban of a particular piece of material is unjust.
1425	4402	2	2	There is a lot of content subject to censorship today, but should these items be removed from libraries? I think not. Items should not be removed from libraries due to censorship. If censorship is a major concern, there are other solutions besides removal.  I don't believe that censored items should be removed just because some people have an issue with them. Nowadays, you can hear the same content in public as what's in censored movies, games, @CAPS1's, etc. If libraries are considering removing censored products, the decision should be up to the library, not the government.  If people have a problem with censorship, they don't have to check out or look at the censored items. If there are issues with parents because their kids are checking out censored items, a restriction should be in place. For example, to check out a censored item, a person should either be @NUM1 years old or accompanied by a parent or guardian. If the problem persists, it could be treated like tobacco products, where one must be @NUM1.  If libraries don't want to implement the above measure, they could create a dedicated room for censored items. The room should be located in a corner or a less - populated area of the library. There should be signs indicating that the room contains censored items and that it's for @NUM1 and older.  There are many ways to deal with censored items. Since there are so many alternatives, there's no need to remove them from libraries. We shouldn't punish everyone because a few people have a problem with censored content.
1426	4403	2	2	Imagine this: a woman storms into a library and starts throwing a fit about a book being inappropriate, demanding it be removed from the shelves. What would you do? Would you just stand there, wondering if she's lost her mind? Or would you think, “This is a public place, and everyone's entitled to their opinion.” Well, I firmly believe that even if someone deems a library material inappropriate, it shouldn't be taken off the shelves.  Many people do think that some library materials are offensive or inappropriate. And it's no surprise that libraries often feel pressured to remove such materials. But think about it: if everyone started complaining about a book being offensive, there'd soon be no books left in the library! Take, for example, a book I wouldn't want my little brother to read right now because it has a sex scene in one of the chapters. However, as he grows older, he'll be able to understand and process such content. If I got rid of the book, I'd be denying others the chance to enjoy it.  If books about a particular topic were removed just because someone was offended by it, it would definitely upset a lot of people. This applies to any subject matter. The more books we remove from the library, the less people will know about different topics. Eventually, as I've said, there'll be no books at all. Everyone has their own idea of what's appropriate, and those views can vary widely.  The solution is simple: don't remove the books. Sure, you might get complaints, but more often than not, the majority of people aren't offended. Americans do have the right to fight for what they believe, but when the majority isn't bothered, it's a tough battle to win.  I truly believe that all books should stay on the library shelves. If you remove one, you might as well remove them all. The next time you pick up a book and find it offensive, think about others who might want to read it. They might even need the information for a school paper. You never know who might benefit from that knowledge. So, let's not be selfish and keep the books on the library shelves.
1427	4404	2	2	Censorship is a pressing issue in today's world. I think there are times when censorship is necessary, but it also needs to be carefully regulated. That's why I have a great deal of respect for organizations and industries that try to delay or prevent the exposure of certain media until people are more mature and responsible enough to handle it.  In my view, the most problematic areas when it comes to censorship are books and music. Many books are well - written and a joy to read. However, in books related to history, race, and culture, they often use words and terms that are offensive to me and many others.  Music is another major culprit. In today's society, almost everyone has an iPod filled with music. I'm not saying all music is bad, but in many cases, I hear offensive language and discussions about race. Rappers are setting a poor example for young adolescents like me. They pose with guns and are associated with marijuana and crack, all just to gain popularity. This kind of behavior is harmful to our education and makes us think that being a criminal is okay.  On the other hand, I really enjoy magazines that provide true and informative facts from professional reporters. These reporters are on the side of the citizens, trying to get the real facts out there. Magazines also tell us about annual celebrations and positive events happening around the world. You can even find out sports scores and the weather forecast.  Last year, I remember reading 'To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4'. It was extremely controversial, talking about black slaves being treated horribly by whites. It also mentioned how blacks never seemed to win a trial and were treated unfairly. As the only African - American in the class, I felt so embarrassed and awkward. I worried that if we had a class discussion, people would say negative things about the book and then stop when they remembered I was there.  So, what should the world do? Censorship covers a wide range of media, and it's up to the right people to stand up for what's right and wrong for our children and young adolescents. We need to fight against the bad and bring about positive change. As @PERSON1 says, “Don't just hope for a better change or wish for a new world.” If we want change, we have to take action and make a difference.
1428	4405	2	2	I firmly believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive to someone's gender, religion, or race should be removed from library shelves.  When a material is offensive to someone's gender, it can have several negative effects. Firstly, it can make a person feel unworthy. Secondly, it can lead to a large altercation between the author and the offended person, and perhaps involve others as well. Thirdly, just by picking up and reading the text, a person can be harmed.  Materials offensive to someone's religion also need to be removed. Such materials can cause someone to hate everyone of the same religion as the writer, songwriter, actor, or director. A library should be a place of education, fun, and interesting content, not a place to offend someone's religious beliefs. Moreover, this kind of offensive content can even drive a person or a group to act like terrorists.  Materials that offend someone's race should also be taken off the shelves. They might call the race of the reader, listener, or viewer offensive names (even if not directly). They can also portray the race as bad. Additionally, they can influence other kids to disrespect and dislike people of that race.  The library is a place where everyone should be able to read, listen, or watch something interesting without being offended. Therefore, materials that are offensive to anyone's gender, religion, or race should definitely be removed from the library shelves.
1429	4406	2	2	Often, when we go to the library, we're on the hunt for an interesting book or magazine without really knowing what's available. To find something that catches our eye, we have to explore by picking up books, looking at the covers, and reading the background information. Sometimes, we come across a book or magazine that's inappropriate for children, and we wonder why it's still on the library shelves for anyone to pick up. I firmly believe that offensive materials should not be available in public libraries.  For starters, the books on library shelves aren't restricted by age. Libraries are divided into different sections for different genres, but young children may not be aware of these distinctions. There are certain materials in libraries that shouldn't be accessible to the public. For example, if a five - year - old child picks up a book about sex and drugs, it could expose them to information they're not ready for.  Offensive books also give libraries a bad reputation. If someone from out of town visits a library and the first thing they see on the shelves is a book with a naked body or drug - related content, they'll be shocked. Offensive books can include those that we wouldn't want a first - grader to see, as well as books about race or religion. Such books can offend people who hold different beliefs, leading to huge confrontations.  Furthermore, offensive books can express a writer's opinion on a certain topic. If someone with a different opinion reads the book, they'll likely be offended. After all, two people with different views rarely reach an agreement.  In conclusion, although what's offensive to one person may not be to another, we need to be aware of what could cause problems for certain individuals. I believe that books expressing strong opinions and 'x - rated' books should not be kept in public libraries. We can easily solve this problem by creating a separate area for these books, so that people won't be offended.
1430	4407	2	2	What's your take on removing offensive books, music, movies, and magazines? Everyone has a different opinion, and it's an important issue to consider. Just think: would you want your child to come across such content when you're not around? Most people would say no, especially because kids are too young to handle such information.  I firmly believe that offensive materials should be removed from the shelves, and people should be @NUM1 or older to purchase them. The main reason is that kids under @NUM1 often want to look cool like older teenagers, but they don't need to be exposed to this kind of content. Young teenagers think they need to imitate what they see in music, movies, to be cool. They don't think about the consequences and just assume it's okay because older kids are doing it.  When it comes to magazines, movies, and music, age restrictions for purchase are necessary. A lot of kids and young teens think they can access offensive content anywhere. There are different types of places, and some require you to be of a certain age to enter. By removing these offensive materials from the shelves, parents can feel more at ease knowing their children won't accidentally stumble upon them.  I hope that through this persuasive essay, I've been able to relate to someone about the issue of offensive books, music, movies, and magazines. I want people to realize the impact these materials can have on young teens, especially those around the age of @NUM3. And if you take your child with you and they see something offensive, it can be a concerning situation. The points I've made should help you see the importance of dealing with offensive materials on the shelves.
1431	4408	2	2	Should offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be removed from libraries? In my view, the answer is no. In this essay, I will elaborate on my stance and hope to influence others' opinions. I will also explore how the past impacts the present.  In some instances, certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc., may offend a particular race or gender. However, this reflects historical events in [LOCATION1]. Some materials may be highly offensive, but they merely showcase the past, while others may be blatantly racist or sexist. Those that depict the history of [LOCATION1] serve as educational resources, allowing us to learn from past mistakes.  The reason for my opinion is that removing such materials from library shelves is akin to infringing on freedom of speech. Although I dislike music that disrespects women, I won't attempt to have it removed because it might express how the artist loved someone or reflect the family's history.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that these materials should remain on the shelves. After presenting my view, it's important to consider whether something is truly offensive or simply an expression of past memories. If a past event was offensive, it doesn't mean that related materials should be removed. As the saying goes, treat others as you want to be treated. I hope my argument has caught your attention and changed some opinions, as much of today's offense has roots in the past.
1432	4409	2	2	Should there be censorship in libraries? My answer is no. There aren't many 'offensive' or 'harmful' items in most libraries in [LOCATION1]. I find it absurd that such an idea has even emerged.  People can be offended in numerous ways. Recall when we nearly altered the Pledge of Allegiance by removing the word 'god' because some individuals don't believe in God. Now, are we supposed to discard excellent books just because they aren't considered child - friendly by some? Consider all the wonderful books, movies, and magazines that would have to be removed from libraries if one person claims, 'I find this book offensive' or 'I don't think this book is appropriate for my child.' What about those who enjoy that book and will no longer have access to it?  Libraries have sections for a reason. Place the more explicit books in the 18 - and - older section so that younger children won't encounter them. Those advocating for the removal of so - called 'dangerous' books make libraries seem like pornographic shops. Most libraries aren't filled with books that will traumatize children for life. In fact, there aren't that many such books.  Occasionally, an inappropriate book may end up in the kids' section, but that doesn't mean we should remove it permanently. Library workers just need to ensure that books are placed in the correct sections. The adult section should house the explicit books, and the child - friendly books should be in another area. Have library workers monitor the areas to prevent young children from accessing the adult section.  In conclusion, the answer to the question of library censorship is no. There are far too many great books that would be lost forever if we implemented such censorship.
1433	4410	2	2	I firmly believe that all forms of literature, regardless of how offensive they may seem, are valuable. If society decides to remove materials from library shelves because they offend a race or gender, a vast number of books, movies, magazines, and music that offer life lessons would disappear.  Literature exists to transport us to different worlds, impart knowledge, and teach us lessons that the real world may not. If materials are removed out of fear of offending someone, as Katherine Paterson pointed out, the literary landscape would be drastically different. Literature is for our benefit; it educates us, and removing even one piece could cause a stir.  Books are our constant companions when we're bored, lonely, or seeking an escape from reality. Imagine not being able to read your favorite book because it's deemed inappropriate. If all books had to be suitable for every age, they would lose their allure. Whether it's a novel or an encyclopedia, everything would be watered down to meet the standards of a 'non - offending' society. Music would lose its charm, magazines would have nothing to gossip about, movies would become dull, and many aspects of society would deteriorate.  Books, documentaries, and magazines help us learn. For example, if books about the dangers of smoking were removed because they offended smokers, how would today's teens know not to start? Novels, although fictional, bring characters to life. Reading how a character handles a situation can guide real - life decision - making. Important historical books or movies might be removed because some people don't want students to learn about slavery.  If one item is removed from the shelf due to offense, more and more materials will follow. This leaves students uneducated on crucial topics and disrupts the order in libraries. It would also restrict authors from writing freely. Removing materials from library shelves serves no good purpose.  Literature, movies, magazines, and music are essential to society. They keep us company, educate us, and make life easier during tough times. If someone finds a book inappropriate, they can choose not to read it, but they shouldn't decide to remove it for everyone. Removing any material from library shelves is a terrible idea.
1434	4411	2	2	The content in today's media, including books, movies, music, and video games, may not always be suitable for young children. Exposure to such content can be harmful to their well - being, as children absorb their environment and are likely to mimic what they see. Therefore, censoring certain materials is necessary for the health and development of today's youth.  Video games and movies have ratings to guide parents and protect children from inappropriate content. However, books and magazines often lack similar protection. Since age and maturity play a significant role in a child's ability to understand and process information, it's crucial to ensure that they're not exposed to explicit or violent material too early.  Violence in video games is a growing concern. Children who are exposed to violent behavior in games are more likely to become violent themselves. Libraries, as community institutions, should play a role in protecting children by censoring explicit materials in books and magazines before they're made available on the shelves.  From my own experience, I've witnessed children growing up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge. For example, in today's music, although radios and CD labels try to censor explicit content, it's still accessible to children. In games like [CAPS1 of CAPS2] and [NUM1], teens are becoming accustomed to behavior that is neither safe nor beneficial for children.  By censoring inappropriate materials, we can prevent the spread of bad behavior among our youth. This will help create a healthier environment for children to grow and develop.
1435	4412	2	2	I don't think libraries should be responsible for censoring reading materials. When people enter a library, they should understand that, as places of knowledge, libraries may contain information that doesn't align with their beliefs. If someone finds a book offensive, they can simply put it down.  However, there are exceptions. Children's sections should be limited to age - appropriate materials. It's illogical to place '[CAPS2 and CAPS3]' in the children's section, just as it's inappropriate to put '[CAPS4 CAPS5]' in the adult section.  Author [PERSON1] once said that if one person has the right to ban a book from a library, then all patrons would have the same right. This would lead to a situation where no books in the library could be read, and the knowledge they contain would be lost.  There are also exceptions to the general rule. If a library is intended mainly for younger audiences, censorship can be a reasonable measure. Excluding inappropriate materials, such as pornographic reading material, protects children from concepts they may not fully understand.  Considering all these factors, banning books from libraries isn't the best approach. A library should be a place of enlightenment, presenting opposing ideas and allowing readers to form their own opinions. Books are like atoms; when opposing ideas collide, they can generate new insights.
1436	4413	2	2	A library is a place where people of all ages can access books, magazines, music, movies, and more. Libraries are crucial for learning and enhancing reading skills. Research indicates that reading can improve intelligence and comprehension. However, in my view, offensive reading, viewing, or listening materials should not be present in libraries to a certain degree.  As previously mentioned, libraries are for learning and skill - building. Adult - oriented books can be found in adult stores or regular local bookstores. Parents bring their children to the library to support and advance their reading abilities. They shouldn't have to worry about their kids being exposed to inappropriate content.  A few years ago, there was a teenage boy who would visit the library about once a week to look for movies his parents wouldn't approve of. Later, he was caught and punished. If those movies weren't in the library in the first place, his parents wouldn't have had to worry. In many aspects of life, there is inappropriate content. Parents should feel at ease when their kids go to the library. This issue can be resolved by removing such offensive materials.  I firmly believe that library materials should be censored so that those who shouldn't access them can't. On the other hand, religious or cultural learning materials that some people find offensive should remain on the shelves. These materials are for people to learn. For instance, I've seen people want a book about a particular religion removed because they don't support its religious ways. This is wrong as we live in a free country with freedom of religion, and people should be able to inform others about their religion.  Libraries are places where people should feel safe and relaxed. Many enjoy spending hours in the library, immersed in a good novel. Offensive materials have no place in libraries, except when they are for genuine educational purposes.
1437	4414	2	2	The topic of censorship in libraries has been frequently debated. Censorship refers to the rule that prohibits access to books, music, movies, magazines, etc., due to their ratings or inappropriate content for certain viewers or readers. Naturally, people, including myself, have diverse opinions on library censorship.  In my opinion, censorship can be a good idea in some cases, such as for music and movies. However, I oppose book censorship. Children around the world are becoming more advanced readers as time progresses. Libraries often want to censor high - level reading books because they contain profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and other adult - related content. I disagree with this practice as it essentially tells children that they can't challenge themselves or learn about certain topics due to their age.  In my view, these books can only benefit children. They help children understand society, distinguish right from wrong, and contribute to their growth. High - level reading books improve vocabulary and knowledge of literature and history.  When I was in middle school, I wasn't an advanced reader, but I liked to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library to find a challenging book and discovered '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON1. It was a fictional story set during the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. When I tried to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that it was a young - adult book, too advanced for me, and I needed parental consent.  That night, I asked my parents, and they were delighted that I wanted to read such a challenging book and gave their approval. The next day, I brought a note from home, and I was overjoyed when I could finally check out and read the book.  Based on my experience with library censorship, I believe that if a parent or guardian over @NUM1 approves a child or student checking out a book, magazine, or other material, then the child should be allowed to do so.  In conclusion, while book and magazine censorship has some merits, it is generally a mediocre idea. Requiring parental or guardian consent is the best approach. This topic will continue to be debated, and people will hold different opinions. Both sides of the argument have valid points, but I think it's essential to keep censorship out of books and let children read and learn at their highest potential, regardless of the reading level.
1438	4415	2	2	Should offensive materials in libraries be removed from the shelves? I don't think books or other materials should be taken off just because they offend some people. There are several reasons why these materials should stay on the shelves.  One reason is that some people may need these books for school projects. For example, a student might have a project on @CAPS1. A book about @CAPS1 could offend many, but that doesn't mean it should be removed. If the only book a student needs for a project is taken off the shelf due to offense, they could fail a class.  Another reason is that whether a book is offensive is a matter of personal opinion. Just because some people don't like a book and find it offensive doesn't mean others don't want to read it. Why remove a book from the shelf because it offends a few? There could be many more people who want to check it out.  If a book offends someone, they can simply ignore it. I don't understand why libraries would remove a book just because it offends someone when that person can easily pay no attention to it.  In conclusion, there's no point in removing books from the shelves. People need them for research and projects. Offense is a matter of personal opinion, and it's easier for people to ignore offensive books than to have them removed.
1439	4416	2	2	Is @CAPS1 justified in removing censorship in libraries? This is a highly opinionated topic, as some people want all censored items out of public areas, while others enjoy reading such materials.  In my opinion, libraries are places where I go to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax with a magazine. They are public areas, and not everyone will agree on what should be available. Everyone has their favorite books and genres. I believe @CAPS1 is unjust in removing censorship in libraries because a censored genre might be someone's favorite. Why should libraries limit choices when other places don't? For example, many parents might want clothing stores to ban holey jeans because they are revealing, but stores don't do this as many teenage girls like them. Similarly, American @CAPS2 won't ban capris just because I don't like them. People have different preferences and opinions.  A great solution to this disagreement is categorization. By placing all censored books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, @CAPS1 can reduce arguments. People who like censored materials can be in that area, while those who don't want them don't have to be exposed.  There's no reason to remove someone's favorite genre just because others don't like it. If we did so, there would be nothing left as not everyone likes the same thing. For example, I don't like blue Aeropostale shirts, but my friend @CAPS3 does. If we both ask the manager to remove the colors we don't like, both colors will be gone, which is senseless.  In conclusion, those in charge should categorize materials in libraries and stores to meet the community's diverse preferences. Removing materials is not the answer; categorization should be implemented immediately.
1440	4417	2	2	In today's society, young children are exposed to a large amount of materials that many adults didn't encounter during their childhood. Certain television shows, books, and popular songs promote behaviors that many @CAPS1 oppose. Although libraries may seem an unlikely place for such materials, many young children can check out age - inappropriate books. Censorship of offensive or inappropriate materials like books, movies, and music can teach children that real life is different from what the media portrays.  One important reason to support library material censorship is that it's often difficult to tell what a book contains. Many children and adults pick books based on their covers or titles. While most library books are age - appropriate, a child can still select an inappropriate one. Children are influenced by the media and their peers, and library censorship can make it a safer place for them to choose books from the appropriate sections. As author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 should not have to worry about what their children access in a public library.  Another reason is that video stores already practice censorship. They have ratings for movies and video games and separate sections for adult - content materials. Minors can't access adult - rated movies or video games without proper authorization. The same censorship model should be applied to libraries. Having separate sections for adult - content books and movies can prevent children from accidentally renting inappropriate materials. This type of censorship also gives parents control over what their children access. For example, a 16 - year - old boy can't rent an @CAPS2 - rated movie alone, but if his @CAPS1 approve, they can rent it for him.  Perhaps the most crucial reason for library censorship is to prevent children's early exposure to inappropriate materials. Many young children are influenced by the media to think that underage drinking, drug use, and early sexual activity are acceptable. Allowing children to follow this path is risky and can lead to various problems, as evidenced by the recent increase in drunk - driving accidents involving underage drinkers. Censorship in libraries can restrict the ideas children are exposed to and help them lead safer and healthier lives.  In conclusion, the difficulty in identifying appropriate materials, the existing censorship in video stores, and the need to prevent early exposure all point to the necessity of library censorship. While some may view this as a restriction of freedom of speech, it is actually beneficial for society as it creates a safer environment for children to grow up in.
1441	4418	2	2	Is it okay for library books to be offensive? We people don't get to decide whether to remove a book based on our opinions. If someone doesn't like a book, just don't pick it next time. I'm sure we shouldn't have the right to take books out of libraries. It's not up to us to make that call.  I know sometimes people find things wrong or inappropriate in library books. But if it's not to your taste, stop reading or don't recommend it to a friend. I've had this problem before. I went to borrow a book, and my mom said she didn't like the topic. Well, that's just her opinion. Everyone has the right to their own views, but it shouldn't affect others.  One person in @MONTH1 really loves a book, while another hates it. Obviously, there are people who enjoy that kind of book, so there's no good reason to get rid of it. Only the librarian should have a say in removing a book. They know what's suitable for the library. If a book has something graphic or racist, you can talk to them calmly because they can't read every single book in the library.  Some things might offend some people but not others. The library is for knowledge and fun. We can have opinions and discuss them properly without making a big fuss because there might be reasons for things being the way they are. We should leave the decision to the person who knows about it, the one in charge of the library.
1442	4419	2	2	Censorship has been a long - standing issue in society, being both unnecessary and unconstitutional. As citizens, we are guaranteed certain rights by the documents that maintain social order. If the right to choose what literature to read, watch, or listen to is taken away, it will have a detrimental impact on our country. Censorship should not be permitted in the present - day context.  In the @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @ORGANIZATION1, we are granted specific rights, including freedom of speech and the press. However, these rights have been restricted, which is contrary to the government's stance but still occurring. We may not have completely lost these rights, but their scope has definitely been constricted. If the government, which is supposed to serve the people, can dictate what we read, there is a risk that it may further control other aspects of our lives, such as what we wear, drink, or eat.  Censorship in libraries is a significant problem. There are numerous reasons why written literature should not be censored. For example, if a college student is writing a research paper on the effects of rape on a child, but the government deems the topic 'too graphic', the student's educational process will be severely hindered. By censoring libraries and removing books, the government is impeding the education of the country's youth.  Some classic works are also facing censorship. The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2, a well - known classic used in classrooms across the country, has recently had its availability questioned. Although the 'n - word' is used in the novel, it was more common and had a less severe meaning during the time of its writing. Removing it from libraries and curriculums due to the change in its modern meaning is an unlawful form of censorship.  Censorship is not limited to written literature. Movies and music are also subject to it. Movie ratings are intended to help parents self - censor for their children, but it should not be the government's role to decide what a child can watch. Parents have the right to expose or protect their children as they see fit.  Music, an integral part of modern society, is also facing increasing censorship. With the popularity of new music styles among teenagers, which often include themes of sex, drugs, and money, the music industry is under pressure. However, it is not appropriate for the government to censor music as it restricts the freedom of expression.  In conclusion, censorship is morally and legally wrong. It violates the rights of citizens and hinders the educational and cultural development of society. We should oppose censorship to preserve our freedoms and access to knowledge.
1443	4420	2	2	The question of whether certain materials in libraries, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed if deemed offensive is a prominent topic of debate. Despite the potential harm of some materials to children, freedom of information is more important than protection, as censorship is unconstitutional, restricts a comprehensive perspective, and conceals pressing societal issues.  The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 stipulates that freedom of speech, religion, and the press shall not be denied or abridged, effectively granting freedom of expression. Censorship is unconstitutional as it restricts this freedom. Students and scholars cannot access all available information due to censorship. While private businesses and libraries may have the right to censor based on their contracts, public libraries and schools violate the constitution when they engage in censorship.  Censorship prevents individuals from obtaining a complete perspective on an issue. Censors often ban books based on personal views of 'immorality'. Without access to all information, it is impossible to draw valid conclusions. For example, if one wishes to learn the difference between agnostic and deist philosophies but cannot access agnostic books banned by intolerant religious groups, learning is severely hampered. Every special - interest group wants to ban certain materials. As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone has the right to remove books they dislike, there will be no books left.  Many books addressing significant societal problems are banned. @PERSON3's @CAPS7 @NUM1, which deals with censorship and the dangers of technology, was ironically censored. This may be a means for censors to protect their own interests. Similarly, @PERSON2's @CAPS9 @CAPS10 was banned. Despite revealing important human truths, it was removed due to vulgar language and its portrayal of certain events.  Censorship is not limited to written literature. Movies and music are also affected. Movie ratings are for parental guidance, but it is not the government's place to decide what a child can watch. Parents have the right to make such decisions. In the music industry, with the changing styles and themes, censorship is becoming more severe, which restricts the freedom of expression.  In conclusion, censorship is a serious problem that undermines the rights and education of individuals. It should be opposed to ensure the free flow of information and the development of a well - informed society.
1444	4421	2	2	I believe that children are our future, and that's why censorship in libraries is a big deal to me. It affects not only my children but also what I and everyone else can read. While I agree that censorship is an important issue, we need to figure out where to draw the line.  In my view, most materials should stay on the library shelves. I understand that some level of censorship might be necessary, but we shouldn't take a book out just because it has a bad word. Just because a book is a classic doesn't mean we should remove it from a public library. Adults usually want to read more complex books, so there should be a good selection of such materials.  However, I think there are some books that should be kept out of libraries, like extremely racist books. These books are a danger to our children. Younger kids might act out what they hear or read, especially from audio books, and get in trouble for things they don't understand.  Instead of completely banning books, there are alternatives to keep inappropriate materials away from children. Public libraries already separate adult and children's books. We could also move these sections to opposite sides of the library and put more explicit books on higher shelves where kids can't reach.  These are my thoughts and ideas on library censorship. I know they might be different from what most people think, but I believe they're good solutions. Separating sections for kids and adults and placing explicit books higher up are practical ways to balance access to information and protect children.
1445	4422	2	2	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all forms of self - expression. We have the freedom to @ORGANIZATION1 our feelings and thoughts, but sometimes the content can be too graphic for some people. I believe that censorship in libraries is necessary to protect the minds of children and those who are easily influenced.  I've seen how books can impact children. Many kids love reading books or comic books with a lot of violence. Their minds are like sponges, soaking up everything they read, which can influence their daily behavior.  When it comes to music, I remember going into a music store and seeing all the different types. In my school, @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 is a very popular rapper. His songs often talk about drugs, sex, money, and violence. I've only listened to a few of his songs, and every time, one of these four topics comes up. Many teens in my school think that if their favorite artist can do these things, they can too.  The movie industry is also following a similar trend. Students in my school often talk about comedy movies like '@ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS1', '@CAPS2' and how they try to imitate the movie characters during @DATE1 or @DATE2 breaks. These movies are funny, but they can have a bad influence on those who are easily swayed.  Books, music, movies, and magazines surround us with the stories and thoughts of others. We do have the right to @ORGANIZATION1 ourselves, but we also have the responsibility to protect the minds of others. I think that censorship in libraries for certain materials is a good way to prevent the spread of harmful content. In conclusion, while we value freedom of expression, we must also ensure that it doesn't endanger the well - being of others, especially the vulnerable minds of children and the easily influenced.
1446	4423	2	2	I firmly believe that any offensive content should be removed from the shelves as it is inappropriate. Books are meant to be a source of enjoyment and learning. While a small amount of violence in an action - adventure book can help set the mood of the character and the story, offensive books, in general, can be a problem. For instance, comedy magazines or books that mock something or someone can be taken offensively. Many people, like parents and friends, are concerned that such books can teach children the wrong things. Young children's brains are highly receptive, and they tend to remember what they learn from books. Since offensive content is already prevalent on television and in daily conversations, kids don't need to be exposed to it through books. Instead, they should have access to educational books that can prepare them for higher grade levels, introducing them to new words and grammar. Therefore, offensive books should be removed from the shelves to ensure a proper learning environment for children.
1447	4424	2	2	I think books that are too vulgar for young children, especially those dealing with sex or violence, should be taken off the shelves. Only appropriate content should be available. Publishers shouldn't create such books or magazines unless they can keep them hidden from people under the age of @NUM2. However, people often do as they please. In conclusion, to protect the well - being of young children, age - appropriate content should be strictly enforced on the shelves.
1448	4425	2	2	Katherine Paterson made a valid point when she said that some books might be too offensive for certain readers. However, this does not mean these books should not be read. Throughout our lives, we encounter things we dislike, but it is beneficial to be exposed to them. Libraries should have the right to offer all types of books without public censorship. In the @CAPS1, we have faced numerous challenges such as @CAPS2, racism, and extreme poverty. We often repeat past mistakes due to a lack of knowledge. Slavery and other dark moments in @CAPS1's history were gruesome, and recalling these memories through books is necessary to prevent repetition. The same principle applies to movies, music, and magazines. These forms of media cover current news and social aspects of life. Music is a form of self - expression, and everyone has different tastes. Limiting the variety of music styles is unfair. Music can express emotions and teach life lessons. Some artists share their life stories, which can educate others about the consequences of certain actions. Magazines cover current topics like politics, jobs, and young adults' lifestyles, and movies also have their own important topics. No group of citizens has the right to censor these materials. The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, and censoring what people read violates an author's right to express themselves. Although Katherine Paterson had a valid point, censoring books and other media is unfair and goes against the principles of free speech.
1449	4426	2	2	There are certain things in the world that are not suitable for children, such as @CAPS1 - rated movies, @CAPS2 books, alcohol, and @CAPS2 music. While people have the right to view what they want, it is the parents' decision whether a @CAPS4 can watch a rated @CAPS1 movie, not the storekeeper's. However, storekeepers should have the right to enforce age limits. For example, if a storekeeper allows a @CAPS4 to buy a movie with violence and the @CAPS4 then copies the actions in real life, it could have serious consequences. If there were no age limit on drinking, a group of @NUM1 - year - olds with driver's licenses could buy beer and drive, endangering lives. Teenagers often make impulsive decisions without considering the consequences. Therefore, there should be age limits on certain items like @CAPS1 - rated movies, alcohol, guns, and knives. This would help protect the well - being of children and prevent potential harm.
1450	4427	2	2	Historically, libraries were places for study. Before the era of computers, people had to visit libraries to look up information in educational books. But now, one might wonder if libraries are still used for their original purpose or if they have become a place where people are exposed to inappropriate materials. A library should be a peaceful place for work and a source of educational resources. However, today, people can be tempted to look at inappropriate books, play games on the computer, or check out materials related to pornography, drugs, alcohol, etc. I personally witnessed a young child pick up a porn magazine at the library, and his mother had to quickly take it away. The library should not expose young children to such materials. The music available in the library can also be bad, and children might get hooked on it. The world's influence on library content is significant, as teenagers are often interested in topics like drugs, sex, and scandals. But a library is a community building, and it's easy for people to access vulgar materials. These materials can have a negative impact on the youth's thoughts. Women and children often find such materials offensive. Therefore, libraries should be a safe place for study, and the content should be more strictly censored to prevent inappropriate exposure.
1451	4428	2	2	A library card is something kids eagerly anticipate. It's often a child's first form of personal identification that they can carry independently. This card unlocks a vast realm of entertainment and stories, transporting one to any place imaginable. Once a child has a library card, they can borrow any book from the extensive collection in the library. However, the issue arises of preventing young children from accessing books, movies, or magazines with inappropriate adult content. A solution to this problem is necessary to shield people from unwanted material in various entertainment sources.  Today's libraries typically have a dedicated children's section filled with picture books and short stories. The rest of the library contains books and other materials sorted mainly by author and genre. To understand what an item is about, one usually has to flip through the pages or read the back cover for plot hints. This can be risky as not all materials provide a detailed summary.  I once rented a movie expecting a scary thriller about a trailer - park killer. Instead, it was disturbing due to multiple uncensored sex scenes in the first few minutes. I was shocked as there was no warning. I firmly believe that such items should either be placed in a separate area or come with a summary of the offensive content. Libraries could collect viewer comments, allowing people to read others' opinions before borrowing an item. This would help in making an informed decision.  Another effective approach is to rate materials, similar to movie ratings in theaters. A specific rating would alert viewers or readers to potentially offensive or inappropriate content. Libraries could also set age ranges based on these ratings, preventing under - age individuals from borrowing certain books. Ratings would safeguard children and others from being exposed to offensive materials.  Libraries house a wide variety of materials on countless subjects, offering both educational and entertaining experiences, but also containing inappropriate items. I advocate that offensive materials should either be segregated or rated to warn people. Viewer comments can also be a valuable addition. Libraries are wonderful places full of stories and adventures, and they should not be contaminated with offensive and inappropriate content.
1452	4429	2	2	I find it hard to understand why someone would be offended by a book they choose to read. In my view, there should be very few reasons for a person to be offended by a book written for the general public.  It's true that some books may contain offensive words or actions. However, unless these are directed at the reader or intentionally used to cause offense, it's just a book. Many history books, for example, use language and actions from the past to depict the era accurately. Authors rarely write books to put someone down; instead, they use offensive elements to set the tone and inform readers about the past.  Music is a different matter. Rap music, in particular, often uses offensive language as rappers express their personal experiences. I personally don't mind it as it usually reflects their own lives. On the positive side, calm and soothing music can help people relax. Whether music is offensive or not depends largely on the individual's reaction.  Magazines, in my opinion, are the worst. They tend to be either extremely negative or overly positive about a person or group. A major problem is that they often report based on what they hear or want to hear, without knowing the full story. This increases the likelihood of being offensive. Although magazines do have positive aspects, they always seem to include a harsh negative element.  In conclusion, I believe there's nothing wrong with libraries. There will always be positives and negatives, but libraries generally focus on the positive. If a book seems offensive, one can simply choose not to read it. With music, pick what you like, and if you're easily offended, avoid certain types. Libraries offer the opportunity to discover enjoyable things, and people should be able to use their judgment to avoid offensive materials.
1453	4430	2	2	Picture your favorite book, song, and movie - the ones you can watch, listen to, or read over and over again. You keep checking them out from the library because you love them so much. Now, imagine they're gone from the library shelves. You initially think they're just checked out, but later find they've been removed because someone found them offensive. What can you do?  Libraries are known for their vast selection of books and other materials, allowing people of all ages to choose what interests them. This is one of the main reasons libraries are so popular. If libraries start removing offensive items, many people will no longer be able to find the things they enjoy.  I firmly believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and libraries should accommodate as many people as possible. While removing certain materials might please some, it would also deprive many others of the items they love.  Libraries should not remove offensive items from the shelves. Doing so would reduce the available material for people of all ages. If you find something offensive, simply don't borrow it. As Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Removing items would mean less for others to enjoy.  Taking materials off the shelves is unfair to all readers. Everyone has a favorite book or movie. If someone disagrees with a particular item and has it removed, it not only prevents you from enjoying it but also takes away the chance for other readers to form their own opinions.  People have different ideas about what is offensive. Some may think certain books are too racy, while others don't. Consider a popular children's book like [book name]. To some, it's a great book. But if someone finds it too serious or offensive for young readers and has it removed, new readers will never get to know it or form their own opinions.  I believe that library censorship is an extreme expression of personal opinion. It's normal to disagree with others about music, movies, etc. Removing materials from the shelves is unfair. If everyone removed their least - favorite books and replaced them with their favorites, libraries would only cater to a specific audience. Libraries are meant to satisfy the diverse interests of everyone.  In conclusion, removing offensive items is unfair and would create more problems. If censorship occurs, people may lose interest in the library as the wide selection is what makes it great. Censorship implies that some people's opinions are more important than others'. Before having an item removed, one should think about how they'd feel if their favorite things were taken away. After all, what one person finds offensive may be someone else's favorite.
1454	4431	2	2	Everyone has books they don't like or approve of. Imagine if your child brought home one of those books from the library.  In my opinion, when it comes to library censorship, if you don't like a book, don't read it. I think libraries should have separate children's and adult sections. This way, parents won't have to worry about their children getting inappropriate books. If a child wants a book from the adult section, they should be accompanied by a parent. This ensures that children won't bring home books their parents don't approve of.  For adults, if you don't like a book, just skip it. There may be other readers who enjoy it and don't want it removed. They can't use the excuse of protecting their children, as children need parental permission to borrow adult - section books anyway.  I believe this approach would make it easier for all readers to enjoy the library. They won't have to worry about picking books they dislike or that their parents won't approve of. In this way, libraries can better serve the diverse needs of all users.
1455	4432	2	2	I firmly believe that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries. Instead, they can be placed in a separate part of the library, away from non - offensive materials.  If these offensive materials are removed, kids will face difficulties in learning the truth. Book publishers often present a filtered version of events, leaving out important details. Without access to offensive materials, many kids may end up sitting idle at home or causing trouble. From my personal experience, I enjoyed reading, listening to, and watching such materials. So, if someone doesn't like them, they should simply avoid them and teach their children to do the same.  Overall, I think offensive materials should be kept in libraries. If people still complain, they can be moved to a separate room or area. This would solve the problem of kids accessing such content while still allowing those who want to engage with it to do so. Libraries should offer a wide range of materials to meet the diverse interests of users, and offensive materials can also have educational and cultural value.
1456	4433	2	2	Those who oppose censorship should either be parents or responsible individuals. Censorship is, in fact, inevitable and should not be a matter of contention. If one does not wish to read a magazine, a book, or watch a movie, they simply need not do so. Every day, countless people avoid such content if they find it unappealing, yet many others do read and watch materials that might be considered inappropriate. It is a matter of personal choice, and one can avoid exposure if they so desire. Those against censorship should find ways to protect their children or themselves from such content, but they should not attempt to eliminate it entirely.  One reason for allowing uncensored content is that it offers a wealth of information and broadens one's perspective in various ways. Whether to engage with the material, good or bad, is a personal decision. In my view, some of this content can be beneficial for children, not to corrupt them, but to expand their imagination. However, children should reach a certain age and level of maturity before accessing such content, so they can distinguish between reality and fiction. Additionally, it can teach valuable lessons that might not be learned elsewhere. Many of these materials are based on real - life events and current affairs. It is beneficial for both children and adults to be aware of what is happening in the world. If children are kept in the dark, they are deprived of the opportunity to form their own opinions. Parents can tell their children that something is bad, but true understanding often comes from personal experience. Children are capable of making their own decisions, and they usually choose what is best for them.  Another reason is that uncensored content can serve as an escape for some individuals. There are people who enjoy reading about fictional or unconventional aspects of life. It helps them get through their daily lives. One can never fully understand what others enjoy. If someone is having a bad day and wants to read or watch their preferred content but is unable to do so, they are likely to be extremely frustrated. I, for one, would be angry or depressed if I were restricted from doing what I like. This is not always a controversial topic. If parents wish to shield their children from such content, that is their choice. However, those who can handle it do not want it to be removed from public access. Libraries should continue to carry such materials. If parents are concerned, they can choose not to give their children library passes. And if they do, they should supervise their children at the library. Borrowing books from the library is cost - effective, and those who cannot afford to buy books or do not wish to own them should not be deprived of the opportunity to access them, as long as proper measures are taken to protect those who need it.  Finally, uncensored content maintains people's interest and imparts a great deal of knowledge. It not only entertains but also enriches one's vocabulary. I have personally learned a significant amount from books, and I rarely had to pay for them. When one cannot afford to buy all the books they want, the library provides a valuable resource. Those who find certain content offensive can simply avoid it. No one is forcing them to access these materials, and it is not their place to dictate what others can see. If people truly want to read such content, they will find a way. Banning books from one place will not eliminate the issue of censorship. Children are already exposed to such content in school and on television. To understand the real world, they need to learn more than just appropriate material. Censorship can be seen as good, bad, or neutral. Everyone should have the freedom to make their own decisions. Constant complaining will only lead to more disputes. We should accept that some things are inevitable and respect individual choices.
1457	4434	2	2	I firmly believe that censored books should not be removed from the shelves. People have diverse preferences when it comes to music, books, movies, magazines, and other forms of media. If a reader dislikes a book, they will stop reading it. Similarly, if a listener does not enjoy rap music, they will switch to a different genre. This is all about personal opinion and choice. If it were up to me, I would support the availability of censored materials. I prefer to experience things in their entirety. I want to feel the authenticity of a song or the intensity of a character's emotions in a book. I do not want to see a bunch of asterisks replacing censored words; I want to see the actual word and feel its full impact.  Currently, I am reading the highly controversial book “*@CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1*”. As you may know, the author of this book is @PERSON1. One of the most controversial aspects of this book is the use of the “@CAPS2 - word”. Throughout most of the book, the author does not refer to people of color as “black” or “colored” but uses the “@CAPS2 - word”. In today's society, this is widely regarded as extremely racist. However, in @LOCATION1's time, this term was commonly used in his social context. While it was still a form of discrimination, it was not as controversial as it is today. Many critics and readers now believe that this book should not be available in libraries or read at all. I disagree. I understand that the author used the word because it was a part of the language of his era. Removing this word from the book would mean losing a part of the history of the old South.  People have the right to freedom of speech, whether in written or verbal form. I admit that I sometimes use censored words, especially when I am angry. Since people cannot control what others say, they should not be able to control what others write or sing either. On the other hand, I can understand why some people oppose the use of censored words. They may not want their children to use such words in school. However, it is unrealistic to protect children from these words as they are prevalent in video games, movies, and most books. We cannot control what others do or say; it is their right to express themselves. In conclusion, censored materials should remain accessible, as they are an important part of free expression and historical representation.
1458	4435	2	2	I am of the opinion that censorship in libraries is unjust for several reasons. Firstly, all the books and content that a public library makes available to the community should be accessible to everyone. Secondly, what one person deems inappropriate may not be so for another. Lastly, an author has the right to express themselves freely in their book without the fear of their work being removed from the shelves of public libraries.  My first reason for opposing censorship is that library content should be open to the community. For instance, if a student needs to conduct research on the treatment of black slaves in history, they might be unable to find relevant books in the library because someone considered such books offensive to black people. As a result, the student will have to look elsewhere for information, and there is a risk of finding inaccurate or unreliable data. This shows that censorship in libraries can hinder the pursuit of knowledge.  The second reason is that personal notions of offensiveness are subjective. One person's opinion should not limit another person's choices. It is unfair for the view of one individual or a group to restrict what others can access in the library. Censorship could lead to the removal of a person's favorite book series from the library simply because some people found it offensive.  Finally, an author has the right to express their thoughts and feelings in their book as they see fit. Sometimes, the content that might be considered offensive is crucial for making the book more descriptive and engaging. It helps the reader better understand the story and its context.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not right. If we continue to censor library materials, there will be very few books left for us to read. These are the reasons that support my opinion on this matter.
1459	4436	2	2	Under no circumstances should books be removed from the shelves. Books are an integral part of most people's daily lives. Whether used for educational purposes or entertainment, they serve a valuable function and are always helpful.  People have different tastes and interests in music, books, movies, and magazines. If a reader dislikes a book, they will stop reading it. Similarly, if a listener does not enjoy a particular type of music, they will switch to something else. This is all about personal choice. For many, books are a wonderful way to spend their free time. They not only help in learning but also offer solace during difficult times. For most people, books are like a whole world, and without them, they would be at a loss. No one should be allowed to take away something that is important to others, even if it might be offensive to some.  All books have a purpose and a message. Authors invest their time and effort in writing and publishing books because they want to share a story, whether it is positive or negative. The stories are clearly significant to the authors, and they are also important to the readers who appreciate their work. Authors should not be penalized just because someone is offended by what they have written. If people are offended, they can simply avoid the books written by that particular author. There are numerous books and many different authors to choose from. They should not target specific authors just because they do not share the same taste as others.  There are countless books in the world, and it is inevitable that some will offend someone. If we remove every book that offends people, there will be very few books left. Books are essential for education and for most people's daily lives. We will miss out on the new ideas and perspectives that authors present if we keep removing books due to offense.  In conclusion, books must remain on the shelves. They are important to everyone, whether they admit it or not. Without books, people would not have achieved the progress they have today.
1460	4437	2	2	Libraries should implement censorship for some of the materials they offer to the public. This is crucial because children can easily access offensive content. Censorship in libraries is necessary to prevent children from being influenced by inappropriate materials.  Libraries do not need to discard the offensive materials they remove from the general shelves. A viable solution is to move them to an adult - only section. This way, libraries do not incur any financial losses, and they can keep the youth away from content that is not suitable for them. There is no valid reason to provide unrestricted access to materials that may be offensive to others.  However, I also recognize that there are a few reasons why people might need access to offensive materials. For example, someone might require a book that contains offensive content for research purposes, but if all such books are removed, they will face difficulties. I believe that the decision to remove materials from the shelves should depend on the degree of offensiveness.  Although I am somewhat conflicted on this issue, there are strong reasons to move offensive materials away from the general shelves. Such content is not appropriate for the young people in our country, and they should not have easy access to it. We should censor library materials to ensure that no one is negatively affected. In conclusion, while there are valid concerns on both sides, the protection of the youth from inappropriate content should be a priority, and libraries should take appropriate measures to achieve this.
1461	4438	2	2	My name is @CAPS3, and I firmly believe that books, magazines, and other reading materials should not be removed from library shelves. Books are invaluable tools that enhance people's reading skills and concentration. In my experience, the more books available, the better, as they have always been a source of entertainment and knowledge. Without them, we would lack a clear understanding of the past and the events that have shaped our world.  Each book has a unique story with engaging details that captivate readers. I cannot fathom a world without books, as they have been a significant part of my life. It is disheartening to think that after encouraging us to read as children, @CAPS5 now wants to get rid of these precious resources.  Magazines also offer a wealth of information about our society and the way we live. They contribute to our knowledge and understanding of the world. Reading equips us with the skills to perform certain tasks and make informed decisions. I recall disliking reading as a child, but as I grew older, it became an integral part of my life, opening up new opportunities and perspectives.  One of my favorite books is the @CAPS6. Although @CAPS5 may seem inappropriate at times, it holds a deeper meaning that resonates with readers. We must preserve these stories and keep the tradition of reading alive. I will not stand by and watch as the things we love are taken away.  I have a profound love for books and am deeply saddened by the thought of their disappearance. These books have accompanied us since childhood, and it is our responsibility to maintain their legacy. Reading is not only a source of enjoyment but also a means of clearing our minds and expanding our horizons. Thanks to reading, I am able to express my support for these books and advocate for their preservation.  Removing books would have a devastating impact on our country, states, cities, schools, and reading clubs. I earnestly request that @CAPS5 refrain from removing our books. By doing so, you will not only make me happy but also bring joy to countless readers. Thank you for considering my plea, and I wish you a pleasant day.
1462	4439	2	2	Materials in libraries that some may consider 'offensive' should be retained, despite the potential to offend certain individuals. If people are bothered by the lack of censorship in libraries, they should re - evaluate the situation. These so - called 'offensive' materials can be appropriate for those who are ready to engage with them. Individuals who do not wish to be exposed to such materials can simply avoid them. Parents, in particular, should monitor their children when they visit the library.  Some books, movies, and other library resources are being labeled as inappropriate. However, many of these materials have educational value and should not be removed from libraries just because they may be too crude, vulgar, or adult - oriented for younger audiences. It is the parents' responsibility to ensure that their children do not come across content that is deemed unsuitable.  A significant portion of the content in libraries that is currently considered inappropriate and in need of censorship actually has educational value. There are books and movies based on true stories that parents may label as 'not suitable for children'. Nevertheless, this does not mean that libraries should remove these materials from their shelves.  Censorship in libraries should remain at its current level. If censorship increases, there will be very few, if any, books left on the shelves for anyone to access. Some people may label certain materials as inappropriate, but these can be valuable learning resources. Parents should take an active role in guiding their children in the library to prevent them from encountering content that they find unacceptable.  Libraries are a source of knowledge, and the materials within them are the result of the efforts of many authors. Removing these resources would deprive people of the right to access information that should be available in a library. By maintaining the current level of censorship, those who wish to read or view these stories and movies can do so without having to purchase them. Parents who are concerned about inappropriate materials can either avoid the library or closely monitor their children during library visits.
1463	4440	2	2	I envision a world where books are freely available, not one where a large number of books are banned for various reasons. This is why I firmly believe that censorship in libraries is unjust. There are three main reasons for this view. Firstly, people have the right to access any information they desire. Secondly, no one has the power to deprive others of the opportunity to gain knowledge. Lastly, all information has value and cannot be classified as 'bad'.  Assuming we are discussing censorship in @CAPS1 libraries, I believe that banning books or censoring materials is unconstitutional. Censoring books is like blinding the reader; they cannot perceive the true nature and intended purpose of the material.  If the discussion includes foreign countries, I think humans do not have the right to influence what others read. In an ideal world, all countries would guarantee equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender. People should be able to see things as they are. Whether something is offensive or not, it is up to the individual to decide whether to read or listen.  This leads me to my final point: no information is bad information. Even if it is profane or offensive, there is always a meaning behind it. Rappers like @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 have songs with deep meanings, whether they are personal experiences or messages to the public.  Books can also be misjudged. For example, @CAPS4 for @LOCATION2 by @ORGANIZATION1 has been banned by some school libraries due to graphic scenes. However, the real message of the book is about guilt, grief, and redemption. Another well - known book, The @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 by @PERSON1, a coming - of - age story about a boy, has also been banned from school libraries.  In conclusion, I do not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries. No one has the authority to do so because there is always meaning within these works. Authors write stories and create music with a purpose, and by banning them, we are taking away people's opportunities for growth and learning.
1464	4441	2	2	Censorship is crucial, especially in libraries. I believe that every individual has the right to an opinion. If a particular book, magazine, movie, or other library material is offensive to someone or a group of people, they should consult an official with the authority to decide what stays on the shelves.  In our world, there are numerous minorities, racial groups, and political groups, such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Despite their differences, they all share one thing: the right to express their voices. Some people may find certain library materials offensive, while others, like me, believe that if there is a problem, one should contact the appropriate person. It is not appropriate for an individual to demand the removal of material just because they find it offensive. What is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another, and this is related to the concept of freedom of speech.  While everyone has the right to voice their concerns, they do not have the privilege to act on their opposing views at will. We all agree that inappropriate material should not be displayed in libraries, especially for the sake of children. Therefore, libraries should seriously consider designating specific areas for adult - only access. This is a good solution for worried officials, adults, and parents, as it can prevent children from being exposed to inappropriate content.
1465	4442	2	2	A few months ago, I went to the local library in search of the perfect book. After an hour of looking, I finally made a choice and was quite pleased when I checked it out. However, as I started reading, I encountered sexual content, drug abuse references, and vulgar language. As a teenager, I do not want or need to be exposed to such inappropriate material, and no one should. This experience has convinced me that censorship in libraries is essential.  Just as one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket for a rated - @CAPS1 movie due to sexual content, drug abuse, and vulgar language, the same standards should apply to books, magazines, and music. @CAPS2 literature is inappropriate for all ages and serves no real purpose. The world exposes children to this kind of literature and then acts surprised when children end up in jails, gangs, or other terrible situations.  Our society has set its standards too low, and today's children are following in our footsteps. Author Katherine Paterson once said, '...if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right so does everyone else.' This quote highlights the influence people have on future generations.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and this is mine. As a regular newspaper reader, I can no longer stay silent. I am part of a generation that is being negatively affected by the world, and the first step to change is to raise the standards. We need to protect future generations by censoring what children can be exposed to.  If libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from their shelves, the situation will improve. The next time I go to the library to find the perfect book, I hope to have a better experience, free from inappropriate content.
1466	4443	2	2	Everyone holds a distinct view on censorship. Some individuals believe that, under certain circumstances, censorship is entirely acceptable, while others oppose it. Personally, I am of the opinion that there are instances where censorship is necessary. Schools possess the right to censor the materials available in their libraries for students, particularly magazines. Some magazines contain articles that are inappropriate for school hours or the school environment. Schools would not want inappropriate content on their shelves where students can access it. This need for censorship is even more pronounced in elementary schools, where younger students' libraries should be more closely monitored. Younger children, such as those in elementary school, lack the discernment to determine what is suitable for them to read. In public libraries, the situation is somewhat different. Parents can typically oversee what their children borrow. Most adults know to read the book's summary to understand its content. If the summary is unclear, they can read a few pages inside. I once visited the public library and borrowed a book I thought was a suspense novel. However, when I started reading at home, I realized it was a romance novel, which I was not interested in. So, I returned it to the library. Often, the synopsis on the back of the book does not reveal much, so it is advisable to read a few pages before borrowing. Everyone is entitled to their opinion on censorship. I firmly believe that in some cases, materials available for borrowing should be censored. In other instances, it should be left to adults and parents to decide what their children can borrow.
1467	4444	2	2	If one person has a right to something, it is only fair that others have the same right. It would be unjust, for example, to have six kids in a room and give cookies to only three of them without any reason. Similarly, if one person wants a book and another person wants the same book, the latter has every right to obtain it, and there is little one can say to dissuade them. I understand the feeling of not having the same rights as others. One time, my teacher gave a piece of gum to my friend for no reason, and I was upset because I didn't receive one. I thought that if he got gum without a reason, the rest of us should too. As I've said, if you grant a right to one person, you should extend it to others. However, I can understand that if three people are involved in a fight, and one is just a bystander, that person does not deserve to go to jail. The two physically fighting, on the other hand, should face the consequences. The bystander also does not have the right to keep videos of the fight and should receive a ticket. In conclusion, equal rights should be the norm, but there are situations where the circumstances determine who should be held accountable.
1468	4445	2	2	When I learned about the censorship issues in some libraries, I pondered the significance of censoring movies, disks, books, and magazines. I firmly believe that children should be shielded from vulgar language, whether heard or read. Books with inappropriate pictures are also unsuitable for young eyes. Libraries should devise a solution. One approach could be to create age - specific sections. When patrons remove books from the shelves and misplace them or report them, it complicates the work of library staff. Additionally, an adult aged @NUM1 or older should accompany children entering these sections. If a child is found alone, the library staff will contact the parents as a @NUM2 offense. The same rule applies for a second offense. For a third offense, the child will be banned from the library for @NUM4 months after the parents are notified. In large cities, there are often better - equipped libraries. Some libraries have so many books that a cherry - picker might be needed to reach the upper shelves. There is a vast difference between large and small libraries, much like the difference between preschool and college. I propose that cities with a large population should have two adjacent libraries. The left - hand library would be for toddlers aged @NUM5 - @NUM6. This library would be busy and include a daycare, allowing parents to search for books in peace. Children aged @NUM7 - @DATE1 would also use this library, but they would be on the upper floor, with age - appropriate books. They would also be able to watch TV or play non - violent computer games. The right - hand library would look similar on the outside but be different inside. This design is to prevent children from being attracted to it just because it looks cooler. Children often imitate adults, so what we watch, listen to, and read can influence them. In conclusion, by implementing these measures, we can protect children from inappropriate content and ensure they grow up without being exposed to things they should not know at age @NUM8.
1469	4446	2	2	I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from library shelves because I see no reason for them to be offensive to others. War movies, for example, depict the experiences of soldiers, including their losses and emotions. They are not just about killing and shooting but offer a deeper understanding of the human cost of war. Every book in the library has value. Some people may need them for projects or to study historical figures, and many books contain a wealth of knowledge that can be learned from. However, I think music, especially rap, should be removed from libraries. Such music can promote hatred and violence, which is not appropriate for a library environment. Regarding magazines, those related to racing, sports, or the military can be allowed, but other inappropriate ones should be excluded. Exposure to inappropriate content can have a negative impact on the minds of readers. In conclusion, while most materials in libraries should remain accessible, certain types of music and inappropriate magazines should be removed to maintain a positive and suitable environment.
1470	4447	2	2	There is a wide variety of books, movies, and magazines available, and most libraries offer a large selection for different readers and movie - watchers. However, some of these materials are not suitable for young minds. It is concerning to think about what might happen if a young child accesses inappropriate reading material. That's why I believe libraries should have age - restricted sections. Books can be a great source of learning, but some contain content that could be traumatizing for children. These might include topics that parents would prefer to discuss with their children at a later stage. There are also many books that are safe for kids to read, and parents don't need to worry about them. Libraries can also help by organizing movies into specific sections. A 'family and kids' section would be ideal, where parents can be confident that their children won't get the wrong ideas from the movies. In my local library, there is such a section, and my grandma and I often went there to find great family movies to watch together. Another important step is for libraries to ensure that children are of the appropriate age to borrow books or movies. Clearly, a @NUM1 - year - old child should not be allowed to borrow a @CAPS1 - rated movie. Movie ratings are there to inform people about the content, and libraries should enforce age - appropriate borrowing. Similarly, library staff should review magazines and books before allowing children to borrow them. In conclusion, I don't think libraries should ban books, magazines, movies, or music. Instead, they should focus on ensuring that children borrow materials suitable for their age. Books are a wonderful way to learn, and libraries should facilitate a positive learning and enjoyable experience for everyone.
1471	4448	2	2	I firmly believe that books, music, magazines, and other materials should not be removed from the shelves simply because they are considered offensive. Everyone has their own opinion on this matter. Throughout my years of reading, I've come across a few books that were a bit questionable, but I'm sure others could relate to them.  Personally, I don't think anything should be removed. As we grow up, our parents try to shield us from things we don't need to see at that stage of life. I can understand the concept of age limits, but we can't hide everything. Isn't it better to let children know what's out there before they discover it on their own?  People will likely have different answers to this question. My views may differ from those of the person sitting next to me, but I think we should have the right to read, see, and listen to what we want. The world is not a safe place; it can be scary and cruel. When I have children, I'll keep certain things from them when they're young, but that's just part of parenting. As they get older and start asking questions, I'll tell them the truth.  Is it lying to our children by keeping these things from them? I'd say yes. By removing these materials from the youth, we're giving them the impression that the world is perfect and there's no wrong. Some people might actually claim that, but I'd say they haven't experienced life. Even today, there's segregation among all people, not just between races but within our own race as well.  In conclusion, we should be free to read and see what we want. We shouldn't shield people from certain things and then let them out into the world and experience a complete culture shock. We should teach our children about the real world and let them know the truth. Should certain materials be removed from the shelves? No, who is to judge what we see and hear?
1472	4449	2	2	In my view, books that might seem offensive to some should remain on the library shelves. People should be allowed to borrow and read them, even if certain individuals find them offensive or they might come across as such.  A reader has the responsibility to choose books that won't make them uncomfortable. For example, if you're a football player, don't pick a book that discriminates against football players, as it's likely to upset you. If you do choose such a book and it makes you uncomfortable, don't go complaining about it. Just put the book down; no one is forcing you to read it.  People should have the freedom to read whatever books interest them. Just because a book is offensive to you doesn't mean it's offensive to others. If we removed all the books, articles, and magazines that offended at least one person from library shelves, there would be nothing left to read.  Movies are a different matter. There are various types of movies with different elements to make them funny, scary, or shocking. If you don't like cussing and you watch a movie like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' where every other word is a cuss word, you'll find it offensive. If you don't like people jumping out to scare you, you won't watch '@CAPS3'. Some people who find movies offensive often make a big deal out of it and sue the movie - makers, but this causes more trouble than it's worth. Similar to books, if we removed all the offensive movies from stores, there would be no movies left to watch because many movies would offend someone.  In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine offensive, get over it. Keep it away from yourself but let others have access to it. At the end of the day, no one will help you sue an author, producer, or music company just because something they created offends you. Just read what you're interested in, watch what you like, and listen to your favorite songs.
1473	4450	2	2	I don't think materials of a certain nature should be taken off the shelves because there are still people who want to access that kind of stuff. Some people say it's not appropriate for kids, but then they should keep their kids away from it.  There are people who don't like this kind of material and those who do. I'm one of the ones who like it because we should have the freedom to read or watch what we want. No one is forcing anyone to look at or read these materials. If you don't like it, just don't look.  This kind of material should be placed to the side, where people know what they're getting into and away from kids. There really shouldn't be a problem with this. Some people who want to remove these materials think they're high - class and assume that those who read or watch such things are bad. That's just their opinion.  In conclusion, I believe that if you avoid reading or watching this kind of material, you're trying to be something you're not. You're acting superior just because you think you're too high - class for it. We all get a laugh out of this kind of stuff, and it should be available for those who want it.
1474	4451	2	2	I firmly oppose the idea of censoring books. The question of whether to remove books with certain language or content from shelves is a complex one. But in my opinion, if someone takes a book away just because it has @CAPS1 language or a nasty meaning, it's a wrong move. There are indeed some books that might need censorship, but doing so in a public library would exclude many great novels from the past, which were acceptable in their time. If one wants to censor books, it should be done in their private library.  I believe that if an author intended to write a book in a certain way, the writing should remain unchanged. Censoring books not only destroys the integrity of the work but also affects the learning curriculum of students. For example, we wouldn't censor a school - book just because it has @CAPS1 graphic text.  There are numerous books with bad language and perverse ideas, but they were written to educate our civilization. Removing these books would harm society's ability to learn. In my view, books are generally not offensive unless one is overly self - conscious. Reading is a wonderful experience that should not be ruined by censorship.  In my personal experience, I've had no issue reading a great novel with @CAPS1 minor graphic details. I don't care about an explicit word in my reading. However, some naive people try to remove offensive articles not for the public good but for personal gain. These actions are a disgrace to literature and culture. In fact, many of today's books are far less explicit than before. Censorship would create an unwanted barrier.  History has shown us the consequences of book - burning. When the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 burned the @CAPS4 books, we almost lost an entire civilization's culture and literature. We should not let this happen to today's literature. Censorship of library materials should be restricted to personal libraries. Libraries are public for a reason.  In conclusion, censorship should not be implemented in libraries as it disrupts public literature. If a book was meant to be read in its original form, it should stay that way. We are not the destroyers of classic literature, and it should never come to that.
1475	4452	2	2	I strongly believe that libraries should be a safe and educational environment for children. The last thing I'd want my children to encounter in a library is offensive material. A library is supposed to be a learning zone where people can expand their knowledge. Having dirty magazines, movies on sexuality, offensive music, or inappropriate websites accessible to children defeats the purpose of a safe learning environment.  I think libraries should primarily be used for educational purposes. There should be appropriate books and magazines that are age - appropriate. Computers are a great resource, but they can contain offensive material. Therefore, the computers in the library should be monitored. If someone wants to access inappropriate content, they should do it in the privacy of their own home, not in a public place where innocent children can be exposed. It's unfair to the kids and their parents who try to protect them from such suggestive material.  I'm aware that some people might disagree with my proposal. They could be those who lack a moral framework, don't have children to look after, or aren't as concerned about this issue. They might argue that there's no need to monitor computers or that they have blocked websites. They might think there's no real harm, perhaps due to their upbringing. Regarding magazines, some might say that children will be exposed to suggestive material eventually, so why not now? But if we all thought like this, all morals would be forgotten.  In some cases, religion might be a significant factor. Many religious people have beliefs against looking at suggestive and 'unholy' material. Parents wouldn't want to take their children to a library and find them looking at images that go against their religious beliefs. It would seem like losing their child's innocence. Having such content accessible to kids and teenagers could unintentionally send the wrong message about sexual activities, which might be unacceptable according to their religion.  I remember when I was a little girl, my mother and I often went to the library to pick out school books. I clearly recall seeing naughty magazines lying on a table near the children's section. My mother was appalled and complained to a librarian, asking for their removal. The librarian apologized and agreed that the placement was inappropriate. Since then, my mother has been skeptical about going to that library. This is why I'm so involved in this issue and wrote this article.  I didn't write this to blame or judge anyone. My purpose was to inform the public about these issues and explain my stance. I don't see the need for having such materials in a library where anyone can access them. I hope this article has opened the eyes of concerned parents and made them aware of the matter. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, @PERSON1.
1476	4453	2	2	Around the globe, children daily wander through libraries, exploring the literary world for learning and growth. The library is a wonderful place with various literary genres, including children's books, non - fiction, fiction, adult books, movies, etc. There are specific genres for different age groups, and some library materials may be inappropriate for children, which concerns parents. However, I believe it is normal yet unnecessary for parents to worry so much. Children should have the right to explore the literary world as they wish. Reading different types of literature is an excellent way of learning, and library shelves should not be stripped of these books. Libraries house a wide range of books, movies, magazines, and music, all great forms of literature and learning tools. Some parents don't want their children exposed to certain materials. But if a child wants to read a book, they should be allowed to. Parents may claim that such materials corrupt children, but in fact, it is the environment and people around them that can cause negative influence. It is natural for parents to be protective, but they should also help their children grow and distinguish right from wrong. They have the right to protect their children from real - world dangers, but not to prevent them from exploring literature. Literature in all forms is a great way of learning, and libraries should not remove wonderful books for the sake of a few. Children should have the freedom to explore the literary world according to their interests.
1477	4454	2	2	Adults should have the freedom to obtain what they desire, while children should not. However, completely depriving people of things they like is unjust. Everyone has different preferences, and as long as it is within a reasonable and legal scope, adults should be able to pursue what they want. For children, appropriate guidance is needed. But overall, we should respect people's choices to a certain extent and not simply take away things that bring them joy or value.
1478	4455	2	2	"Libraries are ubiquitous, and collectively they hold millions of books that influence all readers. Whether it's a book about a particular person or a specific topic, there is always something impactful to be found. Some books contain adult - themed content or references that adults may consider inappropriate for certain age groups. The question is whether it's a good idea to censor and remove these books from library shelves. In my opinion, although these books are influential and may potentially have a negative impact on the youth, everyone has the right to read what interests them. One of the main purposes of most reading materials is to be influential. Most books aim to prove a point or share a side story. It's not wrong to express a point of view or share a life experience. Sharing experiences is an important part of life. For example, a certain organization's account of a major downfall in a location and its impact on people struggling for survival and money, or the ""Twilight"" series showing the softer side of love, are all experiences and topics worth pondering. Losing such elements would be a great loss. The youth are often portrayed negatively, but they need positive influences. Reading is a major source of inspiration for students' growth. In school, students are restricted to a limited reading list, which makes reading seem boring. Taking away the books that young adults are interested in contributes to the growing problem of people losing interest in reading. Teachers, principals, business people, and children all have the right to read what they like. If a sports - major person suddenly had all sports - related materials removed, they would lose their career. Romance novelists use sensual or sexual experiences to convey common human emotions. Removing such natural and relevant content would have serious consequences, especially for those who enjoy these books. It would also deprive people of an intellectual culture. Influencing people to think about common issues can be inspiring. Just because someone is young doesn't mean a literary work will corrupt their mind. Removing materials that contribute to daily life would lead to a less creative, inventive, and inspired world. Not everyone thinks certain books are bad, and I am one of them."
1479	4456	2	2	Should offensive materials like books, music, movies, and magazines be removed from library shelves? Should they be placed in a specific area for a particular age group? Should such things be accessible to children? I think libraries should have a wide variety of books as that's their purpose. However, if people find some books offensive when accessible to children, they can ask the library to adjust the book arrangement. The library should place these adult - oriented books in a separate area for adults. They should also put age restrictions on library cards to avoid problems. Only those above a certain age (e.g., @NUM1 years) should be able to access materials inappropriate for young children. It is understandable that parents with young children or those who don't like the content of certain books, music, and magazines find them offensive. But I don't agree with removing books from the shelves because there are people who come to the library specifically to read them. Taking these books away will upset the readers. Personally, I like magazines, books, music, and movies in the library and find nothing offensive about them. These materials make the library a fun and peaceful place. They give me and my friends something to do after school. Without them, the library will become boring. The library is a place to relax, and removing these items will take away its charm.
1480	4457	2	2	"Censorship in libraries should not be permitted. People should have the right to choose what they read or watch. Just because one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean others will feel the same way. Libraries should let the community decide what is offensive. Some parents worry that their children might access inappropriate materials in the library. If so, they should communicate with their children and explain why certain materials are not suitable, rather than blaming the library for having them. If some books or movies are considered highly offensive by the public, they should be placed in a special area. This area should be clearly marked as ""@CAPS1 content"" and restricted to adults. This would prevent children from easily accessing these materials while still allowing those who want to view them to do so. The best solution is to keep offensive materials in the library but with age restrictions on borrowing and place them in a separate section from regular materials. This way, libraries can balance the needs of different users and ensure that everyone's rights are respected."
1481	4458	2	2	Do I think certain materials like books, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they're considered offensive? I understand that some parents don't want their children reading books about drugs or watching movies about gangs. However, libraries shouldn't be required to remove such materials. There's no movie, book, or magazine that everyone will approve of. Just because a few people find something offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to decide what libraries stock.  One reason I believe items shouldn't be removed just because a few people are offended is based on Katherine Paterson's quote. If a few parents don't want their kids to see a particular book and complain to have it removed from the library, then more and more parents will start complaining about different books, movies, or magazines daily. Eventually, there would be no books, movies, or magazines left in the library.  Another reason the public shouldn't have a say in what libraries hold is related to the diverse cultural families living in @LOCATION1. Some people think bibles should be in libraries, while half of the population agrees, and the other half finds it ridiculous. If people were given the right to decide what libraries stock, a group might demand the removal of bibles they don't want their children to read. Then, the believers in @CAPS1 would come to the library and complain about the removal. It's impossible to please everyone, so libraries should be able to stock whatever they want.  My final reason is that if libraries were forced to remove items because a few people complain, the same logic could apply to restaurants, movie rental businesses, or clothing outlet stores. In my view, the only person who should decide what's in a store or library is the owner, as they're responsible for determining what's appropriate. The public has to accept these choices. No one wants others to come into their business, complain, and force them to get rid of an item.  After considering these points, I hope you understand my perspective. It's not humane to force libraries to remove items. Parents naturally don't want their kids to see inappropriate things, but it's not the public's place to decide. We must accept that libraries should have the freedom to stock materials as they see fit.
1482	4459	2	2	Today, we live in a world with a wide range of political, religious, and personal views, and these views will only become more diverse over time. Unfortunately, it's difficult to accommodate every individual's perspective. This is especially true for libraries, where it's challenging to have books that won't offend people with different opinions.  Take @LOCATION1 as an example. It's home to people of various races and religions. The country has overcome issues like @CAPS1 @CAPS2, racism, and slavery, but there are still disagreements. With different opinions, there are multiple books on the same topic from different viewpoints. As readers, we need to be aware of the author's perspective and avoid books that conflict with our beliefs. This is where the issue of offensiveness arises. We live among diverse people and must understand that not everyone shares our views on life.  When I was in eighth grade, I was @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 with friends. One of them pulled her eyes back because they were itchy. A pregnant @CAPS3 @CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to this gesture. She yelled at us, saying, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' At first, we didn't understand what she meant until we realized our friend's eye movement. This incident shows that different people can be offended by different things due to their heritage.  We can't change the expanding cultures in our country or the views of certain people. However, we can change our own perspective. We need to recognize that there's no single 'right' opinion when dealing with multiple viewpoints. At this point, we should embrace others for who they are and what they believe because we can't change their beliefs.  So, the next time you pick up a book from the library, read the summary and check the author's stance before taking it home. If you get a book you disagree with or find offensive, you only have yourself to blame for not checking first. By understanding and respecting different perspectives, we can create a more inclusive and harmonious society.
1483	4460	2	2	I firmly believe that every book is meant to be read and that people can gain knowledge from all aspects of a book. If children are accessing inappropriate materials, parents should keep them away from those sections. Everyone has different reading preferences, and they shouldn't lose access to certain books just because some children look at inappropriate content. What's the point of a library if it can't have certain materials?  In my view, libraries should make 'bad' sections off - limits to children. Libraries are divided into sections like fiction, non - fiction, fantasy, and children's books for a reason. If parents choose to let their children read from any section, that's their decision. However, parents who don't approve can go to a different library. If one parent complains and no one else shares the concern, that parent should not be allowed in the library.  I don't believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be excluded from libraries. Just because a parent doesn't want their child to pick up a particular book, libraries shouldn't be forced to remove it. Parents should be responsible for monitoring what their children read, not make libraries remove books from the shelves. All materials in libraries are there for educational purposes. There should be laws stating that these materials are in libraries for a reason, and if customers don't like it, they can go elsewhere.  As a volunteer at a local library, I've seen that every movie, book, and magazine in the library has valuable information. Books are for people's enjoyment and love of reading, movies are for educational purposes like teaching kids to count or learn about a topic, and magazines are for relaxation and learning something new.  Parents should monitor what their children read. Libraries shouldn't have to remove long - standing books from their shelves. Materials like movies, books, magazines, and music should never be taken away from libraries. What's the point of a library if you can't check out items that interest you? After considering these points, you should agree that certain materials shouldn't be removed from libraries just because parents don't monitor their children properly.
1484	4461	2	2	Have you ever come across a book or magazine on a shelf that seems offensive, perhaps one dealing with drugs, alcohol, or sex? Some parents are worried that their kids might accidentally pick up such a book and be mentally scarred for life.  Offensive books aren't suitable for kids or early - teens. They're too young to learn about drugs, alcohol, and sex. If a kid picks up a book about sex (which is unlikely to be on a library shelf), they might show it to their parents, saying, '@CAPS1, look what I found.' The shocked parent could even sue the library for having such an offensive book.  However, some @CAPS2 don't find these types of books offensive. They might think these books provide useful information for themselves or others. But it's the @CAPS2, not their children, who should be reading these books, as they can cause long - term mental harm to kids.  The library could take a simple step, like creating a room just for @CAPS2 and keeping offensive movies, books, magazines, etc., in there. Kids should only be allowed in if they're @NUM1 or older. This would prevent children from picking up offensive books and keep their minds safe.  Children are naturally curious, especially as they grow up. They'll ask about drugs, alcohol, and sex at the right time. But having such materials on regular library shelves is offensive to parents and other @CAPS2. Library staff should take action and create a separate room for @CAPS2 @CAPS3. By doing so, libraries can balance the needs of different patrons and protect children from potentially harmful content.
1485	4462	2	2	I believe that censorship is necessary to some extent. If all children grew up listening to hardcore gangster rap and watching porn @DATE1, the future leaders might be shiftless and violent. It's important to have some restrictions to ensure we grow into mentally healthy adults. However, censorship can go too far. Removing an author's work from a public library completely crosses the line.  We have a legal right to express ourselves through the @NUM1 amendment of our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. The writers of this @CAPS1 recognized that freedom of creativity should not be restricted. This law still exists @DATE1 and has been used many times to defend the right to keep works, words, and ideas in the public domain. As far as I know, taking any form of media, book, or entertainment away from the public would be illegal.  When thinking about media censorship, @PERSON4 comes to mind. He was a musician, composer, writer, public speaker, and human @CAPS2 activist. Some might think he's too wild to be a convincing argument, as he was a firm atheist and secular humanist. But he gave the same argument I'm making @DATE1, and I'm a catholic. @PERSON4 spoke out against censorship, saying it's unfair to judge artists' work without fully listening to it. If someone as passionate as @PERSON4, who didn't believe in a @CAPS4, could hold this view, then everyone should recognize that humans have the right to share their creations, and in some cases, it's necessary.  @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON3, and many others were all strong believers in human @CAPS2. Imagine if @CAPS3 had stopped sharing their ideas because they thought people wouldn't want to hear them. The world wouldn't be as amazing and integrated as it is. We never know how life - changing someone's perspective can be, whether it's leading a civil @CAPS2 movement or bringing peace.  Who has the right to judge an artist's work? Whether it's called @CAPS4, the man, or the government, it's hard for an artist to get their work recognized. But that doesn't mean they should give up. Censorship in public places is a violation of the law, nature, and our inalienable @CAPS2. It's our responsibility to create a world where people can freely share their ideas. After considering these points, I hope you'll agree that we should oppose excessive censorship and support the free expression of human creativity.
1486	4463	2	2	Censorship represents a means of depriving an individual or society of knowledge. The attempt to conceal even the slightest details of historical events, political corruption, and inappropriate content from a particular generation can render them ignorant of their past, present, and potentially their future. Censorship poses a significant threat to society as it leaves it vulnerable to future uncertainties. For instance, if the warnings from environmentalists around the world regarding a certain environmental threat were censored, the global community would lose the opportunity to prevent or at least mitigate the impending disaster through sustainable practices. Instead, humanity might face an earlier demise. Moreover, if more people had been aware of a certain person's censorship of oil distribution during their presidency, there might have been discussions about impeachment. Imagine a world where events such as racism, terrorism, wars, or the Holocaust were censored. This could be equated to brainwashing. Even if certain events bring peace and happiness, the lack of historical knowledge would leave society intellectually impoverished. Discovering such censored information suddenly could lead to unforeseen problems. In the book series 'The [CAPS5]' by [PERSON1], a city is isolated from its past, referred to as 'the [CAPS6]'. The new government and its technology have effectively brainwashed the citizens into believing that their predecessors almost destroyed the world through war and destruction. Fortunately, in our current era, most information is accessible, with the exception of some international political affairs. For example, the killing of [LOCATION1] bin [CAPS7] was only known to the [CAPS8] of [ORGANIZATION1], the military, and [CAPS9]. This was a prudent decision rather than announcing it on [NUM1] news. I firmly believe that individuals should be informed about their history as it is both fascinating and provides insights into the present. Books like 'To [CAPS11] a [CAPS12]' or '[PERSON3]' should never be removed from library shelves, regardless of the reader's age. Although a historical racist song might be more offensive than a racist book, I am always interested in learning about such aspects of history. Censorship should be declared illegal in libraries, [CAPS13] stores, and all other establishments selling books, music, movies, and magazines. While I am not aware of any recent instances of censorship, the very existence of censorship raises concerns. In conclusion, the free flow of information is essential for a well - informed and progressive society.
1487	4464	2	2	Dear Katherine Paterson, I've been thinking about whether the items you listed are offensive. I believe that this is a free country where all people should be treated equally. The newspaper organization should continue its current operations and even expand its scope. There should indeed be some restrictions, but to address the issue of under - age purchasing, requiring the use of [CAPS1] would be a viable solution. Implementing this measure, in my opinion, would resolve many problems. Completely removing certain magazines or movies would be an overreaction. Therefore, I suggest maintaining the current approach while setting stricter restrictions on sales. This way, everything should work out just fine. Yours sincerely, Zack.
1488	4465	2	2	This form of writing is socially unacceptable. There are numerous books and media sources that contain inappropriate language, sexual undertones, and other immoral ideas. While it is important to preserve cultural heritage, the prevalence of immorality in the world is currently at an all - time high. We should shift our focus from the books that will always be on the shelves and instead direct our attention towards the hearts of people and promote morally upright values. When a person enters a library, they typically expect certain experiences, such as the smell of old books, the noise of children, and the librarian's calls to maintain quiet. However, they do not anticipate witnessing children using drugs or watching porn on the library computers. This is not the fault of the books or the computers; rather, it is a consequence of an immoral world. I have personally witnessed some unethical behavior among children in the school system, and the situation is deteriorating day by day. There is some good, but it is not because the children themselves are inherently caring and loving. I recall many students in my [NUM1] grade class telling me, 'The only thing that is wrong is telling someone they are.' This mindset is clearly immoral. But who will correct them, and what is the solution? [CAPS2] is the answer. In the [CAPS1], it is stated that [CAPS2] is the way, the truth, and the life. This is an undeniable truth. In the book of [CAPS3], it is written that [CAPS4] allowed many people to succumb to their sinful desires. [CAPS4] is the only source of goodness, and the only light comes from [CAPS5]. The only man to live a perfect life was [CAPS2] [CAPS7], and [CAPS8] was [CAPS4] in human form. As a global community, we need to turn to [CAPS5], the sole source of goodness, and strive to emulate [CAPS5]. The world desperately needs [CAPS5]. Only [CAPS4] can transform a person's heart. Once we focus on [CAPS5], our thoughts, writing, and actions will change, and we will no longer have to grapple with this moral dilemma. In conclusion, embracing [CAPS5] is the key to a more moral and just world.
1489	4466	2	2	I firmly believe that censorship should only be applied when there is truly offensive material. Making fun of or joking about people is wrong. There are movies, such as 'The [CAPS1]', where a character mocks a special olympic team and lies about having a disability to win races and gain money. This kind of content is unacceptable, and I would advocate for such movies to be removed from circulation. I am unsure about the decision - making process regarding what materials are put on shelves. However, it seems reasonable that the nature of the offensive information should determine whether a particular item should be made available to the public. In conclusion, offensive content that demeans or mocks others should not be tolerated, and appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that such materials are not easily accessible.
1490	4467	2	2	I wholeheartedly believe that most materials, including books, movies, and magazines, should be freely available, with the exception of mature content such as pornography, violent and horrifying movies, and video games. This is where organizations like [ORGANIZATION1] come in handy, as they provide a way to verify a person's age. Different age groups have varying levels of tolerance for mature content. Generally, individuals aged [NUM1] and above can handle such material more appropriately. Maturity develops at different rates among individuals of all age groups. For example, a [NUM2] - year - old might be more mature than an [NUM3] - year - old. Maturity is characterized by the ability to behave in a civilized manner, rather than like a wild and unruly group. Just because someone does not always act maturely does not mean they are unaware of proper behavior. To prevent children from accessing inappropriate or vulgar content, a simple solution is to implement an age - grouping system for books. Adult videos should be kept out of children's reach, and safety locks should be installed on TVs to prevent kids from secretly watching inappropriate shows. In conclusion, by taking these precautions, we can ensure that children are protected from harmful content while still allowing access to a wide range of materials for the general public.
1491	4468	2	2	Everyone holds an opinion, which is what makes us unique. This diversity is evident in our preferences, like choosing to watch @CAPS1 over @CAPS2 or listening to pop instead of country. A library is a place that unites people from all walks of life. It is a hub of interest, information, research, and enjoyment. The question then arises: should we remove certain materials from library shelves just because some people find them offensive? I firmly believe we should not. As author Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Think about it. If we allowed individuals to remove library books they dislike, eventually, there would be no books or materials left for study or pleasure reading. I've come across content I don't agree with, but others might. A library isn't meant to cater to one person's interests alone. Millions of people use libraries for various purposes. So, I don't think we should remove items from the shelves. Just pick up what you find interesting and leave the rest. We all have rights, just as we have our likes, dislikes, and independent minds. Opinions define us, choices shape us, and libraries do so much more. They expand our knowledge, turn our dreams into reality, and sometimes even broaden our horizons. We need books, music, movies, and magazines, and we need them all. That's my stance on this topic, and I hope it helps you form yours.
1492	4469	2	2	The question of who decides which books in libraries are appropriate and which are not is a highly controversial one. On one hand, parents are concerned about the content their children can access at local libraries. They believe libraries should not have any offensive books. However, who has the authority to determine what is offensive? If people are given the power to remove books they deem inappropriate, libraries will eventually have so few books that having a library card will be pointless. I believe it is the responsibility of parents and adults to teach children morals and the difference between right and wrong. If children develop strong morals and values, parents won't need to worry as much about what their kids borrow from the library. Children face ethical dilemmas daily, and parents should trust that their children can make the right decisions. As a teenager, I know that the internet offers access to far more inappropriate content than libraries. If we start censoring libraries, it's likely that the internet will be next, and the concept of freedom of speech will be undermined. People have the right to express their opinions, and no one has the right to silence them. In my view, removing books from libraries goes against this principle. A few months ago, I had to write a research paper about @PERSON1. To gather information, I borrowed books from the library. Some of the content was offensive, but I couldn't have completed my paper without it. Library books, regardless of their offensiveness, contain vital information. They can teach us about right and wrong. By being exposed to offensive content, we can learn from it and form our own beliefs. Removing offensive books from libraries won't prevent children from encountering such information, as there are numerous sources available. People are accountable for their choices regarding what they read, watch, or listen to. We face decisions every day, such as whether to watch an inappropriate movie or listen to a song with a bad message. Checking out a library book is no different. Each person should decide what is right for them, and we shouldn't dictate what others can or cannot do.
1493	4470	2	2	I firmly believe that any book found offensive by someone should be removed from the library shelf. We need to consider the perspective of others. Imagine going to the library and constantly being confronted with something that offends you. It would be a difficult situation to deal with during your regular visits and in your daily life. One reason for this is that if someone finds a book offensive and others are aware of it, they might use it to say mean things. Additionally, if you frequently visit the library and have to see an offensive book every day, it would likely become irritating. Therefore, I think offensive books should be removed from the shelf. Music is not as much of an issue as books. Music is something you listen to, while books are something you read. You don't see music in the same way you see the written words in a book. Books present information in black and white, and there's a possibility of it being accompanied by pictures. So, if you find something offensive, you should take action rather than letting it bother you constantly. Either have it removed or learn to accept it. In conclusion, offensive books should be removed from library shelves, while music doesn't pose the same level of concern. People should address offensive content instead of enduring it.
1494	4471	2	2	Books are a form of art, and authors are artists. Writing is a means of expression, and in the @CAPS1, freedom of expression is guaranteed. I firmly believe that we should not deny anyone this freedom, and no books or other forms of art should be removed from library shelves. I understand that parents want to protect their children from certain content. They want to keep their children innocent. However, children need to grow up. They are curious and want to explore the world. We can't shield them from everything. As my favorite musician, @PERSON2, once said, '@CAPS2 covering your children's eyes...' The world has both good and bad aspects, and if we remove everything considered 'offensive,' children and people in general will miss out on a lot. The question of what is offensive and who decides is a complex one. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if everyone can remove what they find offensive, soon there will be no books left on the shelves because everyone has different opinions. What one person finds offensive, another might find beautiful. '@CAPS3 man's trash is another man's treasure.' Books, music, and movies are all forms of art, and people have the right to express themselves. We already censor a lot, and I think censorship takes away from the original work. If you don't like something, you can choose not to read, listen to, or watch it. You can make choices for your own children, but you can't make decisions for others. People have the right to do what makes them happy, including creating and consuming art. Books, music, and other forms of art don't harm people. They can make us uncomfortable, but people are in control of their actions. We should not remove any form of art from the shelves. There could be age limits or specific sections for adult content, but no one should have the power to decide what is right for others. You can protect your children and avoid offensive content, but don't deprive others of the opportunity to experience art that might enrich their lives.
1495	4472	2	2	Books are an integral part of history, and no book should be censored. They offer insights into the past and teach us valuable lessons. If a book is based on true events, nothing in it should be censored. Many books from the @DATE1's and earlier contain language that may not be suitable for younger children. However, in today's world, people are bound to encounter inappropriate content. It's like suggesting that all websites should be censored. A book that requires censorship should not be in an @CAPS1 school. I believe any book that teaches a lesson or aids a teacher should be used, regardless of its content. Teachers should read the books before assigning them to students. If they think the students won't handle the content appropriately, the book should not be used in the classroom. Otherwise, a large number of books would be removed or censored from the shelves. If you don't want to encounter certain words or images, you shouldn't pick up the book. Many people would be unhappy if widespread censorship occurred. I would be too because sometimes an entire chapter or a song lyric might be inappropriate. Currently, some people are already upset, but if censorship becomes more prevalent, even more people will be dissatisfied. In conclusion, books are important historical records, and censorship should be limited. Teachers should play a role in ensuring appropriate book selection for students, but we should not over - censor and risk losing valuable literary resources.
1496	4473	2	2	Removing books from the shelves of our public library seems utterly absurd to me. While I understand that some individuals may find certain books, music, movies, or magazines offensive, others truly appreciate them. This is a matter of diversity; some people love down - to - earth literature, while others can't tolerate it. Why take away something that only a few people oppose?  I firmly believe that some of the most offensive entertainment in libraries is also the best, and it's all based on facts. If this is such a significant issue, there should be a specific section for these items. Those who want to complain can simply stay out of that section, as people like me will be there, eager to explore these different forms of entertainment, regardless of whether they are offensive or not.  Some people find certain content offensive, but I think it actually makes them stronger. It helps them realize how fortunate they are not to be in the situations described in the offensive books they read. After all, it's just a form of entertainment! If it offends you and fails to entertain, go find something that does.  Even though I've heard about people reading offensive books, I've never actually seen one myself. I think some people are overly sensitive. Instead of giving in to their demands, we should have a rational discussion with them. So what if these books aren't removed from the shelves? As I've said, we can create a special section for them. Those who aren't satisfied will eventually get over it.  Now that you've read my thoughts, what's your opinion? Should we remove certain entertainment from library shelves, or should we reason with those who are offended? I hope my words help keep books on the shelves and readers happy.
1497	4474	2	2	The question of whether there should be censorship in libraries is one that both sides can support with valid facts. Censorship is generally defined as restricting access to certain items until an individual reaches a mature age. However, determining when someone is mature is subjective, as maturity is about an individual's ability to handle various thoughts, ideas, and actions. Censorship should be allowed to a certain extent.  Censorship has had a significant impact on society. It has transformed the content on television over the past @NUM1 years. The government is more lenient today compared to @NUM1 years ago. Back then, you would never hear a swear word on TV or see a couple sleeping in the same bed. Now, some swear words are considered acceptable because people can handle them; they've become part of our daily vocabulary. Clearly, censorship has changed a great deal.  Books of all kinds should be accessible to people of all ages. Different literature offers a wide range of topics that can stimulate the brain. We all learn at different paces, and some books with so - called 'adult content' may be more suitable for more intelligent minds. Authors sometimes include such content to add suspense and drama to convey a deeper message in their work. Reading books helps expand the mind and enhances learning.  Movies are different. Some movies contain sexual content that is inappropriate for the youth. Most magazines follow similar principles as movies and are rated according to age. By doing so, we can protect the innocence of young people. Music, on the other hand, is beneficial for one's mood and should not be censored. People have diverse musical tastes, and there is a vast array of music to enjoy. It's impossible to censor the universal language of music.  Ultimately, censorship should be up to parents to decide what their children can see and hear. Censoring books is not advisable, but censoring movies and magazines is acceptable. Music, however, cannot be censored as its lyrics and sounds have a unique way of connecting with people. Everyone should have the right to choose what they read, watch, or listen to, as learning is limitless and should not be restricted.
1498	4475	2	2	I don't think people should remove books, movies, and music from libraries. It's up to individuals to choose what they read, watch, and listen to. Why should we change just because some people can't handle the content? People have the right to decide for themselves what they want to engage with.  They will figure out on their own what they like to read, watch, or listen to. It's their choice, and no one else should interfere. Parents will also determine what they want their kids to consume.  In conclusion, it's the people who should have the freedom to choose what they read, watch, and listen to. We should respect everyone's choices and not let a few people's objections limit the options available to others.
1499	4476	2	2	I believe that individuals have the right to visit a library and access books, magazines, movies, and other materials, as these can be used for information they may need. However, this should be managed maturely. Materials that are inappropriate or of no use to certain people, especially children, should be kept in a special area. If something is intended only for adults, there should be no way for children to access it.  People have the right to obtain books from the library for personal information, research papers, or self - improvement. Any inappropriate content should have its own designated space, separate from other materials.  As I've mentioned, there should be some protection for children. Firstly, they shouldn't be exposed to content that is beyond their comprehension. Secondly, some people may not need certain information.  There are several ways to prevent the perception that libraries need censorship. One way is to have a special room for inappropriate materials. Additionally, there should be a staff member responsible for determining which items should be placed in this special room. There should also be a minimum age requirement to enter the room with uncensored materials. If someone doesn't meet the requirements, they should not be allowed in. In some cases, they may need to explain why they need the material to ensure it's for legitimate reasons.  In summary, all materials should be available in the library as they may be needed by someone for personal information or educational purposes. However, there should be rules and requirements regarding what is appropriate and what isn't. If a person has a valid reason for needing certain materials, they should be able to access them.
1500	4477	2	2	How would you feel if someone told you that you couldn't keep certain food in your fridge because it's bad for your health or they think it tastes bad? You'd probably be unhappy. Similarly, when people try to censor libraries, it's an unjust move.  Libraries are supposed to be places where people can access books and magazines they enjoy. But when people try to censor books, they limit the options available to library users. Those who want to read 'offensive' books are being cheated out of their enjoyment because of censorship.  The people who advocate for censoring certain books claim that these books are offensive to them and to children. My response is simple: you don't have to bring your kids to that section, and you don't have to read those books. Just leave them for those who like them.  What exactly makes a book offensive? Who gets to decide? Different people have different views. Just because one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean everyone else will.  In my opinion, we should leave the books on the shelves and let people enjoy the ones they like. No book is bad; every book can contribute to one's education, relieve stress, and be a source of entertainment in one's free time. People are being deprived of the books they love because of censorship. For example, if the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series were censored because of the magic, many people would be disappointed, as it's one of the greatest books.  As Katherine Paterson said, 'You have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Everyone should have the right to choose the books they read. Those who don't like certain books can simply ignore them. Reading is an endless source of enjoyment, and we should all be able to read what we love.
1501	4478	2	2	Books should only be removed if they are found to be offensive to a certain degree. There are other books intended for educational purposes that are not meant to offend anyone. However, people sometimes take things too seriously. Many books have been a great educational resource for years. Books have existed for a long time. In the past, people read books on scrolls or even in picture - based stories. Stories are just that, stories, not pieces of work to be used to put others down. Yet, there are some books that are clearly intended to put others down. I agree that these books should be removed from the shelves as they might incite people against certain races. A good example of a book that might seem offensive but isn't actually putting others down is 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'. This book is meant to help people understand life during and just after slavery when the newly freed men were not respected. Another book about the slavery era is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1'. It tells the story of a young boy who runs away and meets a runaway slave named @PERSON1, and it shows the punishments slaves would face if caught. There are many such books. I guarantee that over 90% of books are for educational purposes based on their context. Most people misinterpret books because they're afraid of being judged, just like judging a book by its cover. I've read many books in the past few years, and I've found them to be educational. However, there are some books that are overly offensive and should be removed. Censorship is meant to protect us from disturbing topics, and I agree that certain books should be taken off the shelves. But sometimes, places go overboard with censorship. People should be allowed to decide which books (and movies) are appropriate. The world is evolving, and people are constantly learning. There should be some censorship in public places, but only for extremely offensive topics where the author has written something that will offend many.
1502	4479	2	2	Katherine Paterson wrote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' When you enter a library, there are a large number of books to choose from. However, not many are appropriate for all ages, especially children. That's why libraries have different sections, but sometimes people are rude and mix the books up on purpose. How often have you been in a library and found a misplaced book? It happens quite often, either accidentally or on purpose. If I took my child to the library and they got an inappropriate book, I'd take it to the front desk and complain. If it was just a misplaced book, I'd take it away from them. There are indeed some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the library. I remember when I was a little girl, my parents loved taking me to the library. They were happy that I loved reading. One day, my mom took me to get books. She didn't check the books until we got home, and then she realized one of the books had a curse word in it. She was very unhappy. I had no idea what was going on at first. Then she grabbed my hand, took me to the car, and we went back to the library. I can still remember her words. She said, '@CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @PERSON2. She is six years old. We were here about an hour ago, but the funny thing is why we're back. Can you give me a good reason why my six - year - old daughter has a children's book from here with cursing in it? Please explain, I'd love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was shocked; she'd never had someone complain like that in the seven years she'd worked there. That book is no longer in the @LOCATION1 library. I don't remember its title, but I know my mom can get things done. Just as Katherine Paterson said, if everyone has the right to remove books they don't like, there'll be no books left. From my experience and observation, with a little determination and persuasion, you can achieve what you want. It might cause some trouble, but if you set your mind to it, you can solve problems.
1503	4480	2	2	As a parent, would you want to shield your children from things you consider wrong, even though these things happen in the world every day? In today's society, despite having freedom of speech, the government has introduced censorship, which conflicts with this freedom. Censorship is a way for the government to control what people say, hear, read, or see. We shouldn't be restricted in what we read, watch, or listen to. I experience this almost daily, whether it's on the radio or television, where vulgar or inappropriate words are bleeped out. Another issue with censorship is that no matter what it is, where it occurs, or who is involved, someone will always have a problem with it. Recently, in one of my classes, we read an article about a popular children's and young - adult film. A school tried to ban the related books from its library because they dealt with sorcery. Most people I know who've read these books understand that sorcery isn't real. Why do people feel the need to do such things? I think many people view something that might be entertaining to one person as disgusting and disturbing just because it's a bit different. I see it as unique, not bad. Additionally, public libraries shouldn't be censored. Everyone has different views and tastes in music, literature, and films. Just because someone finds something vulgar doesn't mean it should be removed from the library's public shelves. After all, the library is public, and people are diverse. In conclusion, although we have freedom of speech, the government's censorship conflicts with it. No matter what, someone will always find fault with something. It's a shame that society tries to control everything. We should recognize that most of our problems stem from this over - controlling attitude.
1504	4481	2	2	In my opinion, libraries have no right to decide what is offensive and what isn't. The decision on censorship should be left to the people who rent or buy the items, not the library (@CAPS1). The @CAPS1 may have an idea of what's offensive, but they shouldn't make the final decision. If the @CAPS1 wants to keep its business, it should focus on customer satisfaction. Libraries should conduct surveys to understand what people want. People around the world have different views on what is an offensive book, magazine, movie, music, etc. These views can vary greatly. If people find something offensive, they should discuss it with the @CAPS1 and find a solution instead of simply getting rid of the items. A simple and safe solution would be to create a section for items considered offensive by the @CAPS1 or the people. Another option is to rearrange the library's collection into two main categories: offensive and non - offensive, and then further break them down into specific sub - categories. Libraries should conduct surveys that include both the people's and the library's opinions on which items are bad. These surveys can be in paper form at the @CAPS1 or available on its online website. The survey would list books, movies, magazines, and music for people to check off. The @CAPS1 needs money to maintain its stock of books and other items and to repair them when necessary. So, if the @CAPS1 deems a book offensive, it shouldn't have the right to censor it. These books have been in the library for a long time, so why change now? If a book was offensive, why was it put in the @CAPS1 in the first place? In conclusion, the @CAPS1 should have no right to censor books, movies, magazines, music, or any other items. Censorship would cost time and money, which the @CAPS1 doesn't have. It could also lead to a loss of customers, which would mean a loss of money. A significant loss of money can harm a business, potentially leading to bankruptcy or taking a long time to recover, and no business wants that. So, it's best to leave things as they are.
1505	4482	2	2	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed if they are offensive to a race or any other beliefs, except when they are part of a biological or historical timeline. If you find reading material offensive to you or your beliefs, you should talk to the librarian. I once read a magazine that had offensive content. I went to the librarian and told her I wanted it removed from the shelves. We argued for about five minutes, and finally, the magazine was taken off. Nobody wants to be confronted with something that goes against their beliefs. That's why offensive material should be removed from library shelves. In conclusion, we need to ensure that libraries are a safe and non - offensive space for everyone, and removing offensive materials is an important step in achieving this.
1506	4483	2	2	Parents, I firmly believe that certain materials should not be presented. However, some books may not be offensive to everyone. Thus, it would be unjust to remove all books from libraries. I can empathize with the situation where children discover non - educational books. It is the parents' responsibility to guide their children on what to read and what not to read. This also applies to movies, where parents should determine which movies their children can and cannot watch. The reason is that if children were left to decide on their own, the outcomes would often be negative, which is why parents are crucial.  I recall my own childhood when I experienced something similar. I thought the movies I watched were cool, but I was too young to understand the implications of what I was seeing and imitating. My parents had to teach me that my actions were irrational. Only then did I realize my mistakes; there was nothing admirable about them. My friends also pointed this out. I learned this the hard way, and I don't want children to go through the same.  Not all parents can prevent their children from being exposed to disturbing content in books, music, magazines, etc. However, the exposure can be reduced. Some parents can take preventive measures. Once certain ideas get into a child's mind, they may be difficult to correct. These issues are serious, yet some people do not take them seriously. It is up to parents or role models to show children that some things are inappropriate until they are ready.  I am not suggesting that parents isolate their children from the world. Instead, parents should prepare their children for what they may encounter. They should hope that it will not have a negative impact and that children will be able to distinguish right from wrong. It is the parents' duty to assist their children, and it is the children's responsibility to know what is good for them.  I believe that some children can outgrow the influence of negative events they learn from movies, as I did. If I could do it, so can they. It is not impossible. Fortunately, some children grow up in positive communities where they are aware of not reading disturbing books or magazines or watching disturbing movies.
1507	4484	2	2	In my view, materials that some people find offensive should not be removed from libraries. A library is established for people's enjoyment. Just because one person finds a certain material offensive does not mean it should be removed, as it could bring pleasure to another reader. In the following, I will further elaborate on my stance.  A library is a place for people to enjoy themselves. If someone finds something offensive, they should not be angry. The author of the book may have had similar experiences as the offended person. Most creators of books, music, and movies use these mediums to express themselves, and their works can potentially encourage others.  Personally, I have never found a book, song, or movie offensive. I understand that the author is not addressing me directly, so I see no reason to be upset, and this applies to everyone. Those who find things offensive in a library often focus on the negative aspects of the situation. In fact, every situation has a positive side. With a positive attitude, one can see the brighter side of things.  Most magazines, about @PERCENT1 of their content, are about celebrities. Unless one is overly infatuated with a particular celebrity, this content is not relevant. Music is a form of self - expression. One should not be offended just because a songwriter wants to express themselves. If someone doesn't like the way we express ourselves, we wouldn't like it either.  In conclusion, nothing should be removed from the library just because it is offensive to someone. Different materials are there for different people. Everyone has different preferences. If something offends someone, it was not put there intentionally to do so.
1508	4485	2	2	Have you ever picked up a book, video, or music from the library shelf and wondered why such content is available, considering it is not suitable for our younger kids? I believe that we should remove books that promote sexual activity, killing, drug use, and other harmful behaviors from library shelves to create a better community for our children and future generations.  In the past few years, we have witnessed an increase in crime and drug rates. Some of these negative behaviors are promoted in books, videos, and other media. If we remove the media that promotes such behaviors, we can expect a reduction in these types of crimes. We humans tend to imitate the actions of others, whether consciously or not. If the media promotes crime, people are more likely to follow suit.  Music also plays a significant role. Music with bad language or that promotes drug use or violence has been proven to affect our minds. As parents, would we want our children to grow up in a community that promotes such negative behaviors? For example, if we like rap music and it promotes killing, our minds may be influenced, and we may think that such actions are acceptable because we like the music.  In our community, @CAPS1's believe in abstaining from such behaviors. The Bible teaches us to stay away from things that promote drugs, killing, or sexual activity. In @CAPS2 homes and communities, we see less of these negative behaviors. @CAPS4 are in a better position as they live a life after @CAPS3, which does not promote these negative behaviors. I am certain that @CAPS4 would be more willing to remove such media from our libraries. By observing @CAPS4, we can see that they do not engage in drug - related or other negative behaviors because they abstain from media that promotes sex, killing, and drugs.  If you want to help us make our community a better place for our children and their children, let's remove the harmful media from our libraries. We don't want our children to be influenced by such negative content and ruin their lives. By taking action, we can create a safer and more positive environment for everyone.
1509	4486	2	2	I don't think materials that some people find offensive should be removed from libraries. A library should offer a wide variety of books, magazines, music, and movies.  One reason is that people have different reading preferences. For example, some kids love scary and gory books, while others prefer sports or love - story books. Just because a child who likes sports books is offended by gory books, it is unfair to remove the gory books from the library.  Another reason is that a diverse collection in the library is beneficial for kids. It helps them learn to read different types of stories. Magazines in the library can provide kids with a wealth of interesting facts. If the library only has a few magazines on the same topic, kids will miss out on discovering new and cool facts.  A library is a place where kids can enjoy peace and quiet and explore different materials. If we start removing specific items, kids may stop coming to the library. A library is full of great information for kids to learn. But if we start taking things out, kids will not learn new things, and fewer of them will visit the library.  If I had the power, I would keep all materials in the library. Removing items can jeopardize people's willingness to visit the library. If we start removing things, the number of visitors will decrease, and eventually, the library may even have to close due to lack of business. So, we should leave everything on the shelves.
1510	4487	2	2	Life is full of challenges, and sometimes we need all the help we can get. When people feel lost, they often turn to books, music, movies, and magazines. However, at times, we should also listen to our inner selves.  There was a time when reading was not widespread or even allowed. But today, reading has become very important. If one can read well, they have the potential to achieve great things.  Books and magazines have both similarities and differences. Books can transport our minds to places we've never been, such as the wild, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1's, and high in the trees. However, not everything they teach is good. Some books may spread false information about the future of the world. Magazines, on the other hand, show us what celebrities are doing, how they live, and what their houses and wealth are like. We must not blindly believe everything we read; we should use our own judgment.  When we hear our favorite song or watch our favorite movie, we may react in different ways, such as dancing, crying, or imitating the characters. These reactions can either be helpful or make us think about inappropriate actions towards others or ourselves.  Music can evoke memories of our past experiences or make us miss a deceased loved one. It can also have a negative impact, such as driving us to self - harm or hurting our souls when we hear about others' misfortunes. It all depends on how we interpret the song and the messages it conveys.  Movies can show history and the consequences of wrong actions. We may see a character in a movie and want to be like them, but we should not blindly imitate everyone we see. At the end of the day, we should be true to ourselves.  In conclusion, we should believe in ourselves and not be overly influenced by external media. We can listen to music, read books, and watch movies, but we should also follow our dreams and do what we love. We need to be discerning when consuming these forms of media.
1511	4488	2	2	I firmly believe that movies and magazines available to kids at the library should be censored. There are multiple compelling reasons for this, and in this discussion, I will elaborate on them and provide examples of content that children should not have access to. The primary reason for censoring movies is that movies rated @CAPS1 are not intended for children, and it is inappropriate to allow them to rent such films. Imagine an eight - year - old child encountering a sex scene. It would be extremely awkward for parents to explain what is happening. As a parent, would you want to have to explain the concept of sex to an eight - year - old? Another area that requires censorship at the library is magazines. Off the top of my head, I can name three magazines: @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @ORGANIZATION1. These magazines discuss topics like how to be better in bed, which is information that no child, including teenagers, should need. They also feature several unhealthy diets that teenagers might attempt, which could make them very sick or, if they are already thin, even lead to death. In conclusion, while I don't think there are many books that are extremely harmful to children's eyes and ears (romance books are usually too boring for kids to finish), I hope that libraries will take steps to prevent children from accessing inappropriate movies and magazines.
1512	4489	2	2	In libraries, there are some books, music, and magazines that are not suitable to be placed on the shelves. Young children are naturally curious and will try to look at anything they can get their hands on. The library contains both good and bad books. If someone finds a book or any material in the library offensive, it should be removed from the shelf. Children will look at whatever they find interesting, so the library should at least review the content of books when they arrive. This way, there's no need to worry about offensive materials. Movies are not a major concern. There are many bad movies, but people don't necessarily find them offensive as they and their children don't have to watch them. There is a significant amount of bad music. I believe there should be censorship on music because a lot of today's music is about drugs, alcohol, and violence. People don't want their children to be exposed to this type of content in the local library. I've seen on the news that people get upset when they see something inappropriate for underage children, and I would be angry too. Children often look up to songwriters, and we don't want them to be influenced by such negative music. All magazines can be offensive just by their covers and the cover people. Libraries usually don't put inappropriate magazines on the shelves, and there are many good magazines suitable for children. I think libraries avoid offensive magazines to prevent controversy. There are now many good, non - offensive magazines available for everyone. In conclusion, putting censorship on offensive magazines, movies, books, and music in libraries is a good idea. It helps keep children safe and avoids controversy, as parents don't want their children to be influenced by negative role models.
1513	4490	2	2	I am strongly of the opinion that censorship is wrong. First, it goes against our fundamental rights. We have the right to express, read, write, and watch what we desire, as long as it does not involve slandering others. I don't believe that the issue of slander is the main reason for the censorship of many books today. In all other cases, censorship is both wrong and immoral. Second, censorship should not be determined by someone else's opinion. Opinions vary greatly from person to person. If someone thinks a book, movie, or magazine should be censored, they can simply choose not to consume it themselves. Others may find the same content to be great, informative, or interesting. Finally, censorship is a characteristic of communist trends. The @LOCATION1 is a democratic country. Censoring non - detrimental and non - slanderous content would go against the fundamental principles of our democratic government. In conclusion, censorship should not be allowed anywhere. It is a communist - like practice that infringes on our rights. Given the wide variation in people's opinions about what should and should not be censored, it is impossible to determine a clear - cut boundary for censorship.
1514	4491	2	2	Throughout history, there have always been those who oppose the beliefs and ideals of others. For example, in @LOCATION1, statues were censored by the @CAPS1 church, and books were burned to preserve certain ideals. However, in the modern world, women are no longer looked down upon, science is not distorted, and ideas can spread freely through the internet. So, the question arises: is it the library's fault for providing uncensored content, or is it the parents' fault for not educating their children about the morality of such materials? Modern libraries have specific demographics for their items. Movies rated over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers, music appeals to teenagers, and books and other media attract younger children. It would be unfair to force libraries to censor the items that generate the most revenue just to protect children. Moreover, libraries generally don't allow young kids to check out @CAPS3 rated movies or media with parental advisory @CAPS4. Some people argue that books are the most dangerous for children and young adults. They claim that books can plant and strengthen ideas in a teen's mind, potentially turning them into an anti - Semitic or racist individual. However, this should not be blamed on the library. If a teen has solid moral values instilled by their parents, a single book should not have such a significant impact. In conclusion, if you find library materials offensive or are worried about your child's access, you can simply avoid the library. But if you, like me, appreciate the diverse and unfiltered content that libraries offer to the community and individuals, you should oppose the injustice done to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and yourself by censorship.
1515	4492	2	2	Censorship is a common issue in our daily lives. Children often hear curse words from their parents and are likely to repeat them. They should understand what cursing is and know that it is wrong. The choice of what children read should be up to them. Books for children should be censored, but adults should have the freedom to read any type of book they like. Children who have been sheltered should also learn that curse words are a part of reality. We can learn from everything we read, and there are many facts that teachers don't teach but books can. When uncensored content is spoken aloud, children are excited. If they read such content themselves, they can learn a great deal more. Without proper information from parents, children may miss out on some of the most important facts of life. It is unnecessary to have rated @CAPS1 movies. Parents should be able to watch mature movies with their children without constantly worrying about inappropriate content. The decision of whether children watch censored movies should be left to the parents. I always think it's a bad idea to have derogatory pictures on magazines. These pictures can give children negative thoughts, such as making them feel insecure about their appearance. Children have good memories and remember almost everything they see and hear. Ultimately, the choice of what children read should be theirs. In conclusion, while there is a need for some level of censorship in certain cases, we should also respect children's right to explore and learn from different types of content, and parents should play an active role in guiding them.
1516	4493	2	2	"@CAPS1 day @CAPS4 @CAPS3, my father was stopped by the police three times for @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5."" @CAPS6 is merely one of several quotes from a book I'm currently reading, which some individuals might find offensive. Overall, the book is rather soothing, but there are certain elements that could potentially cause offense. However, this does not imply that the book should be removed from library shelves. I firmly believe that libraries should not be compelled to take books off the shelves simply because they have offended someone. This is analogous to suggesting that one should eliminate everyone who has ever made an offensive comment in their lifetime, which would ultimately leave us with nothing. If someone finds the content of a book offensive, they should simply stop reading it, just as they would stop associating with an offensive person. Some magazines contain highly offensive material that reflects real - world conversations. Unlike typical non - fiction books that might use high - school - level insults, one has the choice not to subscribe to or even pick up such magazines. Nowadays, a vast array of things can offend people in countless ways. What might be offensive to @PERSON1 down the street could be amusing to @PERSON2 across town. It is impossible to please everyone. If books were removed from the shelves every time someone complained about offensive content, one would be attempting to satisfy everyone's individual desires. I think it would be reasonable to impose age restrictions on books. More offensive books could have higher age limits. At the junior high I attended, there were 'young adult' books. To access these, students either had to be in eighth grade or have a permission note from their guardian. Similar to movies, which have ratings to restrict viewership, books should also have such limitations. In conclusion, it would be extremely disappointing to me and many others if books, @CAPS7, movies, magazines, etc., were removed from the shelves and the market just because someone found them offensive. People have the freedom to ignore content they don't like. They can choose to read nursery rhymes if they prefer non - offensive material. Repeatedly removing books due to complaints is as absurd as eliminating every person who has made an offensive comment, and it would leave us with a dearth of literary and cultural resources."
1517	4494	2	2	Taking books off the library shelves? I firmly oppose this idea. When I go to the library, I'm drawn to mystery and scary books. They are so engaging that they keep me on the edge of my seat. However, some of the books I've read might not be suitable for younger children. There are voices calling for the removal of offensive books, music, and movies from the library, but I consider this a bad approach. People have the freedom to choose what they read or watch. Nowadays, many young kids visit the library for school - related purposes. I recall an instance when I had to borrow a movie about the Civil War from the library for a school project. The movie contained some disturbing scenes, but I had to watch it for my assignment. If it hadn't been available at the library, I would have been in a difficult situation. This is one of the reasons why I believe removing books and movies from the shelves is not a good idea. As I mentioned earlier, I'm a fan of mystery books. Some of these books have parts that could be offensive. The mystery book I'm currently reading is about the murder of a young girl. I understand that this might be offensive to young readers or those who have lost a loved one to murder. But this doesn't mean it should be removed from the library. If such books were taken away, what would happen to the readers who enjoy them? It seems unfair. For those who find library materials like books, movies, music, or magazines offensive, they can simply avoid using them. The library is a place where one can find a wide range of materials according to their interests. We should respect everyone's diverse interests. It is also a source of valuable information, even if some of it might be offensive. Removing books from the library is neither fair nor just. In conclusion, we should keep the library as a place that offers a rich variety of materials for all.
1518	4495	2	2	In my view, any form of censorship, especially in libraries, is unjustifiable. Libraries serve as public spaces where anyone can access books, @CAPS1, magazines, or movies. They provide equal access to information for people from all economic backgrounds. If we start censoring the opinions expressed in books, music, films, or magazine and newspaper articles, we are infringing on the authors' right to freedom of speech just because someone deems the content offensive. The right to free speech is a fundamental principle in the @LOCATION1. Here, people are entitled to hold their own opinions and beliefs. If a writer wishes to share their thoughts and ideas through writing, they should be allowed to do so. Writing is a powerful form of self - expression. Writers can use their imagination to create fantasy worlds and unique characters. Who has the authority to label a piece of writing as offensive? Who gets to decide which books or movies should be removed? If we were to remove every book that one person finds 'offensive', we would be left with nothing to read. For example, some people might find the @CAPS2 offensive, yet it is still available in libraries. Similarly, books about wizardry and vampires, which are very popular, might be offensive to some, but we don't remove them. What people find offensive is often just a matter of personal opinion, just like the opinions of the writers. In order to encourage young people to read, we need to provide them with materials that stimulate their interests. Sometimes, these materials might be considered 'offensive' by some. In conclusion, censorship in libraries goes against the principles of free speech and the diverse needs of readers. We should allow a wide range of materials to be available in libraries, respecting the rights of both writers and readers.
1519	4496	2	2	Libraries house a wide variety of books, not all of which are suitable for every individual. I firmly believe that libraries should censor books, movies, and magazines. This can be achieved either by placing offensive materials in a separate room accessible only to adults or by not stocking them at all. Many library books contain obscene content that young children should not be exposed to. I have visited the library numerous times, either alone or with others. I am well - aware that some of the books and movies in libraries are not appropriate for children. I look forward to the day when I can take my own child to the library, confident that the materials they encounter will be suitable for them. Magazines often discuss topics such as new relationships, pregnancies, etc. I don't want my young child to be exposed to such content. The library I usually visit displays magazines in a public area where everyone can view them. I don't think this is appropriate for young children. A parent should be able to take their child to the library, knowing that if the child runs up with a book, it will be something they are allowed to read. Libraries could create a separate room for books and movies that are not suitable for children, such as rated @CAPS1 movies or books with inappropriate content. This way, when young children are exploring the library, they won't be able to see or pick up these materials. I'm sure many parents share my concern. I don't want my child walking around talking about inappropriate books or movies they saw at the library. Since libraries offer a vast selection of magazines, books, and movies, they are not always a completely safe place for children to roam freely. By creating a separate room for non - child - friendly items, libraries can ensure that parents can take their children to the library without worry. This would make parents more comfortable letting their children explore and discover new books and movies. In conclusion, implementing such a censorship system in libraries is essential for protecting the innocence and well - being of young readers.
1520	4497	2	2	Censorship is a complex issue with arguments on both sides, but I am firmly against it. There are several reasons for my stance. Firstly, just because someone is offended by certain information or entertainment doesn't mean they have to engage with it. There are many others who may need or want access to that very material. Secondly, if a parent doesn't want their child to see something, removing it from public access is not the best solution. Finally, if everything that someone found offensive were removed, there would be nothing left to read, listen to, or watch. I believe censorship is wrong because those who are offended by certain content don't have to look at it. No one is forcing them to use or view offensive material. They should simply ignore it. On the other hand, people who don't find it offensive have the right to access it. For some, the library may be the only place where they can obtain such materials. Removing these materials would deprive those who need or want them of their right to access. Even a child may have a legitimate right to this information. Some parents may not want their children to see offensive content. However, removing it should not be the first reaction. Parents should trust their children not to look at inappropriate materials. If they can't trust their children, they should find a way to prevent their children from viewing it, rather than removing the content from the public domain. A responsible parent should be able to come up with a reasonable strategy to protect their child's exposure to unwanted content without taking away the rights of others. Imagine a library where each person in the community is offended by at least one book. If everyone were allowed to remove the book that offended them, there would be nothing left to read. Moreover, the person who removed one book might enjoy another book that someone else found offensive. Once the process of removal starts, it could lead to a domino effect, leaving the library empty. In conclusion, censorship is unjust. I, like many others, enjoy going to the library to pick out a good book. No one should have the power to take away this right from others. We should respect the diversity of opinions and the right to access information, and find better ways to manage the issue of offensive content rather than resorting to censorship.
1521	4498	2	2	"Have you ever encountered something, be it in written or auditory form, that is so disturbing that you question its right to be published? Nowadays, music, books, and magazines are inundated with inappropriate and unwholesome content that children are exposed to and may even base their lives on. All these resources containing such material can be found in libraries. We must either put an end to this situation or implement some form of censorship for library resources.  A library often has the reputation of being a dull and unexciting place. However, if a student in school mentions finding a really good book in the library, other students become curious. When they discover that the book contains references to drugs, they no longer perceive it as a boring library book. As a result, more and more people borrow this book and other similar ones. These children, with their new - found ""popular"" books, consider themselves ""cool"" and start emulating the behavior of the characters in the books, which can lead to disastrous consequences.  Music can have a similar impact. Over the past ten years, many music lyrics have incorporated sexual references, drug usage, and inappropriate behavior. Singers and writers have found that works containing these themes sell the most copies. Consequently, artists across various mediums are including such references in their books and songs. Now, singers are also creating music videos that not only feature these lyrics but also visually depict them. Children see these artists in the videos living what seems like a ""perfect life"" with attractive partners and plenty of money. They then try to replicate the artists' actions in an attempt to improve their own lives.  Movies have also followed this trend. Since movies with this kind of content have seen an increase in ratings, they are being included in films. All these forms of media are now filled with inappropriate material, and this has been the case for some time. How can we eliminate this content and prevent children from accessing these resources? No parent wants to hear their children using offensive language or imitating inappropriate behavior. Therefore, libraries need to implement censorship and remove such materials to ensure that minors do not receive the wrong message.  What happened to the good old days when music, movies, and art were regarded as special talents and did not pose a risk of leading children astray? We need to introduce censorship in libraries and return to a time when things were more under control."
1522	4499	2	2	"I was asked whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. My answer is no. I believe that one should not be in the library to criticize what others believe in. If one comes across an offensive book, movie, music, or magazine, the best course of action is to simply ignore it.  People often spend too much time worrying about what others think, even though they should focus on their own lives. The next time you encounter an offensive book, just walk away and don't give it a second thought. Everything can be offensive to someone. @PERSON2 was absolutely right when she said, ""...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...Then you have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" In today's world, children are already more informed than they should be, so why censor what they already know?  Imagine you like a particular series about the Holocaust, which combines multiple stories to depict the experiences of @CAPS1 in the concentration camps. But if a @CAPS2 reads it and has it removed from the shelves because they find it offensive, perhaps thinking it's a disgrace and lies about their home country, what would you do? Would you look for a new book, or would you be upset that you couldn't finish the series? Many people are overly sensitive and find things offensive every day when they shouldn't.  Some people act as if they are superior to others, and this is not right. If you are someone who takes offense easily at the content in books, movies, music, or magazines, you need to grow up and realize that you should focus on living your life rather than getting upset over trivial matters. In music, certain words may be acceptable for one person to use, but if someone from a different race sings about them, they may be accused of being racist. This is not the case; it is not a targeted offense. So, please stop complaining.  Katherine Paterson, @CAPS6, if you have a problem with children taking a book off the shelf, even if it may offend some, you should realize that it is a positive sign that the child is still trying to read and improve their reading skills. In conclusion, we should not be so quick to censor and remove books from the shelves."
1523	4500	2	2	There is a book in the library called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. If you read about @CAPS3, you might be moved to tears. In the book, @CAPS3 is forced to live in the basement, where he has to eat off the floor, consume his brother's vomit, and even eat worms. He is beaten, and his body is covered in bruises. His father broke his arm during a fight with his mother. His brothers can no longer tolerate his situation, so one of his brothers calls the police. When the police arrive, the family's situation changes.  Two years later, @CAPS3 and his brother are adopted. Their new mom and dad are kind to them, even though they have six brothers and five sisters in the new family. They all get along well and lead a good life after the death of their biological parents. This story shows that despite a difficult start, there can be a brighter future.
1524	4501	2	2	"When visiting a library, one has a wide range of items to choose from, including books, music, movies, and magazines. However, not all of these offerings are necessarily beneficial. There are numerous books, movies, and music albums that can be offensive or inappropriate for a library's audience. To protect children, offensive material should not be available on library shelves.  Although libraries offer many valuable resources, they also contain offensive or inappropriate items. For example, an explicit music album sitting on a library shelf can be accessed by anyone. By removing such albums, we can prevent younger children from being exposed to explicit content that most parents do not want their children to hear.  Movies are also a concern in libraries. Libraries often have @CAPS1 - rated movies available for borrowing. Most @CAPS1 - rated movies contain content that is not suitable for children. These movies receive this rating because of the material they contain. When these movies are shown on television, they are edited to make them suitable for all audiences. By removing @CAPS1 - rated movies from library shelves, we can keep young children away from inappropriate behavior.  Books are similar to movies and music. Some books on library shelves may be considered ""funny"" by some, but in reality, they can be harmful. There are books that include racial material and derogatory statements. Removing these books from library shelves can prevent people from being exposed to such offensive content.  For the well - being of children, all offensive material in libraries should be removed. If libraries eliminate all inappropriate materials, they can become a healthier and more stable environment for studying, as they were originally intended to be. By removing offensive content, libraries can make room for more educational books, movies, and other resources."
1525	4502	2	2	"What can be considered offensive in libraries? Offensive materials in libraries include inappropriate and uncensored books, music, magazines, movies, and other resources. However, I believe that these materials should not be removed from the shelves. The authors of these books are simply expressing their creativity.  From my personal experience, I have watched movies that some may find offensive. Whether a movie is offensive depends on its type. If a movie is rated @CAPS1, I expect to see blood, gory scenes, and nudity. If the movie is based on real - life events, I know that some of the content on the screen could potentially happen in the real world. Although most of these extreme situations may not occur, there is a possibility that they could happen to someone. These movies teach me to be more cautious about my actions and my surroundings.  In libraries, there should be no nudity - related websites, books, or magazines, as this is inappropriate for children, especially in a public library. However, books or movies with gory or bloody content should remain on the shelves. In my opinion, they can show the consequences of certain actions and teach others not to repeat them.  So, again, what can be offensive in libraries? Some may argue that books, magazines, or movies containing racial slurs are offensive. However, to others, it shows the harsh reality of the world. In my view, the authors are simply using their creativity to tell a story. Whether it is offensive or not is subjective.  In conclusion, I believe that the so - called ""offensive"" books, magazines, music, movies, and other materials should stay on the library shelves. For the reasons I have mentioned and others not stated, these materials can help people learn and gain a better understanding of the world."
1526	4503	2	2	Libraries should exercise greater caution regarding the materials they make available. Given the diverse daily foot - traffic, including people of all ages, certain materials should be appropriately placed. The library must enforce stricter control over the materials patrons access. It needs to become more organized.  Libraries are open to people of all ages. Children frequently visit and select various materials. However, they should be restricted to age - appropriate selections. By implementing more censorship and stricter controls, children can be prevented from accessing inappropriate materials. No one would want their seven - year - old exposed to offensive content.  Libraries should segregate adult - only materials from those intended for children. This reduces the likelihood of children obtaining inappropriate content. Additionally, some materials that the library deems suitable for children may be offensive to certain parents. For instance, books containing racism or other forms of discrimination, even if unintended, can have a negative impact on children.  Libraries need to assess whether materials are appropriate for the age group and the library's environment. Currently, children often check out books independently, which is a problem. I believe children should require parental consent to borrow books. Libraries often notice missing inventory too late. Children may take books they shouldn't have, and security may not question them. This can corrupt the child's mind, and the library is to blame.  Organization is crucial. Libraries should better organize their materials by reviewing the content on their shelves. I think library staff are lazy. With more effort, children can be kept away from unsuitable materials. Accidental mixing of adult and children's materials can occur but should be prevented for the sake of the children. In conclusion, libraries don't seem to care enough about children. Stricter rules, better security, and organization are needed to ensure children's safety.
1527	4504	2	2	In today's culture, censorship often takes a back seat. Pornography, vulgar language, and grotesque scenes in books and movies make them inappropriate for some. The media frequently portrays sensual elements and uses bad language. Thanks to the freedom provided by our country, people have the right to view and read what they want. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but in my view, there should be no censorship in libraries.  Libraries today have materials with bad images and questionable content. While there are elements in books and movies that children shouldn't view, libraries can't remove them. People enjoy such content, which is why the industry produces more rated - restricted movies than all other ratings combined, as they are the most profitable. In today's economy, libraries need to keep these materials to stay in business. If someone is offended, they should avoid those areas. Taking down offensive materials violates people's freedom. Censorship is a subjective topic and can't be decided unilaterally.  As I see it, the decision to censor books and movies shouldn't be based on personal opinion. Libraries have a duty to uphold people's freedoms and provide the entertainment they desire. Adult - content materials can also offer insights into what society shouldn't be like. Parents should regulate what their children watch, but adults should have the freedom to read and watch whatever they choose. In conclusion, libraries should maintain their current approach and not implement censorship.
1528	4505	2	2	I'm @PERSON1, and I want to share something that people need to hear. I think libraries are great for people of all ages, but there are books in libraries that children shouldn't read or even see. These books should be placed in a separate section.  Once, my little brother asked to go to the library with me. I didn't want to take him but couldn't say no. He was so excited, putting on his shoes and running to the door. When we arrived at the library, he ran towards the doors, and I chased after him and told him not to run off. Inside the large library, he went to find a book, and I looked for one too. I found an interesting book and started reading. Then, he ran to me and asked me to look at the book he'd found. When he handed it to me, I was shocked. It was not a children's book at all; it was one of the worst I'd ever seen. We left the library and never went back.  I firmly believe that books inappropriate for children should be in a separate, adults - only section in libraries. This should be the standard for all libraries. In conclusion, separating inappropriate books is essential to protect children from unsuitable content.
1529	4506	2	2	Censorship in libraries has been a long - standing concern in school systems. In many school libraries, certain books, music, movies, and magazines have been removed due to content such as violence, sexual acts, drug use, and inappropriate language. Parents of young children are often worried about what their kids are exposed to at school. They don't want their children to be introduced to such things at a young age, as it could influence them to engage in these activities.  In my opinion, some materials in school libraries should be removed, but this is not necessary in public libraries, which can be divided into age - appropriate sections. In elementary and middle - school libraries, items should be censored because young students don't need to be exposed to inappropriate or violent content. In a school setting, children should learn about drug use and sexual activity through health classes, where they can gain accurate and educational information, rather than from songs, movies, or other media.  Many movies have violent and inappropriate scenes, and many contemporary songs are extremely inappropriate for young children. There are also books and magazines that young students shouldn't read at school because of their content. Therefore, I believe that censorship in libraries is a good thing. In conclusion, appropriate censorship in school libraries can protect young students from harmful content.
1530	4507	2	2	We often don't think twice when our children check out books from libraries. However, we don't want our children to get hold of censored bad books, movies, music, or magazines. Parents don't want to come home and find their child has learned a new bad word from a book, movie, or magazine they borrowed from the library. A trip to the library can have a negative influence on a child's attitude.  So, children should have a dedicated section in the library to pick out books, and they shouldn't be able to check out censored materials. We need to make sure our children understand the importance of this. In conclusion, creating a safe and appropriate environment in libraries for children by segregating materials is essential to protect them from bad influences.
1531	4508	2	2	I firmly believe that everyone holds their own opinions regarding what they listen to, watch, and read. I am convinced that certain things can transform the world. If we were to remove everything that someone might find offensive, there would be nothing left to sell because virtually everything is offensive to at least one person. I think we should eliminate content that could incite weak - minded individuals to act inappropriately in real life after being exposed to it. I believe that by changing what we see and hear, we can change the world, addressing issues we previously couldn't conceive of. In conclusion, respecting individual opinions while filtering harmful content is crucial for a positive transformation of the world.
1532	4509	2	2	I'm of the opinion that censorship should be permitted in high school. First, students can gain a great deal from reading censored books or watching censored movies. If books are considered inappropriate for school, it's questionable why they're even present. I find it rather silly that movies are restricted due to their ratings. Just because they might contain nudity or bad language doesn't mean high - school students can't watch them. We're mature enough, and these movies can be educational. However, I acknowledge that censorship has both positive and negative aspects, but on the whole, it should be allowed. I personally think students learn better from recent R - rated movies than from some old black - and - white ones. Students are more engaged with interesting movies, while many fall asleep or lose interest during old movies. Also, allowing students to listen to music while working can improve concentration, as I've experienced. So, censorship should be allowed in high schools. In conclusion, considering the educational value and student engagement, permitting censorship in high school makes sense.
1533	4510	2	2	The question of whether there should be censorship in libraries is a divisive one. Some advocate for it, while others oppose. Cultural books and magazines can be offensive to certain readers, and history books can also cause offense depending on one's lifestyle or background. Those in favor of censorship often have the concern of protecting young children from inappropriate content. Parents don't want their vulnerable kids exposed to such materials. On the other hand, opponents argue that people enter the library at their own risk. A book offensive to one person might be valuable to another. Not all offensive books are fiction. Cultural materials from other countries can be graphic and contain age - appropriate language. These materials simply present facts about how people in other countries live. They shouldn't be censored, though a separate section could be created. History books can be controversial, especially regarding religion, race, and origin. But they should not be censored as they teach kids about the past. In my view, there should be no censorship in libraries. A section for potentially 'offensive' materials could be set up, but books should not be removed from the shelves. After all, what one person finds offensive, another may find interesting. In conclusion, a balanced approach that respects diverse opinions and preserves access to knowledge is the best way forward for library censorship.
1534	4511	2	2	Nowadays, millions of teenagers are constantly exposed to a plethora of media junk, including movies, music, magazines, books, and commercials. Parents, teachers, and governments censor such materials to shield students and the general public from offensive or hard - to - explain topics. But is this the right decision? In reality, we can't ignore the harsh realities of the world. Instead, parents and teachers should prepare us to face them when we go out on our own. This raises the question: is it justifiable to censor certain library books that could potentially educate us? When information is concealed, the right to knowledge is violated. Moreover, what one person deems offensive, another may not. This topic is too subjective to be regulated. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if everyone followed a strict censorship approach, no books would be available to anyone. In conclusion, library censorship should be condemned as limiting our access to knowledge will ultimately harm us.
1535	4512	2	2	I believe that censoring library books has both positive and negative aspects. The level of censorship should vary according to the type of library. In elementary school libraries, it is appropriate to censor the books purchased and used. Elementary - school children are less mature, and their reading levels are not as advanced. Parents don't want their kids exposed to books with sex, drug use, or violence, as it might give them wrong ideas. In contrast, high - school students, like me, are interested in such books. We are mature enough to know not to act on what we read and are already aware of most of the content. High schools should have less censorship to allow students to read what they like. Public libraries should have age - based sections, which many already do, so parents can guide their children appropriately. Everyone has the right to choose what to read, even if it's potentially offensive. I don't think offensive books should be removed from the shelves because books are a source of education, entertainment, and distraction. However, censoring and categorizing books can reduce the chances of young children accessing inappropriate content and keep parents satisfied. In conclusion, a balanced approach to library book censorship, considering the different needs of various age groups, is the most reasonable solution.
1536	4513	2	2	In our nation, we enjoy numerous freedoms, including the freedom to access the information we desire through reading, listening, and viewing. This freedom allows individuals to have diverse preferences, such as the television shows they watch, the books they read in their leisure time, and the music they enjoy. However, if we were granted the right to remove content we dislike, it would undermine the enjoyment of others and ultimately erode our freedom. Many authors, musicians, and directors have emphasized the significance of this freedom for a fulfilling and creative life.  As individuals, we hold different perspectives on various matters. Fortunately, our freedoms enable us to maintain these views without impeding the opinions and ideas of others. If we were to remove books, movies, magazines, etc., there would be nothing left for anyone. Libraries would be emptied, classrooms would lack books, and stores would have no products. We should not have the right to eliminate content that we deem inappropriate or that does not align with our values or interests.  Although the idea of removing content may seem appealing, we must consider the thoughts and ideas of others. For instance, public libraries and school libraries offer books catering to the individual preferences of children, teens, and adults. Allowing the right to remove content would undermine the existence of these libraries, which foster individuality, and prevent people from fully exercising their freedom of choice. Everyone should be allowed to express their individuality.  Imagine if this right were extended to the food we purchase. We all have different food preferences, and just as we have books we favor and others we avoid, applying this right to food would lead to a disastrous situation where there would be no food available in restaurants, schools, or even at home.  We should not possess this right as it would be unfair to everyone. While our views may differ, we share similar needs. Our freedom lies in the freedom of choice. If we find a particular book, movie, or magazine inappropriate, we should allow others the opportunity to decide if it suits their values and interests. Others will do the same. After all, individuality and choice are the foundations of our freedoms.
1537	4514	2	2	"The question of whether offensive books should be removed from shelves raises several complex issues. Who determines what is offensive and to whom? These questions can lead to significant conflict among people. Additionally, removing books from shelves may limit our ability to learn and gain different perspectives.  Firstly, determining what is offensive is subjective, as anything can potentially offend someone. Removing a book from the shelves may also offend the author and their followers. Addressing the issue of offensive content by removing books could create more problems than leaving the books on the shelves. If the concern is about offending others, it may be better to leave the books alone rather than trying to please one group at the expense of another.  Secondly, removing books from the shelves may limit our ability to learn and understand different viewpoints. If offensive books had always been removed, we would not have the knowledge we possess today. For example, a biology book may be offensive to individuals whose religious beliefs conflict with its content, while a religious document may be offensive to those who believe in the scientific explanations presented in biology books. If we removed both types of books due to their potential to offend, we would lose both religion and modern science. This example can be applied to any topic or genre of book, as people can find various things offensive.  As a solution, it is unrealistic to please everyone. If one person is satisfied, another may be offended, and vice versa. Labeling books with warnings such as ""some may find this offensive"" or ""this material may be offensive"" can provide a warning to readers, allowing them to make an informed decision about whether to read the book. Similar to the parental warnings on CDs, this approach may not completely eliminate the issue of offensive content but can significantly reduce complaints.  In conclusion, books should remain on the shelves, regardless of complaints about their offensive nature. Removing books could lead to the removal of all books, resulting in a lack of education and learning. While leaving offensive books on the shelves may cause controversy, implementing warnings and following proper procedures can greatly reduce the associated issues. The next time you consider having a book removed from the shelves, think about the broader implications."
1538	4515	2	2	I somewhat agree with Katherine's statement. In middle or elementary schools, if a student finds a book or magazine offensive, they should inform the librarian. It's inevitable that there will be books, movies, or magazines with inappropriate content. One day, my friend and I were in the library looking for a book, and that's when I discovered the @CAPS1 series. As I read more of the books, I noticed they became more mature. The last book, @ORGANIZATION1, contains a lot of profanity. However, this doesn't mean I or other high - school students aren't mature enough to understand it. We can't protect children from everything, including curse words.  If you come across an offensive book at a local library and want it removed, take it to the librarian and talk to them. They might understand and take action, or they might wait to see if others also want it removed. The point is, we can't always shield our children from violent words, movies, or magazines, but we can stand up for what we believe is right and try to make a difference.
1539	4516	2	2	The impact of mature - themed books on kids has sparked discussions about library censorship. Some people are trying to censor libraries based on what their kids are reading or how they're behaving. However, I oppose library censorship. Instead, libraries could create a section for explicit books to prevent young children from accessing them.  Rather than removing all books, creating an age - restricted section at the back of the library could be a better solution. Requiring @CAPS1 to verify that patrons are of the appropriate age would allow the library to keep all its books, satisfy customers, and most importantly, keep parents happy.  Another reason against library censorship is that it could lead to a decline in the number of customers. When libraries don't have the books people want to read, customers become unhappy, and the library's popularity drops.  I understand the concern about kids' behavior, which is why some people advocate for censorship. Censorship might prevent young kids from imitating the actions in books. However, it's better not to censor libraries to keep the readers of these books satisfied.  In conclusion, I oppose library censorship because it would upset readers and likely cause a decline in the library's popularity, leading to fewer people visiting. Those who oppose censorship should take action to preserve the current state of libraries.
1540	4517	2	2	In today's world, libraries are widely used by people for research, study, and finding interesting books. However, the issue of exposing personal and adult - like content has raised concerns. I believe that libraries should implement censorship, and here are my reasons.  One reason is that younger children use libraries. Parents would strongly object to their children reading detailed and adult - oriented books. A library should be a place where people of all ages can escape reality, not a place where they worry about what they might find on the shelves.  If libraries want to keep certain books in stock, they should set an age limit. This would prevent younger audiences from accessing these books. Additionally, parents could work with the library to set individual age limits for their children.  Parents also play a crucial role in preventing offensive viewing. They should monitor what their children read, watch, and listen to.  Censorship is an effective way to prevent the exposure of adult - like issues. More public places should adopt a censorship system. The world needs to recognize that some audiences are not ready for certain aspects of reality. In conclusion, implementing censorship in libraries can create a more suitable environment for all users and protect younger audiences from inappropriate content.
1541	4518	2	2	"Libraries across the globe house an extensive array of books, encompassing both high - quality and sub - standard ones. Inevitably, there will always be elements within a book that may offend the reader or someone close to them, which largely depends on an individual's sensitivity. The primary motivations for people to advocate for book bans or their removal from libraries are the presence of racial slurs, religious content, and sexual material.  It is proposed that the decision of whether to keep a book on the library shelf or remove it should rest with the library. Magazines, along with movies and various types of music, also present similar issues. Some argue that libraries are inundated with vulgar, racial, or inappropriate content in the form of movies, books, and more. For parents worried about their children accessing such materials, they should implement some form of restriction. If an individual wishes to rent potentially inappropriate items, parental permission should be required.  Removing all such materials from the library is not a viable solution. It only incites anger and can lead to legal disputes and other complications. Libraries should create sections for books of different ratings to prevent children from obtaining ""bad"" books. Many of the books in libraries carry significant meaning, even if they contain foul language or hate - related content, as it often reflects the mood of the story or the true feelings of the characters. For instance, if a book like "" [Title with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2]"" lacked anger, emotion, or passion, it would be a dull read. Authors incorporate language, sexual content, and violence into books, movies, and magazines to engage specific audiences. Removing these elements would deprive certain individuals of the entertainment they enjoy from the materials they read. In conclusion, libraries need to manage content in a balanced way, respecting the rights of both readers and the integrity of the works."
1542	4519	2	2	"Imagine a day when the school library stands empty of books. A librarian strolls through the now - silent corridors, lost in memories of the pre - censorship era, when people didn't constantly tell her what they found offensive. Everyone holds different views, but this does not justify forcing others to conform.  If someone finds a book offensive, the simple solution is to avoid picking it up. By pushing for a book's removal, they imply that they know best, which is often not the case. For example, a [@CAPS2] in [@LOCATION1] might be offended by a fashion magazine that merely has an advertisement for body wash. She might claim, "" [@CAPS3] child shouldn't see things like this"" and demand its removal from the library. Does this really make sense? Clearly not.  Moreover, if one person can remove a magazine, others will think they have the same power. Censorship could become a common practice, leading to daily book discards. This is a small - scale issue, but if it escalates to higher authorities, a book could be removed from all schools in [@LOCATION1]. This raises a crucial question: Should ordinary citizens decide what others can read? The answer is a resounding no.  Let's also consider the impact on authors. Take [@PERSON1] as an example. What would happen to her if the series "" [@CAPS4 @CAPS5]"" were banned from schools? And what about the students who love to read? Banning books takes away good reading materials from students just because someone doesn't believe in magic or has a personal issue.  The librarian from the beginning is leaving now, as there are no more books to check out, return, or read. Students have to go to public libraries, but they may still be discouraged from reading due to restricted access. This situation should not occur. Books should not be censored, and those with a problem with a particular book should not ruin it for everyone. In conclusion, censorship in schools undermines the rights of readers and authors, and we should respect the diversity of literary works."
1543	4520	2	2	The question of whether certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves when deemed offensive is complex. It largely depends on the degree of offensiveness. If the material is highly provocative, racist, or beyond the comprehension and maturity level of the intended audience, it may not be suitable for unrestricted access. Alternatively, the materials could be restricted or placed in a special section accessible only to certain individuals. This decision should take into account the intelligence, maturity, and age of the people who can access these materials.  Rather than removing these materials, it is more appropriate to impose restrictions. While schools and libraries should play a role in managing access, parents also have a responsibility. If a guardian deems a particular material appropriate for their child, the child should be allowed to access it. Although there may be differences between the views of guardians and those of schools or libraries, the final decision often lies with the guardian. Schools and libraries cannot impose their moral standards or intelligence judgments on everyone.  In general, materials should not be removed unless a group including parents, teachers, school board members, and library staff deems it necessary. Just because one parent believes a book is inappropriate for their child does not mean it should be banned for others. Everyone has different opinions on what is acceptable, so it is unfair to enforce a single standard.  If a parent does not want their child to access a certain material, they can simply restrict their child's access. If they believe a material is inappropriate for all children, they can voice their concerns, but others may not agree. Materials considered inappropriate by a respected group should be restricted or accompanied by a warning, not completely banned. In conclusion, a balanced approach that respects individual rights and diverse opinions is necessary when dealing with potentially offensive materials in educational and public institutions.
1544	4521	2	2	Suppose you discover a movie you truly enjoy at the library, only to find it removed with no other way to obtain it. Just because one person dislikes something at the library does not mean it lacks educational value and should be discarded. Different people have different preferences, and what one person dislikes may be appealing to another.  Movies serve as excellent visual aids. Some people learn better through visual means, as it helps them understand the purpose and cause of a situation more clearly and may accelerate the learning process. Movies can also show things that cannot be visualized through reading a book. Personally, I find that watching movies makes it seem as if I'm having a conversation with the actors. Even if the content is not entirely appropriate, movies provide a visual representation of what is happening. Therefore, movies should not be removed simply because someone deems them vulgar and uncensored.  Music is another important element that should not be eliminated from the library. It is one of the few things that can calm a person down, enabling them to refocus. Music soothes the mind, allowing individuals to relax without disturbing others. It also blocks out distracting noises. These are all reasons why music should remain in the library.  Magazines and books are the foundation of a library. Without them, a library would lose its essence. Books are fundamental to the learning process, and people acquire the most knowledge from them. Removing magazines and books is equivalent to hindering people's access to education and knowledge.  If movies are removed from the library, people will lose an alternative visual learning method. Without music, it will be more difficult to concentrate due to distractions. And if books and magazines are taken away, the library will cease to be a place of learning. In conclusion, the library should retain movies, music, books, and magazines to fulfill its educational and entertainment functions.
1545	4522	2	2	I may not be an avid reader, but I firmly believe that individuals should have the right to publish any content on any topic, whether it's a graphic novel or a tabloid magazine. No material should be removed from the shelves just because it offends someone. If a person is offended, they should simply refrain from picking it up and reading it.  Suppose I want to write a book, and some people find it disgusting. I should still have the right to write and sell it. People often try to ban or get rid of things they have a problem with, but they should learn to accept differences. We all have rights, and we should exercise them to the fullest extent.  I may be considered old - fashioned, but I stand by the principle of freedom of speech. Our soldiers have fought and sacrificed for the freedoms we enjoy every day. For example, I believe that excessive drinking every [@DATE1] of the week is wrong, but I don't go around making a fuss about it. Instead, I accept it, just as people should accept things they don't like.  In this essay, I hope I've made valid points about making sacrifices, dealing with things we don't like, and not trying to change what we can't. We should respect the rights of others to express themselves through various forms of media. In conclusion, freedom of expression is a fundamental right that should be protected, and we should learn to coexist with diverse content.
1546	4523	2	2	In contemporary society, libraries are repositories of a vast array of materials, including books, magazines, music, and movies, which span a wide spectrum of topics. For instance, movies can fall into genres such as comedy, mystery, or adventure. However, some of these materials may be offensive to certain viewers and thus should be removed from libraries. One compelling reason for removing offensive materials is their potential to incite violence in teenagers. Prolonged exposure to violent content in books or movies may lead teenagers to perceive violent behavior as acceptable. They may fail to recognize that violence is not the solution to most problems and overlook alternative approaches. A real - life example that illustrates this occurred in a high school. A top - performing student received a grade she deemed unjust from a teacher. Subsequently, she painted her face white, applied red lipstick, and brought a knife to the teacher's classroom during school hours, threatening to kill the teacher. Her inspiration was drawn from the movie '@CAPS1', and her costume resembled the @CAPS2. Some students in the classroom called @NUM1, and the police managed to persuade her to放下 the knife. Had she not seen the movie, this threatening incident might have been avoided. Another reason is that offensive materials can be inappropriate for younger children. Children may casually browse books and magazines in the library without checking them out, and no one would be aware of their exposure to the content. Some library books cover sensitive topics such as sex and drugs. Reading such materials can plant harmful ideas in a child's mind. I once read a book with similar content, and I believe it could have a negative impact on a child. In conclusion, offensive materials in libraries should be removed. They can trigger violent behavior in individuals and are inappropriate for younger children. Overall, library materials can be offensive to some people, and taking action to remove such content is necessary.
1547	4524	2	2	Libraries offer a diverse collection of books suitable for all readers. I firmly believe that libraries should not be compelled to remove books simply because some individuals find them offensive, while others may appreciate the author. If you come across a displeasing book in the library, the simple solution is to leave it on the shelf and move on. As author Katherine Paterson aptly stated, if we start removing books, there will be nothing left to read. It's true that some books are not suitable for young children or certain adults. That's why parents should take responsibility and monitor their children's reading choices. Libraries are divided into sections for different age groups, like the children's section for young kids and the adult section for adults. Young children should not be allowed to access books from the adult section. Libraries have functioned well for years and will continue to do so. There is no need to remove specific books just because someone dislikes them or doesn't want their children to read them. Instead, one should ignore the unappealing books and find ones that match their interests. Books are a valuable source of knowledge, and eliminating them would deprive us of learning opportunities. They are an integral part of history, and removing them is unjust. Therefore, books should remain on the library shelves where they belong.
1548	4525	2	2	Libraries house books of various lengths, and whether a book is good or bad depends on the reader's opinion. There is no valid reason to remove a book from the library shelf just because someone is offended by it. Library books are available for everyone, and removing one denies others the chance to read it. Would you destroy food just because it doesn't taste good to you? Of course not; you would simply choose not to have it again. Similarly, it's unjust for someone to remove a book due to personal offense. One's views are merely opinions and not universal truths. Everyone has different perspectives, like @PERSON1 who lives down the street. Removing a book imposes one's views on others. In conclusion, a book's quality is subjective. No one should have the right to remove a book from the library shelf. Books are meant to be read and interpreted by individual readers, and this freedom should be preserved.
1549	4526	2	2	Everyone in the world holds opinions, and while some people may find certain materials offensive, others find them interesting and enjoyable. Personally, I've visited the library only around @NUM1 times, mainly to rent movies, and I've never encountered such issues. There are individuals who can't tolerate content like blood, gore, racism in books, movies, and music, while others love it. I believe it's wrong to deprive people of what they find interesting. Some may label certain materials as vulgar, but others consider them masterpieces. Libraries generally don't stock overly gory or sexually - explicit movies or magazines, though such content may be found in some books. Modern music can be extremely vulgar, disrespectful, sexual, and involve gang - related violence, which is a major concern for children. Libraries usually offer classic music like Michael Jackson, The @CAPS1, slow jams like @CAPS2 - Kelly, positive rap, country music, and soothing jazz. The music popular among children today has negative and violent themes that are not suitable for young and impressionable minds. I don't think these materials should be removed from library shelves, but I do believe there should be an age restriction for accessing them. This way, people can still enjoy what they like, while protecting the younger generation from inappropriate content.
1550	4527	2	2	In today's world, almost anything imaginable can be found. If there is good content, there is also bad. Unfortunately, this bad content is readily available on library shelves across the country, waiting for someone to discover it. As an @CAPS1, every individual has the right to read or do as they please. However, the situation is different when it comes to children. A child may accidentally stumble upon inappropriate material, and it's unfair to hold them accountable. This raises questions about who is to blame and what the solution should be. Censorship in libraries is a complex issue. While some may advocate for it, others believe that people should have the freedom to access any material. I have personal experience with this. On a hot @DATE1 day, I went to the library to find something to do indoors. Since I was familiar with the kid - section, I explored other areas. After getting tired of reading titles, I judged books by their covers and found an adult love story. It was a vivid and detailed account of an older, sexually active couple's relationship, which left me shocked as a child. This experience makes me believe that censorship in libraries is a wise measure. Not every child will have the same experience, but I was deeply traumatized. I can understand how others might feel in similar situations. Those who haven't encountered such material may think it's unfair to censor, but if they were in the shoes of an innocent child exposed to inappropriate content, they might change their minds. If someone seeks more intense or explicit content, they can visit a bookstore instead of a public library. As a teenager without children, I can only imagine the distress parents would feel if their children were emotionally scarred by such experiences. Children should be protected from the bad aspects of the world, and censoring library materials is the most effective way to achieve this.
1551	4528	2	2	Every day, hundreds of individuals visit the local library. The library provides a wide range of materials, including books, music, movies, magazines, and newspapers. However, a question arises: what 'limits' does the library impose on the content of these materials? People from all walks of life visit the library. We all, at some point in our lives, make use of its resources. Different groups of people have diverse interests, some of which may offend others. The central question is whether certain subjects should be restricted or excluded from libraries. Limiting or censoring the media in libraries would likely lead to nearly empty shelves. The reality is that in most libraries, there will always be someone who takes offense to certain items; it's impossible to satisfy everyone. Additionally, some of these potentially controversial topics can serve educational purposes. For example, anatomy books are used by high - school and college students for study, but some mothers may find them inappropriate for young children. This is why libraries have separate sections for different audiences, such as children's, 'tween', and adult sections. Moreover, everyone has unique interests. Personally, I can't stand rap music, but my sister loves it. Even though I find some of the lyrics offensive, it's my choice whether to listen or not. Songwriters, singers, publishers, and authors have the freedom to create their works. We have no right to tell them they can't write about sex, drugs, or murder, as these are part of our daily lives. If children don't encounter such content in libraries, they will likely come across it elsewhere. In conclusion, 'offensive' material should not be removed from libraries. If we do so, there will be little left to read, watch, or listen to, as everyone will find something offensive.
1552	4529	2	2	Dear [Newspaper Name], the article you wrote last week really struck a chord with me. It was about whether certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some people. At first, I thought that if something offended people, we should take it down. After all, why sell something that offends? But then I reconsidered. People have the right to freedom of expression. If this is how they want to communicate, they should be allowed to voice their thoughts. Our great country was founded on the principle that everyone is equal and entitled to freedom of expression. If people want to rap like Lil Wayne or write something in a book that others don't like, it's their way of sharing their feelings. If you don't like it, you don't have to buy it or pay attention. For instance, if I were a rapper, I'd express myself freely because it's my way of telling the world how I feel. If you don't like something in a book, don't go on TV to ridicule it. Instead, write a letter to the author and share your thoughts. Every person, regardless of their race or background, has the right to freedom of expression. This right was given to us for a reason. Even if you think an idea is silly, you should share it because others might find it amazing. We are all created equal, so we should treat others as we'd like to be treated. I want to thank you for writing that article. It really opened my eyes to how I should view the world. Thank you for making me think. Sincerely, [Your Name]
1553	4530	2	2	I believe that certain types of books, magazines, movies, and music may offend some people, depending on their content. There are materials that are suitable for kids, such as age - appropriate games, music, and content about animals and cultures. However, I strongly oppose having materials with sexual harassment, offensive language, or other inappropriate content in libraries. This kind of content can be dangerous and offensive to parents and people, whether they have children or not. I think if such materials are in libraries, they should be removed. We don't want kids to learn disrespectful behavior or inappropriate ideas that don't align with their education and age. I also disagree with the type of music that some artists create, which often talks about drugs, gangs, narcotrafficking, and sex. I've heard this on the radio, and it can have a negative influence on kids, leading them in the wrong direction. As parents, we want our children to have a good future and be successful. We don't want them to be exposed to such harmful content. I've seen that in some parts of the world, people are being killed because of drug - related activities. Drugs are being sold, and innocent people, including kids, are being hurt. If kids consume drugs, they could be our own children or the children of our friends. Sometimes, if they can't pay for the drugs, they are killed. The police are constantly trying to catch these criminals. I hope that artists and those who put such content in libraries think twice. They may think they are doing something good, but in reality, they could be doing something wrong. In conclusion, we need to be more careful about the content in libraries to protect the well - being of our children.
1554	4531	2	2	Book censorship is a significant issue in [Location]. Two common questions are: 'Should there be an age limit on what people can check out?' and 'Did they let my child check that out?' In my opinion, books should have an age limit. Children under [Number] years old need access to books suitable for their age group. There are numerous books available for all age ranges. Kids under [Number] should not be able to check out materials with offensive language, racial slurs, or inappropriate behavior from characters or artists. Another reason for age limits in libraries is that kids can get the wrong ideas from certain content. For example, if a book says '[Statement]', it's something a child shouldn't read. It could mislead the child about what they 'could' do. The age limits for book shelves should be as follows: [Details]. Implementing age - appropriate sections for books would likely ease parents' concerns about what their kids are reading. It would also assist kids in choosing appropriate reading materials. I am confident that with these age limits, the questions about age - restricted check - outs will be answered. Having age groups for books is a great solution to the problem of book censorship in [Location].
1555	4532	2	2	In libraries, there are numerous books that often make people wonder why they are on the shelves. People frequently stand in front of a book and ask themselves, 'Why in the world is this book here?' What many people may not realize is that every book has a purpose. Published books can teach history, manners, and literature, or they can take readers on an adventure. Of course, one may come across a book that is offensive to someone, perhaps even oneself. For example, I once read a first - person novel about slavery in our school library. It was about a boy who was sold to a different plantation owner and separated from his family. Some people might be offended by the use of derogatory terms for [Group], but this book helps us understand the pain that slavery inflicted on people. In any library, from an elementary school library to a public one, you'll always find at least one book about [Controversial Topic]. Almost everyone would be offended by these books because [Reason], but they must remain in libraries due to historical significance. We can't remove these books just because they offend many people. That would be like erasing [Controversial Topic] from history, which is unacceptable. Whether people admit it or not, they've likely encountered at least one offensive book. This is almost a natural occurrence. However, removing books from the shelves would also be offensive to many. People understand that books educate us, and we need them to know what is possible, what has happened, and what might happen. Books are here for a reason, and they should stay.
1556	4533	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, and magazines, should not be removed simply because they may offend some individuals. Censorship is a complex issue, and libraries have the right to curate their collections according to their own judgment. While it's true that some content may be inappropriate for children, libraries typically have dedicated children's sections to ensure that young readers are not exposed to such material.  No one has the right to dictate where stores or libraries should place their items. There are people in [LOCATION1] who may wish to access content that parents might deem inappropriate for their children. In such cases, parents should take responsibility and prevent their children from visiting places where they know such material is available.  Everyone has the right to decide what they want to place and access. There are alternative options, such as ordering books online or accompanying children to the library. When I was a young girl, my mother always supervised me, so I never had to worry about encountering inappropriate content. Nowadays, children are generally able to distinguish right from wrong and know what they should and should not read.  If a librarian or an adult notices children accessing inappropriate content, they should intervene and guide the children away from such material. In conclusion, I maintain that people should have the right to place and access materials as they see fit, as it is their property and a matter of personal choice.
1557	4534	2	2	Have you ever read a book or magazine that you disliked so much that you thought removing it from the shelf would save others from wasting their time? Or have you encountered a book or song that was not offensive to you but might be offensive to others based on their race or gender? Many people face this issue, and I have personally experienced it as well. However, this does not mean that such materials should be removed from the shelves.  If everyone in the world were to go to a library and discard one book they despised from their local library, there would be very few books left. If someone has a problem with the content of a book, magazine, or song, they simply should not read or listen to it. Others may enjoy reading about that topic or listening to that kind of music.  I understand that some books may be offensive to certain individuals, but they should refrain from reading them if they find them offensive. For example, books about slavery may be offensive to some, but they are a part of history, and some people may be interested in learning about this subject or may need the information for a research project. Similarly, there are books on [CAPS1] that some may find offensive, but it is also a part of history that high - school students may study for research papers.  There are various reasons for reading a book. If someone reads a book for enjoyment and finds it offensive, they should choose a different topic. Just because a person dislikes a book or its topic does not give them the right to remove it from the shelf. If parents do not want their children to read about a particular topic, they should guide them when checking out books.  Regarding songs, if people find the profanity in a song offensive, they should not listen to it. Songwriters have the right to write about what they want, and stores will sell albums that are profitable. Parents can simply tell their children not to listen to such songs. In conclusion, materials should not be removed from the shelves just because some people find them offensive; instead, individuals should make their own choices about what to consume.
1558	4535	2	2	Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be removed from the shelves as they contain valuable information that someone may want to access. Removing them would deprive those who need or want to use them of the opportunity. For instance, if a person needs a book for a research paper, removing relevant books would leave them without the necessary resources. At the same time, different people may have different views on what should be removed; one person may think non - educational books should go, while another may want to keep them.  If there are concerns about inappropriate language or nudity in a book or movie, libraries can create age - restricted areas. I once witnessed a woman at the library getting upset because her son had a movie and a book that she considered inappropriate. However, these items were in an area where minors were not supposed to access them. It was not the library's fault that the child was in the wrong place.  These products should remain on the shelves because they are there for a reason. If certain people do not like a product and it is removed, those who do like it will lose access. If there are valid reasons to remove a product, it should be moved to a place where those who want to use it can still access it. In conclusion, keeping these products on the shelves ensures that people who need or want to use them can do so.
1559	4536	2	2	To [CAPS1] [CAPS2] [MONTH1] [CAPS3], the question of whether censorship deserves a place in our society is highly controversial. Some people claim that certain literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others believe that the words of artists and authors convey feelings and hidden messages, even within vulgar language, and this is where I stand.  It seems that whenever we discuss this issue, censorship keeps resurfacing. Those opposed to the freedom of writing and music often believe they must enforce proper etiquette and have everyone conform. Unfortunately, these people often hold significant power in deciding what is allowed and what is not, leaving many of us with little say in the matter.  In my opinion, there are two sides to this story. However, I believe that most of what is considered 'censored' material should not be censored at all. There is only one situation where I think censorship is necessary: songs that consist of nothing but vulgar language for [NUM1] and a half minutes.  All other material, whether it is [CAPS4] rapping or [PERSON1] writing, is acceptable. Many people need to listen to the lyrics or read the words carefully to understand the full message before assuming there is a problem. For example, [Great CAPS5] of [ORGANIZATION1] always has meaningful messages in his music, but because some of his words are considered inappropriate, the radio censors them, and the message can be lost.  Music and literature should be considered rights, similar to the concept of equal rights. It is like talking, but with pages or instruments. In conclusion, I hope my views have made some people reconsider their stance on this debatable topic. If not, it is their loss. Thank you for your time. A [CAPS6] to the [CAPS7], [LOCATION1].
1560	4537	2	2	Everyone had a favorite movie, song, or book when they were young. Nowadays, some of this media may not be child - friendly. Songs may hint at sexual activities, books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published, and there are movies depicting violent and inappropriate behaviors that children should not see. However, this does not mean that public places like libraries should limit access to such materials.  Many people may agree with limiting access, but I disagree. When I was growing up, [PERSON1]'s music was a source of joy for me. Her lyrics seemed simple at first but had deeper meanings. Her music videos also contained actions and images that young children should not imitate. Some parents may restrict their children from accessing such material, but I believe this deprives children of their freedom.  In public libraries, there is a wide selection of books, DVDs, CDs, and magazines, and some even offer public computers. However, not all libraries carry every artist, movie, or reading material because they believe it is inappropriate for children. But who is to say that children cannot enjoy the material they like? Restricting access takes away a part of a person's individuality. Children need the opportunity to form their own opinions and feelings without being confined to a single mindset.  Limiting a child's media consumption can have some benefits, such as teaching time - management skills. For example, restricting computer time, video - game playing, and television watching can help children learn to manage their time. Also, children may repeat what they see and get into trouble. However, libraries should not remove offensive media from the shelves. Instead, they should set age restrictions on renting such materials.  Just because a book or movie contains language and images inappropriate for children does not mean libraries should limit public access. Setting rental restrictions would solve the problem. In conclusion, while censorship in public libraries can be beneficial, setting an age - renting limit is a better solution than removing all materials, as it respects personal freedom and parental concerns.
1561	4538	2	2	Do you think books and movies with high ratings should be hidden? Can children control themselves when exposed to offensive content? Have you ever seen a child watch a movie rated as over @CAPS1? Most parents block such viewings for young children. I firmly believe that if materials like books, music, movies, and magazines are found offensive, they should be kept away from children.  I fully support adults preventing children from watching scary movies or reading certain action books. They should consider the effects of such media on children. Young children are innocent, and you don't want your child to have nightmares because you let them watch an over - rated movie. You'd feel guilty if it causes long - term problems for the child.  You need to decide if the content a child is watching or reading is suitable. It's crucial to hide inappropriate materials so children can't access them. Be careful about the movies and books in the library. Libraries should have a children's section filled with colorful and engaging materials that children would be interested in.  One night, while babysitting a girl named @CAPS5, her parents went to the movies. I brought a movie to watch after she fell asleep. At @NUM1, I put her to bed. But she woke up and saw me watching the horror film @ORGANIZATION1. The movie was full of blood, and she started screaming! I thought she was safely asleep in her bedroom. I quickly rushed to her and put her back to sleep, hoping she wouldn't have nightmares.  Please be considerate of what you let children read or see. Think about the long - term effects on the child. You might think it's not harmful, but it can mess up their minds and actions forever. I hope I've convinced you to remove over - rated movies and books from the shelves for the safety of children.
1562	4539	2	2	Everyone has their own views. We all agree that each person is unique, and this uniqueness extends to our standards of what is bad, offensive, or good. So, why would people attempt to censor books, movies, magazines, etc. in libraries?  When a book is removed from a library shelf, it's often due to the views of one person or a small committee. However, what one person finds offensive, another may not. For example, if a @CAPS4 reads a book advocating that @CAPS3 is the right religion, they're likely to find it offensive. But a @CAPS3 would probably read the same book without finding it offensive. Since everyone has different views, it's impossible to ensure that no one will be offended by any book in the library.  The same issue applies to music, movies, magazines, etc. No matter what we do, someone will be offended. Take the Pledge of Allegiance, which is said in many schools and before sporting events. Some people, like members of @ORGANIZATION1, find it offensive, yet most people just ignore it. So, why can't we do the same for offensive books, movies, and magazines?  In conclusion, it's impossible to implement effective library censorship because people's sensitivities vary widely. Instead of trying to censor, we should simply avoid reading what offends us. Therefore, there should be no censorship in libraries.
1563	4540	2	2	Throughout literary history, numerous books have been banned from public libraries and shelves. These bans often stem from the fact that the books are offensive to certain individuals, but not to everyone. Even books featuring magic and fiction have been excluded from some societies due to specific religions and cultural backgrounds. I firmly believe that no piece of literature should ever be completely banned from public view.  When a book is banned, a part of history is lost. For instance, a book banned in @DATE1 may never be read by future generations, including my children. Usually, books are removed from the public domain because a particular group complains about their content.  When I was eight, I saw on the news that people in @LOCATION1 and other @CAPS1 @CAPS2 countries were burning books from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series. They did this because the series contained magic and fictional elements. However, just because some @CAPS5 disapproved of the story doesn't mean the books should be banned from libraries. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series is extremely popular among my generation, and future generations should be able to enjoy it as well.  Before @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10, the @CAPS11 faced discrimination. During @CAPS12 in @DATE2, radical @CAPS13 and @CAPS14 supporters burned @CAPS11's houses, stores, and books. Some of those books might have been the only copies, yet the @ORGANIZATION1 let their hatred destroy these pieces of @CAPS16 literature. As a result, subsequent generations can never read those burned books.  Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I wholeheartedly agree. If literature continues to be censored, future generations will have nothing to read. No literature, not even the most radical, magical, or fictional, should be censored. If censorship persists, the future of literature is bleak.
1564	4541	2	2	In modern times, there are many creative works that can be considered provocative or offensive, and some are inappropriate for young audiences. People may come up with various reasons to remove such works from public access, but I believe that neither politicians nor artists should have the right to suppress others' creations.  There are books in libraries that the average person might not choose to read, but these books should not be removed from the public domain. A book is the result of an author's time, effort, and soul. No matter how offensive some people may find it, it represents the author's unique perspective. Historically, censorship has been used to suppress rebellions and power shifts, but I still oppose it. For example, @PERSON1's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is illegal to possess in @LOCATION1. While there is a valid reason for this, I think the book should still be available for people to learn from the past.  For centuries, publishing a book has been a way to be remembered. Many authors pour their hearts into their works, which represent the freedom of thought. Removing books from society means removing free will and free thinking. This is well - illustrated in @PERSON2's dark psychological science - fiction novel @CAPS3 @NUM1. The book prophetically describes future society from the perspective of someone in the @DATE1's and accurately depicts the consequences of book censorship. It was censored for a long time, serving as a warning of what could happen if censorship is unrestricted.  People have different views on books, ideas, and other creative works. Just because something is considered wrong by some doesn't mean it should be suppressed. This applies to music, movies, magazines, websites, etc. Removing these from society takes away its diversity and individuality. If censorship is given free rein, even over 'extreme' or 'radical' ideas, people won't be able to learn from past mistakes, and history will repeat itself. Of course, I'm not suggesting that governments should allow terrorists and radicals to spread their harmful ideas freely. Once a threat to the public is identified, appropriate action should be taken. The law should be upheld, but it shouldn't overstep its boundaries.  In conclusion, while censorship can have some benefits for the public, it ultimately restricts our access to the truth and stifles free thinking. Politicians should not interfere with art, music, literature, and education. If they do, society will lose its ability to grow and learn, and history will repeat its mistakes.
1565	4542	2	2	People have different views on what they want their children to be exposed to in books, movies, music, and other media. So, should libraries be more strict and remove certain offensive or vulgar items? I believe it depends on how libraries advertise and who they allow to check out what.  My mother didn't like me reading a particular series because she thought it was inappropriate for me. But she didn't demand that the library remove all books by that author. She respected that others enjoyed the books and just asked me to find more suitable reading materials.  Many libraries have sections for different age groups, such as children, teenagers, and adults. Within these sections, there are sub - areas that separate educational and entertainment materials. For example, if a parent is offended by a sex - education section, should they ask the library to remove it? I don't think so, as students use it for study and parents use it as an educational tool.  I think libraries should put stamps or notices on different media, indicating that only a certain age group can access and check them out. An eight - year - old shouldn't be able to freely borrow a @NUM1 movie. There should be restrictions, but asking to remove all @NUM1 movies is unreasonable because others enjoy this type of entertainment.  Libraries try to respect the diverse interests of different people and create a comfortable environment for everyone. They separate children's and adult videos and have a special section for children's books. However, vulgar magazines and videos have no place in libraries, as they are public, family - friendly areas, and children shouldn't stumble upon inappropriate content.  In conclusion, libraries should not completely remove areas of media. Instead, they should distinguish between adult and children's materials. As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone has the right to remove books from the shelf, eventually, there will be no books left. If we keep removing books, we'll end up with nothing to read.
1566	4543	2	2	People in certain situations have valid reasons to remove items like books, magazines, and other materials from circulation. These reasons can be either personal or professional, and they hold significance. Some individuals find the content offensive, while others believe it inappropriate for the younger generation. Additionally, certain written works or music may be considered unnecessary and irrelevant. The world is filled with various things that someone, whether an educated individual or a high - school dropout, might find offensive. It could be a phrase in a book or the title of a song. However, removing items from public access is generally unjust and should only be allowed if the material is highly offensive. Instead, people can choose to avoid such content. Only when the offensive material is widely and blatantly offensive to the majority should it be removed. Other materials may be clearly inappropriate for some to access. For example, a book on robbing a bank or making cocaine should be removed as it could lead to problems that otherwise would not occur. Although people might learn about such things through other means, making this information publicly available is like starting a fire that could get out of control. Of course, people can get ideas from what they read, but it depends on how they interpret it. Some content is simply inappropriate for the world and its people. For instance, if a singer or rapper uses profanity and disrespects a race or gender without cause, it is unacceptable. Such content should not be allowed in the first place, especially when it concerns a race or culture. Similarly, if a writer portrays a person who has recently saved lives as a horrible individual with little knowledge of the person, it is unjust. In conclusion, in specific cases, people should have the right to remove extremely offensive materials that affect a large number of people. Also, materials that can cause avoidable problems and those that are inappropriate to a race or culture should be removed. Everyone has rights, and if written works, music, or videos violate those rights, they should be restricted from public access.
1567	4544	2	2	In my opinion, kids are going to learn about adult - related content anyway, so there's no point in taking it off the shelves. I don't think any adult material should be censored. If your child asks about something adult - related, just take it from them and say it's not suitable for their eyes. They'll ask questions and start to wonder, but they learn about such things in school too, so what's the big deal? If my child found my personal adult - related items and asked questions, I'd simply tell them it's an adult thing and then hide it in a place they can't find. When we were kids, our parents would scold us for going through their stuff, and later, we might scold our kids for having access to such things. So, don't discipline your children for accidentally coming across adult - related content; instead, learn to hide your stuff better. As a student looking to the future, I have this opinion. Suppose your child sees some adult magazines under your bed. They'll start looking and might say some words, but it's not their fault; it's the parents' for not hiding it well. I don't have a need for such things, but I still have an opinion on this matter. Parents should check their own rooms and hide adult materials before protesting about libraries having such content. Libraries should be able to have whatever they want; it's not up to parents to decide what should be removed. As a student, I firmly believe that adult material should not be banned from libraries. Otherwise, we'll just hear adults complaining, and that's the last thing we need.
1568	4545	2	2	The question of whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are considered offensive is a significant one. My answer is no. Removing these items that some may find 'offensive' takes away things that people enjoy. I, along with many others, do not agree with the implementation of censorship on such items. There are several reasons why this form of censorship should not be passed. Firstly, implementing censorship may lead to a loss of customers for stores selling these items. Once a store loses customers, it loses money, and in the worst - case scenario, it may even have to close down. Many people enjoy materials with no restrictions and find joy in them. I, for one, like reading unrestricted books and listening to music without limitations. If these items are removed or restricted, people may no longer be interested in purchasing them. Secondly, if there are concerns about materials that are not suitable for kids, a better solution is to categorize them. This way, materials inappropriate for children can be separated from those that are suitable. Since there are no other viable solutions besides banning these items, categorization is the best approach. Finally, as Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' If this is truly a problem, parents should monitor what their children are reading. It is not right to take away materials from society just because parents are worried about their children's reading choices. So, what do you think? Should such a law be passed? The choice is yours. But remember, if you support censorship, think about all the things you are taking away from others. Do you really want to be so heartless?
1569	4546	2	2	In today's society, censorship is a highly contentious issue. Many authority figures seem to be preoccupied with the idea that literature, video games, movies, and music are corrupting the current generation. Some believe in censorship as a means to protect children and keep them innocent and morally upright. However, I firmly believe that censorship is a grave mistake. By denying children access to certain literary works, we are not keeping them innocent; rather, we are keeping them ignorant. There are numerous books that, despite being censored, could provide children with vital insights into the world they live in. One of the most challenging aspects of censorship is determining what should and should not be censored. Books deemed offensive or controversial are often targeted, but the concept of offensiveness is subjective. It varies from person to person based on culture, religion, and moral codes. Since there is no consensus on what will have a negative impact on children, it is impossible to establish a standard for what should be removed from the shelves. As a result, many valuable books that should be available for reading are unavailable. Censorship can shield children from information that may be harmful, but it also deprives them of the opportunity to gain important knowledge. Children should be encouraged to read and learn, not restricted from doing so. Given this, one may wonder why the censorship debate still persists. The debate continues because, in reality, there are indeed things that should be censored. Some movies, music, and books today contain excessive violence or sexual content, which can have a negative impact on young people. Bloody video games and hateful song lyrics can foster animosity in children. However, this cannot be the sole cause of such behavior. Children will act appropriately if they are taught to do so, not by hiding them from every instance of inappropriate content. Proper life lessons about morality, equality, peace, and respect are far more effective than censorship. Inevitably, censorship will remain a common practice. But think about a book that positively changed your life and imagine if you had been denied the chance to read it. Do you want your children to miss out on such life - changing experiences?
1570	4547	2	2	I believe we should have access to various materials. Books are essential; without them, we would struggle to survive as a literate society. They are the foundation for learning how to read. Regarding music, it's a mixed bag. Sometimes music can be inappropriate, but at other times, it helps people work. As for magazines, I'd say no. There's often too much content in magazines that isn't suitable for certain audiences. In conclusion, while we need to have access to materials like books for the growth of knowledge, we should be more cautious about the availability of magazines and make sure the content of music is appropriate. We should strike a balance to ensure that the materials we have access to are beneficial and suitable for different people.
1571	4548	2	2	I firmly believe that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves. Nowadays, books are starting to get more engaging. If the good ones are taken away, people will lose interest in reading. Most people enjoy rap music, while country music doesn't appeal to many. There are indeed some bad movies, but they can be entertaining due to their humorous, gross, or sad elements.   If better - quality magazines are not produced, the magazine business may go under, leaving the business owners without the means to support their families. Since I've been alive, many good things like books, music, and magazines have changed as people's preferences have shifted from the old - fashioned items. If more items are removed, people will stop going to the movies and buying books.   Currently, there are a lot of great movies and music being released. If the old - time items were brought back, more people would go to the movies, which would in turn increase revenue. For example, movies from @NUM1 and @NUM2 would likely be very profitable. Removing items is causing us to lose money. Instead of spending on movies or books, people are using that money on drugs and other illegal activities that could land them in jail. Therefore, we should not take these items off the shelves.
1572	4549	2	2	In my view, certain materials should remain available on the shelves. Writing a book is a time - consuming process that can be an author's passion. Everyone has the right to express their opinions freely. Library materials are classified by age group, and as long as the content is appropriate for that age, there should be no issue.  Some people object to certain books for their children, but these books can actually aid in a child's learning. What one person finds boring, another may find fascinating. The diversity of opinions in the world is reflected in the wide variety of books available. Removing a book might seem to protect a child from bad words or beliefs, but it could also deprive them of valuable learning experiences. For instance, a loner could learn from the mistakes of characters in a book.  Many children today are bullied but are reluctant to tell an adult. Reading a book about someone being bullied might encourage them to confide in a teacher. It's true that every piece of material has something that someone won't like. I myself have come across books I didn't approve of, but I know they have connected with some children somewhere. People grow up in different conditions, and materials can teach them valuable lessons.  Imagine if you were a writer. Would you want your hard work to be discarded? Whenever there's a rally against an author's beliefs, there are negative reactions. People often only think about their own families and don't consider the author's family and how they feel.   We should respect others' opinions and let them express what they believe in writing. If someone judged or discarded our beliefs, how would we feel? The next time there's a rally about library materials, we should think before we judge. Everyone's beliefs and opinions deserve respect.
1573	4550	2	2	Nowadays, many things can be considered offensive, but that doesn't mean we should take them away from those who enjoy them. Everyone has their own views and opinions. For the things that people find offensive, I believe they should simply avoid them.  I don't think certain materials should be removed from library shelves. What one person finds offensive in @MONTH1, another might enjoy. If people start causing problems, it might be up to the library staff to decide. There are indeed many things that people take offense to, but that's no reason to deprive others of what they enjoy.  In my life, I've visited many libraries. I haven't seen much that's offensive, though there are books and movies for adults only. In my opinion, it's simple: if you find something offensive, just stay away from it because others might enjoy it.  It's not my decision whether materials should be removed from library shelves. However, I firmly believe that people who find things offensive should avoid them. We need to consider all aspects before jumping to conclusions. In conclusion, respecting others' enjoyment of different materials is important, and we should approach the issue of offensive content with understanding.
1574	4551	2	2	This essay is about censorship in libraries, and I believe there shouldn't be excessive censorship. A lot of the so - called offensive content is already on TV, such as on Comedy Central, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS3, and MTV.  Music should not be censored. Censoring can ruin the beats, rhythm, and lyrics of a song. It disrupts the flow of the song and makes people angry because they have to go to websites like @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 to listen to the uncensored version.  Movies also shouldn't be censored. It's the parents' responsibility. If they don't want their kids to watch or hear certain things, they can choose not to pick the movie or tell the kids to go to their rooms.  Books should not be censored. Adults may want to read them, and it's unfair to censor them just because of concerns about kids. Kids are smart enough to know what they should and shouldn't read.  TV shows are a great form of entertainment. There are funny, awesome, and thrilling shows. However, censorship can ruin the experience. For example, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS3 play good movies, but when they censor words and parts, the movies lose their meaning, and viewers have to rent or buy the uncensored versions.  In conclusion, censorship ruins a lot of TV shows, movies, and music. Actors, music writers, and other creators spend a lot of time on their work for their fans. Censorship takes away from the entertainment value, which is a shame as these creators could be spending time with their families instead.
1575	4552	2	2	There is some material that some people find offensive or inappropriate for the youth, including music, books, and movies. I'd like to share my thoughts on this issue.  Music and movies have ratings indicating the appropriate age for the content. For movies, there are ratings like @CAPS1, which means viewers should be @NUM1 or older. @NUM2 requires parental guidance, @NUM3 and up, and PG means younger kids should be with their parents. Music with explicit content has a label on the cover.  I agree with this rating system. I don't think items should be removed from the shelves unless it's absolutely necessary. If someone doesn't like the content, they can choose not to engage with it. However, I understand that some people may disagree. For example, if a book discriminates against a race, it should be removed.  People have different stances on this issue, just like parents. Some parents want to raise their children in an environment free of swearing and violence, while others are more lenient and let their kids consume content outside their age group. In my case, my parents let me watch, read, and listen to what I wanted, and I turned out fine. I've seen kids with lenient parents grow into well - behaved adults, and vice versa.  In summary, everyone has their own opinions and views on this topic. We should respect the rating system and only remove items when it's truly necessary, while also understanding that different people have different perspectives based on their values and parenting styles.
1576	4553	2	2	Have you ever encountered a book, movie, or magazine that offended you? Have you ever wished that no one else would ever have to read or view it? Should such offensive materials be removed from libraries? In my opinion, they should not. Instead, books, movies, and other materials that might be offensive should be marked as such.  From personal experience, I know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie. I've often read books that completely contradicted my religious beliefs. Usually, I ignore them and move on to something better. Sometimes, it's more difficult to ignore, but I always try to forget and continue with my life, and I believe others should do the same.  Take the book The @CAPS1. If you've read it, you're aware that it contains ideas that spark many controversies. For example, the part where some children are killed. Like most people, I don't agree with this idea and think it's wrong. Some people have tried to get this book banned, but it remains a wonderful piece of literature.  As you may have seen in the media recently, many people are trying to get the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3 removed from schools. Some find it offensive because it repeatedly refers to Native Americans using a derogatory term. However, the law to remove it has not passed because it doesn't affect everyone. Some people may not find it offensive, so it remains in schools.  The same principle applies to removing offensive books from libraries. Some people may find certain books offensive, while others may not. Removing these books from everyone's access would be a terrible idea. A book might only be offensive to one race or religion. Why not simply put a warning label for that specific group? This would put the decision of whether to read and potentially be offended in their hands. It's also possible that a book is offensive to a particular age group. In that case, librarians can place those books in the appropriate age - specific section.  I've provided reasons based on my own experiences, other readings, and media observations. I hope you'll consider my ideas. Don't remove books from the shelf just because they're offensive to one person. Instead, after a few complaints, simply put a warning label on the book. This way, the responsibility of being offended lies with the readers. Once again, I firmly believe that offensive materials should not be removed from our libraries but rather censored only for those to whom they are offensive.
1577	4554	2	2	In @LOCATION1, there is a widespread desire for censorship. This is largely because people don't want to be ostracized. Given the large number of different races in @LOCATION1, this is understandable. Censorship is necessary in some respects, but in other cases, some individuals may be seeking attention. If all different races want censorship, then it's unfair to censor according to the preferences of just one group.  The censorship problem is persistent because it creates a chain reaction. For instance, if a group asks a library to remove books due to certain references that might be insulting to them, another group may then object to references in other books, and this cycle continues. Therefore, there must be some tolerance when it comes to censorship for different groups.  On the other hand, young children require censorship. They are constantly growing and maturing, both physically and mentally. If an inappropriate book is presented to them, they may read it and accept its content as normal. Exposure to such negative content can lead them to develop wrong goals and values for their future.  We all have different perspectives and interpret things in various ways. What one person may consider wrong in a movie or music, another person nearby may view as normal. Questioning someone's choice of movie or song is essentially questioning their judgment, which is unfair.  In conclusion, while censorship has its place, especially for protecting young children, it should be implemented with fairness and tolerance, taking into account the diverse views and needs of different groups.
1578	4555	2	2	Books, music, movies, and magazines are essential for both entertainment and study, and everyone should have access to them. If someone is offended by one of these forms of media, I don't think they should be removed from shelves or advertisements. There will always be many people who find these books or other resources interesting.  If the content is more suitable for adults, it should be placed in a labeled section with appropriate information indicating its nature. For example, radio stations often play songs that discuss sex, drugs, and violence. I believe kids need to be exposed to these issues to some extent. Parents can't shield their children from such topics their entire lives, and most of the explicit content is usually edited out.  Everyone has different interests. So, there's no reason to remove something from store or library shelves just because it's offensive to one person. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of interests and ensure that a wide range of media is available for everyone to choose from.
1579	4556	2	2	I firmly believe that libraries should not be required to censor the types of books, magazines, and other materials they offer. People should have the right to read whatever they desire.  Although people may not always enjoy reading certain things, they may need to access specific resources for research or school. For example, the book @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 describes kidnapping and the rape of young girls. Some classes may require students to read this book, even though no one really wants to read about such disturbing content.  People also have different tastes in movies. Personally, I prefer non - gory horror movies as they make me think about what will happen next. Some people like very graphic and gory movies. If libraries start removing such movies from their shelves, it will be more difficult for those who enjoy them to find these films.  Different people are offended by different things, and it's difficult to determine where censorship should stop. Movies that mock or discuss religion can be offensive to people of that religion, while others may be unaffected. Imagine watching @CAPS3 and seeing someone joking about your beliefs. It would be very offensive, but others may not care at all.  In conclusion, we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy. If there's something we don't want to see, we should simply ignore it. We shouldn't ruin the experience for others who want to engage with that content.
1580	4557	2	2	Censorship in the media has existed since the inception of @ORGANIZATION1. Some of the earliest movies were considered too offensive and never made it to theaters. But when it comes to books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries, the question arises: why do they need to be censored?  Regarding books, if a book is not suitable for children, it should be kept away from them. Extremely offensive books should either be removed from library shelves or not added to the library at all. A library is a place for learning and entertainment, and highly offensive books do not contribute to either.  Music is another area that requires censorship. Most popular songs are highly offensive and should be placed in a separate section. They should not be in the children's music area because parents generally don't want their five - year - olds learning cuss words. Many parents would prefer if libraries got rid of music related to sex, drugs, and cussing, which are all currently censored in the media. Perhaps libraries could carry censored music instead.  Movies are similar to music. They often portray the same offensive content as music, but in a visual form. Parents don't want their children to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that they might copy. Libraries should place such movies in the adult section and censor them by using a censor bar over the mouths of people who are cussing or over inappropriate body parts when an inappropriate gesture is made.  Over the years, it has become increasingly difficult to censor magazines. Magazines are almost impossible to censor, unless the recipient does it themselves. Libraries receiving magazines could use a black marker to cross out offensive words or pictures and should avoid carrying inappropriate magazines altogether.  If you're at a library and see something inappropriate, inform the librarian and ask them to censor the material. In conclusion, proper censorship in libraries is essential to ensure that the materials available are suitable for different audiences, whether it's children or adults.
1581	4558	2	2	I firmly believe that certain offensive materials should be removed from public shelves. Different people have different interests, and materials that some find offensive can indeed cause discomfort to many. For instance, someone might accidentally pick up a book with inappropriate content. They could take it home, start reading, and then be offended by what they find. This not only concerns individuals but can also harm the library, leading to a loss of customers. Children are another important consideration. Imagine a young child wandering in a store or library and randomly picking up a book or magazine with offensive pictures. The child would be exposed to content not suitable for their age, which would surely anger their parents. Parents would likely do everything in their power to have such materials removed from public display and out of children's reach. It's clear that neither children nor some adults should be exposed to such content. Religion also plays a role. Reading inappropriate materials may go against some religious beliefs. If people unknowingly read such content in a book, they would be greatly offended and upset. This could cause many to avoid certain books or even the stores where those materials are sold. In conclusion, all these reasons highlight why inappropriate materials should be removed from public shelves to prevent people from being offended.
1582	4559	2	2	As Katherine Paterson astutely noted, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' However, as an author, she believes that if anyone has the right to remove uncensored books, there will be no books left. Offensiveness is subjective; a book may be offensive to some but not to others. I strongly oppose the idea of allowing anyone to remove books from the shelf. People have diverse preferences when it comes to books. Instead, libraries should set aside a specific section for unsensored books. This would effectively keep children away from age - inappropriate material. Additionally, I think there should be warnings on certain books, indicating that not all the content may be appropriate. Allowing individuals to remove books based on personal opinion is unfair. Libraries are places for people to read, study, and conduct research. Limiting the number of books based on one person's view undermines the rights of others who may enjoy that genre. Before the internet, libraries and books were the primary research resources, and many still prefer them today. Removing the freedom to access any book endangers the learning and discovery process. By designating a specific section for uncensored books, those interested can read them, while others can avoid them. This approach is fair to everyone and gives parents peace of mind. Marking books with offensive content with a warning sticker is also a practical solution. I once had to find a new book for a school project because the first one had inappropriate material. A warning sticker would have made the process much easier. In conclusion, I firmly believe that books should not be removed based on individual opinion. Placing uncensored books in a separate section and using warning stickers can help address the issue of offensive content while preserving the freedom of choice for readers.
1583	4560	2	2	I'm not much of a book - reader. However, I'm convinced that offensive materials should be removed from shelves. If they aren't, it could lead to unpleasant situations. When people are truly offended, they may engage in conflicts, and that's not a sight anyone wants to see. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from shelves is a necessary step to avoid potential conflicts and ensure a more pleasant environment.
1584	4561	2	2	If I worked at a library, I would support removing items with profanity, racism, and slang, such as magazines, music books, and other materials. I wouldn't want my own children to encounter such inappropriate content at the library. To encourage more people to borrow library books, it's essential to ensure that the collection is suitable for all ages. As a library worker, I would scan all the books to ensure they are appropriate for young adults and children. Imagine how parents would feel if their child brought home an inappropriate book because I didn't do my job. I would conduct an observation of all the library's books. Moreover, libraries should have more inspiring books, cartoons, and baby books for young children. If most people at the library find a bad book, I believe we should have the right to remove it. I don't want my children or others' children to be exposed to such content. If my child picked up a bad book, I wouldn't let them go back to the library until it was better organized. Libraries should have a large room filled with children's books, divided into different age - appropriate sections. This would make it easier for parents to find suitable books for their children. In conclusion, libraries need to take responsibility for the content of their books. By removing inappropriate materials, providing age - appropriate books, and creating dedicated children's sections, libraries can offer a safe and inspiring environment for all visitors.
1585	4562	2	2	Censorship in libraries has been a long - standing issue in communities. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if one person has the right to remove a book they find unacceptable, then everyone has that right. Since everyone has a different view of what is unacceptable, this could potentially leave no books on the shelves. If the government censors materials like books, music, movies, and magazines, there's no limit to what they might ban. What one person deems unacceptable may not be seen the same way by the government, and the question of what makes something unacceptable is a matter of opinion. I firmly believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should never be censored. It's up to the individual to choose what to read, listen to, or watch. The government's stance on censorship has changed over time. For example, the novel 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' was once censored and banned because it contained language and scenes considered inappropriate. If it remained banned, a significant part of American culture and its influence on American literature would have been lost. I view literature as a form of art. Art should never be censored because it drives social development. Artists and writers take risks, and if we restrict this, our society will stop evolving. Many of the developments made by researchers, inventors, artists, and writers were once seen as risky. We shouldn't have censored them. Another example of the negative impact of censorship was during the @CAPS2 regime. Under @CAPS3's rule, all forms of media, including music, books, art, and movies, were censored or banned. A whole generation was deprived of cultural and intellectual growth. Allowing the government to censor libraries limits our exposure to new ideas, which can lead to societal ignorance. We need to ask ourselves if there is a limit to what the government can censor. We must prevent the government from cutting off our access to future masterpieces. In conclusion, censorship of books, music, movies, and magazines is unjust and harmful. We should preserve the freedom of individuals to choose what they consume and protect the creative and intellectual growth of society.
1586	4563	2	2	There has recently been an issue of censorship in libraries. A significant number of books, movies, and music are being removed from library collections because they are deemed offensive. However, there are libraries that do not remove such items. There are numerous reasons for the censorship or non - censorship of items, yet libraries should not be compelled to censor certain materials. One reason offensive material should not be removed is that offensive material can be labeled to warn people about its content. If a child attempts to borrow a labeled item, they must be accompanied by a parent to obtain approval. The decision of whether a child reads or views offensive material lies with the parents. Another reason is that parents have the power to approve or restrict the items their children access. If they believe the material is too mature for their child, they can prohibit it; if it seems harmless, they can allow it. This decision is ultimately the parents' prerogative. Offensive books or movies can also be placed in a dedicated section of the library. Children should not be allowed in this section without parental supervision, and this is a parental decision. There are multiple reasons why offensive material should not be banned. Nevertheless, there should be restrictions on who can borrow such items. In conclusion, while offensive material may be uncomfortable for some, proper management through labeling, parental approval, and dedicated sections can ensure that libraries maintain their role as a source of diverse knowledge without over - censoring.
1587	4564	2	2	Everyone holds their own opinions and arguments on various matters. There are numerous books that can be offensive to people in different ways. With thousands of books in a library, it can be challenging to find the right one that interests you. In my opinion, books should not be removed from the shelves just because they might offend someone. As mentioned earlier, everyone has their own viewpoints. There is a wide range of books, including those about murder, romance, mysteries, and drugs. These books should be placed in separate areas, as is common practice. If books are removed from the shelves, it undermines our individual freedom. Libraries contain more than just books; there are also movies, music, magazines, etc., each with different types of content. They should be organized into different areas. I understand that some people worry about the influence of disturbing materials on young children, but children should be accompanied by adults. Adults can distinguish right from wrong better than children. For example, in public places like libraries, it is rare to see children running around unsupervised. Libraries are expected to be quiet, and children should be with their parents or an adult to prevent them from accessing inappropriate materials. I recognize that some teenagers may be offended by content related to drugs or killings in magazines or books, but some people enjoy reading such material. We don't have the right to remove it just because someone is offended. People who don't like it should simply put it down and move on. I agree that there should be restrictions, such as separate sections for teens, adults, and children. However, this does not mean removing materials due to potential offense. Libraries can have a calming and soothing effect on our daily lives. We should have the freedom to access a wide range of materials without unnecessary removal. Taking away items restricts not just one person but everyone. We can have our own form of censorship through individual freedom. These are my personal views on why items should remain on the shelves.
1588	4565	2	2	There are numerous arguments regarding the censorship of books and their potential impact on children. Some people believe that offensive books should be removed from library shelves, while others think they should stay for those who want to read them. Some parents claim that their children have become more offensive towards others, while others attribute it to bad parenting. Clearly, there are diverse opinions about exposing children to offensive content. I believe that some offensive materials should remain on the shelves, while others should not. Some offensive articles can teach children about what is right and wrong. For instance, the book '@PERSON1' showed the horrors of slavery and why it should never happen again. On the other hand, materials that are offensive without a valid reason, like music that promotes extreme harshness and disobedience without cause, should be removed. If a book or other material is offensive in a positive way, I want to read it to understand its message. If it portrays a bad image, it should be removed from the shelves. If it doesn't, it should be taught to children so they can learn the difference between right and wrong. Books that advocate harmful behavior without a purpose should be discarded, as children who read them might imitate the actions, leading to negative consequences. I have witnessed both positive and negative changes in people due to the influence of books and music. Some have engaged in illegal activities after being exposed to bad content, while others, like me, have been positively affected by books. Reading '@ORGANIZATION1' made me realize the injustice towards colored people, and now I treat them equally. In conclusion, not all offensive materials should be banned. We need to carefully evaluate each item based on its message and potential impact. Libraries should provide a diverse range of materials, and it is up to parents and individuals to guide children in making appropriate choices.
1589	4566	2	2	I disagree with the idea of removing books from the library because they are offensive. Instead, there should be age limits on certain books. This approach can protect children from being scared, preserve history, and uphold freedom of speech. By setting age limits on specific books, we can keep children innocent and pure. For example, in the book '@DATE1', kids @NUM1 or under should not read it. Children @NUM1 and under are still naive and have no knowledge of sex or pre - marital sex. With the frequent sexual content and torture scenes in the book, it is inappropriate and scary for young children. When we get rid of offensive books, we also erase history. If Anne Frank had not written her diary, we would have a limited understanding of how cruel Hitler was. Removing books because they are 'offensive' is a ridiculous reason. Books are only offensive to sensitive people, and they play a crucial role in preserving history. Finally, freedom of speech is an important reason to keep these books. Authors have the right to write what they want. If a reader finds a book offensive, they can choose not to read it. If Shakespeare had been restricted from writing his stories, we would not have masterpieces like 'Romeo and Juliet'. Many great books would be lost if censorship based on offensiveness were widespread. In conclusion, age limits should be set for books that are too offensive or inappropriate for children. Removing certain books means losing a part of history and undermining freedom of speech. We should keep these books in the library, as they are just words that can convey important messages.
1590	4567	2	2	Many people assert that certain books, known as '@CAPS2 Books,' should not be allowed on library shelves because they are offensive. However, librarians and public officials have overstepped by thinking they can decide who reads these books. In the novel 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5', the author uses offensive words and descriptions that are essential to the novel's setting. The author is not personally endorsing the offensive views but is depicting how a racist individual during that time might have thought. This novel is a valuable resource for understanding the history of the @CAPS10. Without these descriptions, a significant part of history would be unknown to many. In the novel '@PERSON4 in the @CAPS11', the author @PERSON2 uses curses in the dialogue between high - school boys at a boarding school. Watering down the language or making it 'kid - friendly' would distort the true nature of the characters. The sexual references in the novel are also necessary to show the plot progression and the changing traits of the protagonist @PERSON1. Literature is not the only medium targeted by those seeking to censor libraries. Music, movies, magazines, and video games are also being affected. While some materials are inappropriate for young children or those lacking maturity, it is the parents' responsibility to censor materials for their children. People should not be shielded from real - life occurrences of violence, prejudice, and death. In conclusion, authors often need to use offensive words or descriptions to convey their message effectively. Librarians should not have the power to control which materials reach the library shelves. Libraries should offer a wide variety of materials, and it is up to parents and individuals to select materials that align with their values.
1591	4568	2	2	Works of literature, regardless of their content, should have a place in libraries. All literature deserves a spot on library shelves. If the material is offensive or crude, it can be placed in a restricted section where access requires permission. Literature is a powerful persuasive tool, so we must be cautious about what we allow to be released and who can access it. Authors write for various reasons, such as making money or sharing a viewpoint, and generally want their work to be read. Removing their hard - work from library shelves would prevent it from being read, which is why certain books should not be completely removed. Some crude topics may be necessary for specific individuals. For example, if a scientific book contains images of a nude person that librarians don't want children to access, students studying sexual education or anatomy would be at a disadvantage. To address the issue of those who seek such content for inappropriate reasons, permission should be required to obtain these books. A small, enclosed room in the library can house all the so - called crude books, and access can be controlled by getting a key from a librarian. Destroying certain types of literature because some people are offended is pointless. The best solution is to ensure that only those who want or need to view these books can do so. We cannot discard certain writings just because some parents don't trust their children or some people are offended by the material. After all, if everyone can decide what is offensive, there will be no books left in the library.
1592	4569	2	2	Everyone has the right to their own opinion on various aspects of life, whether it's politics or sports teams. When it comes to reading materials, opinions can be numerous and sometimes hard to hear. Some opinions about books and media materials are biased. People can be offended by the materials available in public libraries. For instance, imagine a grandmother and her grandchild at a public library. The grandchild picks up a self - help book and starts reading. Later, the grandmother reads it and finds that it contradicts what the grandchild has been taught about life by her and the parents. To the grandmother, this is offensive. From my observation, when people pick up an “offensive book” and read a little, they usually put it back. So, there's no need to remove a book from the library; one can simply set it down. The same principle applies to music, movies, and magazines. If you don't like the music, don't listen; if you think a movie isn't “nice,” don't watch it; if a magazine seems raunchy, don't buy it. As @PERSON1 said, if we remove all offensive books from the shelves, there will be no books left for anyone. This statement is very true. Since everyone has an opinion and someone is likely to find something offensive, offensive books and media should remain on the shelves. Instead of fretting over offensive materials, it's easier to move on and forget about them. Sometimes, a bit of ignorance isn't a bad thing.
1593	4570	2	2	Removing books from library shelves won't stop children from accessing them. If they're interested in a book, they'll just go to a bookstore or other libraries. As a child, if I see a book that I'm not supposed to read but I know it's a good one, I'll get it because children are curious and like to explore. Books are meant to be read and looked at. If it's not suitable for certain age groups, libraries should ask for proof of age or restrict access. I really don't understand why some books are in stores but people don't want others to read them. It's great to see children pick up a book and start reading, especially those who don't usually read. However, there are age - appropriate restrictions for some books. But at the same time, you can't shield children from the world. Books are placed in libraries for a reason and shouldn't be ignored. Children listen to music because sometimes the tracks relate to them in a way that others may not understand. They feel the song beyond just the beats, rhythm, and lyrics. This isn't always what parents want their children to experience. Magazines can be too explicit for younger minds. As a father, I wouldn't want my @NUM1 - year - old son looking at naked girls or porn - related ads in magazines. Parents can be over - protective and restrict their children's activities, thinking they know what's best. But this may lead children to do things behind their parents' backs. It's better to let them learn in a more open way rather than forcing them into a difficult situation.
1594	4571	2	2	Libraries offer a wide range of resources, including books, music, and movies. However, these resources may contain offensive words, abusive language, or content that is inappropriate for children. Students should have the right to have a book removed from the library if they find it offensive. Also, students from different backgrounds may be offended by the movies or music in the library. Books are a common library resource. Some books may be offensive to students, and if a student finds something inappropriate, they should be able to have the book removed from the library shelves. Many students like fiction books, but some of these may contain offensive language or racist content. School and public libraries should remove books with inappropriate words that are not suitable for children's learning. Music is another important part of library collections. Common types of music in libraries include @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 music. While most of these may not have bad words, racism, or offensive language, some songs may contain content that is not suitable for school use. Such music should be removed from school and public libraries. Some libraries also carry movies, but not all do. Some movies may have blood scenes, abusive language, or racist content, which are not appropriate for school - age children. People should check the movie's rating before borrowing it from the library or watching it elsewhere. The library is a great place for reading, listening to music, and watching movies. But when using these resources, one may come across inappropriate words. Since these materials can carry abusive language or racism, students should have the right to have inappropriate books, music, and movies removed from school use.
1595	4572	2	2	Many people are offended by uncensored content. There is a divide in opinion; some believe it should be censored, while others think it shouldn't. In my opinion, nothing should be censored because it violates the freedom of speech. Censorship restricts one's ability to fully express themselves and their opinions. Therefore, in the interest of preserving free expression, no content should be subject to censorship.
1596	4573	2	2	"I firmly oppose the notion of removing any materials from public shelves. Books, magazines, and other materials are based on the experiences and observations of authors and musicians. Given the number of readers in [@CAPS1 @CAPS2], I am certain that removing books due to their content would have a negative impact on the public as a whole. The world needs these materials.    The authors write based on their own observations and personal life experiences. [@CAPS3] puts so much effort into creating these works. Why should they be removed just because someone dislikes the way a part of it is worded? Movies that are considered ""bad"" probably just contain a bad word or a scene with a little blood. Many people tend to make a big deal out of nothing. Some parents seem to think that if their child hears a bad word or sees a little bit of blood, the child will end up in jail.    Regarding music, the public believes that kids should not be exposed to rap and hip - hop. While I understand this view, I also see no problem with Christian rap or clean songs. A musician is not only paid for their musical skills but also for their ability to connect with the listeners.    I truly see no reason to remove any form of materials from the shelves. Artists have the right to their own opinions. The public, in my opinion, often overreacts to minor issues. The smallest problems do not define the value of the material; it is how the reader perceives the artist's work that matters. In conclusion, all materials should remain on the public shelves to allow people to make their own choices."
1597	4574	2	2	"In some situations, people are reluctant to read, claiming it's too difficult or they simply don't want to. Reading magazines has become a way to avoid proper reading. Although magazines can be educational, they may also demoralize some people's thoughts and feelings. One proposed solution to this problem is censorship, which involves removing specific books from public access.    We all poke fun at others, sometimes unintentionally hurting them. The media is similar. Books, magazines, [@LOCATION1], and the internet all compete for the attention and money of their audiences by appealing to them. Unfortunately, some media tries to demoralize people. This is where the issue [@CAPS1 the @CAPS3] arises. We should stand up for our rights and censor content that could lead to a worse future for people.    Censorship may seem like just a big word to most, but it represents a significant problem. For me, it becomes a concern when there is racism or vulgarity in the content. The music we listen to is becoming increasingly intense. I've been a victim of the harsh music that is more prevalent today. At least the radio is making an effort by bleeping out curse words or persuading artists to create clean lyrics for airplay. This shows that some places are trying to improve the situation and make tomorrow a better place.    With the rise of new [@CAPS5 (Music @CAPS6)] shows and other reality sitcoms on [@CAPS6], crudeness has become widespread. Some stations try to censor body parts and vulgar language in pictures and on worldwide coverage stations. However, other stations like [@CAPS5] do nothing about the voices and vulgarity in their shows.    Books also need some form of censorship. A [@CAPS2] teacher once told me, ""[@CAPS8], if you can't read it out loud to me, then you probably shouldn't be reading it."" I agree with this. With the development of technology, children are more vulnerable to harsh words and actions. This could lead to a society where people don't trust each other and easily resort to vulgarity.    In today's world, it's easy to access uncensored content. One person tries to make the world better, while another tries to demoralize it. We should not let this continue. Censorship, when used appropriately, can help create a better society. By censoring inappropriate content, we can protect children and promote a more positive and trustworthy social environment."
1598	4575	2	2	Censorship is a complex issue with two opposing views. Some people believe that all written materials should remain as they are, while others think that offensive subjects should be removed. The question of whether a subject is too graphic for students is a crucial one. The principles of freedom of speech and the idea that knowledge is power are important factors to consider when deciding the rightness of censorship.    Determining what is too offensive for students to read is challenging. In history, many events and topics are considered offensive. If all history books are removed, students will be unable to learn from the past, and history may repeat itself. Horror books, which are mainly for entertainment, should also not be removed. Students can learn to their fullest potential from a wide range of books.    Censoring books violates a person's right to freedom of speech. It restricts creativity and the sense of wonder. If certain books are removed from library shelves, some famous books that have influenced the world might never have been read. Even offensive books can present thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world.    People learn from books every day. Books about the past help us understand how to improve the future. If certain books are removed because someone deems them inappropriate for students, there will be knowledge that will never be acquired. The past is the best teacher, and students need access to historical books to learn. Offensive books can also have their value.    All books should remain on the shelves. Students can choose whether to read a book or not. A vast amount of knowledge can be gained from books, and without them, future generations will be deprived of important learning resources. In conclusion, censorship of books should be avoided to ensure the free flow of knowledge.
1599	4576	2	2	Libraries house thousands of books and other materials. These include non - fiction books with valuable knowledge and information, as well as fiction books that offer entertainment and good morals. If libraries start censoring their books, a large amount of information will be hidden from the public. The government may have several reasons for wanting to remove certain books from the shelves. These reasons could include racism, sending the wrong message to children, or spreading knowledge that [@ORGANIZATION1] wants to keep from the general public. However, censoring books would be a terrible idea that would affect everyone.    Books that are often considered for removal are those that are racist or suggest radical ideas. Since all people are equal, books suggesting that one race is superior can offend readers, leading [@ORGANIZATION1] to remove them. Radical - idea books are also at risk of being removed, as [@ORGANIZATION1] may fear that readers will act on these ideas. But censoring these ideas denies the public the opportunity to learn. Racism exists in the world, and simply removing the books will not eliminate it.    Another reason for removing books or magazines is that they may send the wrong message to children or contain vulgar content. Parents try to protect their children from such content. However, children cannot be shielded from everything. They need to learn and accept certain ideas as they grow. Parents can censor what their children read at home, but removing the books from public shelves would prevent others from enjoying and learning from them, even if it's just for entertainment.    Censorship may also be introduced because [@ORGANIZATION1] does not want the public to develop ideas that it disagrees with. They may worry that people will oppose them if they form opinions from the books they read. However, people will always have different opinions, and a growing society and economy need knowledgeable people who can invent and develop concepts.    In terms of race and religion, everyone is equal, but in terms of [@CAPS1], people vary. Censoring to make everyone equal in knowledge would stop the world's modernization. Smart people would go unrecognized, and potential inventions would be lost. In the book [@CAPS2 @NUM1], censorship is used to make everyone equal, but this is not the right approach for a society.    In conclusion, censoring books in libraries would have a negative impact on society. All books should remain on the shelves to allow people to access knowledge and form their own opinions.
1600	4577	2	2	"In the so - called ""material world,"" there are always people who take offense to various media products such as books, songs, or movies. When these ""offended"" people bring up their ""rights"" to have something removed, they don't seem to realize the consequences. If they claim the right to have a particular item removed because it offends them, then everyone has the same right. Another option for them is simple: if something offends them, they can just avoid it. For example, they can switch radio stations, pick up a different book, or watch a different movie. Having an open mind would also make the situation less dramatic.    People who say they are offended by certain materials often use the excuse of not wanting their kids to come across it. They claim the right to remove the ""offensive material"" from public access. This is both right and wrong. If they can remove something, then the creators of other materials can also claim to be offended by something the first person likes. This would lead to a situation where everyone starts removing everything one by one. Since everyone has the same rights, the government should not allow things to be taken off the shelves, as removing one item could lead to the removal of everything.    If someone is so offended by a song on the radio that they want it removed from all music - playing platforms, they need to re - evaluate their approach. The simple solution is to change the radio station. Similarly, if someone finds a book offensive, they don't need to read the whole thing. It's ridiculous to waste time trying to ban the material instead of just moving on to something else.    People who are offended could also try having an open mind. They could read the book to understand the author's intention, watch the movie to see if it really needs to be removed, or listen to the song in full. The artist may have been expressing themselves deeply, and removing their work could be offensive to them. Having an open mind can help the ""offended"" person understand why the material was created.    People have the right to their opinions, but they should not think that their opinions are the only ones that matter. If someone is offended by something, they should first consider alternative actions rather than trying to ban the material. In conclusion, all songs, books, and movies should have the right to be sold, and people should make their own choices about what to consume."
1601	4578	2	2	When one enters a public library, they are often overwhelmed by the vast number of books. Even though an individual could never read all of them, libraries must offer a wide selection to cater to readers with diverse interests. Libraries should not remove books that offend some people because a library is a public space where people can read what they desire. If someone disagrees with what another person is reading, they are not obliged to be present. Since libraries are public, books cannot be discarded simply because they are offensive. As Katherine Paterson stated, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If every offensive book were removed, there would be none remaining, which would discourage many people from reading and learning. Public libraries are open to everyone for reading. Therefore, they must have books that appeal to a wide range of tastes. If libraries stocked only one type of book, few people would visit. To satisfy some patrons, libraries may inadvertently offend others. People visit libraries by choice. If they find certain books offensive, they can choose not to read them. These books are available for those who wish to read them. Libraries should have as many books as possible to appeal to all tastes. They should not remove books that offend a small group of people, as those individuals can avoid reading the offensive material. Libraries are public places where people can read what they want.
1602	4579	2	2	In my opinion, offensive items should remain on library bookshelves. People who find them offensive can simply ignore them and continue with their lives. Students may need certain information for classroom work. If libraries remove this information, students will struggle to find the resources they need for projects or papers. Eventually, students will encounter offensive magazines, movies, music, and books in their lifetimes. Removing offensive books from libraries won't eliminate their offensiveness; they will still exist elsewhere. Libraries that stock offensive books do not aim to offend anyone. These items are on the shelves for educational purposes. If movies are offensive, people should refrain from renting them to save their own and the library's time. If patrons are offended by the materials in a particular library and the library chooses not to remove them, they can visit another library. Additionally, the internet likely contains the same offensive information. The internet is a virtual library where one can search for videos, books, magazines, and music. Removing offensive books and magazines from libraries won't eliminate them because the internet will retain the information indefinitely. Library censorship is pointless due to the wealth of information available on the internet. Libraries should have the autonomy to select the books and information they stock, as long as these items are properly categorized. Parents may be upset if movies they don't want their children to see are placed in the wrong section of the library. To address this, libraries should separate children's and adult sections. Most offensive items are not commonly found in libraries due to the potential for offense. Highly offensive movies should perhaps be sold in stores that clearly label them as such. Sometimes, people may overreact to the situation and fail to recognize that the item in question is not offensive enough to warrant an argument. Personally, I have never encountered an offensive book, magazine, movie, or song in a library. What does an offensive book look like? It often relates to someone's religion, ethnicity, etc. Offensiveness is subjective. If someone is greatly offended by an item in a library, they should avoid that library and inform others. In conclusion, if a library has offensive materials, people should avoid it. However, offensive material can also serve as learning material.
1603	4580	2	2	Yeah, I think that everyone has the right to express their opinion, and people like to look at or listen to different things. Now, it'd be different if it were a children's bookstore. For example, if it had Christian Bible songs or Disney movies, but no adult - oriented stuff. I really don't see a big problem with these things being available. Everyone likes to read something different. As long as you're reading and learning, it doesn't matter what it is. I don't think you can get rid of things like movies and magazines because people like to read or listen to them. So, in my opinion, it doesn't really matter what or where they are. In the end, we should allow a variety of media to be accessible as long as they can offer some value to the readers or listeners.
1604	4581	2	2	I firmly believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are considered offensive. People should not publish content that makes others unhappy. Although we may think that putting certain content in papers, movies, etc., doesn't hurt people, it actually does. Firstly, movies dealing with sexual relationships, such as those related to same - sex marriage, can be offensive. For instance, some content makes fun of same - sex couples, stating that people should not marry the same sex. Only a small number of people are in same - sex relationships, and making them feel offended through books, movies, or songs is not a good approach. Secondly, movies or books that put down people with special needs are offensive. Even if they don't show obvious signs of sadness, we may still have offended them. Families with special - needs members dislike it when someone publicizes their problems. This can make them upset and even angry. Most importantly, books or movies that mock people with limited resources are inappropriate. It's not their fault that they can't afford nice houses or clothes. Many families struggle to pay rent and bills, especially when only one parent is working. Some parents are laid off without pay, and if a family member has to go to the hospital, the medical bills can be a huge burden. Some families are constantly in and out of the hospital and lack the money to buy new things. In conclusion, I believe that certain books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves because they can be offensive. We often don't realize how rude it is to make fun of someone until it's too late. Many people dislike seeing offensive content, and removing such items is the right thing to do.
1605	4582	2	2	Books are meant to be read, and they shouldn't be removed because of their content. To me, it's ridiculous. Our children live in a world full of war and fear every day. What difference will a single book make? They're going to hear swear words and see violence. Wouldn't it be better for them to experience it first in a book rather than in real life without knowing how to react? Music has the power to bring people together. By preventing children from hearing certain lyrics, we're making them weak. Maybe those lyrics are just the truth that some parents don't want their kids to hear. Movies are something that people love to watch. We sometimes pay a lot of money to see them. If parents don't let their kids watch a new horror movie, it won't make them better. They'll face scary situations in real life one day, so why not let them experience it in a movie now? Parents, by not letting us see the real world, you're actually harming us. When we encounter a difficult situation in real life, we won't know what to do, and we'll be in trouble. In conclusion, we should have access to books, music, and movies that show the real world, as it will prepare us for what's to come.
1606	4583	2	2	In a free country like America, no one should have the power to remove books from library shelves. The freedom of speech allows us to express ourselves in various forms, including books, music, and movies. When encountering an offensive book, one should simply put it back and move on. Everyone has come across offensive content related to races and beliefs, such as offensive jokes, but these are not to be taken seriously. For instance, I recently read a book called '@CAPS1's your @CAPS2', and since it wasn't what I expected, I just put it down and picked up another. If books were removed from libraries just because they were offensive, there would hardly be any books left. Movies have ratings as a form of protection, ranging from '@CAPS3 to @CAPS4'. A movie in the @CAPS4 section may contain more offensive language and violent scenes, which is why DVD rental stores have a section restricted to mature individuals aged @NUM1 or older. If a child wanders into this section and finds something unsuitable, it is the parent's responsibility to supervise the child. In conclusion, reading materials should not be removed from library shelves. Removing them would be similar to discarding important documents just because someone disliked the wording. So, when faced with offensive content, we should simply put it back and continue on.
1607	4584	2	2	The current strict censorship in libraries is causing the next generation to miss out on crucial life lessons. Imagine going to the library as an adult and only being able to borrow children's books, magazines, and music. While this may seem extreme, it highlights the importance of knowledge. Without libraries, there would be no access to books, magazines, or music, leading to a lack of knowledge, life lessons, imagination, and excitement. We would regress to an animal - like state because our brains are what have allowed us to become advanced and intelligent. I live by the quote 'if knowledge is power then books must be the means of getting that power'. When Americans think of censorship, we often associate it with negative elements like cuss words, nudity, and battle scenes, which are displayed in different media, such as music. Rap is an example of uncensored music. Although my preference for rock and metal makes my opinion biased, people should have the freedom to listen to the music they like. If one doesn't like what a song says, they can simply choose not to listen. Magazines are also a subject of censorship. While naughty magazines like Playboy should be kept out of school libraries, public libraries should have adult sections with magazines like hunting or hot - rod magazines. Books are also subject to extreme censorship. A classic like 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' is being removed because of one or two cuss words. This is a shame as future generations will miss out on this great book. We should not overreact to a few cuss words. In conclusion, we need to find a balance between the First Amendment right to free speech and censorship. Adults should have an uncensored section, teens should have limited censorship on nudity, and children should have minimal censorship. We can't shield children from the real world forever, and removing classics would mean losing knowledge and freedom.
1608	4585	2	2	Some materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines can be offensive, but they should not be removed from shelves. Firstly, what some people find offensive, others do not. People have different views on what is offensive. For example, a book about @PERSON1 killing the @CAPS3 might be offensive to someone with @CAPS4 descent, and a book full of cursing could be offensive to a religious person. Secondly, offensive material will always be in the world. Parents cannot protect their children from it forever. Children have active minds and will eventually encounter offensive things. Instead of trying to shield them completely, parents should teach them the difference between right and wrong. Finally, if parents don't want their children to read offensive material, they should only restrict their own children, not the rest of the world. Parents cannot decide what other parents should do for their children; they can only control their own children's actions. In conclusion, there should be no censorship in libraries. What is considered offensive varies from person to person, offensive material is always present, and parents should manage their children's access rather than trying to remove offensive materials from the public.
1609	4586	2	2	The question of whether to censor library materials is a significant one. Some believe that certain books, magazines, and music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene. If everyone were allowed to remove materials they find inappropriate, as Katherine Paterson pointed out, there would be nothing left in libraries. Books have a long - standing history, spanning centuries. They are shared and enjoyed globally, containing important information and stories from the past. Banning books from libraries takes away the author's freedom of speech. Moreover, with the rapid advancement of technology, libraries may become extinct in the future as people can access books online @DATE1. Magazines are useful for advertising and discussing global issues. They are great for catching up on news, sports, and other topics. However, some magazines have explicit content, which is why some want to remove them from public libraries. But banning magazines takes away a company's freedom of the press. Also, with the growth of technology, it is easy to access information on the @CAPS1. Music has also been around for centuries and is relatable to everyone. Everyone has their favorite music. Taking away music from libraries is like taking away human culture. In conclusion, libraries are defined by their history, stories, news, and music. Censoring libraries is a bad idea that would likely upset many people. With the rise of technology, libraries may decline, but for now, their materials should remain uncensored.
1610	4587	2	2	There has been a long - standing debate about whether to stop distributing books, movies, music, magazines, etc., if they disturb people's lives and cause offense. Many people also complain about community violence, blaming it on disturbing books and music. However, most people are influenced by what they read and hear. I believe that society should learn to live with different forms of content. No one should be punished for what is available on library shelves or in stores, such as music. If people enjoy reading or listening to certain materials, they should be allowed to do so. Just because some people don't like what others are reading or hearing doesn't mean that the materials should be removed. These materials are not hurting anyone, and removing them would be unfair. In my experience, people should not complain. The content in these stores can actually make us stronger. In conclusion, we should not remove materials just because they bother some people. Everyone should have the freedom to access the content they enjoy, and we should learn to co - exist with different forms of media.
1611	4588	2	2	Most movies, magazines, music, and books are likely to offend at least one person globally. These forms of media frequently face censorship and are constantly challenged for bans, particularly books. Parents do have the right to restrict such materials from their own children, but they do not have the authority to ban them for all children worldwide. Regardless of the reasoning, censorship is unjust. It curtails the freedom of the writer, the freedom of the reader, and, as Katherine Paterson aptly stated, would lead to 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' According to the principle of freedom, everyone has the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press. This applies to writers and artists who may, occasionally or more often, include explicit content in their works. Every book conveys a message from the writer to the audience. How they choose to convey this message is their prerogative, and they have the full right to do so in any way they see fit. People who do not wish to engage with the writer's message have the right to abstain. However, when they fear the message and attempt to prevent others from seeing or hearing it, they violate the writer's freedom by dictating what offensive material cannot be included. Most writers include such material for a purpose. For example, swear words, like those in @PERSON2, often reveal character traits and enhance the setting. During certain periods, people did use explicit names for @CAPS2 @CAPS3, even those without prejudice. That was the reality of their lives, and the author was simply depicting it for the reader. By censoring these words, people are, in a sense, obscuring the history of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Every individual over the age of eighteen has the right to read whatever they desire. They are no longer under the control of their legal guardians and are not subject to the rules of other children's parents. Parents who prefer their children not to access certain materials have the right to censor them for their own children. However, they have no right to dictate what other children can or cannot see. Every parent has different rules and guidelines for their children, and this is their right. Some parents believe it is important for their children to be exposed to certain materials early in life to learn right from wrong. They may even not care. Whatever the reason, they have the right to expose their children to what they consider appropriate. For instance, @PERSON3, an author, has faced challenges throughout her career. Many of her books cover the topic of menstruation, which some parents deemed inappropriate for grade - school children. These parents brought the books to the school board's attention, and the books were quickly removed from the library shelves. Many parents, librarians, and teachers were upset and argued that the topic was not harmful. Fourth - grade girls are required to watch a video on puberty, and many fifth - grade girls start experiencing these changes. So, it is not clear why it is inappropriate for them to read fictional books on the topic. Some parents believe it is not inappropriate and encourage their children to read the books, but the parents who found it offensive deprived these children of their right to read. In the long run, censorship is wrong. It restricts the freedom of both the audience and the writer, preventing growth experiences for both. If everyone were to ban a book they found offensive, the world would be devoid of books and become extremely dull. No one would be able to read, and no one would be able to express themselves freely.
1612	4589	2	2	The library is a valuable resource, but there are certain things that should not be displayed or made accessible to the public. Some topics or materials found in the library are not suitable for everyone and should not be permitted in a public space. Firstly, there should be censorship regarding what can be accessed or retrieved from the library. What if someone accesses or checks out something that should not be seen by others, and it falls into the wrong hands? That person could potentially misuse the information. Not all materials in the library are appropriate for all age groups. Secondly, there is a significant amount of offensive content in the library. Censorship is necessary to prevent harm. Librarians or anyone in the library may never know what someone has accessed or what they are planning until an incident occurs or a problem arises. Therefore, restrictions should be imposed on materials that could be harmful to others. Finally, although people may feel that their research or check - outs are their own business, they should consider that the library is a public place, and anyone could easily view what they have accessed. It is unfair to be in a public place and be offended by someone's choices. The library is open to children and the elderly. In conclusion, there should be censorship regarding what can be found in the library. There are hurtful and inappropriate materials that should not be allowed. Most importantly, a library should be a place where people are not offended by what others access, check out, or say.
1613	4590	2	2	I firmly believe that books should not be removed just because they are considered offensive by some. Here's why. Firstly, books are written in a certain way, and if someone finds a book offensive, they simply have the option not to read it. Secondly, the author writes a book with a particular vision in mind and may not anticipate that someone will find it offensive. Thirdly, a book might be really good and interesting, except for that one person who deems it offensive. We cannot let the opinion of one individual dictate what others can read. In conclusion, we should not remove a book from the shelf just because one person says it's offensive. Everyone has different tastes and sensitivities, and we should respect the diversity of opinions in the literary world.
1614	4591	2	2	All materials in a library must be checked out before they can be taken out. The librarian is responsible for ensuring that students check out materials before removing them from the library. The following aspects will be discussed: why materials need to be checked out, the consequences of not checking out materials, and the consequences of losing checked - out materials. Library materials are available for anyone who wishes to check them out. The librarian can inform students whether a book, music, movie, magazine, etc., is in the library or already checked out. Students can then check out the material or ask the librarian to hold it when it becomes available. This system allows the library to function smoothly as the librarian can keep track of the materials. If materials are not checked out, no one can determine their whereabouts. When materials are checked out, the librarian can track them. Without check - out, the librarian cannot track the materials, cannot inform students of their location, and the materials become unavailable for others to check out. The librarian then has to wait for the person who took the materials to return them. If a student checks out a material and loses it, they must pay for it. Losing a library item means that no one can check it out until it is returned or replaced. The next person who wants the item has to wait longer. The librarian must ensure that the next person gets the item when it becomes available. The person who lost the material should be restricted from checking out further materials and can only read in - house materials for projects or classes. In conclusion, checking out library materials is essential. It enables the librarian to manage the collection effectively, ensuring that all students can access the materials they need. There are many reasons for this system, and it is crucial for the proper functioning of the library.
1615	4592	2	2	If I came across a book on a shelf that I found offensive, I'd be conflicted about whether to have it removed. Everyone has their own opinions and perspectives, and mine differ from others. Just because I might find it offensive, how can others judge its offensiveness if it's taken off the shelf? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Our actions, beliefs, and thoughts define us as individuals. Just because one person finds a book, music, or a movie offensive doesn't mean everyone else will. Others might actually like it. Removing something just because you find it offensive is like taking away a part of someone's identity. It's similar to a school making kids wear uniforms; it strips away our individuality. We all need ways to express ourselves, and what you find offensive might be a form of self - expression for someone else. In life, there will be many things we don't like, but we can't simply get rid of them all. Life doesn't work that way. We won't always get our way, and there's nothing we can do about it. Just because we don't like or find something offensive doesn't mean we can remove or replace it. Life goes on as it is, and trying to change things by removing or replacing them won't make it easier. So, if I found something offensive, I'd choose to ignore it and leave it there because taking it off the shelf won't really solve anything.
1616	4593	2	2	I firmly believe that certain offensive materials should be removed from library shelves. A public library is open to everyone, and no one wants to encounter offensive books or other materials there. For instance, a child once picked up an inappropriate book, and when his mother found him reading it, she was unhappy and left. This shows that such materials can be offensive to people. There are specific books, magazines, etc., that have no place in a library because the public doesn't need to be exposed to such content in a public setting. If someone finds a particular book offensive, they can report it. It's crucial to ensure that all materials in a public library are appropriate for all patrons. Being exposed to offensive content is not conducive to a relaxing library experience. Moreover, music is also a significant issue. There is a lot of music with inappropriate language, which is especially concerning for children and seniors. Books should be enjoyable and interesting to read, not offensive. The purpose of a library is to provide a place where people can relax and find suitable materials to read or borrow. Therefore, it is essential to carefully curate the materials in libraries to maintain a positive and appropriate environment for all.
1617	4594	2	2	"Books, music, movies, and magazines are being increasingly blocked or censored, and there are good reasons for this. There are children, parents, and religious people who oppose certain content that is broadcast. If someone wants uncensored content, they can buy or rent unrated versions. Children are our future, and we should not corrupt their young and innocent minds. For example, a child might be happily watching something one moment and then be exposed to scenes of violence and bombing the next, which can have a lasting impact on their psyche. We also don't want children picking up vulgar language from TV or music. Imagine an 8 - year - old using inappropriate words without knowing where they came from. This vocabulary can grow worse, potentially making the child a ""potty - mouth"" or even violent. We don't want our future leaders to be influenced by such negative content. Parents have the right to choose what they want to watch and the authority to stop their children from viewing or hearing inappropriate content. Many families enjoy car rides and vacations, watching TV and listening to music. However, when a song with inappropriate words comes on, it can be disrespectful and embarrassing, especially when children sing along. Parents should have a say in what their children watch, listen to, and read. For example, books about drugs and other inappropriate topics are not suitable for a 12 - year - old. Religious people also have strong opinions about what they watch, listen to, and read. They may find certain TV shows, music, or books disrespectful. For instance, a religious person might be offended by a TV show with immoral behavior or music that uses the Lord's name in vain. In conclusion, censoring TV shows, music, books, and magazines is beneficial. It sets a good example for everyone and helps our community stay strong. We should strive to create a positive environment for our future generations."
1618	4595	2	2	I think they should leave the materials on the shelves. People often take such things too seriously. If someone doesn't like a particular item, they should simply leave it alone. What one person finds offensive, another may find interesting. There is a lot of content out there that might be a bit offensive to some, but those who are offended just need to put it aside and move on. In the past, there have been movies that make fun of people's actions or past events. I can understand that this might be offensive for personal reasons. Sometimes, people make a big deal out of nothing. A statement can be interpreted differently by the reader. Many books are being removed from the shelves because someone complains about the language or because it might make fun of a particular race. I believe magazines are the worst offenders today. They are constantly judging people based on their relationships, past actions, or physical appearance. People should focus more on themselves rather than worrying so much about others. If we all did this, we would have far fewer problems. In summary, we should be more tolerant and less quick to remove materials from public access.
1619	4596	2	2	"Different books are meant for different people. While it's true that certain materials may not be suitable for public display in some cases, we need to stay informed about what's happening around the world. Even as we speak, there could be a battle taking place or an important event about to occur in another country, and we need this information. There's an old saying, ""You can not judge a man until you claim under his skin and walk around in it."" It took me some time to understand its meaning. Essentially, we shouldn't judge someone based on their appearance but on their inner personality. Similarly, when it comes to books, movies, magazines, etc., we shouldn't judge them without experiencing them ourselves. Companies create these things for specific audiences who enjoy such content. TV shows, newspapers, books, etc., are all meant to bring happiness to people. We should cherish what we have in life. People often say the world is going to end, but it won't. We will continue to live on in the after - life. In conclusion, we should be open - minded about different forms of media and understand that they serve different purposes and audiences."
1620	4597	2	2	Do you really want your kids to see bad images or read inappropriate prompts? Of course not! You can help by teaching them the difference between right and wrong, good and bad. It's important to help them develop a clear conscience so that they know how to handle difficult situations in life. My aunt, Person1, takes action when she encounters inappropriate content. Whenever she is at the checkout aisle of a local grocery store or other shops, she turns around the magazines she deems inappropriate. My parents say this is a silent protest because she isn't hurting anyone; she just doesn't like the content. My dad gets upset when watching TV with us and sees something inappropriate, like half - naked girls in commercials. He will either change the channel or turn off the TV to protect us from the bad things in the world. My mom is similar. She won't let us watch R - rated movies. If I wanted to watch such movies, I usually had to go to my friend's house. I think books are generally okay because most of the time, you have to read them and imagine the images in your head. In conclusion, I hope you share my view. The next time you're at the checkout, think about whether you want little eyes to see the content. You should turn around inappropriate magazines, turn off the TV and music, and read books to know what they are about.
1621	4598	2	2	To Whom It May Concern: In our ever - expanding world, censorship has become a subject of constant debate. Censorship aims to restrict content deemed “offensive.” However, it appears that media is now more heavily censored than ever before, perhaps because people are more easily offended these days. I am personally tired of this “veil over the eyes.” In this country, most censorship is regulated by government - established programs. But censorship should not be determined by an organization; instead, it should be up to the individual viewer. Why should others decide what we find most pleasant to watch? After all, no one knows us better than ourselves. Moreover, if censorship does not exist in our daily lives, why should it be present in the media? People often encounter things they regret seeing, and it depends on how they perceive such experiences. Everyone will come across things they don't want to see; that's life. Censorship denies our rights as [CAPS1] citizens to freedom of speech. If one doesn't like what they're seeing, they should simply look away. Therefore, the current state of censorship needs to be re - evaluated to respect individual rights and choices.
1622	4599	2	2	Should offensive materials like books, music, movies, or magazines be removed from the shelves? I firmly believe they should not. This is because what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to everyone, removing them would violate the law, and it is unfair to the artists who created them. The idea that something is offensive is subjective. For example, some may find [CAPS1] offensive, while for others, it is their religion. This clearly shows that “one man's garbage is another man's treasure.” Removing these materials would also be illegal as it would infringe on the artists' freedom of speech. Artists have the right to create and express themselves through their work, whether it's writing, singing, or filming. In conclusion, offensive materials should remain on the shelves. Respecting the artists' rights, upholding the law, and acknowledging the diversity of opinions are all reasons why we should not remove these materials based on the offense of a few.
1623	4600	2	2	Censorship is a method used to restrict certain inappropriate content and is widely employed in today's modern world, especially in movies, video games, and television. If forms of entertainment such as television and the internet use censorship, it is reasonable to consider implementing it in libraries as well. Additionally, if censorship is not mandatory, there should be restrictions on certain titles that children could access. Censorship can be highly useful in our daily lives. It allows us to monitor what children and teenagers view. This measure can be installed on devices like televisions, computers, and phones. So, if these precautions are taken for these products, it is appropriate for libraries to follow suit. A library should be a place where children can freely browse the shelves and pick up books without the risk of encountering inappropriate materials for their age group. A mandatory block should be implemented in libraries. This block would not eliminate books entirely but rather limit their access to specific age groups. Books should be categorized by age, preventing younger, less - mature children from accessing sections with inappropriate materials. It is a fact, not just an opinion, that younger children should not view certain materials. Young children are easily influenced by content intended for mature audiences, which can have a significant impact on their thoughts and actions. For instance, my cousin, who is no older than [NUM1] years old, was watching something that led to her asking inappropriate questions. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is necessary to protect children from inappropriate materials and ensure that libraries remain safe and suitable places for children to explore.
1624	4601	2	2	In today's world, there are many things that people find offensive, whether it's remarks about one's religion or the infringement of [CAPS1] rights. The question is, should books, music, movies, magazines, and articles be removed from store shelves just because some people are offended? I don't think so. There is a wide variety of religions, races, and beliefs in the world. If we removed everything that someone found offensive, there would be nothing left to sell. When it comes to younger children, they are impressionable and may not understand the implications of the media they consume. Even if children themselves are not offended by certain media, we must consider the parents' views on what is appropriate for their children. Media often contains elements such as drugs, alcohol, and curse words, which can have a negative impact on children. As adults, it is our responsibility to protect children until they are old enough to make their own judgments. Religion plays a significant role in our lives as it shapes our beliefs and values. Parents teach their children right from wrong based on their own beliefs. For example, I was taught to be respectful and work hard. Some children may look up to actors or actresses as role models, and parents may have different opinions on what shows or movies are suitable for their children. Canceling a TV show to please one family may upset many others. In the case of movies, the state provides ratings, and theaters enforce age restrictions. Libraries and movie theaters also have sections for adult - only materials. Some parents follow state laws, while others have their own rules. For example, some parents may allow their under - age children to drink at home. A few years ago, my little cousin watched a [CAPS6] - rated movie with me. It contained content that his parents did not approve of, and he ended up repeating a quote that got him in trouble. This incident shows that different people have different views on what is appropriate. In conclusion, we cannot remove everything that someone finds offensive. Instead, we should respect the diversity of opinions and allow individuals to make their own choices while ensuring that appropriate measures are in place to protect children.
1625	4602	2	2	How many of you truly love reading? I'll admit that I'm not a big fan. However, regardless of my personal preference, I strongly oppose negative books, and I believe that censoring books is crucial in today's society. The cover of a book can often give us an idea of its content. We can make inferences about what's inside just by looking at it. There are several reasons why graphic or offensive books should be removed from the shelves. Consider younger children who love to read. Although they have vivid imaginations, authors should not fill their heads with inappropriate ideas. Kids either quickly show interest in a book they pick up or reject it right away. An offensive book can hurt their feelings. Books are meant to be educational or entertaining, not offensive or discouraging. There are numerous races in [LOCATION1] and around the world, and different races are interested in learning from new books. When they encounter books that are not inclusive or present bad examples about their race, they feel discouraged. No form of media, whether it's a movie, magazine, book, or song, should be offensive to anyone. Authors, publishers, songwriters, and movie producers often focus on entertainment without considering the impact on others. Books with sexual content should be removed without question. They are offensive to parents with young children who visit libraries. Public libraries, which are open to all, should have separate sections for explicit materials. There are so many books in libraries that one may easily come across something offensive. Parents should have a say in whether a book belongs on the shelf. Although I haven't experienced this myself, it could happen at any time. If I were a parent, I would not want my children to see sexual magazines or books in a public library. Some people may counter - argue this stance. They may ask why children should be allowed in adult sections or why discouraged people are reading bad - example books. Adults should have their own section for adult - oriented materials, and children should stick to age - appropriate areas. In conclusion, although those who counter - argue may have points, I still firmly believe that offensive books should be removed from shelves. Book lovers want positive entertainment, and younger children need proper influence. Removing offensive and non - influential books from libraries is an important step in improving society and ensuring a positive reading environment for all.
1626	4603	2	2	What has become of the right to freedom of knowledge for everyone? I firmly believe that certain materials should not be removed simply because someone deems them 'offensive' or 'inappropriate'. Our youth possess the right to access these materials. This right is crucial as it broadens access to knowledge, offers more realistic insights into life, and prevents them from being isolated from the world. We must not deprive children of this opportunity.  Firstly, all children and students globally should have access to a wider range of knowledge. If certain materials are censored and removed, they lose the chance to engage with that type of learning. For instance, a student eager to learn about government and politics through an article may be unable to do so if the article is removed due to a minor comment. We cannot stifle our thirst for learning about the world.  Secondly, such materials can provide a more accurate representation of people, places, things, or events. Explicit content offers children more detailed information about how life truly is. Without it, they may develop a skewed understanding and unrealistic expectations, which could have emotional or psychological consequences when they encounter the real world. They should be well - informed about life in greater detail to avoid confusion later on.  Finally, censorship can isolate children from the world. Being shielded from knowledge can cause emotional stress. A friend of mine had over - protective parents who kept her ignorant of many aspects of the world. As she grew older, she struggled to adapt and became fearful of the real world. This was a direct result of her parents' over - censorship.  Our students should always have access to knowledge, detailed insights into life, and the ability to understand the modern world. We cannot allow censorship to make irrational decisions about what we can and cannot access. If censorship has such a negative impact on society and our youth, it should be re - evaluated.
1627	4604	2	2	"Hello, I'm Kristin, and I'm here to explain why certain items should be removed from public libraries. You may or may not be familiar with magazines like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. I used to read them, and some issues contain sex tips.  If I were a mother and my child asked to check out such a magazine, I'd say no. Children shouldn't learn about sex until they're in their teens, at least 13 or 14. Some parents share my view, believing children shouldn't be exposed to this topic. However, others think it's inevitable that children will learn about sex in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they're married.  There are other items that don't belong in libraries. Some music, like rap, isn't suitable for young children. Rap often contains a lot of cursing and sexual references. Phrases like ""shorty let me rind you like a huricain"" are inappropriate. I want my child to listen to positive content like ""let's go outside and camp"" or ""duck duck gusse"".  Regarding movies, as long as they're not over @NUM1, they can be watched with kids. For example, my 10 - year - old niece can watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6, but only when her parents are in the room. If she watches it alone, she'll be grounded.  In conclusion, due to the inappropriate content in some magazines, music, and movies, these items should be removed from public libraries to ensure a suitable environment for children."
1628	4605	2	2	I believe that the materials on the library shelf are accessible to anyone. Moreover, these materials can be removed as long as they are returned to their original place.  My experience with books isn't particularly extensive, but I do enjoy reading in my spare time. When I borrow a book, I examine it carefully to ensure I really want to read it and to appreciate its merits. I'm not a fast reader, but I'm always curious about how a book begins and ends.  When it comes to magazines, I usually don't take them out of the library. Magazines can be expensive and difficult to replace. If I do look at one, I focus on the important information.  I think movies shouldn't always be available in libraries. People might get ideas from movies or even steal them. Also, movies are costly if they're taken out of the library. When I watch a movie from the library, I try to enjoy it as much as possible because I won't be able to watch it after returning it.  Music is a passion for many. Most people buy CDs to listen to. I listen to music to get inspiration if I ever want to become a musician. Sometimes, I write down song lyrics to understand what the singer is singing about or listen to the song repeatedly.  In conclusion, any item taken from the library shelf should be returned to its proper place. Failure to do so will lead to consequences and a loss of trust.
1629	4606	2	2	Do you think censorship is a good thing? Do you believe libraries should take more responsibility for what they offer? Many people think so, but I disagree. If someone doesn't want to learn about a particular topic, they simply don't have to read the relevant book.  Public libraries are extremely beneficial to the community. They are especially helpful for children who don't have access to certain materials at home. Libraries do consider the information children access, which is why there are restricted areas for children of specific ages. Moreover, it's not just the library's responsibility; parents also play a role in ensuring their kids don't read inappropriate materials.  What may be offensive to some may not be to others. People have different viewpoints. These materials should not be removed as they may be important in our lives. All information is useful in some way. The vast amount of knowledge in libraries should not be taken away just because someone wishes it.  In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of information in libraries and not let censorship limit our access to knowledge.
1630	4607	2	2	Our books and movies can be overly scary and unnecessary, with excessive violence and disturbing content. For young kids, such scary materials can give them nightmares. Books like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are suitable for teenage children. @ORGANIZATION1 teaches them about the past and what it was like in previous times.  As parents, it is crucial to ensure that kids watch the right shows and movies, including those that are educational. Hitler's treatment of people was extremely cruel, and he killed a large number of individuals. I believe it is a valuable lesson for kids to watch movies and read books about him. Additionally, @CAPS1 is a good book because it teaches both girls and boys that forcing something on someone is wrong.  There was a girl who was physically and mentally abused. She called for help, but no one heard her. She never spoke up, and one could tell she was in pain just from her appearance and silence. Movies like this should teach kids to never mistreat others.  Parents should closely monitor what their kids read and be cautious about their activities. They should provide books that can impart valuable lessons. In conclusion, by being vigilant and providing appropriate materials, parents can help their children grow into empathetic and well - informed individuals.
1631	4608	2	2	Libraries are repositories of diverse materials, which various individuals may like or dislike. There are books on @PERSON1, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. These books are not intended to offend but rather to educate on the relevant subjects. Censorship should primarily apply to the youth. As adults, individuals have the freedom to access all information and are responsible for making their own choices and living by them. If one finds a book, song, or movie offensive, the appropriate response is to stop engaging with it. It is inevitable that not everyone will be satisfied. It is firmly believed that no citizen has the right to remove materials from a library. This is because @NUM1 - everyone has unique @CAPS2 and perspectives on @NUM3 - @CAPS5 the @CAPS6. In conclusion, while censorship exists, it should not be excessive. We should be allowed to pursue our interests and acquire knowledge. In school, we are often compelled to learn specific content. It is believed that we have the right to access external knowledge, and the means to do so are through databases such as computers, books, music, and art.
1632	4609	2	2	Libraries are dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. They house books, magazines, movies, and various forms of media, all with the singular purpose of facilitating learning and exploration. When we visit libraries, our expectation is to find the information we seek. Whether it's a simple inquiry about a flower species or in - depth research on the infamous 'In @CAPS1 @CAPS2', we desire unadulterated truth and information. Library materials should never be excluded. Every piece has some value, whether it's for cultural, spiritual, entertainment, or other purposes. Books can serve as gateways to new knowledge and different worlds. What some may consider 'censored' books are often judged from a single perspective. Another person might find these very books exactly what they need. If someone deems a book 'offensive', they should try to understand others' viewpoints and recognize how the information could be useful to someone else. Sensitive topics like the @CAPS3 or religious books may be considered for censorship, but this only reflects the concerns of one group. What about the rest? Now, it's not that racy or graphic movies and magazines should be allowed in libraries. However, any material with legitimate cultural, educational, or entertainment value should never be removed. From working in a local library, it's known that when people become members, they sign an agreement acknowledging the available materials. This also applies to allowing their children to borrow items. If parents think libraries are exposing their children to inappropriate content, they should read the fine - print. They are, in fact, consenting to their children's access to this raw information and entertainment. Libraries are established to provide open access to information for all. They should contain materials on any topic they can obtain, and none should be denied. People rely on libraries as a vital source of knowledge, and efforts should be made to continuously expand this source.
1633	4610	2	2	The issue at hand is that some people believe certain items should not be in libraries. I firmly oppose the removal of materials from library shelves. This is because each family has a different concept of what is 'offensive'. One family may be comfortable with their child watching a particular movie, listening to certain music, or reading specific genres of books. Removing these items would limit people's ability to express themselves as they wish. Moreover, libraries would lose patronage as people would notice the restrictions on available materials and be less likely to visit if they can't find what they're looking for. In conclusion, library materials should remain accessible to accommodate the diverse preferences of all patrons.
1634	4611	2	2	Imagine taking a trip to the library one day and coming across an offensive book. Would you request its removal or simply ignore it? Every year, countless @CAPS1 visit libraries in search of engaging books, driven by personal interests and observations. People have varied tastes in books, which means libraries contain both offensive and non - offensive materials. As a teenager, I've visited libraries and often found some content more offensive than others. Like many, I choose to ignore it. The reason is straightforward: everyone's views are shaped by their life experiences from birth. Different life experiences lead to different views on what is offensive. For example, as a person of a certain race, I find books about slavery offensive. However, a book about the Black Panther organization might be offensive to someone else. Does this mean these books should be removed? Books have different tones, whether dealing with life, politics, or global issues, and they can evoke different emotions in different people. I've seen people feel uplifted by a book while others feel terrible after reading the same one. Take a magazine, for instance. One reader might see a beautiful model and feel good about themselves, while an overweight reader might feel inadequate. Just because of these different reactions, the magazine shouldn't be removed from the shelves. People choose books based on their interests. If a book, magazine, or movie seems offensive, readers are likely to avoid it. I've come across offensive materials in libraries and simply ignored them. Sometimes, I've picked up a seemingly non - offensive book only to find it offensive later. In such cases, I return the book and choose another. If I see an offensive book in a library, I won't ask for its removal; I'll just ignore it. Since everyone has different views on what is offensive, the best approach is to ignore it.
1635	4612	2	2	In the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1', books are illegal. In this society, possessing a book results in punishment. Without books, @CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment, and the society lost its human emotions and became submissive to the government. This led to government - inflicted injustices as there was no opposition. Katherine Paterson warns that if books are discarded, 'no books will be left on the shelf for anyone.' Some @CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every requested removal were carried out, many important works would be lost. A recent debate surrounds @PERSON1's 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1'. Set in the @LOCATION3 during slavery, @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON4 befriends a black man, @PERSON6, and shares experiences along the @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 used the authentic diction of the time, being the first to do so. As a result, the book contains the n - word multiple times, which is unacceptable today and offends many. Nevertheless, this book is a significant part of the @CAPS5 cannon. @PERSON1's work represents a new and groundbreaking writing method. Removing it from library shelves would mean losing one of the most important pieces of @CAPS5 literature. '@ORGANIZATION2' by @PERSON3 explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at @LOCATION2, he discovers his homosexuality, falls in love with @PERSON5, and has detailed sexual relationships described in the book. At first glance, it may seem crude, but @PERSON3 struggled with bisexuality and family issues throughout his life. He expressed his feelings through his characters. The story is about entrapment and human relationships, not just sex. Removing this book from libraries would mean many @CAPS2 people missing a story they could relate to. Katherine Paterson poses an important question: What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer is a society unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media plays a crucial role in enlightening, persuading, and educating people about important issues. Although some works may contain offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning.
1636	4613	2	2	"To the newspaper editors, the question of whether books, music, movies, magazines, and other reading materials should be removed if they are considered offensive is a complex one. In my opinion, this is not a good idea. As an author (@PERSON1) once said, if we remove books from the shelves, there will be ""no more books for any of us to read."" This is true because there are likely many books that some people may find offensive, but it could be that these readers do not fully understand the materials. For example, the topic of same - gender relationships may be offensive to some, but perhaps these readers simply do not understand or accept it.  Another reason against removal is that in America, we have the freedom of speech and expression. People have the right to write and talk about what they want. Just because a reading material offends one person does not mean the writer's work should be taken away. Removing such materials is akin to silencing the writer.  Moreover, as humans, we are constantly eager to learn new things. Reading books, listening to music, watching movies, and reading magazines is an excellent way to learn. We can discover new events, unknown places, improve our grammar, learn different writing styles, and gain more knowledge about various topics. This process of learning is not only educational but also enjoyable.  Removing reading materials can also make other readers feel isolated. For instance, a true - story about a breakup, family issues, or the death of a loved one can provide comfort to those going through similar experiences. Taking away such materials takes away a source of solace from both the writer and the reader.  Finally, even if we remove a material from the library shelf, the topic will still exist. It can be found on the radio, the internet, and other platforms. We cannot eliminate every trace of it. People will still talk about it, and we cannot stop them. In conclusion, although some reading materials may be offensive to some, it is better to tolerate them and let individuals make their own choices. Maybe the offended readers should try to understand the materials better, as they may end up learning something new or finding comfort in them."
1637	4614	2	2	Offensive articles, movies, magazines, and other materials should not be completely removed from shelves. It is an individual's personal choice whether to read or watch such materials. However, an age limit should be set for these materials. If someone finds a material offensive, they should simply choose not to engage with it.  In a public library, offensive materials should be kept in a separate area. This ensures that they are not accessible to small children or those who do not wish to see them. Historic materials, such as diaries and accounts of events, are better stored in federal libraries. Having these documents in a public library may expose small children to inappropriate content.  Some items, like magazines, newspapers, and books, are available at the public - library level. Government - affiliated documents, including parts of history and important national documents, should be stored in federal libraries. High - profile documents, such as the constitution, should be kept in high - security areas.  In conclusion, people who want to view certain materials should have the right to do so, but these materials should not be freely accessible to small children. An age limit is crucial to prevent children from getting the wrong message. Storing certain documents in public libraries and others in federal libraries is a practical approach. Important government - related and historical documents should be stored securely at the federal level. This way, the rights of different users can be balanced, and the appropriate use of materials can be ensured.
1638	4615	2	2	Communities are composed of diverse individuals, and different groups may have varying views on what is offensive. Libraries, being public spaces, often become the stage for such conflicts. Since most libraries are open to the public, a wide range of people share the materials, including books, movies, magazines, and music. Libraries strive to offer a variety of materials to satisfy everyone, but this is where the conflict arises. Some people may find certain materials offensive while the library is trying to please all.  The question of whether offensive materials should be removed from library shelves should be answered with a no. Libraries need to have a diverse collection to meet the needs of all community members. People have different beliefs and values. Just because one person finds a particular type of material offensive does not mean it is offensive to everyone. Take religion as an example. One person may find a book on a certain religion offensive, but others may strongly believe in that religion.  Libraries are for all people. The fact that one person is offended by a material does not justify its removal for everyone. If libraries were to remove every material that someone found offensive, there would be hardly any materials left. People have always had different beliefs, and this is likely to remain the case. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection of materials, allowing individuals to make their own choices about what to read or access.
1639	4616	2	2	"I firmly believe that the censorship in libraries is quite unacceptable. There should be no censorship; it is the parents' responsibility to decide what their children can and cannot watch. If someone finds a material offensive, they should simply avoid it.  For example, the book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" has been banned and unbanned from many school libraries due to its vulgar words and references to rape. I think this is unfair because children aged @NUM1 and above will inevitably hear rude and offensive things in real life. Books, movies, and music with curse words are a part of life, as most adults use such language. Removing these materials from libraries affects both adults and children. It is up to parents to decide when, or if, their children are exposed to such content.  Using ""offensive"" remarks is also a part of our history. In the context of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" the slang used by black people and the cursing of men when angry were common at that time. It reflects how people were and are.  Removing offensive materials from library shelves will not protect adolescents from hearing such content. Teenagers have the right to access these materials if they want, and parents have the right to allow them. Bleeping out words in songs on the radio is pointless because teenagers will know what is being said. Banning books only makes kids more curious about the ""forbidden"" words.  In conclusion, we have the right to hear and read these materials. Removing them is a violation of our freedom and free will. Parents should supervise their children's reading and listening choices instead of relying on censorship. Singling out a particular book or song for removal is unjust and ineffective."
1640	4617	2	2	Throughout life, everyone encounters things they find offensive, and people's views on what is offensive vary widely. Offense can be related to various topics such as race, religion, and gender.  In a public library, if someone finds a book offensive, it should not be removed. Removing a book just because one person dislikes it is unfair to other library users. What may be offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. There are many valid reasons for a book to be in the library, such as helping with research, writing papers, or learning about a subject. If we were to remove every item in a library that one person found offensive, there would be very few materials left.  All books should remain in the library, even if one person finds them offensive. It is unjust to the non - offended person if they cannot check out a book because someone else is offended by it. If the concern is about children checking out offensive materials, it is the parents' responsibility to supervise their children's choices. A child may learn something new from an offensive book.  Even offensive materials can be educational. Reading such materials can change one's mind on a topic and introduce new opinions to others. The only valid reason for removing a book, movie, magazine, or music from a library would be if everyone in the library community agreed that it was offensive.  In conclusion, all library materials should stay on the shelves. Authors write for a reason, and these materials should be available to those who want to read or access them. If someone does not like a material, they should simply not check it out. Even offensive materials can be useful to others, so we should tolerate the diversity of opinions and materials in libraries.
1641	4618	2	2	To @CAPS1 and @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2, and I am from @ORGANIZATION2. I concur that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are not suitable for children to learn about. Many of the materials read by children, teens, and adults can lead to violence and threats, which is a significant issue in today's world. We aspire to a calm and peaceful world. Often, we observe teens and children getting into fights or using offensive language. This is mainly because they either watch @CAPS3 shows with negative content, read inappropriate books, or attempt to act cool. If we were to stock more important learning materials such as books and movies, there would be less aggression in the world. Hearing someone say they read a wonderful book from @ORGANIZATION1 that taught them something new in life would be truly gratifying. Teaching children something memorable and helpful in the long - run is of the utmost importance. Knowing that they are engaged in educational activities brings a great sense of satisfaction. Currently, we rarely see kids doing what they should be doing as they are too preoccupied with seeking trouble. It is essential for them to learn about positive things that can assist them in life. The world is tough for these kids, and they should be taught in the best possible way.
1642	4619	2	2	Materials like books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. A public library is a place where people expect to find content that does not harm or hurt them. Libraries are meant for people to enjoy various materials, whether it's a book, movie, or magazine. When individuals visit the library in search of useful information, they anticipate finding good tips, not being disappointed. For instance, encountering racist content can be disheartening. No one should have to come across offensive material in a library; it is unfair. Regarding parents with children, it is highly unlikely that they would want their children to have unrestricted access in a library and stumble upon porn or other negative influences. Parents who value their children's good education understand the need for a clean and appropriate library environment. It is unjust for library visitors to expect satisfaction but instead be let down. This not only does no good to the individuals but can also give a bad impression of the community. Libraries are supposed to provide useful information, fun facts, and good resources. Therefore, it is necessary to put away the inappropriate books, music, magazines, etc.
1643	4620	2	2	In my opinion, censorship is beneficial, but only to a certain extent. Censorship should be based on the age group of the consumer and the permission of parents or guardians. Consumers aged twelve and under should purchase censored books and other products. However, those aged thirteen and above should be able to buy uncensored products. Some people oppose censored products as they believe it detracts from the essence of the item. For example, many people get angry when song lyrics on a @CAPS1 are censored because it prevents them from experiencing the full effect of the music and the message the artist or band intends to convey. With books, people are often upset because they cannot grasp the complete aspect of the book. Censoring a book is like mutilating a masterpiece. Some books, such as many romance novels with graphic sexual themes and content, should be censored and not be available on the shelves. In the case of magazines, it depends on the type. Political magazines may not present all the true facts and details for specific reasons. Hunting or fishing magazines, on the other hand, can include all the facts about guns, calls, lures, and stories without censorship. Movies are censored on certain channels. Channels like @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS3 on a @CAPS2 network censor movies. However, movie - only channels like @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS4 do not censor movies. This is also why movies have ratings. An R - rated movie is restricted to those under seventeen without an adult present, @NUM1 is for those sixteen and under without an adult, and @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are suitable for all age groups. Overall, censorship truly depends on the age group of the consumer. Elementary school students probably should not be able to buy uncensored products. Those aged thirteen to fifteen should be able to buy products with adult permission, and those sixteen and older should be able to purchase uncensored products without an adult, as they can handle the potentially offensive material.
1644	4621	2	2	Books, music, movies, and other media are all important, especially for kids. If we start removing one book from the shelf, others may follow suit, and the bookshelves will almost be empty. The same principle applies to movies, magazines, and music. Although some parents do not want their young children to read or watch uncensored materials from the library, it is the parents' responsibility to supervise their children, select appropriate materials, and teach them what is right and wrong to read or watch. Libraries typically require @CAPS1 cards. These cards grant access to adult materials based on the type of card a person has. Since parents decide what materials their children can access, they should not blame others if their children take something they dislike from the shelf. Libraries have taken all necessary measures to ensure the safety of the society. If we attempt to remove every book, movie, song, or magazine that contains offensive content, we would have to remove almost everything. People have different cultures and beliefs, and what one person finds offensive, another may consider normal. In today's society, many people are attracted to movies or music with inappropriate content as such materials have become prevalent in the media. We cannot stop the publication of such materials, but we can censor them. The internet, @ORGANIZATION1, and libraries can all be under parental supervision. Therefore, parents should not blame anyone but themselves if their children read or see unacceptable materials. Libraries should maintain their current state of censorship without any changes. Parents need to fully supervise their children. Libraries already have sufficient restrictions and rules regarding books and movies based on a person's age.
1645	4622	2	2	I firmly believe that there should be censorship in libraries for those who are uncomfortable with the content on the shelves. No one should have any issues taking themselves or their children to a library. A public library is frequented by children of all ages, sizes, and races. If I were to take my child to a public library, I would not want to worry about whether they would read or view something inappropriate or unappealing. Censorship in libraries can create a safe and comfortable environment for everyone, especially for parents who want to ensure their children's exposure to suitable materials. Therefore, implementing appropriate censorship measures in libraries is a necessary step to meet the diverse needs of library users.
1646	4623	2	2	Throughout my life, I have visited numerous libraries and encountered a wide range of book categories, including comedy, fiction, non - fiction, and drama. As we all know, there are topics that are inappropriate for minors or certain age groups. In today's era, movies often contain excessive explicit content. For instance, some cartoons have sexual elements like kissing, which some parents do not want their children to be exposed to. Moreover, movies can sometimes implant false beliefs in people's minds about how things are, will be, or how they should be perceived. However, libraries also house good movies such as documentaries, history films, and biographies, which offer valuable insights into the past and present.  Magazines are another aspect. There are strange happenings in the world, and while we put them in magazines, children can easily access them in libraries. Some of the pictures in magazines are inappropriate. Nevertheless, magazines can be as useful as books, carrying helpful information.  Music is also an important part of libraries. Some CDs have good content, but there is also a lot of inappropriate material. Many well - known artists use harsh and profane language that children and many others should not hear. On the bright side, there is gospel, jazz, and other genres that people enjoy listening to.  In conclusion, libraries contain both good and bad materials. In my opinion, libraries should be more cautious about what people can access. A young child who can read could easily pick up an adult book and be exposed to content that parents would rather they avoid. Therefore, offensive materials should be removed from the library shelves.
1647	4624	2	2	Censorship in libraries is a highly controversial topic with two opposing views. The pro - censorship side believes that some literary materials in libraries may be offensive to certain individuals and should be removed or censored. The pro - free - speech side argues that all literary materials in libraries should be retained, regardless of whether they are considered offensive. Clearly, censorship should not be implemented in libraries because it violates the right to free speech, dilutes the true meanings and expressions of literary works, and deprives interested readers of the opportunity to read such works.  The first reason why censoring literary materials in libraries is unjust is the right to free speech. This right belongs to all citizens of @LOCATION1 and should not be taken away simply because one person deems something offensive. I have noticed that many people often try to deprive others of this right, and implementing censorship will do the same to authors.  The second reason is that censorship will dull the true meanings and expressive themes that literary works are intended to convey. Take the famous 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' as an example. Although this novel contains offensive language at times, omitting such language would change the reading experience significantly. @PERSON1's expressions in the story would be greatly diminished and nearly silenced.  The third reason is that censorship removes the availability of books for interested readers. I have often seen people throw tantrums over offensive literary works. I have been offended by what I've read, but instead of demanding removal or a less - offensive substitute, I either stopped reading or continued. Offensive language in literary works is usually used to make a strong point rather than to attack the reader. If a person finds the material too offensive, they should stop reading and find a more suitable work. By remaining calm, the literary work can stay on the shelves for others who want to read it.  In conclusion, removing or censoring literary works in libraries is a bad idea. It violates the author's right to free speech, dilutes the author's true meanings and expressions, and deprives interested people of the opportunity to read. This would be a regrettable decision in the long run, which is why censoring literary works in libraries is unjust.
1648	4625	2	2	Dear @PERSON1, newspaper editor.  Removing books, CDs, DVDs, magazines, etc., from libraries because they are considered offensive or obscene is a weak - willed move. Some people think the world should be perfect, but in reality, it is far from it, and it's disheartening that only a small percentage of people have accepted this truth. If I haven't convinced you yet, please keep reading.  I believe that if the world can't handle the materials on the shelves of public libraries, they should just leave them alone and stick to their preferred reading selections. If someone is offended, they can go elsewhere to read.  I understand that some people may have been in the library first. In that case, they can politely ask the person or people who are causing offense to move.  The world is not perfect. There are positive aspects, such as the @CAPS1 nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (@CAPS2.A.T.O.). However, for some reason, people act as if they'll die without perfection. They've decided to remove offensive and obscene content from libraries worldwide, leading to boredom and an ill - conceived sense of perfection. I refuse to let this mindset take hold of me, and I hope you'll make the same choice.  Yours @CAPS3 @CAPS4
1649	4626	2	2	Reading is a personal choice made for entertainment, enjoyment, and knowledge acquisition. Reading should not be restricted in any way. If a person is interested in a book, they should have the right to read it. In my opinion, censorship in libraries is not a good idea.  It is astonishing that some people want to take away others' right to read the books of their choice. I know that some books can be descriptive and graphic, but the boundaries should be set at home. If a parent doesn't want their child to read a certain book, they shouldn't impose their views on the entire community. It's unfair to others.  If you don't find a book entertaining or enjoyable because you consider it offensive, there are many other books to choose from. No one is forcing you to read a book you don't like. That's why libraries have different sections, ranging from mystery to romance. Find a different book and let those who like offensive books read them. This way, everyone will be happy.  Libraries are places where people borrow and read books. Usually, people choose a book based on its cover or a friend's recommendation. If libraries start removing books from the shelves, there will be fewer books for the rest of us to read. Eventually, there may even be no more libraries.  Just because a few people think a book contains offensive words, scenes, or ideas, it doesn't mean they should take away others' right to read it. If you have a problem with a book, simply don't read it. Don't make other book - lovers suffer because of one person's opinion.
1650	4627	2	2	I firmly believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive. We don't need media that causes people to judge others based on what they read.  Offensive media can hurt people's feelings. I recall reading a book that had extremely offensive content about homeless people. It made them seem like terrible individuals, which is often not true. I felt bad reading it, and I remember some people who believed every word. These people now look down on homeless people rudely. So, there's no reason to keep such a book in the library. Many books can change the way people think.  There is also a lot of offensive music. Nowadays, most of the songs people listen to are offensive, but we often don't notice. These songs should not be available in libraries because anyone can rent them. Singing a song that one thinks is okay can actually hurt someone's feelings.  Magazines are another area that libraries need to monitor. Most magazines are fine, but some include inappropriate stories. To protect everyone, libraries should thoroughly review magazines to ensure they are not offensive.  Movies are a medium that libraries really need to carefully consider. They should realize that children can rent movies and think about whether they are appropriate. I think libraries should only have family - oriented movies to ensure that no one is harmed by what they watch.  In conclusion, libraries should be extremely careful when selecting media. They should try to limit offensive content to prevent anyone from getting hurt.
1651	4628	2	2	Should libraries implement censorship? People hold diverse views on this question. In my opinion, libraries should never have censorship. Allowing censorship in libraries is an infringement of our rights and contradicts the freedom of the press. Everyone has the right to have their opinions read. Censorship in libraries also goes against the freedom of speech. Writing is essentially written speech. If someone wants to express something, they should have the right to do so. Just as a mute person can convey their thoughts through writing. What one person finds offensive, another may not. Those who find a particular piece of content offensive can simply choose not to read it. In conclusion, libraries should remain free from censorship to uphold the rights and freedoms of all individuals.
1652	4629	2	2	The quote 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' sums up the situation perfectly. If everyone had a say in what is offensive, everything would be deemed so. Books are either for entertainment or informational purposes. People have different views on books, so it's unfair to ban a book just because someone else doesn't want others to read it. Personally, I like books with action and an intense plot. I understand that some may find such books offensive, especially for children, but I've read similar books since I was in @NUM1 grade and they haven't had a negative impact on me. Even the librarian asked me about removing a book with vulgar language, but I found it interesting. Many informational books, like dictionaries and encyclopedias, can also be accessed by children. I once looked for 'bad words' in the dictionary as a kid, but that doesn't justify removing it. Even school - assigned books have 'bad words'. My @CAPS1 teacher was against removing 'To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3' because it was an interesting read. Books can't be taken away from high - schoolers just because some adults find them offensive, as they teach valuable morals. In politics and other topics, people have different opinions. If one book is removed, it could start a chain reaction until no books are left. The answer to whether libraries should be censored is no. Books are published for a reason, and in the end, a book is just a book.
1653	4630	2	2	Have you ever entered a library and seen a book you wouldn't want your child or any young person to read? There are indeed many books in the library suitable for young children. I don't think a particular book should be removed from the library just because it's offensive to some or not suitable for children. Instead, there are several ways to keep these books away from kids. One option is to move these books to a higher shelf. This will keep them out of children's sight and reach, preventing them from getting their hands on these books. Another possibility is to designate a specific area for these books in the library. This creates a 'barrier' that allows you to tell your child to stay away from that area and keep an eye on them. You'll also know where these books are and can ensure your child doesn't go there. The final option is to put an age limit on these books. This way, children must be of a certain age to check them out, preventing them from reading the offensive content. In conclusion, these methods can effectively keep offensive books out of children's hands.
1654	4631	2	2	People have varying views on censorship. Some believe that certain movies, books, newspapers, etc., contain subject matter inappropriate for some viewers and that there should be restrictions on what is written. Others advocate for freedom of speech, believing that people have the right to express themselves on any topic. There are indeed stories that I find inappropriate, but I know that what I consider useless or offensive may be valuable to someone else. Everyone has different beliefs. If people could control what was available in libraries, @PERSON1's statement 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us' would come true. Certain materials can be useful and interesting to specific people, regardless of the subject, as long as they are of the right age. However, if a story is solely about drugs, sex, alcohol, and violence with no real value, it should be removed from the shelf. We don't know who might access such content, and we don't want to expose children to it. In conclusion, while we shouldn't remove materials that could be useful to anyone, there should be a limit to what is available.
1655	4632	2	2	What happened to using books and films just for entertainment? Why are we now so cautious about what our children pick from the library shelves? Society has changed our perception of entertainment. Books are now viewed with suspicion, and once - harmless movies and magazines are filled with inappropriate content. Music, once a beautiful art form, now often contains mindless words and curses. Libraries should be cautious when lending materials that are not suitable for certain users. There was a young girl, 14 or 15, who loved reading and music. She used books as friends and visited the library daily. One day, she found a used book on the top shelf. After reading it, she was filled with guilt as it contained a harmful message. There should have been a warning. The difference between writing something offensive and being offensive is that the author may not intend to be hurtful. When we find offensive content, we can put it down. But what about our children? How do we protect them from offensive literature, music, and movies? Remember the old black - and - white films with happy endings? While there are still positive movies, many blockbusters contain violence, racism, or sexual content. Libraries should be very careful when labeling books, movies, and magazines. Librarians should ensure that the materials children borrow are age - appropriate. Parents should also be cautious when letting their children go to the movies. I don't think libraries should remove certain materials from their shelves, but we should be careful about what we read and watch. Use the internet to find reviews before deciding. Have fun, but stay safe.
1656	4633	2	2	I firmly believe that books, magazines, and music containing offensive content should be removed. Such materials can overly stimulate the imagination of children and adults, leading them to perceive improper behaviors as normal. All inappropriate items should be disposed of to prevent their use by anyone. I am convinced that exposure to such content can have a negative impact on individuals as they grow and develop. Books and music that are not used for positive purposes should be taken off the shelves. Magazines and books with pornographic or otherwise inappropriate content must be removed. Both children and adults have vivid imaginations, and exposure to such content can sometimes lead to harmful behavior towards others, including family members. Books, magazines, and music are meant to inspire, not distract. Unknowingly, what one sees, reads, or hears can cause harm to loved ones. The negative effects of such content on people can be significant. If the materials we consume, such as books, magazines, and music, cause more problems than they solve, they should be removed from the market. Sometimes, people are attracted to these items because of the images they contain. However, the ideas presented in these materials can be harmful. All in all, I am of the opinion that offensive books, magazines, and music should be removed as they offer no benefits to the mind. In my view, trashy books and music can even lead to suicidal thoughts or impulsive actions that one may later regret. Therefore, these items are of no use to either individuals or children. In conclusion, non - useful books, magazines, and music should be removed from shelves, and items that stimulate the mind should be put in their place. Materials that do not contribute to mental well - being should be discarded. Allowing such items to remain can lead to instability in life and wrong decisions that result in failure. Ultimately, all non - useful books, magazines, and music should be removed.
1657	4634	2	2	"I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves just because they're considered offensive. First, we need to figure out what's offensive to most people and who should decide if something should be censored. People should be able to choose for themselves whether to pick up an item from the shelf, as what one person finds offensive, another might not. For example, if you're a parent, you have the right to stop your children from accessing certain materials, but you can't have them removed from the shelf because that would restrict others who find the content acceptable. Offensive content can range from swear words to extreme violence. Some people don't mind a few bad words or a bit of violence, while others find it very offensive. In my experience, I don't think a little cussing is offensive, but I know some people who are really bothered by even a single mild swear word. Many modern movies have mildly offensive content, but it often depends on how seriously you take it. These movies might make fun of things that some people find offensive, which can upset those people even more. But they don't have to watch the movies if they don't want to! It all depends on the person, their upbringing, and their sense of right and wrong. It's either an individual's or a parent's responsibility to decide if the content of a book or movie is appropriate. Parents often say that children are too young to judge, and that's true. That's why most children's books and movies are suitable and don't contain content that's too much for them. If you're older, you can usually decide for yourself what to read or watch as it's more age - appropriate. You've probably already been exposed to the ideas in books and movies in your daily life. It comes down to who the content is for and what's suitable for their age. Removing these items from the shelves would be a disaster. School reading lists would have to be cut because of parental disapproval, and children would miss out on valuable knowledge in literature. Someone might want to rent their favorite horror movie, but it won't be available because a few people found it offensive. If one person's disapproval led to removal, there'd be nothing left in libraries as every item would have at least one detractor. I once read ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" and our teacher told us it was banned in another state because a few parents didn't like one or two things in it. This book has many valuable ideas and lessons and is a great piece of literature. These parents wanted it banned nationwide, which would violate others' freedom of speech. Parents can voice their opinions and keep their own children from reading it, but they can't stop others from having access. Taking these items off the shelves would also take away important ideas. Literature, movies, and other forms of media shape our culture. Many social movements started with literature. Censorship would take away a part of our culture, which would be devastating. So, think about what you find offensive, then consider someone else's perspective. Almost everything offends someone, but it's up to you and your family to decide what's appropriate. Library shelves should stay full as it's a way to express freedom of speech, which is essential to our country and culture."
1658	4635	2	2	"Censorship in libraries has its merits in some respects. Readers should have access to a wide range of books. However, almost anything can be considered offensive these days, which is quite ridiculous. For example, a book about Native Americans and their poor treatment might offend some. But in reality, there will always be something that someone finds offensive. In my own experience, I wasn't overly bothered by offensive content in general. Once, in a library, I was flipping through a book and came across a paragraph with the word ""nigger."" I found it a bit offensive as that word is simply not nice. People have different preferences for books, movies, magazines, etc. Some of the greatest movies of all time might be offensive to some. What one person finds offensive, another might not. My aunt, for instance, finds magazines offensive because of the bathing - suit models advertising swimsuits or liquor. In conclusion, just about everything is offensive to someone. If we were to remove all offensive items, there would be very few books, movies, etc. left, and it would be a real shame."
1659	4636	2	2	I firmly believe that people have the right to listen to, read, and watch whatever they choose. It's an individual's own decision what media they consume, and taking away offensive movies or books won't change their preferences. They'll simply find other sources. Everyone has the right to engage with content they believe is beneficial. If others find it offensive, that's their issue. People have the freedom to make their own choices, and trying to restrict them will only make them more determined to access the content. Removing offensive books, music, movies, and magazines won't solve the problem of offensive behavior in society; it will only hide it. Taking these items out won't suddenly make people stop being offensive; they'll just stop doing it in libraries. Every form of media will be offensive to someone. If we remove all offensive content, there will be nothing left to read or watch. This is a reality we have to accept. Therefore, I strongly oppose censorship in libraries. It not only takes away our right to access the media we want but also eliminates almost all books and movies, as almost every piece of media is offensive to someone. If we remove all the so - called offensive books, our libraries will be empty. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a bad idea that undermines our freedom of choice and access to diverse media.
1660	4637	2	2	"I don't think certain books should be taken off library shelves. There are many things in the world that can be considered offensive, such as gangs, politics, race, and even the schools children attend. I understand the desire to protect children, but it's impossible to shield them from everything. In inner cities, gangs write offensive words on trains, buildings, and other public places. You can't just ""remove"" this from their view. Politics can be extremely divisive. During presidential elections, candidates often bring up each other's skin color and personal details. Children watch this on TV. Racial conflicts are a global problem. People fight because of the color of their skin, and it's an ongoing battle that shows no sign of ending. In my school, there are various issues like young kids swearing, older kids fighting, and students who do well in school being bullied. You can't keep kids in the dark forever. Sooner or later, they'll encounter these problems. Instead of removing books, it's better to keep kids off the streets. Reading about these issues in a book is safer than experiencing them in the real world. Parents and guardians need to prepare children for the challenges ahead. If they don't, children may be more severely affected by real - life situations than by the words in books, magazines, or movies. In conclusion, removing books from shelves is not the solution. We should use these resources to help children understand and prepare for the real world."
1661	4638	2	2	"In the book ""Fahrenheit 451"", all books are burned regardless of their content, and the people are constantly sad and depressed. Books are an important part of our lives. While some materials do require censorship as they may offend individuals who are already struggling with their self - identity, there are instances where books are unnecessarily censored. A single rude or misunderstood word can lead to unjust censorship. Censorship, when properly applied, is crucial for libraries. We rely on books for various purposes, from learning to simply passing time. Music has accompanied humanity since the beginning, movies depict the ups and downs of life, and magazines keep us informed about new and interesting things. These elements have become as essential to us as clothes and food. Removing them would make the world a gloomier place. Some content may inadvertently offend people. Katherine Paterson pointed out that if one person has the right to remove an offensive book, then everyone can, and soon all books will disappear. We can strive to be kind to everyone, but inevitably, something will offend someone. We cannot eliminate everything for this reason."
1662	4639	2	2	I firmly believe that censorship is an attempt to cover up the truth. Many define censorship as a book without swear words or a movie without racism, but I disagree. I don't think movies or books should be removed from circulation just because some people find them offensive. When a book uses a swear word to express anger or simply includes it, it's acceptable because that's what we hear in the real world. I understand that some people may not have grown up hearing such language, but many of us have. Regarding movies, if parents have concerns about their children watching inappropriate or offensive content, they should take responsibility and prevent their kids from watching. Nowadays, people often avoid taking blame for the problems in their lives and use censorship as a means to feel like good parents or to claim that the world owes them something. When it comes to race - related issues in movies or books, censorship is often misused. Many people are sensitive about their race or nationality being misrepresented. It's ironic that some racial groups use offensive language among themselves but label it as racism when it appears in a book. Similarly, when a certain race is portrayed in a way that makes them uncomfortable in a movie, the movie is branded as racist. In my opinion, if people have an issue with something they don't agree with, they should exclude it from their own lives. For years, there has been a push to censor school - read books for bad language. Instead of focusing on censoring books, adults should address the real issue, which is the language used by kids in school. If adults realized that they need to guide their children rather than censor books, censorship wouldn't be such a significant problem. Censoring books or movies doesn't eliminate offensive words or bad images; it merely hides them.
1663	4640	2	2	I don't think it's right to remove books from library shelves just because someone finds them offensive. One person's opinion doesn't represent everyone's. A book that one person deems offensive could be a valuable learning resource for a child. The same goes for music, movies, and magazines. These can be accessed elsewhere, so having them in a library shouldn't be a problem. Many kids visit libraries to find school - required books. If people keep removing books from the shelves, it will be difficult for kids to complete their schoolwork. Some may argue that certain books contain content that kids aren't ready to learn, but we'll have to learn about such things eventually, so why not now? Removing music from libraries is also unnecessary. Kids can easily access music on the internet, often in ways that could get them in trouble. Having music in libraries provides a safe and free way for them to access it. Magazines can be bought at stores, but many kids may not have the money. Libraries offer them a chance to view magazines. As long as the content is suitable for kids, there's no harm in libraries having these materials. In my view, removing books, music, magazines, and movies from libraries is a bad idea. Perhaps libraries could create an adult - only section. If someone suggests a book should be placed there, the library staff can review it. While some content may need to be removed, it should be minimal. Otherwise, a library without these resources ceases to be a proper library.
1664	4641	2	2	I believe that offensive content should not be accessible to kids until they are old enough to read or listen to it. Such content should be removed from library shelves or stored separately. This is because it can be harmful and inappropriate for younger kids, and removing it can prevent potential negative impacts. Magazines can be put away or placed in their own sections, and the same goes for music and movies. Internet access to certain websites can also be blocked. Fortunately, in our society, there are adults who can prevent kids from accessing inappropriate content. They can monitor kids and tell them when they are too young for certain things. In my opinion, preventing kids from accessing offensive content is easy. We just need to put it away or remove it from the shelves. By removing offensive materials, we don't have to worry about whether our children are exposed to them.
1665	4642	2	2	I'm writing to express my view that while books, music, movies, magazines, etc. in libraries are great for kids, providing them with a place to go in their free time and a space for reading, some content is not suitable for young kids and young adults. In high school, just walking down the hall, one can encounter inappropriate information. And when entering the library, it sometimes seems as if it is promoting drugs, alcohol, and sex. Books about drugs can be acceptable to a certain extent, especially when they are about medicinal drugs. However, when they describe how drugs relieve pain and make everything better, it goes too far. Our current and future kids do not need to learn about such things. The same applies to alcohol. It is ubiquitous, and kids are starting to consume it at a young age because movies, music, books, etc. are essentially promoting it. Our kids should learn about the dangers of alcohol, not how to get drunk and what to do when drunk. Advertisements, especially those on billboards and magazine covers, are the worst things for kids to see. At such a young age, kids should be encouraged to play outside, participate in sports, have fun with their families, or ride their bikes, rather than being exposed to inappropriate content. I believe that offensive content should be removed from libraries. Taking such content off the shelves may be for the best, as it could lead to healthier and longer - living kids who are not influenced or pressured into using drugs and alcohol.  Sincerely, @PERSON1
1666	4643	2	2	I am writing this letter to share my views on library censorship. Some individuals find books, music, movies, magazines, etc., offensive. However, what may be offensive to one person might not be to another. Therefore, it is essential to consider multiple perspectives rather than just one's own. I firmly believe that these items should not be removed from library shelves. Everyone has different preferences; for example, my mother enjoys vampire books and movies, while I prefer tragedies. This shows that everyone has unique tastes. Additionally, we must also consider that books from certain sources might be offensive to some. Are we going to remove those as well? If we were to take out all offensive materials, there would be little left in libraries. Different people find different things offensive, and it is impossible to please everyone. I understand that some people do not want their children exposed to such content, but it is a part of life. We cannot remove everything to satisfy one individual, as it may upset others. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection, respecting the varied viewpoints of their patrons.
1667	4644	2	2	Libraries are typically peaceful havens where people can relax, enjoy a cup of coffee, read a book or magazine, surf the internet, or listen to their favorite music. However, some individuals misuse this space. They engage in unruly behavior, disrespecting others who are seeking solitude, whether to unwind after a tough day or to prepare for the next one. We often wonder why people choose to read at the library instead of borrowing materials and taking them home. Why is it so important for people to check out books, magazines, music, and movies from the library? I fail to see the significance. Most counties have public libraries, which welcome anyone interested in their resources. It is reasonable for libraries to require borrowers to provide personal information, such as a telephone number, address, or credit card number, when checking out items. This information can be used to ensure that the items are returned on time and to avoid accusations of theft. Many libraries impose late fees, which can deter borrowers from returning items promptly. By collecting credit card information, libraries can automatically charge late fees, ensuring that they are compensated for the overdue items. I know that our school library at @ORGANIZATION1 has struggled with overdue books and unpaid late fees. This issue can be persistent, as some individuals simply do not care. The internet is a different matter, as not everyone can afford to have it at home. I am not writing this letter to complain; rather, I am offering suggestions to keep libraries functional and well - maintained. I believe that my ideas can help libraries in our county and @LOCATION1 serve their communities more effectively.
1668	4645	2	2	Offense is an inevitable part of life. While some people have valid reasons to feel offended, it is impossible to control every situation. This has been the case for thousands of years, and people have gradually learned to cope with it. I firmly believe that offensive books and other materials in libraries should not be removed casually. Taking down one offensive item may please some, but it could upset others. The reality is that in a diverse society, it is impossible to satisfy everyone. It should be the library's decision whether to remove certain materials, as they have purchased these items and have the right to make them available to the public. However, libraries should strive to minimize the presence of highly offensive content, especially racism, which still has a significant impact on our country and is an ongoing problem in the @CAPS1. In conclusion, libraries have the right to own somewhat offensive books and movies. Most people encounter offensive content at some point, and it is unrealistic to expect everyone to be happy. Moreover, some of this material may be educational, teaching us about the history of @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, etc. Instead of being quick to label it as offensive, we should try to understand its value and reach a common understanding. After all, we are all part of the same human family, despite our differences in appearance and culture.
1669	4646	2	2	Libraries are intended for people of all ages, from children to adults. However, there may be certain materials that are inappropriate for certain areas or the library as a whole. Since libraries house books for all age groups, there should be careful consideration about the content available. Young children may pick up materials that contain offensive or inappropriate content. In my opinion, libraries should only stock materials that are suitable for all age groups. The reason is simple: we cannot predict what a child or someone else's child might pick up and read or hear. The best approach is to ensure that all materials in the library are appropriate. In conclusion, by maintaining a collection of appropriate materials, libraries can provide a safe and educational environment for everyone.
1670	4647	2	2	The question of whether offensive books, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves is a crucial one. I firmly believe that libraries should eliminate offensive materials. Libraries are large public spaces that offer knowledge and entertainment to a wide range of people seeking to expand their horizons. Across the @LOCATION1 and other countries, there are libraries that possess offensive content. I advocate for removing these items because young children could easily access them, some people might be influenced to engage in foolish activities after reading or viewing them, and there is a risk of theft. Libraries are vital resources where people of all ages come to enjoy, relax, and think. Unfortunately, offensive materials are present in libraries worldwide and should be removed. Parents bring their children to libraries as a stress - relieving and educational activity. However, if there are inappropriate materials within reach of children, they may absorb unwanted knowledge, and parents may be unaware. This could lead to the spread of offensive language and ideas among children, potentially harming their developing minds. Teenagers, who are at a vulnerable age, often visit libraries to socialize or study. An immature teen might stumble upon offensive material, find it amusing, and attempt to replicate what they have read, which could result in regrettable consequences. Additionally, there are individuals who steal offensive materials from libraries. These people can cause problems, as they may share the content online, exposing it to a wider audience. Libraries are meant to be places of learning and knowledge - sharing. I do not want such valuable resources to be contaminated by offensive materials. Therefore, I strongly believe that offensive books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed from libraries to ensure a safe and beneficial environment for all.
1671	4648	2	2	In my view, the current issue of censorship in libraries isn't a significant problem, though many would oppose this stance. Books and movies are valuable resources for people of all ages, offering facts on various topics that might not be found elsewhere. Everyone has their own understanding of what is offensive. I firmly believe that rating books, movies, and magazines as offensive shouldn't solely be the library's responsibility; it also depends on the users of these resources. For children of all ages, the main reasons for borrowing books from the library are for pleasure and school - related projects. Censoring a book for a teenager or child often makes them more curious about its contents. People who read for pleasure usually stick to a particular genre. If a person wants to borrow a book that isn't suitable for them, the librarian or teacher can restrict access. When it comes to school projects, it's up to the librarian to decide if a book should be censored for a child. However, unlike movies, books aren't rated. So, it really depends on how the book will be used and the maturity of the borrower. If they think a book isn't appropriate for someone, they can suggest censorship. Books and movies have distinct characteristics. Reading a book allows you to create mental images, while movies present visual images directly. No matter how graphic a book's description is, it can't compare to a movie's visual impact. Movies are rated according to age, and the reasons for the ratings are provided. Libraries usually don't keep movies rated above a certain level. Although movies can still be censored if they create a too - offensive image, it's ultimately up to the viewer. Music is an essential part of our lives. Everyone has a favorite music genre and often sticks to it. Like movies, music is rated based on its content. If a song contains words that need to be censored, it's usually labeled 'explicit'. I believe that music, like movies, shouldn't be censored because it's already rated appropriately. Some books, magazines, and movies contain harsh facts about the past that might be too disturbing for some. Even though these events are in the past, they're still important for our present. Books can be a place for both children and adults to create their own worlds. Censoring a book, movie, or magazine would deprive someone of the chance to enjoy life a little more during that moment. In conclusion, we should be cautious about censorship as it may take away the enjoyment and learning opportunities these resources provide.

I'm both for and against the idea of removing offensive things. People have different preferences. For example, if a parent is in a music store with their child and hears cussing in the music, they wouldn't want their child exposed to it. I completely understand the need to remove such offensive content in this case. Similarly, in a store where kids go to buy candy, having a wall full of tobacco products in plain sight is inappropriate, and I think it should be removed. However, there would be numerous conflicts if we start removing things just because they're offensive to someone. Everyone has different tastes, and taking away things that some people find offensive will upset others. This affects people of all ages. On the other hand, I'd be very angry if something I really admired was removed because someone else found it offensive. Removing such items would only cause problems and make the situation worse. We all have our own opinions and like different things. We need to accept that and deal with things we don't like. In conclusion, I see both sides of this issue. It has its pros and cons. People need to accept that they'll encounter things they don't like in life, and we should find a balanced way to handle offensive content rather than simply removing it.
1673	4650	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials shouldn't be removed just because they're considered inappropriate. There are several reasons for this view. Firstly, different libraries have different collections. For instance, one library might have action books but not thriller ones, while another has thriller books but lacks action. If materials are removed from public libraries due to censorship, people will have to look for them online or in specific stores. Secondly, kids generally won't pick up inappropriate books unless they have parental approval. Although making the library more kid - friendly is a good idea, a book shouldn't be kept away from a child just because of a few bad words. There could be an age - restriction policy, or parents could give prior permission for their kids to access such books. Lastly, some adults would be unhappy if certain books were removed. Some books that are intended for adults are better off staying in the library. If these books are removed, adults will have to search for them online. In my opinion, censorship won't bring any positive change. If it continues, it could lead to a situation where libraries have to close. We should not let censorship take over our libraries and limit our access to diverse materials.
1674	4651	2	2	Censorship, to most people, means more than just a simple word. It implies sacrificing the right to express and think freely. For many, this isn't a favorable concept. When a person is censored, they're essentially giving up their right to freedom of speech. In this essay, I'll discuss three drawbacks of censorship in libraries. One major reason against library censorship is the violation of the right to freedom of speech. Decades ago, when the right to free speech was established, censorship wasn't part of the plan. As citizens, we have the right to express and write freely, regardless of whether the material is offensive or not. We should understand that people are different and won't always agree. Just because one person finds something offensive doesn't mean an item should be removed from the shelves. Freedom of speech is our inalienable right, and we shouldn't be censored. Author Katherine Paterson said, '...But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This statement clearly shows the absurdity of removing books just because one person dislikes them. If we follow this logic, everyone could find books they consider offensive, and eventually, there would be no books left in the library. Another drawback of library censorship is the loss of perspective and learning opportunities that books offer. As an enthusiastic reader, I've learned a great deal from books, including new vocabulary and different perspectives. For example, when I read the book [Book Name], I initially disliked the main character and found the book offensive. However, it provided valuable insights into [Author's] life that I knew nothing about. It made me reflect on how people change over the years. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a bad idea. When people are censored, they lose their right to freedom of speech, access to various books, and the chance to learn new things. I hope this essay has either convinced you or at least informed you about the negative aspects of library censorship.
1675	4652	2	2	I am of the opinion that certain materials such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. People are mature enough to handle offensive content. Most individuals choose books or movies they've heard of, so they generally know what they're getting into. Instead of removing offensive material, a warning should be provided to inform readers that the item they're checking out is considered offensive. In today's world, people are exposed to various types of offensive material daily. For example, when watching the news, we often see offensive pictures or videos and read offensive news stories. When someone checks out an offensive book, it's usually because they want to. Libraries shouldn't revoke a reader's right to read what they want. Before checking out a book or movie, individuals should do some research to ensure they're comfortable with the content. This can prevent many issues. For instance, a young reader might see an interesting - looking book. If they don't read a bit about it first and just take it home, they may later find offensive material. But if they do some research before checking it out, they can decide whether they still want to read it. Libraries have several ways to prevent children or less - mature individuals from accessing offensive material. They can put warning labels on books and movies or set an age limit for checking out such items. These measures can ensure that only mature people access offensive materials. In conclusion, libraries shouldn't remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material. People should have the right to access what they want, as long as they're informed. And libraries can take steps to manage access to offensive content, rather than simply removing it from the shelves.
1676	4653	2	2	In today's society, the issue of library censorship is of great significance. The question of whether there is sufficient censorship in libraries often arises. Have you ever encountered a vulgar or offensive book in the library and hoped that children would not read it? Such a situation should never occur. If a book or other material is offensive, it should be placed in a separate area of the library accessible only to adults. Apart from this section, there should be no offensive or vulgar materials that children or early - teenagers can access. Almost daily, children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials, which can have terrible effects on them. If they do not encounter these offensive materials at a young age, they are less likely to engage in the behaviors they see or read about. For example, when teenagers read about drug use, it may influence them to participate in such activities. The impact of these materials may not be immediate but can be substantial in the long run. The youth will be the future leaders of our country. Therefore, we must take action to keep offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of children and teenagers. I don't want my children to read the same inappropriate content I read when I was young. This is why I firmly believe that there should be censorship in every library.
1677	4654	2	2	I firmly believe that every book in the world should be available on library shelves. If a book is offensive, one simply doesn't have to read it. It is far better to have the freedom to read any book one desires. If a library doesn't have a particular book, some people may not go through the trouble of obtaining it elsewhere, which means they won't gain as much knowledge as they could. We need intelligent people to reach their full potential and acquire as much knowledge as possible. Although not everyone reads a large number of books, books are an essential source of information. For instance, if you want to know about trucks, you can either find a book on the subject, search online, or ask someone with knowledge. Without the person who built the truck writing a book about it, you would have to take the truck apart to learn about it, which is extremely difficult and risky. Having a book to refer to usually simplifies the process. This is one of the main reasons why every book should be on the shelf. When you need to learn something, you can read about it and find out what you want to know. Reading is one of the best ways to obtain accurate information without relying on potentially inaccurate second - hand accounts. Moreover, books are simply enjoyable to read. Similarly, all movies should be available, except for those restricted by age. Everyone has the right to watch any movie they want, as long as they meet the age requirements and don't need parental permission. If a movie is offensive, one can choose not to watch it. Magazines are also valuable. I read a lot of magazines and have found that they can provide a wealth of information on various topics. In conclusion, books, movies, and magazines should all be accessible to the public, allowing people to learn and enjoy according to their own interests.
1678	4655	2	2	I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries should be removed due to being offensive. In my opinion, the various items in libraries are mostly beneficial. Some people may dislike certain materials because of their content, but much of it is part of history, which cannot be changed. If someone doesn't like a book, movie, or magazine, they can simply choose not to read or watch it. I have found that the materials in libraries are very useful for projects. For example, if we want to learn about slavery, we can turn to library resources. Although some people may have different views, we can only learn from the mistakes of the past. I have not found anything in the library to be offensive or bad. Libraries have books on a wide range of topics, including history, guns, drugs, and wars. Some books may contain untrue information, but most of them offer good knowledge. I think people often over - react to certain things. If a book or movie doesn't appeal to you, don't get it. Just look at the cover; if it seems interesting, go ahead and read or watch it. Complaining about it is a waste of time and can lead to unnecessary problems. In conclusion, in my view, books, movies, magazines, etc. in libraries are generally very helpful, although others may hold different opinions.
1679	4656	2	2	I firmly believe that no books should be removed from library shelves. While some content may be offensive to certain individuals, others may need these books for research, projects, etc. People should read to understand why some may find certain things offensive. Every book should be available in public libraries, allowing everyone the freedom to decide for themselves whether a book is offensive. For example, an author might write a book about gangsters and their children. The author could be trying to provide an inside look at a child's life filled with killings and violence. This should not be considered offensive just because it involves such topics. Reading this book can help us understand how the child grew up and may even change the minds of gang - affiliated parents, making them realize the impact on their children's future. The same principle applies to movies and magazines. Reading magazines and watching movies can be beneficial. For instance, if someone is in a gang, these media can show the consequences of gang involvement and potentially change their thoughts. Directors and writers may create such content to show the outcomes of engaging in harmful activities. Why should certain people have the power to decide if a book, movie, or magazine is offensive to some but not others? I believe the best solution is to leave all books on public library shelves. Let the library patrons decide what is appropriate for them to read. Even if libraries make a decision, someone will be unhappy. The only way to handle this issue is to let people make their own choices. If they like a book, great; if not, they can stop reading or return it. After all, only individuals can decide what is right and wrong for themselves.
1680	4657	2	2	Nowadays, there is a problem in libraries where some children take books off the shelves, and these books may be in a state that some older people can no longer read. Additionally, some people remove books, damage them, and even tear pages out. This behavior not only affects the normal use of books by other library users but also causes damage to the library's collection. It is necessary to raise awareness among library users, especially children, about the proper handling of books to ensure that the library's resources can be effectively utilized by everyone.
1681	4658	2	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to discuss the issue of censorship in libraries. Libraries contain a vast amount of materials with offensive language and images. I hold a broad perspective on this matter. In my view, if libraries censor their materials, television should also be censored. I have deaf parents, so we always have the captions on at home. Every day, I see uncensored bad language and images on TV. Nowadays, the youth tend to watch more TV than use the library. So, why not censor TV? There are things on TV that I would never see in a library. In conclusion, I do not believe that libraries should censor their materials because students will still find out about such content. There are many other places that are worse, like crime scenes which have blood and gore, while libraries only have offensive language. These are my views, and others may differ.
1682	4659	2	2	Author Katherine Paterson once stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe she was trying to convey that some books should not be available for children to read, and I concur with this statement. I once read a book with very mature content. It was vulgar and inappropriate for my age and maturity level. There are numerous such books, and we need to keep them away from the children in our society. They are too young to be exposed to adult - related actions such as war, violence, sex, drugs, and other similar things. Removing these mature books and other forms of media from the shelves would improve the lives of our children. There would be fewer teenage pregnancies, less drug usage, and other social issues would be mitigated. Children would behave better as they would not be as strongly influenced by the media. However, I do not think we should get rid of these books entirely. We should simply keep them out of libraries. If people want to read such books, they should look elsewhere. An effective solution is to set an age limit on this type of content and place them in a separate store or section in libraries. A great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media, but also that those who want to read or watch it have the right to do so. This is why an age limit is necessary. For now, if the content is too adult - oriented or does not align with your views, simply avoid it.
1683	4660	2	2	We've all visited a library at some point in our lives. Have you ever come across something in a library that you found offensive or disagreed with? What if you had the opportunity to have it removed from the shelves permanently? Or, what if someone else had that choice? Would you let them do it? In my opinion, I'd say no. No one has the right to remove reading materials from the shelves just because it might be offensive to them or their way of life. I think if you don't like it, don't look at it; it's that simple. For instance, if you're into rap or hip - hop culture and someone finds it offensive, would you let them deny you access to it? Or would you want to do that to someone else? Suppose you're a Christian, and an atheist finds religious content offensive or untrue and has it removed from the shelves. Does that seem fair to you? If someone doesn't like a certain topic, culture, or finds it offensive, they should just stay away from it. The point is, if we all start removing things from the shelves, eventually, there'll be nothing left. We should respect other cultures and ways of life and avoid what offends us. Would you like it if someone removed what you like from the shelves? I wouldn't, so we shouldn't do it to others.
1684	4661	2	2	Nowadays, it seems that we try to censor everything, but have we gone too far? Have we crossed the line and are no longer protecting children but rather holding back our society as a whole? In my view, the censorship of literature in libraries has crossed that line. A library is an extremely valuable resource for each generation. In some cases, it still serves its purpose well. However, when books are withheld because they might offend someone, we are preventing people from gaining knowledge from these literary works. In today's society, we try to please everyone, so we censor many things that are considered politically incorrect. If future generations cannot learn from these writings, they will lack the insights we have gained. Moreover, history and society have never been, and likely never will be, completely politically correct. People take offense to certain words, and as a result, some libraries remove books containing those words. But what do we really achieve by trying to hide a part of history? This is debatable. In school, we learn about events like the @CAPS1, even though it upsets many people. We must learn about it because it was an important part of history that we need to remember to prevent similar tragedies. If we learn about an international event that affected the whole world, shouldn't we also learn about our own historical faults, such as the times we oppressed people and the terms we used so commonly in the past? Has censorship really helped us? No. People need to recognize a problem and be reminded of its wrongness to truly understand it. Napoleon said that history is a story written by the victor, but is victory still sweet when our history has been rewritten? If we censor or remove everything that offends people, we will end up with nothing. If one person can decide what is acceptable, others will follow suit. It would become a trend, and people would find faults with almost anything. In essence, by censoring library works, we are holding back future generations from reaching their full potential. We are making them ignorant of society's problems. In the end, we must ask ourselves if it was really worth it. Remember, a library is an invaluable resource.
1685	4662	2	2	When people think of a library, they usually envision a quiet place for studying and reading. Teachers utilize libraries for various purposes. They use them to access movies on specific topics, books about certain people or events, and magazines for projects and to stay updated on the world outside of school. So, what's my opinion on removing offensive materials? I'll share it with you. Kids watch movies in class regularly. Some movies are inappropriate at times, but others are insightful and helpful. I think if a teacher watches a movie and deems it too inappropriate for elementary - school children, it should be removed from that school's library. However, high - school students have likely seen or heard worse. So, movies should generally remain in high - school libraries, but not all should be in elementary - school libraries. Books are also a great resource when used properly. They help students learn about historical war heroes and past events. However, some books, like those with detailed information about drugs, should be kept behind the counter and only used for specific classes. If someone needs such a book for medical purposes, like to become a doctor, they can simply ask. Magazines are useful in several ways. They are great for projects, especially when a computer cannot be used. For example, if you have to do a project on food, magazines can provide good pictures. They are also commonly used for entertainment. When you get bored with a book or find it too difficult to read, you can pick up a magazine. In reality, some materials should be kept, while others should be removed. People spend a lot of time in libraries for different reasons, and this will not change. Movies are a good source of entertainment, and that won't change either. So, I'm somewhat split on whether to keep or get rid of offensive materials.
1686	4663	2	2	I firmly believe that the open distribution of certain newspaper articles, along with other media content like radio shows, should be opposed. There are media materials that vividly depict news events, and the content might not be suitable for some individuals, such as younger children or those who are averse to biased reactions, opinions, and interpretations. Newspaper articles and materials with disturbing images should be censored. Recently, I saw photos of people killed during the search for @LOCATION1. While these images may hold significance for some interested people, they can be horrifying for children who can easily access the newspaper on their doorsteps. Even adults may not necessarily approve of such content. Adults may find news related to the death of @LOCATION1 either intriguing or disturbing, but when it comes to protecting their children from excessive exposure, it's not a good idea.  One day, on the way back from school in the car, I switched the radio from AM to FM as I usually do. Instead of a top - hundred song, I heard a woman expressing her opinion about the death of @LOCATION1 on a talk - radio show. The show was pre - recorded. After the woman vented her anger, the host reviewed calls from other people who were frustrated with her comments. She had said it was wrong to kill someone, and the host countered with the argument that it was okay for @LOCATION1 to kill thousands but not okay to kill him. The comments of the other callers were offensive and disturbing. They told the woman to leave the country and cursed at her. The news of @LOCATION1's death is not only violent in itself but also triggers violent reactions.  Another time, at a school assembly, we watched a video about a protest against people of @CAPS1 belief. The protesters' issue was that people of the @CAPS1 faith, who were from @LOCATION3, were meeting representatives to help a poor community in @LOCATION2. Despite their efforts to assist the poor and homeless in @LOCATION2, they were shouted at to leave. News about such events can be offensive, especially to those who don't understand the background and may take it very personally.  In conclusion, the material exposed to people of all ages should be censored. The currently openly distributed content is not suitable for everyone, and some people prefer to avoid news on certain uncomfortable topics.
1687	4664	2	2	In my view, if a book is published, it should be allowed in libraries. A published book is already open to the public, so there's no valid reason to exclude it from library shelves. If a library buys a book and then removes it, it seems like a waste of money. Only the library owner should have the right to take a book off the shelf since it's their property. However, it doesn't make sense for them to purchase a book only to remove it later.  The public should not be able to remove books from libraries. People have different tastes and views, and if anyone could remove books, there would soon be no books left in the library. A book is an inanimate object, not a criminal, so there's no justification for removing it from a library just because some people may not like it. As long as a book is published, it has the right to be in a library.  In conclusion, the policy of allowing published books in libraries should be maintained. We should respect the diversity of literature and let people choose what they want to read.
1688	4665	2	2	I don't think a magazine should be removed from the shelves just because someone is offended. People get offended regularly, but that doesn't mean they should try to get rid of whatever caused their offense. I've been offended by cartoons before, but I don't make a fuss about it. One of the most offensive characters on the TV show @LOCATION1 is Cartman. He uses every offensive language imaginable, makes fun of all races, and claims to hate everyone equally. Trying to stop such content is like trying to turn a dog into a cat; it's impossible. It's also similar to trying to eliminate racism.  In conclusion, we should learn to tolerate offensive content instead of trying to remove it at the first sign of offense. It's part of the diverse media landscape, and we should develop the ability to deal with it maturely.
1689	4666	2	2	When you enter a local library, you'll find thousands of books, magazines, movies, and other materials. There are various types and styles, including fiction and non - fiction, comedy, horror, and children's books. However, some libraries have materials that are sexual, violent, or disruptive, which are inappropriate for young children. Movies and magazines of this nature can have a negative influence.  When a young child visits a library, they expect colorful, action - packed, and picture - filled books. But while browsing, they might come across inappropriate books that could influence them. An inappropriate book can affect a child's life as they may try to imitate what they read, which could lead to wrong decisions.  Inappropriate materials such as pornographic magazines, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 rated movies should not be in libraries. These items are for adults only and should be sold in separate stores. We should inspire children to do the right thing and avoid negative influences. If you have such items at home, keep them out of children's reach.  In today's generation, young people often focus on gang violence, sex, rap music, and drugs, which can be found in movies, books, and songs. Most rap songs these days talk about violence, sex, or drugs, while music should generally have a positive message. If we keep these negative - minded items out of public places like libraries and homes, there may be a positive change.  I believe that if I see inappropriate materials on a library shelf where young people can access them, I should have the right to remove them. Society has changed, and making such a change could have a positive impact. Even though I'm young, I think my generation should stop the violence and avoid being influenced by negative content. If we focus on more important things, the world can be a better place.
1690	4667	2	2	Censorship in libraries can have both positive and negative aspects. On one hand, there are things that parents may not want their children to read, and age groups play a significant role in this. There are materials that are inappropriate for young children, but if they are censored, children won't be able to access them even when they are older. It all depends on the content of books, music, movies, and magazines.  What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. Censorship can be beneficial when the content is untrue and offensive to a large group. For example, consider two books on the same true topic. One has some offensive material here and there but presents the complete story, while the other is censored and may not tell the whole truth. Personally, I'd prefer the book with the full story, even if it has some offensive parts.  If you're a writer who has spent a long time and effort on a book, you'd want it on the library shelf. But if your book contains something that might be offensive to others, it may not be allowed in the library. However, if the content is true to life, it doesn't make sense to show children a false version. Reading a book is about understanding the author's perspective, which may be different from ours, and that can be a good thing.  I've been to libraries and found books that I'm interested in but that some people might find offensive. If the content is untrue and offensive, it should be censored, but only for a certain age group. Just because a book has material that some people consider 'bad' doesn't mean readers will start using offensive language after reading it. It depends on the person's perspective. If someone finds a book offensive, they can simply choose not to read it.  In conclusion, not all content with offensive material is bad. It may be part of someone's life. Censorship can be good for some and bad for others. If you prefer a happy - ending and sanitized version, censorship might be suitable. But if you want the whole story, whether it's non - fiction or fiction, censorship may not be the best option.
1691	4668	2	2	Offensive materials, including books, movies, music, and magazines, should not be accessible in places where children frequent, such as libraries. These materials can contain content like violence and other inappropriate elements that may have a negative influence on readers or viewers, especially children. If offensive content is found in a book, it could offend the reader, whether it pertains to their religion, race, or personal life. Similarly, children may be exposed to inappropriate content in movies, and parents may not always be aware of what their children are watching. Magazines can also be offensive, with content such as violence, arrests, or inappropriate images. To address these issues, materials should have an age - restriction indication, and offensive items should be placed where only those of a suitable age can access them. In extreme cases, offensive materials should be taken to court. Overall, removing offensive materials from public places is essential to prevent people from being offended and to protect children from harmful content.
1692	4669	2	2	I firmly believe that offensive materials like books, movies, and magazines should be removed from public access. In libraries and stores, there are often materials that contain offensive content, such as violence. These materials can have a significant impact on readers and viewers. For instance, a reader might come across offensive words or topics in a book, which could be highly offensive, especially if it relates to their religion, race, or personal life. A child reading an offensive book might learn bad behavior. When it comes to movies, if a child or their parents rent a movie without knowing its content, the child may be exposed to violence or other inappropriate elements, and parents may not always monitor their children's viewing. Magazines in stores can also be offensive, with content about violence, arrests, or inappropriate images, which can be particularly harmful if a child picks them up. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from the shelves of libraries, stores, and other public places is necessary to avoid offending people and to protect children from the negative influence of such content.
1693	4670	2	2	"I am of the opinion that certain books, movies, music, and other materials should be kept away from children. These materials can contain content that may lead to bad behavior in children. To prevent children from accessing these materials, they should be placed in areas that children cannot reach, such as high shelves, closets, or attics. In more secure cases, they can be stored in a personal safe. Books may have pictures that can give children the wrong ideas at their age. Music can talk about actions that may seem ""cool"" to children, leading them to imitate. Magazines often show famous people engaging in wrongdoings, setting a bad example. I once had a negative experience with inappropriate material, which taught me to avoid such items. Therefore, it is crucial to keep these materials away from children to prevent any negative consequences that could harm them or lead to serious actions."
1694	4671	2	2	In my view, certain offensive materials in libraries should be removed, though not all. Materials that undermine or degrade religious beliefs, involve racial stereotypes or comments, and express violent or criminal acts should be carefully considered. Books or other media that slander or pass judgment on religious beliefs should be taken off library shelves. As people are becoming more serious about religion, no one wants to see their beliefs mocked or rejected. While this material may not seem harmful at first, it can lead to angry and frustrated customers. To avoid conflicts and complaints, it is better to keep such material out of the library. Racial material also needs to be removed. Racism is a global problem, and having books with racial stereotypes in the library can cause great offense. For example, books that label all black teens as problems or all Arabians as dangerous are clearly racist. Keeping such stereotypes off library shelves is a good business decision and will keep customers happy. Finally, books expressing violent or criminal acts should be restricted to an older audience. Kids are likely to mimic what they see, and peer - pressure can exacerbate the problem. If children are exposed to such materials, parents will be outraged and blame the library. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from libraries is essential to maintain a harmonious environment and avoid customer complaints.
1695	4672	2	2	Many people I know would be disappointed if there were no books on library shelves. I think libraries should have offensive books, as long as they are properly labeled. Labels could indicate that a book may not be suitable for certain people and may contain bad language. Libraries should have sections for different types of materials, such as adult and children's sections, and sections for specific genres like murder and mystery. This applies to movies, music, and magazines as well. I enjoy browsing through library books because you never know what you'll find. In conclusion, by having a variety of materials with proper labeling, libraries can meet the diverse needs of their patrons while also ensuring that people are aware of the content they are accessing.
1696	4673	2	2	The question of whether there should be censorship in libraries is a crucial one. In my view, censorship is not the answer. In today's world, almost everything can offend someone. If we implement censorship, there will be very few good books, magazines, and movies left. For example, action, horror, and comedy films often contain elements like blood, violence, and cursing, which can actually enhance the quality of a movie. Some books also have similar content, and certain @MONTH1 books can seem provocative. Take @ORGANIZATION1, where the book repeatedly uses the n - word. Even some fashion, sports, and car magazines are considered provocative. If I walked into my local library and found my favorite items missing from the shelves, I'd never go back. I'm not suggesting putting adult books in elementary school libraries, but in public libraries, it's acceptable to have such materials. Imagine a library with censorship; it would be empty. Censorship in libraries restricts access to diverse content and is not a viable solution.
1697	4674	2	2	When we enter a library today, we are presented with a wide array of books. There are children's books and those meant for more mature readers. Many parents worry that their children might read inappropriate books. However, if everyone removes books they find unacceptable, there will be no books left to enjoy. What makes a book unacceptable? It could be the language, graphic scenes, or extremely scary parts. Some people believe such books should not be available. But removing books based on personal opinion is unfair as it violates the rights of both the author and the reader under the right to free press. Unfortunately, some books can scare children as they often take the stories as reality. As more of these books are released, children are more likely to read offensive stories. I firmly believe that removing books from libraries based on opinion is wrong. While leaving such books accessible to children can be a problem, libraries are usually sectioned by age, like children's, teen, and adult sections. If parents are concerned, they should accompany their children to the library. A public library is for a diverse range of readers. Removing books only reduces the selection, and eventually, there will be nothing left for anyone to read. In conclusion, we should respect the rights of both authors and readers and use library sections to manage access for different age groups.
1698	4675	2	2	I don't think there should be strict limitations on the materials available in libraries. There are different types of materials for adults, teens, and children. Children generally won't be interested in adult books, and adults won't want to read children's books. Teens might be interested in adult books, and that's okay as they are on the verge of adulthood. If parents don't want their teens or children to read certain materials, they should accompany them to the library and approve the books, magazines, or other materials they want to check out. The same goes for movies; there are different age - appropriate materials. Sometimes, younger age groups might be interested in materials for older ones, which just shows they are maturing and curious. They should be allowed to explore and decide for themselves if the material is suitable. In the end, a balanced approach that respects the natural curiosity of young people while giving parents the ability to guide their children is the best way to handle library materials.
1699	4676	2	2	Offensive books are a real concern. Have you ever wondered why students read the books they do? They read books about sex, guns, etc., thinking it's exciting, but it's not. The authors of these books are mainly after money and don't consider the impact on kids. Kids are easily influenced by such content. I firmly believe that these types of books should be removed. We don't want our children growing up on such literature, as they may not want the same for their own children in the future. Many parents are too lenient, thinking as long as their children are reading, it's fine. This is very wrong. Great writers shouldn't use bad language, yet they seem to think it's okay. The behavior of kids today can be attributed in part to the influence of these books and movies. I think the production of these books should stop, or they should be sold in separate stores for adults. Most kids don't want to learn such things, but some do, and that's not right. In conclusion, kids should be encouraged to read good books and not be exposed to offensive content.
1700	4677	2	2	Censorship in libraries can have detrimental effects. Parents have diverse views on books, music, etc. One parent may not mind a book with a few curse words, while another may object and want it removed. If libraries censor books based on individual complaints, it can have a significant impact on patrons. For example, someone who really likes a particular book may no longer be able to access it because of a complaint. This can lead to a loss of library users. Also, when a student needs to research a topic for school in the library, they may find that relevant books have been removed due to someone deeming them offensive. This can cause frustration and force students to rely mainly on the @CAPS2 for research, which may not meet the requirements of their teachers. While there are materials not suitable for young children, libraries are divided into age - appropriate sections. However, these sections don't completely prevent children from accessing inappropriate content. Parents should be vigilant and look for signs or check the materials. Censorship would not only eliminate various forms of media but also empty the libraries. Since everyone has different views, it's impossible to please everyone through censorship. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not a practical solution as it undermines the purpose of providing diverse resources to all.
1701	4678	2	2	There is extensive debate regarding what is suitable for children and teenagers to read, watch, and listen to. This discussion will present opinions and logical explanations about what some consider appropriate for young people to be exposed to. First, children should not watch movies rated @CAPS1 or even @NUM1 if they contain vulgar, sexual, or violent content. Despite some parents allowing it, these movies and magazines can significantly impact a child and potentially influence their future behavior. Second, there are numerous movies that children can watch and learn from, which can benefit their education and future careers. Finally, teenagers and young adults exposed to such movies, books, music, or other media entertainment are more likely to make destructive decisions compared to those who are not. Although this is not always the case, it does increase the likelihood of poor choices and affects young minds. In conclusion, young adults, teenagers, and children should not access media with vulgar, sexual, or violent content without parental supervision and permission.
1702	4679	2	2	Libraries should control the types of books, magazines, and movies available to children. For example, it's clearly wrong to let a @NUM1 - year - old watch a rated @CAPS1 movie, let alone a porn movie. The same goes for magazines and books. Magazines may have inappropriate images for the intended age group, and kids can easily pick them up and look. Books, too, can have an impact. Even without pictures, kids have imaginative minds and understand more than we often think. I know this from personal experience. As a child, my brothers got a rated @CAPS1 film called '@CAPS3's @CAPS4'. After watching all @NUM2 available films at the time, I couldn't look at dolls the same way. When my mom got rid of some dolls with moving eyes, I'd sit far away from them in the car. To prevent other kids from having similar experiences, local libraries should create separate sections for children, teens, and adults. This way, it's easy to direct kids to the appropriate sections. Films and magazines should also be organized this way. I know some may disagree with my ideas, but I ask them if they have better ones. Regarding offensive materials in the library, I think we should keep them. Kids need to know about our culture to survive in it. They should be aware of racism, bullying, atheism, and sexism. While some content is inappropriate for certain ages, we can't keep it out of their lives forever. So, it's best not to discard books that mention such things.
1703	4680	2	2	I've often wondered if others have had the same experience as me in the library, coming across something that makes you exclaim, ' @CAPS1! That's inappropriate!' Just the other day, I was in the library and saw posters for a new rental movie. I remembered seeing repulsive ads for it on TV. How can they display such things? And how does it affect our country's youth? My stance on this is clear, though I know others may oppose it as everyone has their own views. I understand the library has age limits on rentals, but what about these posters everywhere? You don't have to rent the material to be influenced by it. I believe there should be a separate section for such content. Another example of harmful library rentals is @CAPS2. New music sometimes has lewd or inappropriate lyrics, and some album covers should be removed for the public's good. It's astonishing how these things go unnoticed in the library. I once saw a young boy renting a @CAPS4 with a 'parental advisory' on the cover, and no one stopped him. Books are also a problem. The library is filled with disturbing covers and titles, and no one screens them before they hit the shelves. So, when will someone address library censorship? It's hard to say, but I strongly believe it's up to us protesters to stop this. I hope you'll join me in this fight for censorship to protect our youth.
1704	4681	2	2	In my opinion, books, magazines, and other materials with offensive content shouldn't be removed because they offer people different reading options. Most people don't want to read @CAPS1 or novels. Some prefer to read about crimes, mysteries, and action. There are many good movies, but some are too offensive for others. For instance, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is offensive to some. Those who find it offensive are often just narrow - minded. I acknowledge that there is literature that offends some, but those who criticize don't consider that the books may not be offensive to others. Books about war may seem too graphic to some, but they're often about history. I've only recently noticed people trying to get rid of books they don't like. In the @DATE1's, people just wanted something to read and didn't care what was in the library. I say we should leave the libraries alone.
1705	4682	2	2	Censorship in libraries is a significant issue today. Many authors use offensive methods and terms to engage their audiences, while others do not. All authors have the right to express themselves, but there should be limits on where their books are placed and who can access them. If libraries accept offensive magazines, books, music, movies, etc., they should ensure these are out of children's reach. Like many city libraries, there should be separate sections for children and adults. Offensive materials should be placed in a special section of the adult area, and customers should be warned. Since people have different views on what's right and wrong, a special team should manage the separation of offensive materials. Borrowers should have the right to bring offensive items to the attention of library staff. By following this approach, offensive materials can be kept away from those who don't want to see them. Items with vulgar language are unacceptable to most, but there is still a majority interested in such materials. Everyone has the right to do as they wish, but based on personal experience and upbringing, people should be treated with dignity and respect. As our constitution states, we are all created equal, regardless of color, size, looks, or personality. Therefore, we should only view content that is just for all. After all, everyone wants to be treated kindly.
1706	4683	2	2	Public libraries should maintain a diverse collection to cater to the varied interests, religions, and customs of all individuals. I firmly hold this view because everyone in the world is unique. Removing certain books and music from the library would undermine its purpose as a public institution. Instead, creating distinct sections for different types of content would enable people to easily find what they want or need, without the risk of offense. It would be unjust to deprive anyone of access to materials just because one person might be offended. Therefore, public libraries should strive to accommodate all forms of content for the benefit of all patrons.
1707	4684	2	2	In contemporary society, people have divergent perspectives on libraries. Some perceive libraries as places for learning, self - expression, and freedom, while others believe they pose risks to minors and can be inappropriate. These two viewpoints often lead to an interesting debate. People visit libraries to escape or simply to enjoy a good book. There is a wide range of books available, but one must be cautious while browsing, as some books, though good, may be unsuitable for certain ages, sparking controversy. Parents often think libraries encourage the borrowing of inappropriate books, but this is not entirely true. It mainly depends on the placement of books, as most librarians would attest. Librarians do not coerce kids to borrow such books, yet kids have the right to do so. Also, what is offensive to one person may bring joy to another from a different race or ethnic background. I firmly believe that the so - called offensive books or magazines that parents complain about should not be removed from libraries. These materials are there for a reason and are not meant to be offensive. A solution to prevent kids from accessing inappropriate books could be to require a child to be accompanied by an adult in certain sections. This would not only stop kids from borrowing inappropriate books but also potentially end parents' complaints and resolve the controversy. People should view libraries as places that bring joy to children rather than as sources of negativity. After all, libraries were built for those who love reading. Instead of complaining, we should focus on the positives they offer and recall the happiness libraries brought us in our childhood.
1708	4685	2	2	In modern times, most books, movies, and music feature warning labels in the form of 'Parental Advisory' stickers on their covers. However, materials from the past may contain more offensive content than those of today because they use words that were acceptable then but are considered offensive now. Yet, these books, movies, and music are not to blame, as parents sometimes claim. For instance, the book 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain uses words to describe people of that era. In the past, it was acceptable, but today, the book has been on the ban list. I believe that a book should not be banned based on its content but on its educational value. If it can teach students about history and culture, it should be read. Movies have a rating system for a reason. Some movies are not suitable for younger audiences, and people must be of a certain age to legally rent, buy, or view them. Unfortunately, many ignore this system. A horror film is not appropriate for a young child who may take everything on screen as real. However, the blame should fall on parents, not the movies, as they are the ones who let their children watch such films. If a movie is intended for a mature audience, it should remain so. Regarding music, much of today's music can be offensive, with only a few 'pure' genres free of cursing. The government has mandated that music with harsh words and other offensive elements carry a 'Parental Advisory' sticker. Parents should be aware of these stickers, but it's up to them to enforce restrictions. In conclusion, movies, books, and music with 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. What is offensive to one person may not be to another. Ratings exist to protect children and manage the level of harshness in society. Despite ongoing arguments about banning certain books, movies, and music, we should remember that parents are often responsible for their children's exposure to such content.
1709	4686	2	2	The question of what children should be able to access in public libraries is a pressing concern for parents. This is why parents are so cautious about their children's computer use and internet access. Every situation has its advantages and disadvantages, and by analyzing them, we can reach a reasonable conclusion. When visiting a library with children, they usually head to the children's section. As children grow older and learn to read, they may want to explore more adult - oriented materials, such as watching older movies, reading harder books, and accessing what they want on the computer. One might think of censoring the library by removing horror films and banned books. However, this would be unfair to adults who have the right to read and watch whatever they choose. The library is a free public resource, and if society dislikes certain materials, it's unreasonable to force adults to pay for them elsewhere. Moreover, if a child is determined to access inappropriate content at a library, they could do the same at a bookstore. Banned books are another issue. Many of them are classics that previous generations studied in school. Why would we decide to remove them now? It gives the impression that younger generations can't handle them or that past generations are trying to hide something. Classics are works that have withstood the test of time. If they are not read in school today and in future generations, they may be forgotten. Some parents wonder why certain classic books are banned, as they don't recall anything objectionable. Many of these classic banned books were written in the 1920s, 1930s, or 1940s, when society was different. Reading a classic is like reading a history book that shows us what life was like during that era. Instead of censoring the library, we can take some measures. For example, some magazines can be placed out of children's reach, and horror movies can be in a separate section. Parents can also monitor their children's computer use at the library. In conclusion, while some censorship in libraries may be necessary, society should not go overboard. By making rational decisions, we can ensure that libraries remain safe and educational places for all generations.
1710	4687	2	2	Have you ever encountered something in a library that offended or upset you? Do you think certain books should be banned from libraries due to their content? In today's society, with its diverse population, people have a wide range of opinions on various matters. When I think of a library, I consider the fact that people of all ages and different social groups visit it, and there is a vast collection of books. Taking all these factors into account, I believe that public libraries should allow all types of materials, but there should be separate areas for adult - only books, magazines, and movies. If we remove all the 'bad' or 'offensive' materials, we may disappoint those who find them interesting or enjoyable. This could lead to people losing interest in visiting the library. Separating books by age groups is a good idea. It prevents younger children from accessing inappropriate materials and helps those who are unsure what to read to find suitable recommendations for their age. From my own experience, I've read some books and magazines that were probably not suitable for my age at the time. However, this doesn't mean these materials should be removed from the shelves; rather, they should be placed in areas where younger people can't easily find them. So, the next time you see something offensive in the library, remember that what you find offensive may be interesting to others.
1711	4688	2	2	There are indeed numerous books containing graphic and sexual phrases, which has raised concerns among many parents regarding what their children might read in libraries. One viable solution is to place age - limit signs in specific library areas. However, it's uncertain whether children will abide by these signs. We can be certain that pornography is not present in libraries, so parents need not worry about that.  In my opinion, libraries should be divided into sections: a kids' section, a teens' section, and an adults' section. The adult section shouldn't be too far from the teen section because when people think of adult books or magazines, they often assume it's porn. Even the adult section should have some form of censorship.  There should be doors blocking the entrances to each section, and patrons should show proof of age to access these areas, except for the kids' section. The kids' section is safe for all children as the books there are harmless. Implementing such security measures would alleviate parents' concerns about their children's mental safety.  There are other ideas to censor books, but many of them are impractical and absurd. I believe music and movies don't belong in libraries; it's better to let other stores handle them since librarians may not be aware of the content of the CDs being checked out.  I firmly believe that using doors to restrict access to certain books is a great plan as it would prevent certain children from accessing inappropriate areas. Other parents or individuals may have their own ideas, and it would be beneficial to share and discuss them in the community. Overall, these measures can contribute to a more responsible and safe library environment for all.
1712	4689	2	2	We've all had moments when, while reading a magazine article, a book, or a newspaper, we've come across what could be considered harmful words. These words may not affect me in a harmful way, but they could impact other readers differently. It's not the materials themselves but the readers' maturity levels that make a difference.  For example, the word 'wetback' in a biography about a particular group is acceptable in the context of the book. The problem arises when a reader misinterprets it, finds it funny, and starts using it to call someone, especially a person of that race. This is when such materials seem inappropriate on library shelves, yet it still boils down to the reader's maturity.  These words or passages can harm someone who hasn't even read the material, simply because someone else decides to use them in a derogatory way. Books are a great resource for students researching class projects, but certain book topics can turn these words into harmful tools. Books about specific races can lead to name - calling in schools as students may think it's okay to use the words they read in the books.  Similarly, the topic of'sex' in a book can be misinterpreted. Some teens may think it's acceptable to engage in sexual activities just because the characters in the book do so. Whether the book remains on the shelf or is removed, name - calling and misinterpretation issues will persist. Thus, removing materials from the shelves alone won't solve the problem. A more comprehensive approach that focuses on educating readers about appropriate interpretation is necessary.
1713	4690	2	2	Censorship is a complex and widely - debated topic. Different people have different views on what should and should not be accessible. Some believe certain books with sexual content are unsuitable for the public, while others think they are acceptable. People often rely on others to make decisions about what they read, but in reality, individuals should take responsibility for their own choices.  Some people doubt others' ability to decide what to read. For instance, books about witchcraft, like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 books, were blocked because people were afraid children would be exposed to something they deemed inappropriate. The Grapes of @CAPS3 was banned due to its mention of slavery, as people didn't want younger readers to be exposed to it.  In the realm of music and movies, there are also concerns. Music has started to include discussions about drugs and inappropriate topics. A song called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 sends a bad message. Movies are similar; they often depict violence that exists only in people's minds. The movie @PERSON1 shows a minor going on a killing spree, which is disturbing.  However, it's also important to see the things that are in people's minds. This knowledge can make us more cautious in the real world. In conclusion, there is no clear - cut answer to the question of censorship. There are always exceptions to any rule. Therefore, people should have the freedom to decide what they read and watch, taking into account their own values and maturity levels.
1714	4691	2	2	"Questions like ""What race are you?"", ""What religion are you?"", and ""What have you been taught?"" can be considered offensive. The question then arises: should offensive materials be removed from libraries?  The answer is no. Offensive content is ubiquitous. We see offensive television shows and commercials every day. For example, the commercials for @CAPS1 gum featuring a @CAPS2 woman may be offensive to some. A person with a disease that causes bad breath might take offense to the claim of a 'clean feeling' in the commercial. Television shows like @ORGANIZATION1 can also offend certain races and ethnic groups. But does this mean we should eliminate them?  People are offended by something somewhere; the world is far from perfect. Even if we remove offensive materials from libraries, they can still be found elsewhere. Trying to eliminate all offensive content globally would lead to chaos. There is no such thing as a perfect world, and if there were, it might drive people crazy. In the movie '@CAPS5 @CAPS6', the main character visits a town that is supposed to be a perfect society. At first, everything seems nice, but the excessive perfection becomes unbearable, and he leaves.  The best approach is to let these materials remain. They can also help kids learn. Shielding them completely from the real world won't prepare them for life. So, the question of whether these offensive things should go away remains open - ended. It's up to each individual to decide how to deal with such content."
1715	4692	2	2	We've all had experiences as children when our parents wouldn't let us listen to a certain song or watch a movie, like a @CAPS1 - rated one. We may have also accidentally come across a book with inappropriate language during a research project. There is a significant amount of media and books that parents don't want their children to access, and the government often plays a role in censoring such content. Censorship has both positive and negative aspects.  I've observed that people with less knowledge tend to be happier. However, if we can access censored materials, we might understand different perspectives and potentially agree with the ideas presented. Most news focuses on negative events. For example, if a terrible event like thousands of people being used to test lions' eating habits in @LOCATION1 occurred, the government might censor the news for various reasons. Similarly, a racist movie against @CAPS2 people would likely be censored.  People who read censored material often feel special as they've accessed something not meant for the general public. Removing censorship would lead to more freedom of speech. When people discover that material is being censored, they often get angry because they feel valuable information is being hidden from them.  Societies that practice censorship often have angry citizens. On the other hand, if citizens believe censorship is for the greater good of society, they may accept it. People also want the right to make their own decisions. In a censored civilization, people are often clueless about what's happening outside their borders and may be misled by their government.  Overall, censorship has its pros and cons. While it may protect people from offensive content, it can also make them feel that their right to information is being violated. Hidden information can be both good and bad, but most people prefer to know the truth. In my view, people should have the right to decide what they want to read and watch, and censorship, in general, restricts this fundamental right.
1716	4693	2	2	I moderately concur with the removal of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other materials that might offend someone, as they could contain racial content or be inappropriate for children. The decision should depend on the topic, as what offends one person may not affect another. Thus, individuals should choose their reading materials judiciously. Removing certain books from library shelves would be unfair since people have diverse interests. For instance, one person might find a book inappropriate, while another deems it acceptable. Taking that book off the shelves would deprive the latter of the opportunity to read it. However, I firmly oppose the inclusion of inappropriate pictures and comics in books or magazines, as children should not have access to such content. Parents or adults should review the material before allowing children to engage with it. Ultimately, the suitability of a book, movie, or magazine depends on its content. It is up to the individual; if they dislike the content, they should refrain from consuming it.
1717	4694	2	2	Should certain materials be removed from library shelves if someone dislikes or disagrees with the topic or plot? Should a book be banned from public libraries just because someone has a negative opinion about its message? In my view, individuals have the right to avoid reading a book, magazine, or watching a movie if they find it offensive. Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe her statement rings true. Given the diversity of opinions, if everyone could remove a book they disliked or found offensive, there would be a limited selection of books for people to choose from. I've often asked friends about the books they're reading. Their opinions vary, and sometimes what they consider a bad book, I find quite engaging. If they had the power to remove those books, I would have missed out on many great reads. I firmly believe that people should not be able to remove books from shelves based solely on their personal preferences. Everyone has a unique perspective on books, and a wide variety of options should be available to all.
1718	4695	2	2	Have you ever visited a library and come across a book on slavery with strong language or a book about the teenage years that includes alcohol, drugs, and sexual content? Libraries house a wide range of materials, from those for leisure and study to those that may offend various individuals, including children and adults. Despite the presence of offensive materials, I believe that books, movies, magazines, and music with such content should remain on the shelves. The internet is rife with similar offensive content, and many people are unfazed by the vulgarity and violence in books. Moreover, some of the most remarkable books may be considered offensive by some. Throughout history, people have created songs, movies, and magazines, and what was once acceptable has now become inappropriate. Libraries contain materials that, if not carefully monitored, could have a negative influence on children. Parents and others are rightfully concerned about library censorship, as children are the future and need to be taught the right values. An old librarian once told me that books should be cherished because they will eventually be replaced by technology. It's astonishing to see how technology has transformed our lives. This relates to offensive books because, like the internet, they can be used for good or bad. Parents worry about their children reading offensive books but allow them to surf the internet, where they may encounter inappropriate content. Compared to the internet, the offensive materials in libraries are relatively minor. Parents can filter what their children access in libraries, but the internet poses a greater threat to children's minds. People around the world have different tastes in books. A good plot, dialogue, theme, and elements like drama, language, violence, drugs, alcohol, and sex can make a book enjoyable. Without offensive books, reading would lose its appeal for many. There are also great books that, despite being offensive, provide valuable details. For example, books on slavery, like [book name], offer a vivid description of the past. In conclusion, books, music, magazines, and other materials should not be removed from library shelves. They are essential for readers, and parents can take steps to protect their children from inappropriate content.
1719	4696	2	2	Hi, I'm Mason, and I'm writing about whether we should remove books, music, movies, and magazines from shelves. People have different views on different things. Books offer a unique form of learning. While I learn better from the internet or TV, it's nice to read a good book every now and then. Everyone enjoys sitting down with a great book from time to time. Music doesn't really teach you much, but it can relax you in different ways. Some people might learn from music, but I'm not one of them. It can also motivate you, like when you're getting ready for a football game. When I watch a movie, I can learn from it because I have the patience to sit through it. Movies get straight to the point and don't waste time on unnecessary details. Magazines are also helpful. They have short articles that go straight to the point, which is what I like about them and movies. Although there aren't many magazines that offer useful information, the ones that do are really helpful. I think music should be removed from shelves because it doesn't teach you a lot. However, books, movies, and magazines can be helpful to a certain extent. It's up to everyone to decide whether music should be removed, as it might help different people in different ways.
1720	4697	2	2	I'm a student from [school name]. I've read some great and interesting books from both the school and public libraries. However, there have been complaints from my friends and family. Some friends said there aren't good books at school and want to replace most of them. But if they do that, it'll only be their choice, and not everyone will want to go to the library. Without good books, students won't visit the library, which will affect their academic performance and the school. A family member saw a young girl looking at an inappropriate book at the public library. Instead of removing such books, they should be placed in a room off - limits to children. If removed, the book won't be used again, and someone might need the information it contains. Books are important, so I oppose removing books disliked by some. If someone doesn't like a book or magazine, they can request the ones they want. This way, the unused books can still be read by interested people. Keeping all the books will encourage more students and people to read. In conclusion, some may think removing books is better, but I believe keeping them is the right choice. These books can be useful in the future, no matter how old they are. Inappropriate books should be stored properly, and if there aren't enough interesting ones, people can request new ones. Taking books off the shelves is wrong, and we should do everything to prevent them from going to waste.
1721	4698	2	2	In the world, many things are relative, and censorship is one of them. “Relative” implies that different people hold different views. Censorship occurs when an authoritative person or organization prohibits people from accessing materials they consider inappropriate. The key phrase “things that they believe” is crucial in censorship. What one person deems inappropriate may be acceptable to another. This decision should not rest with a single individual or a group claiming to know what is socially acceptable or politically correct. In a library, censorship is not advisable. One day, @PERSON3 and @CAPS2 entered a library. There was a magazine on the rack showing a person standing over a 200 - pound, 24 - point, state - record whitetail deer, holding a gun. @PERSON3 firmly believes in providing for his family and in the rights granted by the Second Amendment of the @LOCATION1 constitution. He thinks that killing an animal for resources is justifiable, and there is pride in harvesting an animal for food. For @PERSON3, the magazine is an opportunity to learn tips or discover useful gear. Conversely, @CAPS2 is a conservative who believes killing is wrong and inhumane. She buys meat from the freezer section and prefers not to know its origin. She views the magazine as inappropriate. Clearly, censorship is relative to the person evaluating the material. Just because @CAPS2 thinks the magazine is inappropriate, should it be removed from the shelf, preventing someone like @PERSON3 from reading, appreciating, and learning from it? The choice not to read the magazine lies with @CAPS2, not the librarian. @CAPS2 is responsible for her own views and choices, and @PERSON3 has the same right. The choice should be left to the reader. In the book section, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were present. @PERSON1 is a science and history enthusiast, while @PERSON2 prefers religious books that explain the theology behind worldly and religious matters. At the end of the row, on top of the shelf, there is a book on evolution. @PERSON1 believes in the theory and finds the book interesting. @PERSON2, however, thinks the content is untrue and wonders why anyone would waste time reading it. But this does not mean the book should be removed from the shelf. @PERSON2 can simply walk away. The choice is his. At the front desk, librarians have their own views and opinions. However, the books, music, movies, and magazines available for checkout should be selected based on the potential need for the information they contain, not on the librarian's personal likes or dislikes. If librarians make the selection based on personal preference, the materials may not be accessible to those who need them. Censorship in libraries is a bad practice as it deprives people of useful materials. Like many other things, censorship is relative. What one person deems inappropriate may be perfectly acceptable to another. Based on moral values, character, and life - developed opinions, people judge what is appropriate or unacceptable. The choice to view a magazine, read a book, or listen to a song should be left to the individual, not made for them.
1722	4699	2	2	Have you ever thought that some of the materials we borrow from libraries may not be suitable for young children? Certain library materials are sometimes age - inappropriate or offensive to some people. Not all books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive or promote inappropriate behavior, but they may expose children to content that is rated and should not be learned in a library. Most music today is inappropriate due to its content, such as references to sex, drugs, and violence. Last fall, when I visited my school library, I found a movie that I thought was not school - appropriate and should not be watched without parental approval. Any mention of sex and drugs in school materials can give young teens and children the idea that it is okay to engage in such activities, whether they read, hear, or see it. When I see teens in town doing inappropriate things, the first thing they often say is, “I heard it in a movie.” Most public libraries have movies, books, music, etc. on their shelves that are not suitable for young children. Librarians are usually busy and cannot monitor the entire library, but they can ensure that inappropriate materials are secured and kept away from juveniles. Children often choose to read what seems interesting and fun. Many modern books that promote violence have guns, drugs, and sexual content on the front cover, making it difficult for children to resist. In school libraries, @PERCENT1 of the books are age - appropriate, but in public libraries, it is different because they serve both adults and children. Some books should be removed from the shelves, especially those with rated content. In conclusion, libraries need to monitor what is being checked out, regardless of who the borrower is, and ask for identification. This way, they can better protect young children from accessing inappropriate materials.
1723	4700	2	2	The world is not strictly divided into black and white, and people have diverse ideas. As a result, when some individuals believe a particular word or topic should be restricted, others will hold the opposite view. Sometimes, what is considered “vulgar” may be presented for educational purposes. Moreover, this relates to the freedom of speech and the press, which are fundamental rights in our country. Magazines, music, books, and movies are primarily for entertainment, and people's reactions to them vary. For instance, a @NUM1 - year - old girl had a rough first day of high school when she dropped her lunch tray at lunchtime. Later, while reading her favorite magazine alone, she came across an article about embarrassing stories, including a girl accidentally walking into a boys' restroom. Some parents may find this inappropriate, but it made the young girl feel better about her own situation. Making mistakes and acting erratically is part of being human, as we are not perfect. When we see these errors portrayed in comedies and dramas through various media, we realize that we are not the only ones experiencing such events. Censoring books and television would be equivalent to denying that bad things happen. Of course, a novel about brutal murder with sexual references should not be given to a young child, but it should not be completely removed from the shelves. The issue of censorship in schools is particularly sensitive, especially when it comes to younger students. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if every parent had the right to remove books they deemed unsuitable, eventually, there would be no books left. Many parents are uncomfortable with their children being taught sexual education, but there are also parents who appreciate it. They do so not because it saves them time but because, to a certain extent, explicit topics can help a person mature when presented in a controlled environment. In the past, censorship in the media was common. It could range from using euphemisms like “intercourse” instead of “sex” to extreme propaganda. Our constitution protects freedom of speech for a reason. No matter how appalling a topic may seem to someone, it usually has some informative value; otherwise, it would not have been published. Deciding what is offensive is a matter of personal opinion. As mentioned before, no two people are exactly the same, and their opinions will differ. If one person in a group is allowed to censor or dispose of materials they find offensive, it is inevitable that some of the other group members will be dissatisfied. This is when people often claim that the law protects their freedom of speech. Ultimately, the media is mainly for entertainment, offering a wide range of shows and articles on various topics. If someone finds something offensive, they do not need to remove it from the shelves and complain. Instead, they can simply look for other content.
1724	4701	2	2	There are many perspectives on censorship in our country. Given the diversity of our population, people of different ages, including the old, the young, parents, and children, hold varying views. In libraries, there are books, music, and other materials that some people may find offensive. Since everyone has different opinions, we cannot rely on the judgment of a single person. Otherwise, it will lead to conflicts among those who disagree. I believe that people who visit the library should be mature enough to handle the content they encounter. If they cannot, they may not be suitable library - goers. Libraries are public institutions that share a wealth of knowledge. However, if we completely eliminate censorship, people may be deprived of knowledge. The reason some books are removed is often due to concerns about children. Parents do not want their children to access inappropriate materials, so they try to keep them hidden. I think we should maintain a certain level of censorship because removing it would deny people access to knowledge. At the same time, we should remind parents that some library materials are not suitable for children and that they should be responsible for monitoring what their children read.
1725	4702	2	2	I firmly believe that a random stranger should not have the right to decide which books should be available in a public library. If someone has an issue with certain content in a book, they should bring it to the library's attention. The author of a book has the freedom of speech and can write whatever they choose. If parents do not want their children to read a particular book, they should simply tell their children to avoid it. If they have raised their children well, the children should respect the boundaries set by their parents. However, there should be a limit to what is considered too graphic for display in a public library. Some magazines with graphic content can be educational, such as @ORGANIZATION1. But this does not mean that we should fill the shelves with such magazines. There is a clear difference between books that educate children about different cultures and those that expose them to sex and explicit material. It is the responsibility of adults to protect their children from such content, but not by removing the books from the shelves. Even if a book contains drug references or nudity, concerned parents cannot take matters into their own hands. The library owner has the authority to decide which books and magazines are allowed in the library, not the customers. If someone is offended by a book in a library, they should inform the owner or go to a different library. If the owner refuses to remove the item and the material is highly offensive, the person can take the case to court and plead it to a judge. But under no circumstances do they have the right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to them.
1726	4703	2	2	When selecting books, music, movies, and magazines from the library, it is often a difficult decision. Just like many of us, one might want to read multiple books simultaneously. Offensive books tend to be more engaging than mundane ones. Thus, it is questionable why anyone would remove offensive books from the shelves. When children choose books from the library, it is essential to ensure they are age - appropriate and educational. An adult would not want a child to access an adult - oriented or offensive book. Therefore, libraries should have separate adult and kids sections. A library usually offers a wide variety of books. If books are removed from the shelves, the library's usage will decline as there will be less reason for people to visit. Additionally, those who cannot afford to buy books rely on the library to borrow. Removing books would limit their learning opportunities. The only valid reason to remove offensive materials is for the sake of children's safety. If libraries are considering removing offensive books, a public vote should be held to gauge public opinion. Instead of completely removing offensive books, an adult section where those aged @NUM1 or older can access them could be established. This way, finding a suitable book becomes easier, and offensive books are still available for those who wish to read them.
1727	4704	2	2	I firmly believe that no one should have the right to remove a book simply because they find it offensive. Katherine Paterson, an author, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' She believes that some books should be kept away from children. However, not everyone shares this view. Imagine an old - fashioned woman with conservative ideals. She picks up a book, sees cursing on the first page, and decides to remove all books with violence or cursing from the library. As a result, the library becomes half - empty due to her beliefs. Beliefs are personal, but books, in my opinion, are not about beliefs. Some books contain dreams, like characters running from danger or flying into the sky. These are the dreams of the authors, and no one should crush them, regardless of whether they are considered offensive. Books are like the dreams of their authors. Telling an author they cannot publish a book because someone finds it offensive is like telling them their dream is offensive. Parents should protect their children from offensive books, just as they protect them from real - world dangers. Authors write for those who share similar dreams, not for a single person. If one does not share the author's dream, they are not obliged to read the book. Authors write to express themselves. We should not shun a book because of one offensive element; after all, a book is someone's dream. In conclusion, we would never crush our children's dreams, so we should not crush the dreams of authors by removing their books.
1728	4705	2	2	I am strongly of the opinion that offensive materials should be removed from all shelves. There are three main reasons for this stance. Firstly, creating books, magazines, or movies with the intention of offending others is morally wrong. People should follow the golden rule of treating others as they would like to be treated. When someone creates negative content about a person or thing, it may indicate that they have personal issues and are using such content as a way to avoid dealing with them. Secondly, offensive behavior can lead to serious personal problems for the victims. I have personal experience of this. In the eighth grade, a girl taunted me by calling me a 'garden tool' and making a song about my appearance. She recorded it and distributed it at school. Soon, others joined in, and I became severely depressed, to the point of having suicidal thoughts. I had to see a therapist to overcome these feelings. This shows that the words and actions of others can have a detrimental impact on a person's mental health. Finally, people will eventually grow tired of negative content. The victims will be exhausted from being taunted, and the general public will stop supporting such degrading materials. As a result, the careers of those who create offensive content will decline, as there is no future in offending others. In conclusion, offensive materials should be removed from libraries, stores, and everywhere else. These negative comments serve no positive purpose and can cause significant harm.
1729	4706	2	2	In my view, books that some people find offensive or do not want to read should remain available. Just because a person is offended by a book does not mean they have to read it. Suppose you are in a library and come across a book you find offensive. You might think it should be removed, but you need to consider other people's perspectives. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to others. That's why libraries have age - group and grade - level categorizations. For example, a child who likes picture books won't accidentally get a book with curse words or adult - oriented content. The same principle applies to movies, magazines, and music. I once saw a book called @CAPS1 the @ORGANIZATION1 in the library and thought it was stupid and should be thrown away. But then I realized that it might be someone else's favorite book. If it were removed, that person would be disappointed. Similarly, if someone removed your favorite book because they found it offensive or didn't like it as much as you did, it wouldn't seem fair. In conclusion, we should not remove books based on personal opinions. They should stay on the shelves so that everyone has the opportunity to choose what they want to read.
1730	4707	2	2	Books can be both good and bad. Different people have different opinions about books; some may find a book offensive while others like it. Reading can improve one's reading ability, but many people dislike reading. In a library, there are concerns regarding the access of inappropriate books. Children and adults have different reading preferences. Children are drawn to fairytale stories, while adults enjoy mystery stories about murder and such. Libraries allow people to check out books they find interesting, but there is a risk that children may be exposed to inappropriate content if books are left lying around. To prevent children from forming bad habits or learning things they shouldn't, parents should ensure that books are properly stored. Although libraries have separate children's and adult sections, children can still find inappropriate books at home. Parents should take steps to protect their children's thoughts and questions by keeping bad books out of their reach. Books can provide useful information, but they can also contain content that one may not want to read. If a child finds a misleading book, parents should make sure the child doesn't read it and hide it away. In the end, by taking these precautions, the issue of children's exposure to inappropriate books can be resolved.
1731	4708	2	2	In my view, every individual should have the right to visit the library and access any book, magazine, movie, or music they desire. People visit libraries for various reasons, such as using computers and borrowing books. Moreover, public libraries are extremely useful for those who do not have a computer at home. As it is a public library, one should be able to find almost anything they need, whether it is a book or a movie. Everyone has different preferences and interests when it comes to books or movies. I am certain that people go to the library expecting it to have what they are looking for. However, some people do visit the library and fail to find what they want. This makes them angry and disappointed because they assume the library should have it. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that the library should have any kind of magazine, movie, or book that one might need. After all, it is a library, and it should offer a wide range of materials. People also have the right to obtain any book or movie they like. This is called freedom. Everyone is unique, and everyone has different tastes. There have been several instances when I went to our local library to find books or movies, but they were not available. One would think that a library would have a book or movie about potty - training a toddler, but unfortunately, it did not. I hold the opinion that the library should have every type of book, magazine, and movie that people want. Some people may take offense to certain materials, but that should not matter. Clearly, if they do not want it, they can simply ignore it and get what they like. Just because someone does not like something does not mean others do not. Therefore, I do not think that materials should be removed from the shelves just because some people do not like them. In conclusion, I absolutely do not believe that any books, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves. Everyone is entitled to their own preferences, and it should not matter what others think as long as it is something they enjoy. In my opinion, the library should be a useful resource for everyone, and the materials should remain on the shelves for those who like to read or watch them.
1732	4709	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials, including books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from library shelves just because they are considered offensive. Some people enjoy books with offensive language or content as they like to feel the energy and tone of the writer. Personally, I love offensive language. If everything were censored, the world would seem dull and fake. For example, when someone says 'Your @CAPS1****** cheating on me @CAPS2****', you can feel the strong emotion in your body. But if we censor it to 'Your cheating on me @PERSON1', it becomes dull. If you've ever been cheated on, you can probably think of many uncensored things you would have said. If you're a parent who doesn't want your child exposed to such content, you should teach your child or keep them away from it. Rather than removing these materials, why not move them to an @NUM1+ section of the library? This section will serve as a warning to kids and parents about the content. If parents don't want their children to be exposed to the harsh realities of life, then they should avoid that area. Libraries are usually divided into sections. If not, you can ask local libraries if they separate adult and children's books. They should be able to provide this information. In conclusion, we should find a way to balance access to different types of materials while also protecting those who may be sensitive to certain content.
1733	4710	2	2	Censorship in the @CAPS1 is a highly controversial topic because what is offensive to some may not be offensive to others. There is no clear - cut way to determine when one has gone too far when expressing themselves artistically. In the music industry, recently, there have been songs and music videos with messages that are not suitable for teenagers. Adolescence is a time of great turmoil, and teenagers are making decisions that will shape their identities. When songs promote drug use and other criminal activities, teens may perceive these as cool and harmless everyday activities. In this regard, I somewhat support censorship as it can protect teenagers from being influenced by such negative content. In literature and art, the situation is more complex. Literature is about expressing one's thoughts and feelings about a story or a subject, while art allows for visual or abstract self - expression. Censoring these forms of art would mean suppressing a person's voice and emotions. When a person's voice and emotions are taken away, they become an empty shell, unable to fully experience life. Over time, people's sensitivities have changed. When @PERSON1 used the '@CAPS3 - word' in his literary works, it did not offend people at that time. However, in modern times, it is no longer acceptable for @PERSON1 to use this word, yet rappers and others can use it frequently in their music. This shows that what is considered offensive is subjective and depends on the perspective of the reader, listener, or viewer. These days, parents try to shield their children from the harsh realities of the world by censoring what they read, hear, or see. But this approach does not solve the problems in the world. There will always be war, crime, and death, and as long as there is 'good', there will always be 'bad'. In my honest opinion, I believe that censorship in the @CAPS1 is a bad idea. It does not solve the actual problems in the world; instead, it merely covers them up, just like the dialogue or images that people want to get rid of. We should find a better way to deal with controversial content rather than relying on censorship.
1734	4711	2	2	Despite the increasing demand for electronic books in this new era, hard - back and paperback books are far from obsolete. Many people still cherish the traditional experience of going to libraries and embarking on the search for the perfect book. Additionally, considering the current economic downturn, borrowing books from the library is a more cost - effective option. However, a significant question arises: can people find everything they want at their local library? For some, the answer is no, mainly due to library censorship. It is true that many libraries censor materials that they deem inappropriate for children. I agree that certain content should not be openly displayed on library shelves. While some adults and teenagers may desire more mature materials, these should not be accessible to children. Children and their parents are among the most loyal library customers. Parents do not want their children to be exposed to explicit materials at a young age. If libraries lose young families as customers, they could lose almost half of their clientele. Therefore, if you are looking for something that may be too mature for children, you should reconsider going to the library. Instead, visit a bookstore and purchase what you need there. This way, we can keep children in a safe and innocent environment. In conclusion, library censorship, while necessary to protect children, also has an impact on the availability of materials for different age groups, and we should make appropriate choices to balance the needs of all users.
1735	4712	2	2	When you're in search of the right book, music, movie, or magazine, you may come across some interesting ones. The question is, should libraries ban certain books just because of some content on one page? Individuals have the ability to decide whether to read a particular book or not. Banning books has become a significant issue in contemporary society and needs to be addressed. People should be old enough to select books they enjoy without having to worry about whether the library has the book they want when they visit. Just because some people might think certain books are bad, it doesn't mean they should be banned. Many so - called 'bad' books only have a single offensive word on one page, yet banning them means denying others the chance to read a perfectly good book. For example, @PERSON2's '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' caused a great deal of controversy regarding whether it should be put on the library shelves. The book contained the @CAPS4 word, which displeased some people. However, the book was well - written and only had a few bad words. Should a few bad words prevent a book from being a prize - winner? This is a great story that many people should read and not be left in storage boxes. There are alternative ways to restrict access to certain books based on age. Libraries could set aside a specific area for such books. This way, the books are still somewhat censored, but we can still keep the wonderful books that we all love. For instance, if there is a highly informative book about a particular task that contains bad language, should the world's knowledge and well - being decline just because of some inappropriate material in the book? Authors also have the same rights as readers. They should have a say in whether their books are put on the shelves. The government should not have the sole decision - making power in this matter. The community and the author should have more influence. When an author writes a novel, they focus on the great content they are creating, not on whether it is suitable for children. Authors should be able to write freely without having to worry about excessive concerns. This year, we read a book called '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 Are @CAPS7 @CAPS8'. It had some language that I believe might not be suitable for everyone. But I don't think it should be banned from the library because the words were used in a non - violent way. When I read it, neither I nor my classmates felt harmed by the content. @PERSON1, the author, did an excellent job of writing this piece of literature. In conclusion, before deciding to ban a book, we should consider the many people whose enjoyment we might be taking away. Banning books is not the solution; instead, we should find better ways to manage access while preserving the right to read a wide variety of materials.
1736	4713	2	2	Should certain offensive materials like books, music, movies, and magazines be removed from shelves? The answer is no. Just because a particular book, song, magazine article, or movie is offensive does not grant us the right to remove it. While we do have the option to take a book off the shelf, there are numerous things that can offend people. For instance, if someone encounters an offensive book at the library, it is not reasonable for them to go through the trouble of getting it removed. It is more practical to simply ignore it and look for other materials. If anyone could remove a book just because they found it offensive, bookstores would soon be empty. People can easily be offended, especially when something they hold dear, such as their religion, is mocked in a book. We all experience offense, but we should move on and find something else. We are not compelled to read a book, listen to a song, or look at a magazine. We have a choice. We can either move on and engage with more positive content or go through the process of getting the offensive item removed. It's important to note that what one person finds offensive, another might find beneficial or relatable. Therefore, the decision should not rest with an individual. However, if an entire community has an issue with a book, then removal could be considered as an option.
1737	4714	2	2	In my opinion, some books in the library might be offensive to certain people. However, many of these books carry a deeper meaning. Take, for example, a well - known book that a large number of people enjoy reading. This book frequently uses a particular word that many find offensive, but the question is, why? There has been a significant debate about book companies changing this word in the book. From my perspective, the book should remain unchanged. Why make a change now? Many English teachers use this book because it tells the story of a white boy named @CAPS6 who saves @PERSON1. The use of the word is in the context of how language was used in the past, not in a derogatory way. The book is powerful and offers readers a profound insight into life. While it is true that one should not casually use that word in daily life, changing the book after it has been available to the public for a long time would alter its original meaning. In conclusion, we should respect the integrity of the book and not change it just to avoid potential offense.
1738	4715	2	2	Katherine Paterson delved into the real impact of censoring library content. In her quote, she pointed out that if every offensive item is removed based on individual preferences, eventually, there will be nothing left in the library. The question of whether library content should be censored is a highly debated topic. The straightforward answer is that it should not be censored. People's views on what should be censored and the reasons behind it vary according to their personal characteristics and backgrounds. As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @PERSON2 made an astute observation that most people fail to consider. Logically, we should not censor the works in libraries. Once everyone starts removing what they think should not be on the shelves, the library will become an empty building. To prevent children from accessing certain types of literature, movies, and music, libraries can set aside a section within the adult area for these materials. Many public libraries do not carry highly disputed items to avoid potential issues. These public institutions aim to serve the best interests of their visitors. If there are works that need to be kept away from the children's section, they will handle it appropriately. The topic of censorship is a sensitive one, and it boils down to the question of what exactly should be censored. The problem with defining what is 'explicit' is that there is no clear - cut boundary. For example, does a book become inappropriate just because a teen girl gets pregnant in it? Some people may find it inappropriate, but critics argue that this is a part of life, and shielding the world from reality makes us blind. Instilling proper morals and values at home will help young people make wise choices. However, expecting the world to censor itself for each individual is an impossible task. Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject. As Katherine Paterson said, if everyone removed what they considered inappropriate, there would be no books left. Therefore, we should stop library censorship before all the books disappear. Life goes on, and we cannot stop it just because bad or inappropriate things exist. We should learn to accept that these things @MONTH1 exist and use better judgment to coexist without trying to remove everything 'bad'.
1739	4716	2	2	I firmly believe that we should have the freedom to read, listen to, and view whatever we want. It is unfair that schools have the power to dictate what we can access. This is America, and we have the right to make our own choices. If a piece of material is offensive to someone, they can simply choose not to engage with it. Just because something might be offensive to one person does not mean it is vulgar, rude, or obscene to everyone. I am asking you, the newspaper, to support me in this fight against the school. We need to tell them that they should not censor good material just because some people do not like it. Censorship restricts our freedom of choice and prevents us from exploring different ideas. In conclusion, we should stand up against this unjust censorship and defend our right to access a wide range of materials.
1740	4717	2	2	I am of the opinion that no books should be removed from libraries. Both adults and children should have the right to access and read whatever they wish. For example, if a public library allows music listening and a song has curse words, people should still be permitted to listen to it. If someone is bothered by it, they can leave the area. Similarly, if someone wants to look at a magazine but is prevented from doing so because it is considered inappropriate, this restriction is unnecessary. Also, when it comes to checking out movies from the library, if a movie is not available because it is too violent, I think libraries should be able to have whatever inventory they choose. To protect children, instead of completely removing such materials, libraries can ensure that children do not have access to them. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a diverse collection of materials, and proper measures should be taken to safeguard children without overly restricting the general public's access.
1741	4718	2	2	I firmly believe that profanity has both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, in books, music, and movies, profanity can add flavor and texture, often expressing a person's emotions, usually anger. It can also influence a person's behavior, affecting how they talk and act. Personally, I find it acceptable in music and movies, but I detest it when people use it in everyday conversation.  The decision to keep or remove profanity from certain media should depend on the age of the audience. For example, books for children aged three to thirteen should be free of profanity, while those for ages fourteen and above may contain it. The reason for keeping profanity away from young children is to ensure they have a healthy, profanity - free environment for proper development. Young kids learn easily, and if they are exposed to bad behavior through media, they may imitate it.  People who dislike profanity should simply avoid purchasing media that contains it and keep such materials out of children's reach. The prevalence of profanity in movies and songs has a significant impact on people's language use. Using profanity can lead to negative consequences such as difficulty in getting a good job, potential legal issues, and raising children who repeat their parents' mistakes.  However, in movies, profanity can add action and drama. Profanity consists of negative words that express anger and rudeness. Our society is filled with profanity, which spreads like a disease from one generation to the next. I have experienced this firsthand. As a Chinese person who came to the United States in @DATE1, not knowing any English, I was often the target of people's cursing. This could have been avoided if there was less profanity in books, music, and movies. I've learned a lot about people from the way they talk, which helps me identify those to avoid.  We should keep profanity but limit children's exposure to it. It's like ice - cream; some people like it, and others don't. People can choose to live a profanity - free life if they wish. Taking profanity - containing media off the shelves for children is the right thing to do, but adults should have the freedom to access it.  Profanity can also get people into trouble. For instance, someone pulled over for a minor speeding ticket may end up in more trouble by swearing at the officer. On the other hand, profanity can be used in a motivational speech. As a member of the @LOCATION1 football team, our coach uses profanity in pre - game speeches to pump us up.  In conclusion, profanity should remain, but it must be kept out of children's reach. Parents should be selective when buying books for their kids. For movies, they should check the age limit and profanity content on the label. Lock away shows with profanity so that children can't access them. If people don't want to be exposed to profanity, they can choose to stay away from it. Everyone should do what they think is right and make their own choices regarding profanity.
1742	4719	2	2	All materials in a library are intended for public use, which is the very purpose of public libraries. When children visit libraries, they are usually accompanied by an adult and are looking for age - appropriate books or activities. If a library customer finds a book or item offensive, it's likely they intentionally came across it. Library materials should not be removed just because a few people find them offensive.  Children are naturally curious in libraries, aware that adult - oriented materials are also present. This is where adult supervision comes in. Some parents are okay with their children seeing certain images or reading inappropriate information, while others are not. If someone stumbles upon offensive information, they were probably looking for it, as libraries are well - organized and labeled.  It is the responsibility of parents or guardians to decide whether their children can access the more inappropriate areas of the library. Everyone has different rules, and while these rules should be followed, it's not the library's job to monitor children to ensure they stay in a specific area.  In a library, the location of different materials is usually quite obvious. Adult and inappropriate materials are typically placed at the back of the library for privacy, making it harder for young children to find and providing more privacy for readers. Children's books and movies are usually located at the front to attract their attention. Children won't know about other materials in the library if they don't go looking for them. If parents think their children might wander off in search of inappropriate materials, they should accompany them.  Offensive materials can be offensive not only to children but also to different races or cultures. If a person finds such information, they were most likely searching for it. Everything in a library is labeled, and offensive information won't suddenly appear if one isn't looking for it.  Overall, library materials are public and available to all visitors. Children should be supervised if they are likely to wander in search of inappropriate materials. If someone doesn't want to encounter offensive information, they should avoid the areas where it is located.
1743	4720	2	2	In our society, many people and places are sensitive to certain things. In my view, libraries and bookstores should not remove items from their shelves simply because they might be offensive.  People have the right to pick up an item, examine it, and decide for themselves if it's offensive. If a book or movie upsets someone so much that they feel the need to complain to the places selling it, perhaps that work should never have been created in the first place.  I acknowledge that some things are offensive, but if a work is created by someone unknown to us, we shouldn't let it bother us. Music is a form of self - expression. I truly believe that music sold in stores should not be censored. If the content is too graphic for children or some individuals, they should simply choose not to listen to it. If someone requires content to be censored due to certain words or topics in order to read, listen, or watch it, then they should make that choice for themselves.  In conclusion, we should respect the right of creators to express themselves and the right of consumers to make their own decisions about what they consume. Libraries and bookstores should maintain a diverse collection of materials, allowing people to exercise their freedom of choice rather than removing items based on potential offensiveness.
1744	4721	2	2	Katherine Paterson states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Every day, books and movies around the world are being censored and removed from libraries because of their explicit content.  I firmly believe that books, movies, and magazines should remain on the shelves as they serve a real purpose. Explicit materials should not be censored. Firstly, every individual should be able to make their own judgments. Secondly, parents have the right to keep such materials away from their children. Thirdly, some of this material can be valuable and offer learning opportunities.  Children are influenced by books, magazines, movies, and songs. Some argue that these materials are negatively affecting kids' behavior. However, I believe that children should have strong morals and values to distinguish right from wrong. For example, if a child sees a pornography magazine in a grocery store, they should know that buying it is wrong, despite the temptation. From birth, parents teach their children about the harmful effects of drugs, alcohol, and smoking. Children should not be influenced by what they see in movies or hear in songs, as they should use their logic to understand that not everything presented is the right thing to do.  Parents have the power to protect their children from harmful materials. They are the guiding figures in a child's life. At most local theaters, a child under seventeen needs a parent or guardian to watch a rated '@CAPS1' movie. The presence of a parent means they are making the decision for their child, rather than the child watching without permission. If a parent deems a movie inappropriate, they can simply say no.  If all offensive books and movies were removed, our world would become less diverse and less educational. Although some people may find certain books and songs offensive, others can benefit from them. A child might pick up a book and discover new and thought - provoking ideas. This kind of exposure helps create a more advanced society. Reading can be an escape for some children, allowing them to get away from the daily struggles. For instance, some schools are not allowing students to read The @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 @CAPS7, which is unfair as it is an inspiring and life - changing novel.  In conclusion, books, magazines, movies, and music are forms of self - expression. They should not be censored. People should make their own judgments, parents should control their children's access, and these materials can be used as learning tools. Removing them is like punishing authors for being unique and limiting children's learning and growth opportunities. We should not let the fear of offense prevent us from having a rich and diverse cultural environment.
1745	4722	2	2	I think that if I come across a book I consider inappropriate for others, I'd ask the librarian to assess it. If she also finds it offensive, she can remove it without question. If she's undecided, she could take a vote to determine if it should be removed.  I'd find a book offensive if it has inappropriate pictures, and this also depends on the reader's age. Another offensive aspect is excessive foul language or racism. When it comes to offensive movies, I'd suggest moving them to a section for mature adults or some teenagers. However, my opinion alone can't remove an item; multiple complaints are needed.  Some movies and books should be removed because younger kids might imitate the bad actions they see. For example, if a movie or book is about drugs, kids might think it's okay to do drugs after seeing it on TV. Some kids even get into dangerous situations or lose their lives by trying out what they've seen. Parents also play a role; if they monitor their children's media consumption, some of these issues could be avoided.  Music is also a concern as it's becoming increasingly filled with offensive content. Years ago, it wasn't as bad, but now the amount of foul language, violence, and sexual content is on the rise. I believe some music should be banned because of its negative influence, especially on younger listeners. I get so annoyed by some songs that I wish I could just get rid of them. Artists should think twice before releasing songs with bad content, as they know young people will hear it.  I think offensive music contributes to the violence in society, perhaps due to the presence of racism in some lyrics. I'm not blaming the artists completely, but they should be more responsible.  In conclusion, while everyone has the right to their opinion, certain materials should be kept away from kids. I believe that steps will be taken to address this issue, but it will take time.
1746	4723	2	2	In my view, censorship in libraries worldwide is necessary as there are instances where certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be available on the shelves. These materials may contain content that children might misinterpret and that adults of any age could find offensive. During my school years, I've come across numerous such items. For example, once while searching for a book for a book - report, I read the back of a book and found it involved drugs, sex, and other inappropriate content even for someone my age. Librarians and school workers who buy books often don't consider whether a book is inappropriate or offensive for young children and teenagers, but most books have something that proves they should. I also read a book recommended for those under twelve that I found offensive. I believe the people who recommended it should re - evaluate the target age group. It's not just books; many magazines, movies, and music in libraries can be inappropriate. I knew someone doing a pop - culture report who found the library - provided music offensive. I think teenagers above a certain age should understand maturity. I've noticed that those who read offensive materials often develop behaviors that parents and teachers disapprove of. When my children reach that age, I hope they won't act like some of the kids I've seen. Given the amount of inappropriate and offensive content in these materials, I recommend that libraries evaluate the resources they offer and address this issue immediately. I'm certain parents around the world would agree, and I would never want my children to read the books I encountered in high - school libraries. This is a serious matter that teachers and parents should consider when recommending materials to children and teenagers. As the world becomes more violent, we don't want the youth's minds to be filled with offensive content. Taking action on this is a step in the right direction.
1747	4724	2	2	I firmly believe that everyone has the right to their own opinion. If a parent doesn't want their child to do something, they should prevent them. It's similar to the situation where some people are against hunting; if you don't like it, don't do it. If everyone expressed their opinions, the world would be a better place. For instance, if I tell someone I don't like them, they'll know and won't interact with me. On a larger scale, if one region tells another that they're not liked, the disliked region won't try to be friends. When parents express their dislike of certain things like music, movies, or books to their kids, the kids learn that those things are bad. My dad taught me that it's okay to kill animals if I'm going to eat them, and that makes sense to me, though others may disagree. I think if parents aren't hypocritical and live as they teach their kids, the kids will listen. My dad's rule about killing animals has an exception: coyotes. Where I live, coyotes are pests, so it's acceptable to deal with them. If you don't want your kids watching rated movies, block them on TV. The same goes for magazines, books, and music. In conclusion, respecting individual opinions and making reasonable parenting choices can contribute to a more harmonious world.
1748	4725	2	2	Censorship in libraries is a highly debated topic today. Many people are unsure about what is 'appropriate' for children. Given various social, cultural, and religious factors, it's difficult to find non - offensive materials for children in libraries. Three main reasons for the difficulty in finding suitable, non - offensive books for children are racism, cultural beliefs, and religious beliefs. Racism was a significant issue from the late [NUM1]s to the early [DATE1]s. Thanks to [LOCATION2], slavery was abolished in [LOCATION1]. However, there are still racist comments, articles, and films being published. If these harsh comments aren't stopped, they'll continue. Children shouldn't be exposed to the kind of racist remarks their ancestors endured. Harsh comments towards cultural beliefs are inappropriate for society, especially for children. Books with such content should be placed in a separate section of the library. As a teenage reader, I'm interested in learning about other cultures. There are numerous religions in the world, each with its own deities. I believe children should be able to celebrate their own religions as they wish, but it's wrong to have hateful opinions towards other religions. Children shouldn't read false information about religions and form incorrect beliefs. These materials should be placed in a restricted section. For now, children should receive materials that are easy to understand and interesting. It would be a good idea to have a fiction section for kids and a restricted section for both kids and adults. Local public libraries could hold meetings to decide whether to keep the library easily accessible. This is a decision that needs to be made carefully to ensure that children are exposed to appropriate content while respecting different beliefs.
1749	4726	2	2	In my opinion, everyone has different beliefs and views regarding books, music, and other aspects of life. What one person considers a bad and vulgar book may not be seen the same way by others. This is why censorship in public places like libraries can be beneficial. Censoring materials in libraries and video stores helps prevent potential future problems. However, censorship in libraries can also be a negative thing. Not everyone has the same interests, and we can't censor everything that someone dislikes. If we remove a book just because one parent complains that it's too 'vulgar' for their child, we're giving that power to every complaining parent. It's not the library's job to monitor every child's reading and viewing choices. Censoring library materials doesn't prevent children from accessing inappropriate content, just like censoring words in movies doesn't stop children from learning vulgar language. In today's world, children hear more vulgar words in school than in movies and TV. The concept of 'offensive' varies from person to person. We can't remove everything from library shelves just because one parent objects. We all have the freedom to choose what we read and listen to. Taking away materials that some people like is taking away their rights as citizens. I think censoring sex scenes in movies or vulgar language in music is acceptable, but removing books just because of personal dislike of the writing style, author, or language used is over - the - top. Books are important for children's learning and imagination. Removing them from library shelves can hinder a child's growth. In conclusion, censorship has its pros and cons, and we need to strike a balance to ensure children's healthy development while respecting individual freedoms.
1750	4727	2	2	This is my personal take on the matter. People have different views; some are content with certain things while others disagree. Unless something is racist or sexist, no one has the right to say it doesn't belong. If someone doesn't like a book, they should just ignore it instead of questioning its presence, as someone else might need it. I'm not fond of this topic, but I'm okay with writing about it. Deciding what belongs where shouldn't be a matter of personal whim, except when it comes to personal property. I don't try to get things moved or banned just because I don't like them; if others want to read something, it should be available. However, if a book contains race - insulting or sexist content, it should be removed. People can voice their unhappiness about such content, but if they just don't like the topic while others do, they should move on. If the title of a book clearly indicates its content, those who don't like it should simply walk away. The book might be useful for research in the future. Some people can be self - centered and cause a big fuss over minor things. I think this topic arose because of such people who are used to getting their way. In conclusion, my view on censorship is that items in places like schools or libraries are there because someone is interested in them. Whether people think my thoughts are stupid or smart depends on their upbringing and mindset at the time. We should respect different interests and only remove truly offensive materials.
1751	4728	2	2	I firmly believe there's no need to remove offensive materials from libraries. While some individuals may find certain things offensive, removing them would greatly offend others. Take rap music, for example. Many consider its lyrics terrible and offensive, yet others find it amazing. Personally, I'm not a fan of rap, but I wouldn't advocate for it to be banned from the radio or stores. The same principle applies to library materials. Some may be offended, but others highly appreciate them.  Some people may be interested in these topics, just as others are into fantasy or comedy. It's unfair for libraries to remove these materials and deny those who like them the right to borrow. Another factor is the reader's maturity. If someone reads or views potentially offensive content out of genuine interest, there's no issue. However, if they're not reading for interest, there's a problem. It all depends on the individual's maturity when entering the library. The library's materials are there for everyone to find something they're interested in. Just because some may find certain materials offensive isn't a reason to remove them from the shelves.  I understand why some parents may be upset that their kids might see inappropriate things in the library. But most libraries I've been to have a special area for kids' materials. If parents are worried, they can take their kids to that area. In conclusion, I don't think offensive materials should be removed from libraries. Everyone will be offended by something, and it's unfair to deprive others of access to these materials just because they're offensive to some.
1752	4729	2	2	Censorship in libraries should not be permitted. Libraries offer people opportunities for new learning and entertainment. Everyone has different likes and dislikes, as no two people are alike.  When someone visits a library, they should recognize that the books are selected by the library owner. Thus, it's the owner's responsibility to add and remove books. The owner aims to include a variety of materials because there are so many different types of writing that people are likely to dislike something.  If a person finds a library book offensive after starting to read it, they shouldn't discard it. Instead, they should return it to the library and discuss their concerns with the owner. People have the right to do as they wish with a book, but a library book is the library's property. If someone is offended by a book, they should communicate their concerns to the owner and seek a solution. They're not likely to be the only ones with such an opinion, and one person can make a difference.  Books are meant for multiple readers to enjoy. People have their opinions and will stand by them. This is expected with books, as both books and people are diverse. Our society is filled with individuals who have diverse opinions and aren't afraid to express them. There's nothing wrong with expressing opinions; in fact, it's beneficial as others can then learn about a book and either agree or disagree, which helps them discover the type of writing they truly like.  While people have the right to discard books, if everyone starts doing so, the spread of opinions will cease. Sharing opinions allows the world to know where someone stands on a particular topic. Without this, the world would be dull as everyone would share the same opinion. In conclusion, there are multiple reasons why censorship in libraries should not be allowed.
1753	4730	2	2	I'm facing issues with censorship at @ORGANIZATION1. I changed the @ORGANIZATION2 name of a story I heard from my grandparents because I couldn't remember the real one. I don't think this is actually happening at @ORGANIZATION1.  I informed the people at @ORGANIZATION3 and their readers that there's a problem at @ORGANIZATION2. It's not extremely serious, but the librarians there are censoring a large number of books and other materials. I specifically need some of this censored content for a homework assignment on the movie @CAPS1.  They said they're censoring the materials because the movie is too bloody and scary for some readers. Some parents have also complained that their kids had nightmares for weeks after watching the movie.  I asked if I could use the library computers to get information, but they said they've already blocked all inappropriate sites. Since I don't have internet at home, this makes schoolwork difficult.  I then tried to get the @CAPS2 to uncensor the materials so that I could have them censor only the adult - rated content. I also suggested separating @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 by age group (child, teen, older teen) to prevent kids from having nightmares. The @CAPS2 said they'd try my idea but that they'd keep the classic @CAPS4 and @CAPS3. They also said I'd have to volunteer at @ORGANIZATION2 and go through the censored materials over the years. I agreed, but when I saw the censor list, which was over a hundred pages long, it was overwhelming.  So, I got other volunteers to help me and put up posters at my school to find more helpers. So far, there hasn't been much progress on the lists. I'm asking for help from readers of this article. If you can't help, please see if someone you know is willing to assist. Thank you for reading.
1754	4731	2	2	In my opinion, offensive books, music, magazines, etc., should be placed in a separate section in libraries. Alternatively, librarians should keep them in storage, and if someone wants to access them, they should have to go to the front desk. Also, if young children or teenagers shouldn't be exposed to such materials, they shouldn't be readily available in the general area.  This approach allows for the accommodation of different interests while protecting younger audiences. By having a separate section or a system where access is controlled, it ensures that those who are interested in these materials can still access them, while also safeguarding the well - being of younger patrons. In conclusion, this is a reasonable way to handle offensive materials in libraries, balancing the rights of different users.
1755	4732	2	2	Have you ever come across a book you thought was inappropriate and considered banning it from the library? Many people have had this experience and have advocated for more censorship in libraries. However, we can't always take such extreme measures. That book you deemed inappropriate might be someone else's favorite, and conversely, someone might think your favorite book is inappropriate. Since there are many different people with diverse opinions in the world, instead of banning books, libraries and schools should censor them.  Censoring seems like an obvious solution, but many people don't consider it. We can't ignore all inappropriate books, but we can at least censor them. This could be as simple as putting a tag on the books or creating a separate section for them. The tags should be clearly marked so that readers know what to expect.  We don't need to get rid of books completely. We must recognize that young children may pick up inappropriate books without realizing it. Parents have the right to monitor their children's reading. However, completely removing books also restricts people's freedom of speech. No one has the right to decide which books are inappropriate, so no one should have the right to remove books from the shelves.  Rather than banning books or complaining, a rating system could be implemented. Just as people check movie ratings to determine if they're appropriate for themselves or their children, we could do the same for books. This would likely reduce the number of problems related to inappropriate books.  While we may not be able to make everyone happy, we can at least make people more informed about the books they're reading. If everyone contributes to making libraries and schools more censored, libraries will become more enjoyable places full of adventure. In conclusion, implementing censorship and a rating system is a better approach than outright banning books.
1756	4733	2	2	In today's society, offensive materials in libraries, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, often spark controversy. Some individuals may find certain items offensive, but this does not justify their removal from library shelves. Just because a few people object to a particular work does not mean that others do not appreciate or benefit from it. For example, while the speaker's friends enjoyed reading a certain author's books, the speaker did not, yet the speaker did not prevent others from reading them. Similarly, a well - known work might be offensive to some, but those who find it so can simply choose not to read it.  The freedom of speech and the right to access diverse materials are fundamental. In libraries, where people have the right to read, watch, and listen to what they desire, censorship is a bad idea. Many works from around the world may be considered offensive by at least one person, but these individuals do not have the authority to restrict others' access. Censorship limits the opportunity for people to encounter works that could potentially change their lives. Whether the impact is positive or negative, the choice of what to read or listen to should be left to the individual.  In conclusion, offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. People have the right to make their own choices, and the responsibility lies with them to avoid what they find offensive. By maintaining a diverse collection, libraries uphold the principles of freedom and provide opportunities for personal growth and discovery.
1757	4734	2	2	In today's world, racism and criticism are prevalent. Our actions are often judged as either right or wrong, with no middle ground. When dining out or shopping, one can encounter offensive comments or images. The media, including newspapers, news broadcasts, and the internet, often exaggerate events, especially when they involve certain groups of people, which can lead to offense.  When searching for entertainment, such as a book, movie, or music, people naturally select what interests them. During the selection process, it is inevitable to come across titles or images that are offensive. For instance, when the speaker encounters such items, they may pick them up to read the back.  It is certain that someone will find a movie, music, book, or magazine offensive. If we were to remove all offensive items from every store, there would be nothing left on the shelves. Authors have the right to write about whatever they choose, and singers have the same freedom to sing about their topics of interest.  In the [ORGANIZATION1], every individual has the freedom of speech. Therefore, libraries cannot remove an item from the shelves simply because someone deems it offensive. The existence of different genres of music and literature allows people to read and listen to what they prefer.  Each person has the choice of what to read or listen to. If someone finds something offensive, they should refrain from picking it up. When they complain about it later, it is ultimately their own fault for engaging with the material.  Offensive remarks about race, culture, appearance, and weight are part of life. At some point, one must rise above and ignore such comments.  In conclusion, offensive books, music, and magazines should not be removed from libraries or stores. People have the freedom to choose what they consume, and it is their responsibility to avoid offensive materials.
1758	4735	2	2	I firmly believe that if the books, music, movies, or magazines in a library are not offensive, they should be allowed on the shelves. There is nothing wrong with having music and magazines in libraries. Some people may not enjoy reading but love listening to music, while others may prefer magazines over books. Movies can also be a valuable addition, including educational ones or regular entertainment.  However, if an item is found to be offensive, it should be removed from the shelves. The purpose of having a variety of materials in libraries is to allow people to choose what they want to read and listen to. Each individual has the right to make this choice.  In conclusion, non - offensive materials should remain on library shelves to provide people with options. Offensive items, on the other hand, should be removed to maintain a suitable environment. This way, libraries can fulfill their role of providing diverse and appropriate resources to the public.
1759	4736	2	2	"Books, music, movies, magazines, and other such materials should not be removed from library shelves simply because they are considered offensive or because children might access them and imitate what they see, read, or hear. These so - called ""offensive"" items can offer valuable lessons. They can teach us about what is right and wrong and provide insights into history, whether it is our own or that of other countries.  It is true that there are some things in libraries that children may not be ready to see. However, it is difficult to prevent them from looking at such materials. There are individuals who seek out this type of knowledge, but they are often told that they are not old or mature enough to handle it. In fact, studies have shown that some people can better thrive when exposed to the truth, even if it involves violence, rather than having it hidden from them.  Without access to these materials, children will remain ignorant of the real world. They may be ill - prepared to handle dangerous situations and lack the necessary knowledge to respond appropriately.  In conclusion, offensive materials should stay in libraries. They contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the world and allow people to make informed decisions. By keeping these materials, libraries support the development of critical thinking and the ability to face reality."
1760	4737	2	2	Everyone has the right to dislike or abhor certain works, but only the author of a work has the right to decide whether it should be removed from the shelves. If just anyone could remove a work because they dislike it, it would be unfair to those who appreciate it. Imagine how the people who like a particular work would feel if they learned that it had been destroyed.  Furthermore, consider the feelings of the author. If thousands of their works were destroyed without considering the opinions of others, it would be a great injustice. The author is the one who created the work, and they should be the ones to make the decision about its fate.  Before destroying any work, whether it is a book, movie, song, or even a child's dreams, one should consider the feelings of everyone involved. We should respect the rights of the creator and the potential enjoyment of the audience.  In conclusion, the decision to save or destroy a work should rest with the creator. By doing so, we uphold the principles of respect for creativity and the rights of all individuals involved in the consumption and creation of cultural works.
1761	4738	2	2	Dear reader, the question of whether certain books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed from library shelves if found offensive is a topic that many people around the world are currently debating. Some parents advocate for their removal, while others believe they should remain. I'd like to share my perspective on this matter.  As a citizen, I understand that some parents argue for the removal of offensive magazines and books from libraries. However, if we were to implement such a policy, libraries would likely be left with very little on their shelves and might even be forced to close. I can empathize with the concerns of parents, as some materials can indeed be offensive and inappropriate for children. Nevertheless, rather than removing these items from the library altogether, parents can take steps to ensure their children do not access them. For example, they can keep their children away from the relevant sections of the library or borrow the desired materials on their behalf and bring them home.  In today's world, what one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. Everyone has their own subjective views on what constitutes offensive content. If we were to attempt to remove all offensive materials from libraries, we would ultimately end up with empty shelves. Consider the following quote: 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you have the exact same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (@PERSON1) This quote perfectly encapsulates the dilemma we face.  In truth, we cannot always have things our way. We must accept the world as it is and strive to make it better for ourselves and our families. If you take the time to consider my perspective, you may find it easier to simply ignore offensive books and magazines in the library. Trying to have them removed could ultimately lead to the closure of libraries, which would be a great loss for everyone.  Sincerely, The one and only, @PERSON2
1762	4739	2	2	I am of the opinion that while censorship in libraries can have its merits, it can also be taken too far. Removing movies and magazines that contain gratuitously offensive content from library shelves could be a reasonable measure, as I doubt many people would object strongly to such a step. However, this seemingly minor action could potentially escalate into a more significant problem. It is crucial to determine where the line should be drawn when it comes to removing items from library shelves.  The process often begins with a single incident. For instance, a parent might come across their child reading a magazine with an offensive picture of a movie star and accompanying judgmental text at the library. Finding this content inappropriate, the parent complains, and the magazine is subsequently removed from the shelf. Soon after, an offensive movie is also taken off the shelves. As word spreads, more and more people start bringing in minor complaints about various items, and it seems that almost everything has someone who wants it banned.  Even if there were a clearly defined set of criteria for what can be banned, people would still continue to voice their complaints until they get their way. Faced with a large number of complaints, the government might decide to shut down libraries to avoid the arduous task of reviewing every 'offensive' piece of literature, film, or artwork. What initially aimed to filter out offensive material ends up highlighting the fact that everything can be considered offensive to someone. A work that is widely regarded as a masterpiece by most might be seen as an abomination by a few.  In conclusion, libraries should not be granted the authority to censor content. The proportion of materials that truly need to be censored is extremely small, and the potential risks associated with censorship far outweigh the benefits. What may be offensive to some can serve as a source of inspiration for others. Libraries were established to provide people with the opportunity to be inspired, and they should not have the power to deprive readers of this inspiration.
1763	4740	2	2	The question of whether libraries should allow offensive material on their shelves is a hot - button issue for many. Some people are indifferent, while others view it as a significant problem. Those who are concerned believe that offensive material should be removed from library shelves. Personally, I believe that 'offensive' material should be allowed on the shelves of libraries across the @ORGANIZATION1.  The concept of what is considered offensive is highly subjective. Each individual has their own unique perspective on what they find offensive. For example, a young child in @MONTH1 might think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word, while older people may not share this view. If we were to remove all offensive material from libraries, there would be little left on the shelves. You might think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is an excellent book, but someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false might find its presence on the shelf offensive to their beliefs. Given the wide range of opinions on what is offensive, it is virtually impossible to create a non - offensive library. A group of people will never be able to reach a consensus on what is or isn't offensive.  There are numerous websites and organizations that offer their opinions on what is offensive and what is not. People can refer to these resources to determine what they personally should borrow from the library. It is not the library's responsibility to dictate what patrons can and cannot check out. Each person is accountable for their own choices. If someone wants to borrow a book or movie that some find offensive, they have the right to do so in a free society. While some may not approve of their choice, individuals have the freedom to read the book or listen to the music of their preference.  In conclusion, no one should have the power to decide what can and cannot be on library shelves. If someone personally finds a movie or book offensive, they simply shouldn't watch or read it. The real question isn't 'Should we remove offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library?', but rather 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's personal choice to read a book or listen to music, and we are not responsible for the actions of others.
1764	4741	2	2	I firmly believe that offensive books should be removed from library shelves. Some books contain offensive and inappropriate content, and librarians should take action to ensure that young children do not have access to such materials. Similarly, movies rated '@CAPS1' and above, as well as anything with an 'A' rating, should be removed from libraries. Libraries are public spaces where people can rent, return, buy, sell, or trade books, movies, and other items. It is essential to keep materials that are safe for children to protect their mental health.  One way to deal with inappropriate content is to censor it using a black marker. In the old library I used to visit, slang, curse words, and other offensive elements in books were marked out with a black sharpie. Movies with high - risk ratings were removed, and magazines also had offensive pages marked to censor inappropriate language. The music in the library was also regulated; some music was blocked, some was left uncensored, and the rest had the offensive parts censored. Libraries should follow the example set by this old library.  In conclusion, by removing offensive books and movies and censoring inappropriate content, libraries can create a safer and more suitable environment for all patrons, especially children. This approach will help ensure that children are not exposed to harmful or offensive material during their library visits.
1765	4742	2	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,  My name is @PERSON1, and I am a student at @ORGANIZATION1. I visit libraries quite frequently, and I often come across things that I believe have no place in these institutions. Take the movies, for example. While they are generally okay, they are all grouped together, which means that as a young lady, I sometimes see content that I know my mother would not approve of me even looking at. There are censored movies just sitting out in the open.  I also browse the shelves from time to time and find books that my mother would never read. Censored books are just sitting there in the library, as if they were ordinary books. I have spoken to some of the library workers about this issue, and while not all of them share my concerns, some seem to think that it is perfectly fine for children and teenagers to look at censored materials. I strongly disagree. I believe that censored books should not be in libraries where children can easily access them.  When it comes to music in libraries, I support its presence because people have diverse musical tastes. As long as the music is positive, it can be a great addition to the library environment. However, we need to be cautious because there are young people everywhere, including children as young as @NUM1 and even younger. These children may not know how to react to songs that contain violent or inappropriate lyrics, and we also don't know what their parents want them to be exposed to at such a young age. Therefore, I believe that truly offensive and explicit music should not be played in @CAPS4 Libraries.  I also think that censored magazines have no place in libraries. Magazines are among the most commonly censored items in libraries, and there are also many such books. For the sake of children and parents, these materials should be removed. Children should be allowed to enjoy their childhood and not be exposed to content that may force them to grow up too quickly.  In conclusion, I believe that something needs to be done about all these censored items in the library. Many people complain to the @CAPS1 when they visit @CAPS4 Libraries. I am simply asking you to help remove these offensive items from the library. One possible solution could be to create a separate section in the library for adults only, where censored materials can be placed. I am confident that this is the right thing to do, and I know that many people share my view. After all, libraries should be a safe and positive environment for everyone, especially children.  Sincerely, A student who believes in changes
1766	4743	2	2	Everyone has preferences in literature, including books, magazines, movies, or music. These different literary works hold significance for each individual. If people had the right to completely remove works that displease them, no literary works would remain. Thus, I firmly believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from public libraries or other public places. Each person has unique ideas, necessities, and preferences. A few years ago, I had a classmate who held different views on religious persecution from most people. He was against the idea of mixing people of different religions in one place. He wrote a paper expressing his thoughts on how the world should function regarding religion. When he tried to publish it, his work was rejected because it was considered offensive. Although I disagree with his ideas, I don't think his paper should have been rejected. There might be people in the world who agree with his thoughts and would be interested in reading them. His paper might even contain ideas that could help countries solve various problems. I find it unfair that his paper was rejected. People have different necessities based on what they need to achieve. For instance, last @DATE1, I read about a girl working on a project about racism. She went to the library to find a book about apartheid in @LOCATION1 but couldn't find any. When she asked the librarian, she was told that such books were considered offensive in that local library and she had to search elsewhere. I believe this is unjust because the girl might not have had other places to obtain information for her project. She should have had the right to access the information she needed to avoid failing the project. Another reason why no books should be removed is that everyone has unique preferences. In the world, there are books that some people enjoy more than others. Literature should be used for entertainment and convenience. If I go to a library now, I expect to find many selections that match my ideal novel or magazine. Every person should have this right. If people start removing offensive materials, nothing will be left on the shelves, and no one will have access to the materials they desire. In this world, diversity exists everywhere. People have and will always have different wants, needs, and desires, and literary works are no exception. If people start eliminating offensive materials based on their frustrations or dislikes, no books will remain on public shelves. Therefore, materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should never be removed from public places as they are essential to the world.
1767	4744	2	2	I believe that if you find a book offensive, you shouldn't read it. After all, someone else might like the book. It could be an inspiration to them and drive them to achieve their goals in life. When people enter a library, they should be free to make their own choices about what to borrow. If a book offends you, you could write to the author to express your concerns. By writing to the author, you might receive a letter of apology in the mail or even a personal visit from the author to express regret for the pain caused by the book. I also don't think books should be removed from the shelves. Maybe a book that offends one person could motivate another. Removing books based on individual sensitivities would limit the diversity of literature available to everyone. In conclusion, people should have the freedom to choose what they read, and books should remain on the shelves to provide a wide range of options for all readers.
1768	4745	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Firstly, some people may be offended by these materials as they might discuss race, religion, or gender. No one wants to be criticized in a book or other forms of media. For example, rap music often focuses on aspects like race or body size, which can be offensive to some. Parents likely don't want their children exposed to such content, so it should be removed from the radio. Secondly, if a child accesses a critical book, movie, or other material, it can have a negative impact on their future. They may start criticizing others for being different. Some books discuss religion, and people should not be judged for their religious beliefs as they are often a part of their identity. Such books should be removed from the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was offended by a movie that made fun of a female who liked the same sex. No one should be judged based on their sexual orientation, so movies with such content should be removed. Additionally, magazine authors sometimes take pictures of celebrities and downsize them on magazine covers. This can be offensive to some, and magazines should either present celebrities in their true size or remove such content from the shelves. In conclusion, based on my observations and experiences, many people are often offended by materials that discuss race, gender, or religion. Therefore, I believe that offensive materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves.
1769	4746	2	2	"In my opinion, libraries should not have the right to remove books and movies from the shelves simply because they are deemed offensive. People have diverse thoughts and opinions, and I will explain my stance in the following paragraphs. Not everyone has the same taste in books and movies. Some prefer romantic, scary, or mysterious genres. For example, I sometimes enjoy reading books with violent or disturbing content, but others may find such books offensive. Just because one person is offended by a book doesn't mean others won't like it. When I go to the library, I expect to find the books I want, not what others prefer. One time, I went to the library looking for a romantic book but couldn't find it. When I asked the librarian, she said it was removed because a lady thought it was inappropriate for children. In my view, that lady might not have liked romantic books herself. Libraries shouldn't make decisions based on the opinion of one person. Libraries initially place books and movies on the shelves because they believe people will enjoy them. Writers and producers would be unhappy if their works were removed from the library due to perceived offensiveness. Books and movies should be given a chance to see how the majority of people react to them. It's reasonable to remove a work if everyone finds it offensive, but not based on the opinion of a single individual. In conclusion, I believe that if a library had a book or movie at one time, it should remain on the shelves until it becomes old and worn out. Libraries should offer a wide variety of materials, not just those that are considered ""safe."" If someone doesn't like a book or movie, they can suggest to others not to read or watch it, but the library shouldn't remove it."
1770	4747	2	2	When you enter a library, you open the door to a vast repository of knowledge accessible at the click of a mouse, the push of a button, or the turn of a page. However, there are some who believe that not all information should be available to everyone and advocate for censorship. In the following, I will express my strong opposition to this view. As a musician, I am passionate about music. I often seek inspiration from other artists' works, and the library is a great place to find such music. I was disappointed when I found that some music had been removed from the library because it was considered explicit. I was interested in the beautiful melodies and harmonies, not the offensive lyrics. It is unwise to isolate media without first recognizing the positive aspects and the powerful emotions it can convey. We should not discard the world's greatest novels because of racial issues or the presence of wizardry. We should not throw away moving songs because of their lyrics, nor should we trash movies without even giving them a chance. It is unfair to judge a work based on a single aspect. Just as some people may refuse to read a newspaper because of a disagreement with one editor, this kind of censorship is unjust. I urge the public, people with sound judgment and strong hearts, to reconsider the censorship of works that have a meaningful message and were created for the benefit of humanity. Everything has a story to tell. A friend once told me that there are three ways to deal with things we find undesirable: reject, ignore, or absorb and interpret. Rejecting leaves us ignorant, ignoring leaves us in fear, but absorbing allows us to gain new knowledge, whether it's about a new culture or a new person. In conclusion, we should approach all materials with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Libraries should provide a diverse range of materials to expose us to new ideas and perspectives. Censorship should be used sparingly, and only when a work truly has no redeeming value. We need substantial materials in our libraries to expand our knowledge and understanding of the world.
1771	4748	2	2	Materials should not be removed from libraries. Most books, movies, and music are excellent means of supporting various ideas. Each medium has its own way of persuading the audience. There are multiple ways to gain understanding, and these are undoubtedly the most effective ones. For instance, some individuals prefer visual learning and find movies a great way to comprehend concepts. It may take time for them to grasp information through movies rather than reading or listening. Simply sitting and watching a movie can be a powerful learning experience. However, some people may misinterpret a movie and form offensive thoughts. Similarly, music is an effective way to understand what someone is trying to convey. One must take the time to truly listen and understand the message. If a person hears a song once and misinterprets it, they may never fully appreciate its meaning. Some people let one or two words change their perception of a song. Therefore, it is important to listen to the entire song before making a judgment. Books are one of the best ways to understand a person's perspective. A book is like a condensed life. Judging a book by its first few paragraphs may prevent one from grasping its true meaning. One must give a book a chance to sink in and develop an understanding. A book can provide a wealth of information. Some people may find certain books offensive, but these materials should never be removed from libraries. They are valuable tools for understanding the world. If one finds something offensive, they can try another medium. Without these materials, we would never be able to understand or discover anything in our world.
1772	4749	2	2	When you think of a book, do you envision happy children's books or mysterious, dark ones? What if I mentioned offensive books? Many magazines, music, books, and movies available today are neither as pleasant nor as mysterious as one might expect. When I consider a movie to watch, I look forward to something enjoyable, not something I'll want to turn off halfway through. Imagine picking a movie that looks appealing on the cover and sounds interesting based on the back description, but when you watch it at home with your younger sibling, it's the complete opposite. Do you return it? Do you turn it off and waste your money without taking any action? Offensive books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from stores. If you're not going to finish consuming an item, why is it there? I won't watch a movie or read a book if it doesn't make me feel good about myself. If people can create such content, we should be able to express our opinions on whether it's good or not. People have feelings, and if something is likely to hurt them, we should remove it from the shelves. We should all strive to do something for others, and if not, at least for ourselves. In conclusion, it's essential to take action to ensure that the media we consume is appropriate and does not cause harm.
1773	4750	2	2	There should be no censorship of books in the library. Consider how many great works of literature would be inaccessible if they didn't meet certain standards. People would be unable to read some of their favorite books. Would you really want to deprive people of that opportunity? If my argument hasn't changed your mind, at least consider placing censored books behind the counter. In conclusion, censorship of library books restricts access to valuable knowledge and should be avoided. By allowing people to freely choose the books they read, we promote intellectual growth and the exploration of diverse ideas.
1774	4751	2	2	"I firmly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed from library shelves simply because they might be considered offensive. Being unique is a positive trait, and regardless of how inappropriate a subject may seem, it can still be factual and educational. Instead of removing these materials, a label indicating ""adult content"" could be placed on the cover. History often repeats itself, and we must learn from our mistakes, no matter how unpleasant the subjects may be. For example, the Holocaust was a tragic event in which millions of Jews were killed. While some may find books about the Holocaust offensive, it is important to remember that this event actually occurred. There are many offensive and controversial pictures and stories about the Holocaust, but it is still crucial for our children to learn about it. Understanding such events can help them distinguish right from wrong and prevent similar mistakes in the future. The Civil Rights Movement lasted from the 1950s until 1968. This movement had a profound impact on everyone in the United States, but some people struggled to cope with the changes. In the South, many white people treated African - Americans poorly. They were denied access to schools, clubs, and churches, and were often subjected to violence, including lynching. The Jim Crow laws were a set of regulations that enforced racial segregation and discrimination. If a child were to see a picture of a lynching in a book or magazine, it would likely stay with them for life. This could help them recognize the unethical nature of such actions. Some library materials can be explicit, but we cannot shield our children from the world forever. Parents should have open and honest discussions with their children when they have questions. When children go to school and hear about subjects like sex, they may get the wrong idea if their parents have not provided accurate information. Parents need to be proactive in discussing uncomfortable topics such as puberty, sex, and babies with their children as they reach an appropriate age. In conclusion, removing offensive materials from libraries is not the solution. Instead, parents should take responsibility for guiding their children's learning and help them understand the world realistically."
1775	4752	2	2	Censorship in libraries refers to the librarian's right to remove inappropriate materials, such as books, movies, music, and magazines, from the shelves. I believe that libraries should not implement censorship. In the case of libraries frequented mainly by young children, it could be argued that censorship might be appropriate. However, it is ultimately the parents' responsibility to ensure that the books their children read are suitable. For a regular library with a mix of adults and children, there is no need for censorship. Firstly, it is an individual's choice to select an item. If one finds it offensive, they can simply avoid it. Secondly, it would be unfair to the library users who like a particular item but can no longer access it because someone else deems it offensive. Additionally, people might falsely claim that an item is unsuitable just because they don't like it. Finally, library members have diverse opinions on items. If they had the same power as librarians to remove items, so many different items would be taken off the shelves that eventually, there would be no books left. In conclusion, I do not think censorship is necessary in libraries. Parents of young children should take responsibility for their children's reading materials, and the potential for conflict over item removal makes censorship an impractical solution.
1776	4753	2	2	I firmly believe that if certain books, music, or magazines are offensive to some people, those individuals should simply remove themselves from the library. There's a wide variety of reading and listening materials out there, so those who don't like what's in one library can easily go to another. There are numerous libraries around.  If someone doesn't like what they see in a library, there's no point in going back. What's offensive to some isn't offensive to all. If people try to fight for the removal of these items, the ones who like them will be angry because they enjoy reading or using them. As I've said, if they don't like it, there are plenty of other libraries that might not have those items.  Libraries should have the freedom to put whatever they want on their shelves. They can place controversial items in the back, and those who want them can ask for them. Or they can put up signs so people know what's there, and if they don't like it, they don't have to go near it. There are multiple shelves in a library, so if you don't like something, just stay away. If there's a sign, there's no excuse to get offended and complain.  We also need to think about other people. Those who like these items and go to the library to read books, listen to music, rent movies, or read magazines won't be able to do so if the items are removed. This will make them angry and lead to more conflicts. No one wants that much drama. We don't know what someone might do if they can't get their favorite books, music, movies, or magazines. How would you feel if you lost something you loved? Probably not very happy.  In conclusion, I believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should stay on the library shelves. Just because a few people don't like them and want to fight for their removal, they should step back and consider what they're doing. There are many libraries in the world. If you don't like what a library is offering, find a new one. It's not worth fighting over and spending money on, especially when many people don't have much to spare. As I've said, if you don't like it, just ignore it and you won't get offended.
1777	4754	2	2	"I understand that some people find certain books offensive, perhaps because they seem cruel or racist. However, most of the time, authors write what they feel or what they think people want to read. Books are a privilege, and we should be able to exercise that privilege. People need to accept that books can sometimes be a bit harsh. The real world isn't always a friendly place, and books can convey this reality with less harm than experiencing it firsthand.  I firmly believe that all books should remain on the shelves. Just because a book is offensive to someone doesn't mean it should be removed. For every book, there will always be someone who finds something offensive in it. If the criterion is offensiveness, then all books would have to be removed. If an author has taken the time to write a book and ensure its accuracy, we shouldn't prevent others from reading it. They have the right to write, and we have the right to read, and no one should take these rights away.  Take, for example, books about the Holocaust. Many people are deeply offended by them, but they don't try to get rid of these books. So why should other books be treated differently just because they aren't about a major event? It's truly absurd that some people go to such lengths to remove a book simply because they're offended by it. They should just accept it and move on. If they don't like a book, they don't have to read it. We shouldn't take away the opportunity for those who want to read it.  I remember a time when someone wanted to read a book in our library, but they were told, ""Oh, you can't read that because it was found to be offensive."" It really upset me that someone else could decide how another person should feel about a book. It's as if they think they're magical, knowing how someone else feels about a book or any subject. In our library, there are some books kept behind the librarian's desk. If someone really wants to read them, they can. I'm okay with this arrangement because at least these books are still available for those who want to read them. This is what should happen with books that are considered too offensive. We should at least make an effort to preserve our rights as citizens.  Let's also consider the financial aspect. The books in the library are often paid for by taxpayers. So, you and many others have contributed to the purchase of these books. It's insane to waste that money by removing a book just because it's offensive to someone. Does it really make you feel better to get worked up over a book and then have it removed? All you've done is get angry and waste money. People need to look at the bigger picture and consider others. When someone removes a book because they're offended, it offends me. It's unnecessary and ruins something that could have been a source of knowledge for others.  In conclusion, I'm very disappointed that people would go to such lengths to ban books from libraries. If you were an author and people did this to your work, how would you feel? You'd probably feel terrible. People need to calm down and think rationally. They should ask themselves, ""Will this really affect me if I let this book stay on the shelf?"" It also makes me angry that the library spent money on a book, and now it's gone. We should respect the rights of both authors and readers and not let a few offended individuals dictate what others can and cannot read."
1778	4755	2	2	The question of whether citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from library shelves due to personal disagreement with the content is a complex one with no clear - cut answer. Some individuals believe they have the right to eliminate books, music, and movies containing what they consider 'offensive' material. On the other hand, there are those who think library censorship is wrong and that people should have unrestricted access to any material they desire.  In today's society, there are no strict boundaries. The human imagination can create both beautiful literary and musical works and content that may not be suitable for all age groups. Library censorship is seen as a way to shield young and curious minds from such 'unsuitable' material. However, what might be inappropriate for children could be perfectly acceptable for mature adults. Censorship is highly subjective. For instance, a person who firmly believes in a certain religious creation story might find a book or movie supporting the theory of evolution offensive. A parent who doesn't want their child exposed to a particular topic would prefer not to see related materials in the children's section. But it's unfair to remove all content related to a particular subject just because one person has an issue with it. If someone doesn't want to be exposed to certain 'offensive' subjects, they can choose to avoid them, but they don't have the right to prevent others from accessing that knowledge.  Writing is a form of self - expression, a means to convey thoughts and feelings and share them with others. It's also a way to educate people about the past. If written works are not shared, how can individuals form their own opinions when they're not exposed to diverse viewpoints? It's unjust to prevent someone from learning about a subject just because a few people oppose the content. If we start removing books and movies based on individual sensitivities, eventually, there will be nothing left on the library shelves because everyone is offended by something. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right in our society. By living here, we have the right to read and learn about whatever we choose. Censorship restricts the learning opportunities of those who seek knowledge.  Parents are often strong advocates of library censorship. Their concern about their children being exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because a parent doesn't want their child to see a particular movie or read a certain book doesn't mean they have the right to stop others from accessing it. Children need to be exposed to different ideas at some point to develop open - mindedness and acceptance of others. Libraries are a valuable source for young people to learn about different religions, beliefs, and customs. It shouldn't be up to parents to decide what goes on the library shelves. If they don't want their children to access certain materials, they can restrict their children's library visits.  In conclusion, library censorship is a matter of personal opinion. Citizens have the right to access the materials they want. While it's reasonable for parents to protect their children, they shouldn't prevent others from learning. The right to express oneself through literature is meaningless if that literature can't be shared. As Katherine Paterson said, if we continue with excessive censorship, there will be no books left on the shelves for anyone.
1779	4756	2	2	Why are there so many offensive books, magazines, movies, and music in the world? In our society, people have moved on from the era of shows like @CAPS1 - duty time, @PERSON1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, which were non - offensive. Today's shows, books, and movies are often inappropriate for younger viewers.  The good old cartoons that I used to watch, such as @CAPS4, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION1, and @CAPS5, which taught me values like @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @CAPS8, have disappeared. The so - called good cartoons for children today mainly focus on @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @CAPS11, and other deadly sins. They show these without providing any useful life lessons, which is a real problem.  We can't completely eliminate offensive materials. We can't make books disappear from shelves, force directors to stop directing, rappers to stop rapping, or end the production of pornography. However, we can restrict access to them. Offensive content will always be available, whether through the black market or adult stores. Thankfully, there are ways to protect our children. We can set restrictions on televisions, and place offensive books and magazines in restricted areas of the library, accessible only to those over @NUM2 years old.  The music today can be extremely offensive. I grew up listening to traditional country music, but unfortunately, the genre has changed for the worse. The shift in music started with the hippies in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS13 era. While they were under the influence of @CAPS14, @CAPS15, and @CAPS16, they introduced new forms of music that have been around for over @NUM3 years and are not going away. All we can do is hope that our children don't turn on the radio tuned to such offensive music and think it's good.  Pornographic magazines have been around for a long time. No matter what we do, they won't disappear. All we can do is try to keep them out of our lives and our children's sight. But we know that children will eventually be aware of their existence.  In conclusion, we should move offensive materials to restricted areas in the library and other media. We can't completely stop the spread of offensive content, but we can take steps to limit our children's exposure. With determination, we can at least make an effort to protect our children from the negative influence of such materials.
1780	4757	2	2	The question of whether libraries should censor materials is a pressing one. In our society, there's a dilemma regarding the presence of offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries. Some people believe they have the right to remove these items, while others think everyone should have access to all materials.  As a citizen, I believe that offensive materials have no place in a public library. There are children in libraries who might stumble upon inappropriate movies or books. For example, a child looking for something to read might come across a movie that is highly inappropriate. This kind of content should not be available in a public space where children can easily access it.  Books these days often contain a lot of offensive language. Kids might pick up this foul language, which is why some books need to be censored. Similarly, a lot of music has offensive lyrics. Rock stars and rappers often write lyrics without considering how others might feel. They use the worst language in their songs, mainly for the sake of making money. We should stand up and demand that they censor their lyrics or at least be more considerate. Writing a letter to express our concerns is a good way to start.  Magazines in libraries can also be a problem. Some magazines talk about sex, drugs, and other inappropriate topics. While some people might be interested in this content, it's not suitable for a 12 - year - old boy to pick up and read. I once saw an 11 - year - old boy reading about drugs, sex, and violence in a library book. This is a serious issue because children might be influenced by what they read.  Censorship is the solution. We need to check and edit the materials in libraries. Books, movies, magazines, and other items should be carefully reviewed, and offensive parts should be blacked out or removed. Not all of these materials should be displayed on the library shelves.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that offensive materials in libraries need to be censored. It's unfair to expose children to such content in a public library. People should start caring more about what is available in libraries and take action to ensure that the environment is suitable for all, especially children. This is my opinion on why censorship is necessary in libraries.
1781	4758	2	2	In today's media landscape, numerous elements can be deemed offensive, such as movies, books, songs, and magazines. In my view, everything presented in the media serves a purpose. When an individual finds something offensive, they should distance themselves from it rather than depriving others of access. For instance, song - artists incorporate certain content in their songs to convey a message to the audience. Similarly, movies are crafted in a particular way to make a point. If people find a movie offensive, they simply need to avoid watching it. Some people may find certain library books offensive because they disagree with the content. However, removing a book from the library shelf means denying others the chance to read it. I firmly believe that media that some of the public finds offensive should not be removed. Not everyone is offended by the same things in the media. Every item on the market and in the media is there to convey a message. In conclusion, we should respect the diversity of media content and the different perspectives of the public.
1782	4759	2	2	I don't think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves just because they're offensive. These items should remain accessible, with appropriate age - restrictions. Adults over 18 should have the freedom to choose what they read, watch, or listen to. For those under 18, there should be age requirements and parental consent. When minors get a library membership, they should verify their date of birth and the materials their parents allow them to access. Libraries and bookstores should rate materials, similar to movie ratings. This would reduce parental anger over their children engaging with inappropriate content. If bookstores sell restricted items to minors without consent, they can face charges, just like selling liquor or cigarettes to a minor. I've seen firsthand the negative impact of inappropriate content on children. My little brother, with my mother's permission, played video games with violence, sex, drugs, and foul language. As a result, he became disobedient and misbehaved at school. Even if parents give permission, there should still be age limits. Some parents make poor decisions, and it will affect their children later. In conclusion, keep these materials on the shelves for mature audiences. Limiting access to minors can reduce crimes, violence, and drug - related issues.
1783	4760	2	2	Some books, magazines, music, and movies should not be freely available in libraries as children can be exposed to inappropriate content that parents may not approve of. Libraries often contain offensive materials, such as prejudiced books or music with swear words and political views. Libraries need to address this issue properly. Instead of removing the materials, they should monitor certain sections more closely. For example, they can require children to stay with their parents. To address the issue of offending people, libraries can put up signs in prominent locations. These signs can clearly state that the content in a particular section may be offensive and that parental control is needed. Libraries should be more empathetic towards the public's feelings. They should consider how they would feel if such content was shown to their own children. I once had a personal experience in a library. I was offended by a book title against my religion. If there had been a warning sign, I wouldn't have had to see it. My brother also rented a movie that our parents didn't approve of, as the library's controls were inadequate. Other children could engage in more inappropriate behavior, like looking at inappropriate magazines or reading unapproved books. In conclusion, libraries need to take control and present themselves to the public in a more appropriate manner. Putting up signs and ensuring parental control can reduce or eliminate these issues.
1784	4761	2	2	Offensive materials should be removed from the shelves for several reasons. The content in magazines should be appropriate for public viewing. One reason is that it may offend important figures, such as the president of an organization or the governor of a state. If someone is offended by the content in reading materials, they should speak up to defend themselves. Otherwise, no one will take steps to make changes. I'm puzzled as to why such offensive content is allowed in magazines, music, and movies. Although movies are often fictional, they can still cause offense. In books, the author may have a reason for including offensive content, which may be relevant to real - life situations. For example, I read a newspaper article about the current president being questioned about his birth certificate. People doubted he was born in the United States. I personally believe he was born in the U.S., and since his certificate proved his citizenship, the issue should be dropped. I can't help but wonder what the president thought when asked that question. It's likely that someone would have verified his birth details before he became president. In conclusion, offensive materials should be carefully considered and removed when they cause unnecessary offense.
1785	4762	2	2	"What if someone finds your favorite book offensive? While inappropriate materials should be kept away from young minds, we can't shield people from everything. Everyone has different views on what is offensive. One person may think a book should be removed from the shelves, while another sees no problem with it. Children need protection from harmful materials. Magazines featuring celebrities breaking the law can have a negative influence on young people, who may try to imitate such behavior. However, children are exposed to worse things at home, on TV, and at school than in some books. We can't ""baby - proof"" life. Parents should teach their children to say no to bad influences. Libraries serve a diverse public, and someone will always find something offensive. Due to different views, beliefs, and religions, books on certain topics may be offensive to some but a part of another's lifestyle. As Katherine Paterson said, if we remove every offensive book, there will be no books left in libraries. Even if a book is not suitable for a particular group, it should be available if someone wants to read it. Libraries should not be prejudiced against certain books. Children can be protected from inappropriate books if they have learned moral values to make mature choices. In conclusion, libraries should maintain a wide variety of books to meet the diverse needs of the public."
1786	4763	2	2	I firmly believe that any book or movie in the library has a valid reason for being there. The world is filled with both things that can harm and demoralize a person and those that can make one feel on top of the world. There are indeed things that are inappropriate for children, and these are typically not exposed to students until they reach a mature and responsible age. As children grow up, they will inevitably be taught and shown things that parents may find uncomfortable, such as books about people with disorders, romance novels, movies with cursing, sex scenes, and violence. Some parents even don't want their children to see a simple kiss on the cheek, which I find rather strange because these are all part of life. However, if a child is engaging in inappropriate behavior, that's a different matter. For example, I also believe that children should not be taught about sex or shown the physical differences between genders. Their minds should not be focused on such things. Books, movies, and TV shows should not be removed from the library because they depict real life and what one will encounter as they get older. In conclusion, we should accept that these materials are a part of the library's collection as they contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the world.
1787	4764	2	2	Debates are an integral part of our contemporary society. Everyone holds an opinion on how the world should be, and there is no absolute right or wrong. Books that describe the behavior of other cultures, which may seem offensive to the people being described, are crucial as we need to learn as much as possible about different cultures. Our businesses operate in foreign countries, many people in our country are bilingual, and individuals have the right to read materials that might be offensive to a particular race. Businesses thrive in other countries, and a significant portion of our country's income comes from factories and companies abroad. For instance, [LOCATION2] is a major business hub for [ORGANIZATION2]. If we, as [CAPS1], cannot learn about the [CAPS2], how can we understand their business methods and way of life? While these books may be offensive to the [CAPS2], they serve as learning tools for us to understand their culture. Bilingualism is a widespread trend, and high schools require students to learn a foreign language, even if it's just the basics, to prepare them for the global workforce. Learning about other languages and cultures often comes from books. Although the Mexican population may not like the way they are portrayed in our stories, it is necessary for us to learn about them. In the [ORGANIZATION1], we enjoy various freedoms, including freedom of speech, which extends to books. It's likely that other countries also have books that are offensive to us, and this is a common phenomenon globally. Since businesses thrive in foreign countries, we should be able to read books about them, even if they seem offensive. Learning is an essential aspect of education, and there should be no limit to what we can learn. If a book contains vulgar language or sexual scenes, it should be moved from the children's section rather than being completely banned. The same principle applies to other groups of people. They should not take offense at what we read, as there are likely worse things said about them elsewhere. Learning is a necessary tool in our society, and nothing should be restricted. In conclusion, we should embrace these books as they contribute to our understanding of the world and our ability to conduct business globally.
1788	4765	2	2	Books are of utmost importance to our society. They hold a special place in our hearts and contain a vast amount of the world's knowledge. Everyone has their own view on what should or should not be included in books. I strongly believe that young children should not be allowed to purchase books with explicit content. However, many of us, including myself, have checked out or bought books only to later realize the content. I do not think that any book should be removed from the shelves simply because it contains certain content. There are numerous books in school and public libraries that could be considered offensive. For example, books about the [CAPS1] and even the [CAPS2] [CAPS3], like '[CAPS4] [CAPS5]'s [CAPS6]', can be misinterpreted. These books do contain language that is inappropriate for children, yet they remain on the shelves. Why? Because these books, along with many others, are extremely valuable to us. As Katherine Paterson aptly said, '... And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This means that if everyone removed books they found offensive, there would be no books left. Books are essential for learning. We have been recording our knowledge in books for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. When the libraries in [LOCATION2] were destroyed, we feared that our knowledge was lost forever. Fortunately, there was a backup system in [LOCATION1]. I have read the [ORGANIZATION1] and believe in it whole - heartedly. However, I know that some people do not believe in the [CAPS8] and may take some statements in the [ORGANIZATION1] personally. I think the [ORGANIZATION1] is the most important book in the world. Without it, we would not know about the wonderful things our [CAPS8] has done for us. Nevertheless, some people may find its statements about homosexuals and divorces offensive. But would we allow gays or divorced individuals to remove the [ORGANIZATION1] from the shelves? Of course not! If we don't allow the removal of this important book, why should we allow the removal of other books? In conclusion, books are vital to our world as they preserve knowledge and touch our hearts. We cannot imagine a world without them.
1789	4766	2	2	In today's world, children are exposed to more inappropriate content than ever before. They hear inappropriate things from older siblings, watch uncensored TV programs, listen to explicit music, and read books with improper content. The question at hand is whether libraries should dispose of inappropriate books, movies, music, and magazines. Children can read what they like with parental permission, but in modern society, some parents are too busy with work to pay attention. One solution is to set age limits on books. My mother has often restricted me from reading books that deal with issues I'm not ready for. Since not all parents are as vigilant, an age limit would help keep children from being exposed to inappropriate content. Librarians or a national book association could determine the appropriate age for each book. This would prevent children from reading about vulgar issues. Additionally, [CAPS1] books should be more accessible. These books teach good morals and how to live a fulfilling life. Many [CAPS1] authors are not represented in public school libraries. By adding these books, students would be more likely to discover and learn from them. Libraries also face issues with music and movies. It's convenient to borrow CDs and movies from the library, but some contain offensive language and inappropriate scenes. The public should demand the removal of music and videos with non - child - friendly content. Movie ratings exist for a reason, and any movie rated above [NUM1] should not be in libraries. If a movie has content unsuitable for children under thirteen, it should be removed. Magazines can be educational, but some have content inappropriate for children. Like books, magazines should also have ratings. For example, the [CAPS3] magazine has articles that are too vulgar for students. Such magazines should be placed in an adult section. Some magazines also contain pictures that were once considered illegal. These magazines should not be allowed in libraries. America's standards regarding what is acceptable to read, watch, and listen to have changed significantly. Children are learning inappropriate things at a young age. Society needs to impose strict restrictions on what is suitable for children. I personally believe that strict rules should be set for what children can watch, read, and listen to. My parents' strictness in this regard has benefited my learning. Libraries should remove books that were once considered inappropriate. Since parents are less involved in monitoring their children's media consumption, society should enforce strict rules on library content. In conclusion, by implementing these measures, we can protect children from inappropriate content and ensure a more suitable learning environment.
1790	4767	2	2	This essay will discuss whether offensive materials in libraries or music should be censored and removed from the shelves. In my opinion, most materials in libraries and music should be censored, but not removed just because one person finds them offensive. Uncensored materials, such as books that some people find offensive, may be relatable to others who have had similar experiences during their upbringing. However, we should be more cautious to prevent younger kids from getting the wrong ideas when they listen to the radio or read books. Censorship should be carried out to a certain extent, but not overdone. In the long run, appropriate censorship can contribute to a cleaner and safer society by exposing people only to positive content. There's a possibility that we can make a significant difference by doing so. I wouldn't attempt to censor everything because it's impossible to stop everyone from accessing such materials. While it's worth a try, I wouldn't completely remove offensive materials just because a particular person is offended. I understand moving a book if someone finds it offensive, but only to a place where it won't cause offense. I'm not saying it's wrong to censor, but I think it could make many people angry. After all, the government has done many things that we don't like and can't do much about. In conclusion, we should approach censorship with a balanced perspective, considering both the need to protect the public and the rights of individuals to access diverse materials.
1791	4768	2	2	In contemporary society, books, movies, magazines, music, and other forms of media constitute a significant portion of our entertainment system. Today, local libraries offer a wide range of entertainment materials, both informational and purely for amusement, which is a departure from the past when most libraries only housed books. It is evident that entertainment has evolved over time and will continue to change in the future.  Libraries today contain diverse materials. Some may provide information about the solar system or the human body, while others may be fictional stories filled with action, horror, or romance. There are also materials featuring true, life - changing, and inspiring stories. However, certain materials may be offensive to some individuals and inappropriate for younger audiences.  Nonetheless, materials in libraries that contain offensive, inappropriate, or rude content should not be banned. Most libraries are large and well - organized into different sections. For instance, there are areas for fiction books, non - fiction books, children's books, and sections for magazines, movies, and music, all categorized by type and genre. Materials suitable only for adults should be placed in a separate section. When someone checks out a book from this section, the library should verify the person's age. This approach can also be applied to movies, magazines, and music in that section.  What is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. Removing offensive materials from the library will not satisfy everyone and may disappoint those who do not find such materials offensive. Placing these materials in a separate section is the most beneficial solution. Just because one person deems certain materials offensive, it does not mean that everyone shares the same view, nor should all such materials be removed. Dividing these materials into their own section and regulating access is the best way to ensure that everyone's needs are met.
1792	4769	2	2	I firmly believe that certain materials should not be removed from library shelves due to censorship. Different sections should be provided in libraries to accommodate the diverse preferences of patrons. Everyone has their own opinions on what they like to read or watch, and individuals should be able to make choices at their own risk. Censorship should not impact libraries.  Libraries should have distinct sections for kids, teenagers, and adults. The kids' section should offer age - appropriate books, and children should only be allowed to check out materials from this area. They should not be exposed to content that librarians consider inappropriate, and thus, do not need to worry about censorship.  The teenage section should not have censorship. Many teenagers are already aware of various things, and exposure to certain content in books, such as foul language and inappropriate themes, or in music, does not have a significant influence on them. Since they are familiar with the content of the music they listen to, it is unnecessary to offer only censored music in libraries. Removing uncensored materials is pointless when teenagers are already aware of such content.  The adult section should also be free from censorship. Adults have experienced and seen a great deal, and it is futile to remove materials from the shelves. They are well - informed, and there is no reason to discard books that others may want to read. A library should offer materials that enhance intelligence, not limit it.  Censorship is pointless. People should make choices at their own risk. The content in movies, books, and magazines reflects the real world. It is impossible to block out all negative things. If someone finds something offensive, they can choose not to engage with it. Patrons should enter the library with the understanding that they are responsible for their own choices.  Libraries are places where people with different opinions and preferences gather. Censorship would lead to the loss of many materials due to the opinions of a few, disregarding the preferences of others. Everyone enjoys a wide variety of materials, and libraries should offer a broad selection. Therefore, censorship should not be implemented in libraries. It would reduce the available materials and likely result in fewer check - outs.
1793	4770	2	2	"In my opinion, certain materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed from library shelves simply because they are considered offensive. Firstly, the definition of ""offensive"" is subjective. Is it content that discriminates against a particular group, creates negative attention, or is simply something one does not like? Anyone can enter a library and find something they dislike, but that does not necessarily mean it is offensive.  For example, both the National Geographic magazine and the [@CAPS1] magazine often feature pictures of naked people. Deciding which one to censor would spark a major argument about what is offensive and what is not, leading to a conflict between different viewpoints. Offensiveness is often a matter of perception; we can choose not to look at something we find unpleasant.  The [@ORGANIZATION1] and the [@CAPS2] may have differences, but if their respective holy books are on library shelves, neither can claim that the other's book is offensive just because it does not align with their beliefs. We have the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and the press. Just because we may not like what someone publishes does not make their work offensive, as it may appeal to a specific group of people. Every item in the library has a purpose, and if it does not serve our purpose, it is not offensive to us.  Libraries are places for a wide range of materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines. We visit libraries to conduct research, learn, and read the latest books in a series. Implementing censorship would hinder our ability to achieve these goals. We may be unable to complete a research project because a book is considered offensive, or we may be unable to listen to a new album because some find the lyrics offensive. Censorship would upset the general public more than not having it, as allowing everyone to check out what they want from the library ensures satisfaction."
1794	4771	2	2	"I personally think that there's no need to remove materials like books, music, movies, and magazines from library shelves if they're considered offensive. First, how do we even define ""offensive""? Is it something that discriminates against a group, creates negative attention, or is just something we don't like? Just because someone walks into a library and doesn't like something, it doesn't mean it's offensive.  Take the National Geographic magazine and the [@CAPS1] magazine. They both sometimes have pictures of naked people. If we start putting censorship on them, it'll start a huge argument about what's offensive and what's not. It's only offensive when we make it so. We have the choice not to pick up something we think might be offensive.  The [@ORGANIZATION1] and the [@CAPS2] might not get along, but if their holy books are in the library, they can't say one's book is offensive just because it doesn't match their beliefs. We have the freedom of speech and press. Just because we don't like what someone publishes doesn't make it offensive, as it might be for a group that likes it. Everything in the library has a purpose, and if it doesn't fit ours, it's not offensive to us.  Libraries are for books, music, movies, and magazines. We go there to check out books for research or to read the latest in a series. Censorship would stop us from doing these things. We might not be able to finish a research project because someone thought a book was offensive, or we can't listen to a new album because some people think the lyrics are too much. Having censorship would make people more unhappy than not having it. If everyone can check out what they want from the library, they'll be content."
1795	4772	2	2	I sincerely hope that children won't pick up inappropriate books or magazines in the library. However, we shouldn't censor movies, books, and other materials just because there are children everywhere. If I had the power, I would keep these uncensored materials on the shelves.  I believe that libraries should have uncensored books. If everything were censored, we would have little to read or watch. Censoring everything is unfair to the world. Everyone should be able to watch and read what they want without censorship. If people's favorite movies or music were censored, they might no longer find them enjoyable and stop watching or listening.  I don't think libraries should implement censorship. Some materials, like certain CD songs, may seem a bit offensive at times, but that's part of life. If you find something offensive, you can simply choose not to listen to it. There's no reason to remove it from the shelves just because some people don't like it. Maybe others enjoy that kind of music.  Children today are exposed to more and know more than they should. For example, they may be familiar with cursing. If a child sees cursing in a magazine at the library and their parents get angry, the parents shouldn't overreact. The library shouldn't censor materials because of such isolated incidents. Children will encounter such things sooner or later.  If I had the decision - making power, I would ensure that libraries keep their materials uncensored. These are the reasons why I think libraries shouldn't censor movies, music, and other materials.
1796	4773	2	2	The author is writing about removing books that adults don't want. They take out books with bad words or pictures. However, I don't believe they should be removed because some of these books are interesting. I'm not a fan of reading, but I have to read anyway, and I don't think these books should be removed. It's better to keep them so kids can read and learn from the pictures. Some books aren't bad for elementary kids, who like picture - books, while middle - school kids prefer chapter books and interesting ones. Parents want educational books to help kids learn new words and school - related things. Adults want books with meaning and knowledge. But I think they should leave these books for kids as they are at least educational. By doing so, adults will have more educated students to rely on.
1797	4774	2	2	I firmly believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because they are considered offensive. People have different views and beliefs regarding various aspects, including religion, culture, and sexuality. While some may be offended by certain materials, others can gain information and learn new facts. Everyone perceives things differently, and each person has their own way of life and thought process. If one person deems a book offensive and removes it, others may start removing other materials too, which would eventually leave us with no books, music, movies, or magazines. In my opinion, it's ridiculous to remove materials from shelves just because they are found offensive. If someone finds a book, magazine, movie, or music offensive, they can simply choose not to engage with it again. These materials are valuable resources that help us learn. In America, we value freedom of speech. Removing materials from shelves is not the solution. We should respect different opinions and keep these resources available for everyone.
1798	4775	2	2	We should definitely keep books, music, movies, and magazines. Magazines and music are beneficial for many. Most people use music to concentrate on work, and magazines can provide topics for classwork. It makes no sense for someone to take away things that are helpful in life. So, those who want to remove books or other items should leave them alone. We need to fight for what we want. It shouldn't be up to others to decide what is good for us. In conclusion, these materials should remain on the shelves as they are valuable resources for all.
1799	4776	2	2	I believe that books, magazines, music, and movies should be taken off the shelf when someone wants to use them. If another person wants the same item, they should wait until it is returned. These items are meant to be used, not just displayed. Books and magazines are made to entertain and catch the reader's attention, as well as to help people learn new things. For example, in school, classroom books teach us math, history, and English. Magazines can be browsed even just for pictures. Music should be taken off the shelf to be listened to. It comes in various genres like rap, R&B, gospel, and soul. Music can tell us about people's lives, inspire us, and is an important part of life. Movies are meant to be watched. They can inspire people, tell life stories, and give us something to do when we're bored. In conclusion, we should take these items off the shelf, use them, and then put them back so others can enjoy them too. They are valuable resources that can enhance our lives and knowledge.
1800	4777	2	2	Why do people find small things offensive? In my opinion, everyone has their own idea of what is offensive. There are many seemingly insignificant things like books, movies, and music that can be considered offensive. It's not right to discriminate against someone because of their belongings. Books can be a great source of learning. Sometimes, they can convey more than a person can with their own words. There are books that may be offensive to people and kids. For instance, a parent might not want a book about '@CAPS2' on the shelf when their child is getting @CAPS2. But parents should consider that kids may need to know what @CAPS2 really means. A book can teach us in both good and bad ways, and we can learn from it without having to discuss it. Movies are similar to books. They show things in action and can teach us important lessons. Some movies, like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, are tough to watch, but they can help us understand what really happened to certain people. As the saying goes, seeing is believing. Music can be offensive to some, but it's a singer's way of expressing their feelings. We can't discriminate against them for their beliefs. Singers like @CAPS5 @CAPS6 may use bad words in their songs, but that's their way of getting their emotions across. In conclusion, we are all different and have our own opinions. We should respect these differences. If we want to learn new things and someone won't tell or show us, books, movies, and music can be great resources. Parents shouldn't assume that just because a child is engaging with something that seems bad, they will imitate it. We should respect each other's choices and keep these materials available for learning.
