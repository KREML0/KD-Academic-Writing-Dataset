1	8863	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this passage as gardens are unable to thrive when the ground is covered with snow. Thus, she surmises that once all the snow has melted, she will endeavor to cultivate another one. I perceive that she is not sufficiently enthusiastic about growing another garden; I believe she ought to be more engaged in its cultivation rather than disheartened.
2	8864	4	1	The narrator incorporates that element within the paragraph because it all forms a coherent whole and aligns seamlessly. The narrator posits that when the geese emerge and the hibiscus begins to bud, it signifies that spring has once again arrived.
3	8865	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that passage to underscore the significance of the inspiration Saeng derives from the hibiscus plant. Throughout the story, Saeng found solace in the hibiscus plant as it evoked memories of her homeland. The plant during winter metaphorically reflects Saeng's stance towards her new country and her driving test; the hibiscus in winter loses its splendor in the harsh cold but adapts and endures, reverting to its resplendent state in spring. Saeng is resentful about her new country and the driving test but is in the process of adapting and will be spurred by the hibiscus's glorious state in spring to retake the test. In conclusion, the author concluded the story in such a manner to emphasize the importance of the bond between Saeng and the hibiscus plant.
4	8866	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the concept of transformation. The melting snow symbolizes the transition from cold to warmth. The return of the geese represents a new beginning, akin to returning to something somewhat novel, just as the author is revisiting driver's education. The budding hibiscus represents growth. The author will be more mature, knowledgeable, and proficient than before.
5	8867	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph from ""Winter Hibiscus"" as it harks back to events that transpired in the narrative. Saeng had previously failed the test. In spring, the hibiscus will once again burst into bloom. Saeng has come to realize that many of the things she once deemed peculiar now seem almost familiar. The calls of the snow geese have become somewhat familiar to her. The melting snow signals the arrival of spring. Some potential outcomes of spring's arrival are that Saeng will pass the test, and her mother will be proud of her. Additionally, Saeng will gradually acclimate to her new country and surroundings and cease yearning for her life back in Vietnam."
6	8868	4	1	The rationale behind the author concluding the story with this paragraph is that the author aimed to convey the time when Saeng would retake the test. The author indicated the time through the season of spring. During spring, all the snow had melted, and the geese and hibiscus were in the process of budding. Moreover, this paragraph facilitates easier comprehension for the reader. This is precisely why the author incorporated this paragraph into the story.
7	8869	4	1	"The narrative concludes with the author stating, ""when they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow thaws, the geese come back, and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will attempt that test once more."" The author brings the story to a close with this paragraph because Saeng is disheartened about spending @NUM1 on a plant she thought was distinct from the one at home. She asserts that she will not undertake the test of purchasing another until the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud."
8	8870	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it aids in bringing the narrative to a proper conclusion. In the paragraph, she essentially implies that when the geese return and her flower is in bloom, she will be sufficiently prepared to take the test. She will be ready because she will have acclimated adequately and gained sufficient experience, much like the plant and the geese. She is drawing a parallel between her life and the lives of the geese and the existence of her flower.
9	8871	4	1	The author chooses to conclude the story with that paragraph due to her previous failure in the test and her desire to achieve a passing grade. This prompts the reader to ponder whether she will succeed in passing it or not.
10	8872	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrative reaches a satisfactory conclusion. In the tale, the girl purchases a hibiscus that evokes memories of her homeland. She returns home and informs her mother that she failed her test but bought the plant. While planting it, she spots geese, which further reminds her of home. America starts to feel like home, and she becomes happier. In the text, she remarks, ""many of the things she once regarded as peculiar had now become nearly familiar to her."" She is willing to give the test another shot and is confident of passing it. America is gradually beginning to feel more like a home to her."
11	8873	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as the story commences with Saeng failing the examination, then going out to purchase a plant to console herself and confessing to her mother. The plant is associated with her through the recollections of her homeland. When she failed that test, she felt profoundly despondent and sorrowful. She wept to express her anguish and bought a plant to uplift her spirits. As she confided in her mother, she experienced the pain anew; however, her mother prepared her favorite dish and assisted her in planting the plant. She was aware that it was not the same as the former plant, yet it was the sentiment and memories. She knew she could not simply abandon hope. Thus, when the opportune moment arrived, she was going to attempt the test once more. This connection aids readers in comprehending the story more thoroughly and demonstrates that she was not going to quit. Her mother was extremely empathetic, and when she retakes the test, she will be well - prepared. This is how it relates back to the story.
12	8874	4	1	I surmise that he concluded the story with this paragraph because certain events unfold within the narrative. When the geese depart, they will return and then leave again. This, in my estimation, is what the act of taking the test again implies.
13	8875	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify that when all things return to normal, she will undertake the test. This is the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph.
14	8876	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey a sense of tenacity that Saeng embodies. When Saeng returns and presents the hibiscus plant to her mother, she is extremely distressed, with tears welling in her eyes. Initially, her mother is disheartened by her for purchasing the plant, but she becomes understanding upon realizing that Saeng is deeply troubled. The mother offers to aid Saeng in planting the hibiscus, which provides Saeng with some solace and helps her regain the determination necessary for recovery. The story states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had regarded as peculiar before had, through the silent recurrence of season after season, become nearly familiar to her now.” This quote indicates that Saeng realizes that aspects of her home can be comparable to those in her new country. The author employs the term “familiar” to convey that Saeng is beginning to accept that some things may be different, but she will ultimately adapt to them, thereby adopting a more optimistic outlook on life.
15	8877	4	1	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that the paragraph contains a wealth of information that constitutes the core of the story. For instance, it includes all the names, discussions about the seasons, and their comparisons and disparities. It also delves into different stages of plant growth, such as when one obtains the mids, nuggets, and headies of the plant. Since the hibiscus represents a novel form of something pleasant.
16	8878	4	1	He posits this as the conclusion since it demonstrates the faith she harbors in the flower and the manner in which it will bestow luck upon her for the impending test. She perceives the familiar flower as being out of place, much like herself, and they can find common ground in certain aspects.
17	8879	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the narrative with Saeng as it illustrates the moments when she is reminded of her homeland. I surmise that she believed she could pass the examination when the flower was in bloom, evoking memories of home. For instance, Saeng murmured, “Not like the kind we had before.” This implies to me that she was likely homesick. Subsequently, when spring arrives and the flower blossoms, it could endow her with the fortitude to pass the test. This is the rationale behind my belief that the author concluded with this paragraph.
18	8880	4	1	The author employs this approach because Saeng regained self - assurance from planting the hibiscus and all the events that transpired that year. Consequently, she is now prepared, and this is what the author intended for the reader to discern.
19	8881	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner due to Saeng's failure in the test, the comforting effect of the hibiscus on her, and her sense of kinship with the geese. For example, Saeng utters, “I - I failed the test.” She has acknowledged her test failure, is distraught about it, and desires to “take that test again.” Moreover, Saeng states, “And that rich sweet scent - that was familiar, too,” while describing the hibiscus. The familiarity of the plant soothes her and empowers her to muster the courage to “take the test again.” Finally, at one juncture, Saeng ruminates, “the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.” Saeng identifies with the geese in this regard, which prompts her to decide to take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” The author concludes the story effectively, delineating Saeng's test failure, the hibiscus's comforting influence, and her affinity with the geese.
20	8882	4	1	I conjecture that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it will prompt her to reminisce about her native land and the idea of returning home. The basis for this assertion is that the geese are journeying back to their habitat, and she shares the same longing. Additionally, the hibiscus will be budding in the wild, reminiscent of her homeland.
21	8883	4	1	It is posited that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph by instructing Saeng in the art of self - assurance and prompting a silent vow. The aim is to impart further lessons, considering that Saeng failed the test midway through the passage. Saeng informs her mother that upon the snow's departure in spring, she will retake the examination she previously failed. Her mother was deeply dismayed upon learning of Saeng's initial test failure.
22	8884	4	1	Presumably, they concluded it in such a manner to cultivate suspense or leave the reader with a favorable impression. Some might believe that circumstances will improve for them, and that Saeng will obtain her license. Additionally, it is anticipated that they will amass more funds.
23	8885	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the protagonist, Saeng, encounters numerous challenges as she endeavors to acclimate to her new country, which starkly contrasts with her homeland. The author opts to conclude the story with the line, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Evidently, the author intended to end the tale in this way to assure the reader that Saeng has discovered new hope, symbolized by the hibiscus flower. Alongside this budding hope, the flower also holds sentimental value associated with her home. Sometimes, the most effective approach to surmounting obstacles is to embrace them, as Saeng did in the greenhouse, thereby creating space for a fresh start.
24	8886	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that a single failure should not prompt surrender. Based on the content of the paragraph, it is inferred that Saeng will gain greater strength by spring and will be capable of passing the test.
25	8887	4	1	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all entities adhere to routines and have requisite actions for survival. The geese migrate for the warm months to avoid succumbing to the cold. The flower withers in winter and is rejuvenated in spring. This parallels Saeng's situation, as when the geese and the flower return, she will undertake the test of integrating into her new country. This is the rationale behind the author's choice to end the story in this fashion.
26	8888	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the final designated paragraph, “When they came back…then I will take that test again.” This is because it leaves numerous unresolved queries that the reader may have. Subsequently, the reader might be inclined to peruse her subsequent work. Essentially, the last paragraph captivates the reader's attention. Many of the unanswered inquiries revolve around the statement, “I failed the test.” Moreover, we are also unaware of “her gentle grandmother,” “Mrs. Lambert,” and “home.” Another rationale for the author to end the story with that paragraph is to exert an influence on the reader. The reader is left solely to surmise and envision what lies ahead. Will she pass the test? Will she return home? What will transpire? All we know is, “when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” Most likely, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to create a dramatic impact on the reader. This is the reason why I believe the author of “Winter Hibiscus” ended with the specified paragraph.
27	8889	4	1	I surmise that she concluded the story in such a manner as it implies that she is acclimating to all the seasons. “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She will undertake the test once the cold has subsided, thus she will await the return of the geese, which will signify the arrival of spring. I opine that she is also attempting to convey that when the snow melts and the geese reappear, she will have taken the test and achieved success. This, I believe, is why she ended it in this way as these elements hold significance for her.
28	8890	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it illustrates how everything is in a state of change and adapting to such transformation. Saeng determines that amidst this change, she too can adapt to her new life by retaking and passing the driver's test. The hibiscus also symbolizes how something originating from her homeland has made its way to America and must now endure. When it commences to bud, Saeng will commence the process of adapting to America by passing her driver's test. It all pertains to the endeavor of becoming accustomed to alterations. When Saeng experiences distress over her failure, that is why something from her past serves as a source of solace for her.
29	8891	4	1	By concluding the story with the concept of retaking a test in the spring, the author instills a sense of commencing anew and persevering. For instance, when the author states, “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,” she conveys the notion of initiating a fresh life in the spring by returning to their abode and the hibiscus rejuvenating by budding once more. This is the reason why spring is the time when Saeng desires to start afresh and retake the test. The paragraph also demonstrates that Saeng, akin to the hibiscus, is persevering. The hibiscus perseveres by surviving through the winter and blooming anew, while Saeng perseveres by retaking the test. The author concludes with this paragraph to indicate that Saeng will not relinquish her efforts.
30	8892	4	1	The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because Saeng feels most at ease retaking the test when the circumstances she described occur. Saeng yearns deeply for her place of origin. She made a vow to herself that she would retake the test when such a situation arises. Saeng's statement prompts one to wonder why she will not retake the test until the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. It imparts a profound sense of comfort to her when that occurs.
31	8893	4	1	The concluding paragraph delineates her subsequent objective. She was required to take an examination but unfortunately failed it. She disbursed over nineteen dollars for the plant, which evoked memories of her former residence. She will exude confidence in the spring as the plant has acclimated to its new abode, and thus she too will adapt to her new environment.
32	8894	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" with this particular paragraph for multiple pertinent reasons. By concluding the story in this manner, it showcases Saeng's development and her heightened resolve to persevere and perform at her best. When she declares her intention to retake the test, it reflects her newfound confidence and her gradual sense of ease in a place that is not her native country. She is now striving diligently towards achieving success. The author endeavors to infuse greater profundity and significance into the story through this approach. Saeng has transformed from being anxious and fretful when admitting, ""I - I failed the test,"" to now setting a goal to retake it when the bud blossoms next year. Essentially, the author has completed a full cycle by ending the story in this way, moving from discussions of the test to sharing the flower - related experience with her mother and finally stating her plan to retake the test next year."
33	8895	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it reveals that despite Saeng's distress and unease, she is capable of maintaining optimism. In the narrative, Saeng encounters a hibiscus, which triggers intense nostalgia for her native Vietnam. The reader also discovers that she failed an exam and feels out of place. Nevertheless, the hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope and solace. The author opts to conclude with this paragraph because, despite Saeng's adversities, the hibiscus enables her to recognize that she can surmount her obstacles and look forward to the future with hope.
34	8896	4	1	The author concludes the story using this paragraph because when Saeng and her mother return to their previous home, they find the flowers there more resplendent than those in their current dwelling. She desires to plant flowers that will evoke memories of her homeland. In the story, Saeng's mother remarks that although the flowers are not as aesthetically pleasing, they are robust enough to endure the frigid months of winter. This winter hibiscus is what her mother wishes for her to understand: the only crucial aspect is that the plant can survive the winter.
35	8897	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when saeng and her mother go back to there home where the flowers were more beautiful than the flowers where there living now. She wants to plant flowers thatís going to remind her of her home. In the story saeng mother said that itís flowers arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months here this winter hibiscus her mother wanted her to know that the only thing that maths is that the plant can last threw winter.
36	8898	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng's failure in that test does not signify her surrender. She declared that when the snows dissolve, the geese return, and this hibiscus begins to blossom, she will attempt it once more. What the author implies is that currently, she has encountered failure, yet over time, she can engage in study and acquire more knowledge to prepare for a retake. By the time she is ready to take the test, the snow will have vanished, the weather should be warm, the birds will have returned, and the flower will be flourishing. She will undertake the test. The way the author ended it informs us that she will take it, and the choice of words indicates that she will not only take it but also succeed.
37	8899	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because the hibiscus has commenced budding, and she is presently content. Thus, she asserts that after the geese return and the snow melts, she will initiate the process anew. This ending suggests that despite previous setbacks, there is a promise of renewal and the determination to persevere.
38	8900	4	1	The rationale behind the author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concluding it as she does is to convey the message that we should never abandon our efforts. The protagonist fails her driving test on the first attempt. As someone who will be taking the test within a year, I am inspired by her example. Regardless of the number of times I may fail, I am resolved never to surrender. We must persevere through every challenge we encounter in life. If we do not and simply give up, we will never achieve our goals. The protagonist vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is in bloom, she will retake the test. I sincerely hope that I will pass my driving test on the first try, just as I did with the learner's permit test. Moreover, we should never abandon any task, no matter how insignificant it may seem. For instance, if we cease working, we will risk losing our jobs. Therefore, we must always maintain our resolve and never give up.
39	8901	4	1	The author incorporated that sentence into the story to demonstrate Saeng's profound affection for the snow and plants. She expresses a preference for gardening over schoolwork, indicating her passion for cultivating new flora. This reveals Saeng's deep - seated connection with nature and her inclination towards activities that allow her to interact with the natural world.
40	8902	4	1	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is to demonstrate that Saeng is beginning to acclimate to the new place she finds herself in. Throughout the narrative, it depicts how she feels like an outsider, much like the “winter hibiscus.” Subsequently, in the story, she remarks that “many of the things that she once regarded as peculiar had, through the repeated cycles of seasons, become nearly familiar to her.” This quotation implies that she is gradually growing accustomed to what she once considered strange, which indicates that she is adapting. Hence, the reason she utters the last paragraph is to convey that when everything reverts to spring, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts to bud, “then she will take that test again.” Therefore, the author includes this conclusion in the story as it shows how she, like the hibiscus, will adapt to her new environment.
41	8903	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph, thereby instilling in the reader a sense of optimism for the future. Despite the narrator purchasing the plant in a state of sorrow, subsequent to failing her driving test and yearning for her homeland, it remains a symbol of hope. What she implies is that when the flower blossoms, her hope will also flourish, and she will make another attempt, perhaps achieving success this time. Presently, she may be sorrowful and apprehensive, yet she is aware that matters will resolve themselves, and she will be well. She is finally acclimating to her new life and remarks that “many of the things she had once regarded as peculiar had now become nearly familiar to her.” This indicates that although she deeply misses her native land, she is gradually growing accustomed to her new abode and her new life. Perhaps by spring, she will be content and at ease here, sufficiently so to retake her driving test. The hibiscus embodies both the longing for the past and the hope for the future.
42	8904	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng is most at ease when surrounded by elements from her homeland. She believes she will be prepared to take the test when she sees the ducks again and when the hibiscus commences to bud. The narrator states, “A saebya ledges tall and high, had surrounded their garden…” This serves as evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the tale of the well evokes memories of it. The narrator also remarks, “Overhead, a flock of [CAPS1] geese, their faint looks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now,” which proves that the geese symbolize [CAPS3] home as well. In essence, these elements in the story highlight Saeng's connection to her roots and her anticipation for new beginnings.
43	8905	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author concludes with that quote for a variety of reasons. One purpose is to illustrate that the character is not merely going to abandon her efforts, that her failure was not the end for her. This exemplifies a principle akin to the morale of perseverance. It seems as though the character is regarding the hibiscus with profound sentiment. “The hibiscus will be budding,” which implies that she herself will expand and acquire more knowledge. By springtime, she will have amassed sufficient knowledge and experience to attempt to pass the test once more. The hibiscus also serves as a reminder of her home. When she gazes upon it, she will discover the fortitude to persevere and confront her challenges, such as the test. The ending quote effectively concludes the story. It also showcases the character's determination not to yield and to always strive forward.
44	8906	4	1	The author employs this concluding paragraph to integrate the entire story. She refers to the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant - three subjects present in the narrative. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” she is alluding to the geese mentioned when she states, “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky.” She underwent a transformation, much like the geese do annually during winter. She realizes that “many of the things that she had once considered strange had now become… familiar to her.” All of us must undergo changes; Saeng simply experienced a more significant one. In the end, this conclusion emphasizes the universality of change and Saeng's journey through it.
45	8907	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author replicated the content from the paragraph within the story but augmented it with additional details, problems, and circumstances. By doing so, the author ties up the loose ends and provides a more comprehensive and nuanced account of the events. This conclusion serves to bring the story to a satisfying close, ensuring that the reader has a complete understanding of the narrative and its underlying themes.
46	8908	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's reverence and her longing for her homeland. An initial instance is when ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" which demonstrates her respect for and nostalgia towards her native land. It implies that she intends to attempt redemption from her past failure. Another example is her aspiration to surmount her past setbacks. The concluding line of the paragraph, ""then I will take that test again,"" indicates her desire for a fresh opportunity in life. These exemplify why the author concludes the story with this paragraph."
47	8909	4	1	"The author concludes this story with this paragraph to create an impression of a new beginning, as if starting anew with a clean slate, so that the past no longer plagues the characters. After Saeng brings a plate to her mother, she appears to experience a measure of relief. It seems that she feels better, as at the end of the paragraph, she exudes self - assurance. She sounds determined and as if she wishes to start afresh, stating, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" To the reader, she seems like a transformed individual who has put the past behind."
48	8910	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant catches her attention as she returns home after failing the driving test. She asserts that when the circumstances are ideal, she will retake the test. The driving test holds little significance for her, and she realizes she may not pass it easily. Thus, she intends to retake it when the plant she purchased is in full bloom and at its prime.
49	8911	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it showcases the significant growth Saeng has undergone due to this experience and her unwavering determination. This final paragraph provides an unexpected happy ending to an otherwise melancholic story, and it gives the reader hope, knowing that the character of the mom is confident enough to make another attempt. The entire story is permeated with sadness as Saeng's family is forced to relocate to a new country and start afresh. However, gardening serves as an escape for them. In Vietnam, they had a beautiful garden and derived great pleasure from it. Now in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants within it evoke memories of their homeland and their former life. Despite being disheartened by failing her driving test, Saeng discovers a plant that brings her joy and rejuvenates her hope of passing the test. The final paragraph solidifies her new - found self - confidence, as it is evident that the happy memories she is recalling have bolstered her belief in herself.
50	8912	4	1	The author employs the last paragraph because the hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng. It suggests that she will be prepared when spring arrives. When the plant is on the verge of budding, she will possess the confidence to take the test. Presumably, she will want to tend to the plant before taking the test. Once the plant has blossomed, Saeng will no longer need to provide it with care.
51	8913	4	1	"I surmise that the author concludes the narrative with the paragraph since Saeng expresses that once the favorable period returns, she will attempt the test anew due to her previous failure. For instance, on page @NUM1 at the top, she states, ""I-I failed the test."" This is precisely why I believe the author concludes the story in this manner, as it was of great significance to Saeng to pass the test during the opportune season of spring."
52	8914	4	1	"Winter Hibiscus"" revolves around a young girl named Saeng, who migrated from Vietnam to the @ORGANIZATION1. After failing her driver's test, she makes her way home and discovers a hibiscus. ""She closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. The familiar aroma filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost sense the delicate strands of her grandmother's long gray hair…"" She proceeds to a flower shop to inquire if the plant is available for purchase. She expends a substantial amount of money on the plant because it is both rare and valuable. It holds a special place in her heart as she used to have hibiscus plants in Vietnam. She brings the plant home and informs her mother that it evokes memories of Vietnam. The mother acknowledges that it also reminds her of Vietnam but is displeased with the exorbitant price Saeng paid for it. She plants it in her garden. ""When the hibiscus was lowered into the ground, a flock of geese flew by."" When the hibiscus reappears in the spring, Saeng will retake her driver's test. In the spring, all the flowers commence to bud and blossom. Everything is rejuvenated, and Saeng will have a fresh opportunity to pass her test."
53	8915	4	1	"I opine that the inclusion of this element is because she is likening herself to a flower. When she experiences growth anew, much like a flower, she will endeavor to prove herself and pass that test. She asserts that there is always a second chance. She wishes to convey to everyone that it is acceptable to encounter setbacks or make errors. For example, ""they said there were many things that she had perceived peculiarly, season after season."" This encapsulates the idea that setbacks are not permanent and that one can always strive for a better outcome."
54	8916	4	1	"The author concludes the story in such a way because she intends for everyone to understand her profound sentiments towards the hibiscus. She regarded the hibiscus as an exquisite plant. She characterized it as ""smooth and cool"" towards the end of the first page. When she first encountered the plant back in Vietnam, she assumed that it grew in a wild and untamed manner. Then, when she saw it in the United States, she was astounded to find it growing in a pot. For example, she described the fragrance of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent."" @CAPS1, this is the reason why she concludes the story in this fashion; it is a reflection of her deep - seated emotions towards the plant."
55	8917	4	1	The author concludes the story with that statement as it demonstrates Saeng's ardor for gardening. Her willingness to take the test is driven by her eagerness to witness whether her plants can thrive when spring arrives and the hibiscus begins to bud. She will endeavor to cultivate it, which vividly illustrates Saeng's intense anticipation for gardening and her determination to nurture the hibiscus to growth during the spring season. This conclusion effectively showcases Saeng's unwavering passion and commitment to her gardening pursuits.
56	8918	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this to convey that when all is restored to normalcy and beauty, that is precisely when Saeng will undertake the test. By doing so, the author demonstrates that Saeng is attuned to the spring season and delights in toiling in the garden during this time. Moreover, it implies that Saeng perceives herself as performing better academically during the spring months. The author concludes the narrative with this to convey that when all is restored to normalcy and beauty, that is precisely when Saeng will undertake the test. By doing so, the author demonstrates that Saeng is attuned to the spring season and delights in toiling in the garden during this time. Moreover, it implies that Saeng perceives herself as performing better academically during the spring months.
57	8919	4	1	"Change and disappointment present formidable challenges to surmount. Some individuals harbor an intense aversion to change. For Saeng, the protagonist of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" change manifests in the form of a relocation to @LOCATION1. Everything surrounding her is novel and distinct. Coupled with the disappointment of failing her driver's examination, the sensation of helplessness in her new life engulfs her. After purchasing a winter hibiscus plant, she pledges to retake the test when it blossoms in the spring. The resilience of the winter flower and the memories it symbolizes inspire Saeng to persevere."
58	8920	4	1	I surmise that the author intended to portray Saeng's state of mind when she made a vow and to convey the emotions she experienced. When the statement was uttered, I believe it was also crafted to pique the readers' interest but primarily to facilitate their comprehension.
59	8921	4	1	"For foreshadowing, future allusion, and consistent behavior—all serve as justifications for why that is the concluding paragraph. They contribute to foreshadowing as they disclose something she claims she will do in the future. She divulges her future plans, thus referencing what she intends to execute later. She maintains the behavior from before, as she asserts that she will do something again the following year, which is why I referred to it as consistent behavior. She declared, ""When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Hence, foreshadowing, future reference, and consistent behavior are compelling reasons why I consider what she said to be significant, and these three elements aptly characterize what she expressed and what she intended to do the next year."
60	8922	4	1	"I opine that the author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate a sense of continuity in life. In the narrative, Saeng takes a ""test"" and fails. She ventures out and purchases a hibiscus plant at a price far exceeding its reasonable value. Her trial is to overcome the memories of her true ""home,"" which now only brings her to tears when she reminisces. To Saeng, the plant represents the memories and the life she once had but no longer possesses, yet yearns to reclaim. Her vow to herself is that when the geese fly back over her, she will return to the greenhouse that evokes such vivid memories of her home and attempt once more to utter the word ""home"" without succumbing to emotion and without incurring an exorbitant cost."
61	8923	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never explicitly specifies which test Saeng has failed. Nevertheless, through the subject matter and lexical choices, it becomes evident that the test holds significance not only for Saeng and her mother but also for her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the narrative, Saeng's yearning for her homeland is overwhelming. The deluge of memories that resurfaced when she bought the hibiscus is evidently painful and an integral part of her daily existence. Saeng is laboring diligently to preserve her recollections of Vietnam while being aware that she must assimilate to the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are certain aspects she need not alter, such as passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can utilize these memories to sustain her spirits; she can employ them as motivation. This is why the final sentence of the story is so empowering, as she has learned to reconcile the @NUM1 elements—memory and change—“when this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.”
62	8924	4	1	The author opted to conclude the story with that paragraph to demonstrate that the girl had acclimated to her new country. Saeng yearned for her homeland. It was arduous for her to refer to her new country as home without shedding tears. “It’s not like the wind we had at - at -.” She also expended @MONEY1 on a plant because it evoked memories of her native land. One can infer that she had adapted since she was acquainted with the seasonal changes, and it is stated that when the geese return, she will retake the test. This indicates her growing sense of belonging and readiness to face new challenges in her adopted country.
63	8925	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it enables Saeng to feel more at ease in her new environment. For instance, it states, “the snow melts, and the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding; then I will take the test again.” It is plausible that the author includes this because all the elements in that sentence evoke nostalgia for her homeland. For example, the plant and the geese are familiar sights from her home. Thus, when winter concludes, she will feel more comforted and be prepared to take the test. This conclusion showcases Saeng's gradual adaptation and her ability to find solace in the natural cycles of her new surroundings.
64	8926	4	1	The rationale behind the author ending the story with Saeng's vow is that she is highly dedicated. She failed the initial attempt, but now she is determined to succeed. Hence, she is awaiting the moment when the snow melts, the @CAPS1 geese return, and the hibiscus is in bloom @CAPS2 before she makes a comeback. This vow reflects her resilience and her commitment to overcoming the obstacles in her path, ultimately suggesting a hopeful future in her new life.
65	8927	4	1	I surmise that the author concluded the story in such a manner because throughout the entire narrative, the plot was set in winter. She might have intended to explore the possibility of a different outcome by having Saeng attempt the test in a different season to ascertain if she would perform better under a new set of circumstances. That is why I believe the author concluded the story in this way, as it offers a glimmer of hope and the prospect of a fresh start for Saeng, symbolizing the potential for growth and change with the changing seasons.
66	8928	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for the subsequent reasons. Saeng genuinely implies that she will undertake the test in spring. I infer this because she mentions that when the snow melts and geese return, signifying next spring, she will retake the test. She speaks with conviction as she begins to incorporate more details. For instance, she adds, “hibiscus is budding.” Based on her statements, Saeng is resolute to pass the test. This elucidates why this was the last paragraph and the meaning behind her words.
67	8929	4	1	The author concludes the story by stating “in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again,” as it implies the advent of a new year. For example, having failed the test the first time, she will await an opportunity to attempt it once more. Another illustration is that she is simply determined to persevere until she obtains her driving license. This conclusion encapsulates her tenacity and hope for a successful outcome.
68	8930	4	1	In this narrative, Saeng demonstrates to her mother her profound enthusiasm for planting and her fervor for plants. The author includes this paragraph in the story to convey Saeng's sentiments towards her gardening pursuits. One indication of her passion for planting is her declaration, “I will try this test again,” which suggests that when engaged in an activity she relishes, she will persistently attempt it until she attains complete satisfaction. This clearly showcases her unwavering dedication to the art of planting.
69	8931	4	1	The author reaches a conclusion within the paragraph. I believe the author does so because it reveals a significant amount of self - assurance about the character. For example, when she stated, “then I will take that test again,” it exuded a strong sense of confidence. This implies that she is willing to make another attempt even if she fails on the first try, highlighting her resilient and determined nature.
70	8932	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that she has not relinquished her dreams. By including this passage, the author conveys a message of hope and perseverance. It serves as a reminder that despite potential setbacks, one should remain steadfast in the pursuit of their aspirations. This conclusion leaves the reader with an optimistic outlook on the character's future.
71	8933	4	1	"Hope, a novel beginning, and adaptation—all serve as rationales for the speaker's conclusion, stating, ""When they return, in the spring, when the snow thaws and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will undertake that test once more."" That hibiscus blossom endows that girl with hope as it evokes memories of her grandmother and her homeland, of how idyllic things were there. And as the flower blooms, she discerns that positive change can occur there as well. She will also experience a fresh start in the spring. By then, she ought to acclimate to her surroundings, forge new friendships, engage in activities, and create novel memories to reminisce about. Thus, reflecting on past imperfections won't seem as dire. The flower will bring her hope and solace during her adjustment."
72	8934	4	1	The author posits that she refrains from taking action until there is a pleasant day outdoors. Moreover, she desires the weather to be neither overly cold nor excessively warm so that she can emerge and frolic with her children. Subsequently, she asserts that she will retake the test on a favorable day for her well - being.
73	8935	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this assertion to illustrate that @PERSON1 exhibits profound passion for bridging her life in the United States with the life she once had in Vietnam and for somehow integrating the two. In the story, @PERSON1 expresses her longing for home and her ongoing struggle to adapt to her new life away from the familiar abode. When Saeng declares that she has failed the test and wishes to retake it, she implies that she intends to demonstrate her ability to thrive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When Saeng expends @MONEY1 on a plant, her mother is incredulous because Saeng is cognizant of the arduousness of survival. When the conclusion states, ""I will take the test again,"" it indicates that Saeng is resolute in her attempt to succeed in the United States, having come from Vietnam, proving that she can construct a more prosperous life for herself and her family through diligent work while simultaneously preserving the traditions of Vietnam. Saeng simply aspired to infuse her new dwelling with the essence of Vietnam by purchasing a plant she knew her mother would cherish."
74	8936	4	1	The author may have concluded this story as it resembles a decline. This implies that currently, he is at the nadir and must ascend to the zenith. He is poised to commence anew and retake the test, yet this time, he is determined not to fail.
75	8937	4	1	"The author concluded her paragraph in this manner to evoke emotion. This final paragraph imbues a sense of sentiment, revealing that she is unable to garden due to winter. During the winter season, all of her plants perish. The author simply suggests that Saeng will return. After the snow, frost, and frigid weather subside, Saeng will arrive in the subsequent season to resume her gardening endeavors, tending to her plants and soil. As stated, ""I will take the test again,"" Saeng implies that she will return and confront the trial of exerting effort in her gardening and in her relationship with her mother the next time, the next season when her plants begin to sprout anew."
76	8938	4	1	I surmise that the author designates this particular paragraph as the conclusion since it depicts what the girl is destined to undertake in the ensuing year. She will remain by her mother's side, assisting in the garden. Devoid of companions, she will solely admit her mother into her world.
77	8939	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate what Saeng has gleaned from the hibiscus plant. Similar to the plant, Saeng is poised to surmount an impediment. She will attempt the driving test anew, just as the plant will endure the severe, merciless winter months. The plant will blossom in spring, demonstrating its resilience in the face of adversity. Saeng will also overcome the adversity she encountered upon failing her driving test and realizing the depth of her longing for her homeland. In a sense, Saeng too will bloom in spring. The winter, symbolizing her loathing and homesickness, will not prevent her from living happily and retaking the test. The hibiscus serves as a reminder, and the story ends with this paragraph to showcase how the “Winter Hibiscus” has imparted lessons about overcoming obstacles.
78	8940	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it reveals that Saeng will embrace her new abode, recognize the resemblances to her former home, and cherish memories closely to surmount the challenges she confronts in life. “I've witnessed this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers may not be as exquisite, yet it's robust enough to endure the frigid months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what counts.” This establishes parallels between their old and new homes, indicating that while things change, they also remain constant. This leads to the conclusion as it is here that Saeng realizes she will always retain the memories of her old home and utilize them to overcome the difficulties she is experiencing.
79	8941	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate the resemblance between Saeng and the hibiscus plant and how Saeng will surmount her challenge when the plant overcomes its own. Saeng's challenge lies in adapting to her new life, and the initial step is passing her driver's test. The reader is aware that she must pass as Saeng informs her mother, “I - I failed the [@NUM1].” The hibiscus must survive the winter; it too must adapt to new surroundings to endure, just like Saeng. The mother tells Saeng, “... but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters” [@NUM2]. Thus, if the winter hibiscus's task, or the hurdle it must surmount, is to survive the winter months, then its task will be accomplished in spring. The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself, “... in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” [@NUM2]. If Saeng's challenge is to complete and pass the driver's test, and she succeeds in spring, precisely when the hibiscus passes its “test,” the symbolism between the two, signifying a determined spirit of adaptation, will intensify as they will adapt and overcome their challenges simultaneously.
80	8942	4	1	I believe the story circles back to this point because it aligns with the story's inception. It all commenced with Saeng taking a test but failing to pass. Hence, when the weather improves, she will stand a better chance of passing that test. This is why I believe she returns to the matter of the test.
81	8943	4	1	The rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story in this manner is that she aimed to leave the reader in suspense, yearning for more. This is evident as the text never explicitly reveals what the test entails. She intended for the reader to attempt to deduce the nature of the test. When Saeng approached her mother, she informed her that she had failed the test.
82	8944	4	1	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to offer a glimpse into the subsequent narrative. I surmise that there will be another story as there are indications to substantiate my hypothesis. Specifically, at the onset of the paragraph, when they return. Then, at the conclusion, it states, ""then I will take the test again."" The narrative does not end with a conventional happily - ever - after; rather, it merely presents those personal changes. Hence, I believe the author will pen another story so that we can ascertain whether Saeng will pass her test."
83	8945	4	1	The author chose to end with this paragraph as it serves as an illustration of how everything undergoes a rejuvenation in spring. For instance, geese return to their habitats after winter to establish new families, and hibiscus leaves wither in winter only to experience a rebirth in spring. I opine that the author employs this paragraph at the end as it is a metaphor signifying that everything will have a fresh start, and Saeng will also get a new opportunity to take her driving test, much like the plants and geese getting a new lease on life.
84	8946	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the return of these geese symbolizes Saeng's tenacity and the hope requisite for her to pass the driving test. She will await the winter's end so that she can succeed in the test. The arrival of spring also represents renewal and genesis. Saeng will have another chance to pass the driving test with restored faith and motivation. This is an excellent way to conclude the story as it is profoundly meaningful and prompts the reader to contemplate the significance of the scene and how the geese, hibiscus plant, and the arrival of spring influence the story's conclusion.
85	8947	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph to convey that he will emerge in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return. Additionally, I think the author appreciates the spring setting, with its sunny skies and geese floating on a [assuming @CAPS2 is a body of water, let's say pond]. I too would relish such a setting as it sparks more ideas and is an extremely charming environment to be in. This is why I believe the author selected that paragraph to conclude the story.
86	8948	4	1	"The short narrative, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" revolves around a young girl who relocated with her mother to @LOCATION1. The tale delineates the girl's transition into a distinct culture. Throughout the story, the author alludes to the daughter having to undertake a test. At the story's conclusion, the author penned, ""In the spring…then I will take that test again."" In the text, when referring to the winter hibiscus plant she purchased, the girl remarks, ""it's—it's not a real one."" The reader can deduce that this quotation implies the girl harbors memories of her homeland, yet they are not the genuine experience. Additionally, the author wrote, ""… much preferred it to the Big Mac."" This quote indicates that she yearns for her native culture and struggles to adapt to the @CAPS1 culture in which she currently resides. In summary, the girl's test @MONTH1 entails her ability to cope with change and to recall memories of her homeland with joy rather than sorrow."
87	8949	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with that particular ending to convey to the reader the message that ""if you simply persevere, you might develop an affinity for it."" This is the reason the girl expressed her intention to return the following spring when the snow melts to retake the test."
88	8950	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it effectively integrates all elements. One way it achieves this cohesion is by linking the events at the beginning with the reason she initially purchased the flower. Moreover, it connects Saeng's past memories from Vietnam to her new lifestyle in the United States. The story states, ""Carefully, Saeng dug it up and smiled. She closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs."" This demonstrates that the flower she discovered in the flower shop evokes memories of Vietnam. This is precisely why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."
89	8951	4	1	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it conveys that Saeng intends to attempt to pass the test in the spring. Obtaining that hibiscus rekindled her memories of her homeland and stirred recollections of the past. Furthermore, it instilled in her self - confidence and the determination to strive once more. It filled her with hope. The author employs the description ""when snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" to signify that it will be spring when she attempts to take the test again."
90	8952	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because, considering all that has transpired, such as her failure in the test, the author desires the ending to be a memorable and positive one. Additionally, the author wishes the ending to illustrate that despite a setback, she is resolved to try again. The author aims to showcase her tenacity and her pursuit of what she desires. Hence, the author deems this paragraph to be the fitting conclusion for the story.
91	8953	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to signify that the girl will not abandon her efforts to pass the test. Moreover, she will acclimate to her newly - discovered abode and transform it into what her home in Vietnam once was to her. The girl is nostalgic about her former life and yearns to return and resume the existence she had in her homeland. When she is...
92	8954	4	1	The author deliberately concluded the story with this paragraph as it offers a resolution to the entire preceding narrative. In the story, Saeng, the protagonist, was burdened by stress due to failing the @CAPS1 test. Additionally, she was saddened by the recollection of the hibiscus plant in her native Vietnam. At the story's conclusion, when it states, “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again” (Ho), the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus symbolize transformation and adaptation. Saeng must undergo change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and attain emotional well - being. This is precisely why the author, @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus,” employed a powerful, symbol - laden, and conclusive ending for her narrative.
93	8955	4	1	After Saeng fails her driver's examination, she succumbs to despair regarding the future. However, the sight of the hibiscus plant serves as a poignant reminder for her to persevere, regardless of the adversity. In the story, Saeng's mother remarks, “Its flowers aren't as resplendent, but it's robust enough to endure the frigid months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what counts.” This quote illustrates that even if it is not an object of aesthetic allure, it possesses the tenacity to survive. Saeng perceives herself as akin to the hibiscus, possessing the fortitude to thrive in a novel environment. Despite being new to this country, Saeng has demonstrated that regardless of the magnitude of the challenge, any obstacle can be surmounted through self - belief and the support of family.
94	8956	4	1	The author likely utilized this passage as the final paragraph to convey that this time next year, the protagonist will retake the test. By penning this paragraph, the author reveals that she failed the test when the geese were migrating for winter and the hibiscus was in full bloom. This final segment effectively ties together the narrative, emphasizing the cyclical nature of time and the protagonist's determination for a second attempt.
95	8957	4	1	The author concludes the story in this way because it underscores the profound significance of the plant. Saeng will await the flower's blooming as it holds great emotional value for her. The flower serves as a metaphor for her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is on the verge of blossoming, she will be prepared to drive. The plant instills in her hope for a new dawn, a fresh opportunity. The last paragraph enables the reader to grasp the plant's significance to the girl. It makes her feel more at ease in her new environment, alleviating the sense of alienation. After the distress of failing the driving test, it brings her joy and contentment, reaffirming the plant's role as a source of comfort and motivation.
96	8958	4	1	She concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she desires @DATE1 to revisit. She utters, “when the snow melts.” She wishes to re - examine the events and tend to them.
97	8959	4	1	In this concise narrative, Saeng pledges to retake the examination in the spring as she is cognizant that she will be capable of passing it once she has come to terms with residing in this novel locale. Subsequent to Saeng's relocation, she was profoundly distressed and yearned for her former abode, kin, and way of life. This impeded her from concentrating on the test. Nevertheless, upon realizing that the blossoms in her new dwelling are also resplendent, she commenced to embrace the alterations. The familiarity of the geese to her symbolizes her acclimation to her new lifestyle. Saeng likely made this vow as she did not wish for her mother to be disheartened by her once more. After witnessing her mother's disappointment and affectionate benevolence, Saeng was resolute to pass the test. When Saeng retakes the test in the spring, she will be prepared as she has adapted to and accepted her new existence.
98	8960	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because at the onset of the narrative, her family emigrated from Vietnam to the United States. Saeng was returning home after failing her driver's test. She spotted a familiar plant. Subsequently, she visited a florist shop to ascertain if the plant could be procured. Thus, she obtained the plant seeds and sowed them so that when they commence to blossom, she will retake the driving test she failed. I @CAPS1 she utilizes it for good fortune. That is the rationale behind the author concluding that paragraph in the story.
99	8961	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with the paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng can surmount obstacles, and the subsequent time she encounters these reminders, she will achieve success. When she states, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had regarded as peculiar before had become... almost familiar to her now,” it implies that she is becoming accustomed to the changes in her new life. Hence, the concluding paragraph mirrors these concepts.
100	8962	4	1	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the narrative with the paragraph for several reasons. One rationale is that she endeavors to surmount change and aspires to ameliorate the situation. She attempts to achieve this by retaking the test. The author also concludes with the paragraph as she feels despondent that life is not unfolding as she desires and that she must take action. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to indicate whether she is determined or not, and whether she will persevere.
101	8963	4	1	I surmise that the author concluded the narrative with that paragraph as she intends to ascertain whether she can acclimate to the new country. This serves as an excellent method to conclude the story since one remains uncertain whether she will succeed or not; it leaves the reader in suspense. Additionally, I opine that this is a judicious way to end it as the author could pen a sequel and develop a series from it.
102	8964	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because the snow possesses aesthetic allure, and geese, as animals, enhance its beauty. Thus, the author aims to prompt the reader to perceive the outdoors as the most enchanting aspect of the surroundings.
103	8965	4	1	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to depict Saeng embarking on a new beginning. The statement “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” parallels her life, signifying that she is commencing anew. Although she may yearn for her former life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine - toothed comb, she is making an effort and “take that test again”. By retaking the test, she demonstrates her unwillingness to succumb to “the pangs of loss” and her grief.
104	8966	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as he is aware that all the events transpiring are highly likely to resurface. Just as he mentioned that geese return annually, he is essentially indicating that these circumstances will recur. This is my belief.
105	8967	4	1	I conjecture that the author chose that as the concluding sentence because it implies that Saeng will retake the test once she is prepared. I believe she is drawing a comparison between herself and the snow, the geese, and the hibiscus. I arrive at this conclusion because she states that she will retake the test when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. Hence, I infer that she is suggesting she is not yet ready for the test and will take it once she attains readiness.
106	8968	4	1	The author's denouement to the narrative reveals how Saeng construed the experience of that day. She employs a springtime backdrop to illustrate the moment when her self - confidence is reborn. Beholding her hibiscus bud in spring will endow her with a newly discovered integrity to attempt the driving test once more.
107	8969	4	1	Hope, optimism, and altruism are all factors that impel the author to conclude the story with this paragraph. Firstly, the final paragraph imparts to the readers a sense that Saeng harbors hope. I discerned her hope as she is resolved to retake the test. Since she intends to retake the test, she aspires to assist her mother. Secondly, the last paragraph conveys the impression that Saeng maintains a positive disposition. She purchased a flower to supplant the withered ones and declared that she will retake the test in spring. Thirdly, Saeng is helpful to her mother. Saeng completed digging the hole for the new flower for her mother, enabling her mother to prepare dinner. Saeng also empathized with her mother's feelings upon learning that she did not pass the test. Hence, she is retaking the test. Saeng experienced emotions akin to those of any other newcomer. She was frightened, yet throughout it all, Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and was helpful.
108	8970	4	1	For her, the hibiscus symbolized a test. Saeng perceived that she had failed the test of relinquishing the past and embracing the “present”. The hibiscus evoked memories of her homeland, thus she expended over @MONEY1 on it, cognizant that she and her mother were in need of the funds. Essentially, she felt as though she had failed a test.
109	8971	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with that paragraph to enable the reader to comprehend Saeng's fortitude. One rationale I believe they end the story in such a manner is that she intuitively knows that when her plant thrives and is free of snow, she will be strong. That is when she desires to take her driving test. For instance, when she stated, “When the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
110	8972	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the protagonist Saeng and her mother relocated from their native land to a novel place where everything diverged. She encountered great difficulty in acclimating to this new environment, and Saeng failed a significant test. This setback deeply disheartened her, and she sought to reminisce about her homeland. She bought the winter hibiscus to evoke memories of home, but while planting it, she became resolutely determined to endeavor to adapt by taking the test when the hibiscus would bud. The author concludes the story by suggesting that there is hope and determination for Saeng to adapt to her new abode.
111	8973	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it conveys the inspiring message that Saeng will be capable of surmounting the challenges of residing in an unfamiliar nation. Firstly, the @CAPS1 geese symbolize an aspect of her new abode since she “reluctantly” reasons that they are now familiar to her. This portrays her aptitude to acclimate to her novel environment. Additionally, she also associates spring with the budding of the hibiscus, and the hibiscus serves as a symbol of herself as both are endeavoring to thrive in a country that is not their native land. Hence, the budding of the hibiscus represents her ability to dwell comfortably in @LOCATION1. Finally, she pledges that she will retake her driver's test. Her initial failure to pass the test indicated her inability to integrate into @LOCATION1, but if she passes it, then she will have successfully adapted. Overall, the author of this story concludes with this paragraph because it encapsulates the theme of the passage through an uplifting message.
112	8974	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the conclusion incorporates the budding of the hibiscus and the retaking of the test to establish a connection between the two. The geese are also included at the end to signify the new country to which she has adapted, as she discerns the comings and goings of the geese. The budding of the hibiscus holds far greater significance for her than merely being a flower. It demonstrates the rejuvenation of new life within her, much like how flowers typically bud in spring. This is also the reason why she opts to take the test, as her “budding” will occur in spring, and she will possess newly - born confidence for the impending test. Thus, the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included at the end of the story to illustrate the connection between her former home and her adaptation to a new lifestyle.
113	8975	4	1	She will undertake gardening anew after the return of the geese and the blossoming of the flowers. She aspires to cultivate the most exquisite garden in the vicinity. She desires to perpetuate the tradition.
114	8976	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng did not believe that the winter hibiscus was still in the ground, and when she returned, all of her plants had vanished due to the snow. Consequently, she declared that she would retake the test, signifying that she would recommence from the initial stages with her plants and flowers.
115	8977	4	1	The author concludes, “When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese come back and this hibiscus is in bloom, then I will retake that test,” because Saeng is not ready to surrender yet. In the story, Saeng murmured, “I mean, not like the kind at - at - ” She discovered that she was still too tremulous to utter the words at home. Saeng remained disheartened as she yearned for her homeland in Vietnam. When Saeng plants the hibiscus in the ground, she feels more invigorated, and she wishes to feel at home in the United States. Saeng is not going to abandon her pursuit of driving; instead, she will strive more and more diligently to pass the test.
116	8978	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it pertains to her thoughts. When her semblance of welcome warmed Saeng, “cheerfully she skipped over to say ‘you're back!’” @CAPS1 It's long past time. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you? She feels a strong connection to it as it relates to her emotions.
117	8979	4	1	“When they returned, Saeng privately vowed to herself that in the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese reappear and this hibiscus begins to bud, then she would retake that test. The story “Winter Hibiscus” concluded with this paragraph because it symbolizes a new beginning for Saeng. Spring will arrive, and the geese will return to the place where she currently resides, which now has the hibiscus to evoke memories of her former home. This paragraph also draws a parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus. In the story, her mother remarks, “I've witnessed this kind blooming beside the lake. Its flowers may not be as beautiful, but it is resilient enough to endure the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what counts.” Saeng is like the winter hibiscus, strong enough to survive winter, and failing the test will be insignificant until spring when she will take it and succeed. This is represented when the hibiscus is in full bloom. I also believe the story ended in this manner because it weaves together Saeng's emotions throughout the narrative regarding her new and old homes. It also showcases her capacity to overcome challenges. She will put aside the memory of failing the driving test and strive to pass it in the spring.
118	8980	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because the hibiscus empowers them to surmount obstacles. She desired to retake the test to demonstrate to her mother that she could pass it. Additionally, I opine that the hibiscus bestows strength upon her, and she gained greater self - confidence to pass the test.
119	8981	4	1	The author opted to conclude the story in this fashion for multiple reasons. Firstly, it instills a sense of hope in the reader, conveys the message that there is always a second opportunity, and emphasizes the significance of perseverance. The concluding paragraph evokes hope as it depicts how everything will recur and that another chance will present itself. The author included this in the text as it creates an upbeat tone to end on and imparts a sense of happiness to the reader, knowing that there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it communicates to the reader that one always gets another chance regardless of one's actions. The author intended to convey this lesson to the reader as it is a crucial one to learn. The ending also illustrates to the reader that perseverance is of utmost importance in life and is nearly indispensable for survival. The author demonstrates this by discussing the melting snow, the returning geese, and the blooming flower, which are phenomena that occur continuously and rarely cease because they refuse to yield and perish. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The paragraph offers a great deal of hope to the reader and conveys the concept of a second chance. Moreover, it contains several analogies to perseverance, which is vital in life.
120	8982	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as he implies that Saeng prefers to undertake tasks in the spring when she observes flowers blossoming because she feels a sense of home, thereby boosting her confidence in passing the test.
121	8983	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concluded the tale with the quotation ""when they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow dissipates and the geese reappear and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I shall take the test anew."" The author incorporated this passage as the concluding reflection to emphasize that Saeng is resolute in effecting a change. She failed the test yet desires to retake it. Her grandmother's essence is embodied in the flower; thus, if the flower buds, then her grandmother will, in a sense, return. When her grandmother ""returns"", Saeng will feel as though her grandmother is endowing her with the strength and encouragement to attempt the test once more."
122	8984	4	1	The author concludes the story with that passage to illustrate how Saeng, akin to the nascent Hibiscus, will embark on a fresh start in the spring and surmount obstacles.
123	8985	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with, ""when they come back, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" It is posited that the author employed this conclusion to prompt the reader to envision the story's conclusion independently. Alternatively, the author could pen another story to bring it to a close. Many authors conclude their stories in this manner, empowering the reader to determine the ending."
124	8986	4	1	Based on my comprehension of the story, I surmise that the author concludes the narrative with the paragraph to emphasize what will transpire and to engage the reader in contemplation, cultivating excitement and provoking questions and thoughts in the reader's mind after perusing the passage. The intention, in my view, is to captivate the reader's attention, prompting speculation about whether she survives and adapts to a lifestyle to which she is unaccustomed, and to assess her ability to endure different seasons. It also serves to convey that regardless of the challenges one encounters in life, there are always additional obstacles ahead.
125	8987	4	1	The author elected to conclude the story with that paragraph for its emotional connotations. The final paragraph indicates that she will retake the test when the hibiscus blossoms in the spring. She hopes that the blooming hibiscus will imbue her with the strength to pass the test. The hibiscus evokes memories of her homeland and offers her solace. Saeng anticipates that the sight of the blooming hibiscus will remind her of home and endow her with the fortitude to pass the test.
126	8988	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner as the arrival and departure of the geese symbolize transformation for Saeng. The hibiscus differs from what she recalls of her homeland. The blossoming of the hibiscus reflects Saeng's contentment associated with home. This passage demonstrates that the familiarity of the budding plant endows Saeng with the fortitude and capability to surmount her obstacle. The geese in this passage signify the passage of time. The plant will bloom when the geese return in the spring. Had the author not included this final passage, the full impact of Saeng's memories would not have been comprehensively depicted. This line suggests that Saeng was unable to overcome her obstacle due to the novelty of this place. When the buds evoke a sense of home within her, she will be able to conquer the challenge of her driving test and become more self - assured.
127	8989	4	1	The author incorporates this element to illustrate that she has not relinquished her efforts. Since she persists, she can undertake additional attempts.
128	8990	4	1	"There exist numerous reasons why the author opted to conclude the story with Saeng pledging to retake the driver's test. Initially, the story commences with a melancholic and matter - of - fact tone, as evidenced by the quote ""as Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test."" This quote establishes a sorrowful tone because she has failed a crucial test and is walking alone. The glimmer of hope reenters the story when ""She sees a familiar plant."" When she brings the plant she purchased to her mother, a significant moment occurs. ""Where did you get it?"" her mother inquired, and Saeng responded, ""I bought it."" She bought it for @MONEY1 more than what her mother would have paid for all the seeds in the garden. As time elapsed, it became evident to her mother that the plant symbolizes strength and hope for her daughter. I recall a time when my mother bought me a decorative candle. Initially, I considered it a waste of money, but when I witnessed her delight in it, I grew fond of it too. When Saeng's mother realized that the plant brought Saeng happiness and instilled courage in her, it became clear why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again."
129	8991	4	1	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph as it extends the narrative and provides a satisfying denouement. However, I am uncertain of its meaning, and I believe the author should offer an explanation rather than leaving it to the readers to decipher.
130	8992	4	1	The author concluded the story with this paragraph as @CAPS1 aimed to inform the readers about what transpired after the story concluded. @CAPS1 also endeavored to make the post - story events lucid, which is why I believe @CAPS1 conceived the idea of concluding with that paragraph.
131	8993	4	1	The author concludes this paragraph as Saeng intends to await the conclusion of winter to embark upon a fresh start. She desires to make another attempt since her previous endeavor resulted in the tilling of the plants. Saeng aspires to become a gardener akin to her mother.
132	8994	4	1	The author of this essay incorporates those sentences as the conclusion to convey that she will come to the realization that they are returning.
133	8995	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow…” to illustrate that Saeng has grown stronger. She has strengthened because she has adapted to her new residence and surroundings. Saeng is more self - assured to retake the test. She does not wish to shed tears as she did during her last examination. Her enhanced confidence and better adaptation are the reasons for her newfound strength, and her new strength is the impetus for her desire to retake the test.
134	8996	4	1	Confidence, perseverance, memories – all attributes that Saeng possesses – elucidate why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Since Saeng relocated from her native country, she has been rather despondent, remaining dejected throughout and longing for everyone and everything from Vietnam; every sight she encounters reminds her of it. The final paragraph, stating, “then I will take that test again,” demonstrates her self - confidence and her resolve to exert greater effort in the future. Her perseverance is evident when she declares her intention to try again and hopefully not abandon the attempt. Saeng yearns for almost everything from Vietnam, including the cuisine. She also misses her family, their appearance, and attire. Her memories likely hindered her from focusing intently on her driver's test. Knowing she wished to perform well, she purchased the flower in the hope of alleviating her distress. It is hoped that Saeng's life will improve in the United States, and she will learn to cherish this country.
135	8997	4	1	The blossoming of the hibiscus plant heralds new hope. In the story, the young girl perceives the hibiscus as emblematic of her former life, and the budding of the plant initiates a new chapter in her existence.
136	8998	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as he endeavors to substantiate his stance. I believe that Saeng was likening herself to the flower. For instance, the flower was initially a wildflower and subsequently was planted in a pot. Saeng was a care - free and joyous girl, yet then she had to relocate to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng sense that they are out of their element. Since in the story Saeng bears resemblance to the flower, then at the story's conclusion, I opine that Saeng believes if the flower can endure the winter, then she can withstand @LOCATION1 and pass the test. This is the rationale behind my belief that the author ended with that paragraph to convey his message.
137	8999	4	1	The rationale for the author's conclusion of the story in such a manner is that he or she aims to demonstrate Saeng's resolve not to fail the driver's test. The author intends to leave Saeng on a positive note so that she will not be despondent. When she retakes the test, she will be better prepared and cognizant of what to anticipate. She will experience a more favorable winter.
138	9000	4	1	I posit that the author concludes the story as he or she does to impart a moral. Irrespective of what obstacles lie in your path or what impediments slow you down, never abandon your efforts. You ought to persevere. If you fail at something, persistently attempt it until you achieve success.
139	9001	4	1	@CAPS2, recollections, arduous @CAPS1 – all serve as explanations for why the author concludes the story with “When They come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take the test again.” Firstly, @CAPS2 because she initially failed her test, thus it requires courage and willpower to return and even attempt it anew. Additionally, since memories of her grandmother distress her, it undoubtedly demands @CAPS2 and human determination to take the test a second time. Secondly, recollections. I @CAPS4 that she persists in wanting to take this test because she has amassed numerous pleasant memories with her grandmother and does not wish to ever forget them. But once again, it reverts to the willpower or the inclination to return and take the test a second time. Lastly, all the arduous @CAPS1. All the arduous @CAPS1 because she comprehends what her grandmother meant to her, and through all the trials or arduous @CAPS1 that her grandmother endured, she witnessed and desires to honor and appreciate all that her grandmother did for her. These are the reasons that @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the author concluded with that paragraph rather than another.
140	9002	4	1	The author incorporates the final paragraph to illustrate that she still harbors hope. It is the last sentence because @CAPS1 Fong Ho wishes to show that when all appears lost and you reach the end of your tether, you can always hold out hope for a better outcome. When spring arrives, so will a new beginning, not only for Saeng's plant but also for her life in a foreign country.
141	9003	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” opted to conclude the narrative with that paragraph to fortify the story's theme and conclude on an optimistic note. The overarching theme of the story revolves around acclimating to novel circumstances and capitalizing on every change. The statement “Saeng vowed silently to herself” indicates to the audience that Saeng is exerting efforts to integrate and discover the positives in her new life. The optimistic tone established serves as a means to demonstrate that Saeng is willing to embrace life's changes and endeavors to surmount obstacles. She declares, “I will take that test again.” The test symbolizes the hurdles she will overcome when efforts are applied. The hibiscus in the sentence “...when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” represents a fresh start. The budding hibiscus is likened to Saeng, who has a new beginning and the determination to achieve her goal of adapting to a new lifestyle. The author selected this paragraph to conclude the selection in order to emphasize the theme and symbolize a new start.
142	9004	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with that statement as it enables the audience to draw parallels between Saeng and the hibiscus. After perusing that statement, I discerned that Saeng and the hibiscus share similarities, as both are destined to persevere and emerge victorious (Saeng obtaining her license and the hibiscus blossoming). The author might have ended the story with that statement because it showcases Saeng's commitment to pursuing her goal and her refusal to abandon it. “Saeng vowed silently to herself, ‘I will take that test again’.” Ultimately, I believe the author concluded the story with that statement as it offers the audience the gratification of knowing Saeng's future while leaving a modicum of mystery for them to interpret as they wish. For instance, I am aware that Saeng will retake the test, and I am confident she will pass it; conversely, another reader might opine that she failed again and had to retake it.
143	9005	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to allow the reader to draw comparisons between the girl, the geese, and the hibiscus. The geese migrate during winter and return in spring, and they also illustrate how the girl will return to take the driver's test again in spring. The hibiscus withers during winter and begins to bud anew in spring, indicating that winter is its vulnerability. Similar to the hibiscus, the girl overcomes her weakness of being unable to drive by recalling her homeland. The author places this paragraph at the story's conclusion so that the reader can recognize the resemblance between the girl, the geese, and the hibiscus.
144	9006	4	1	I posit that the author concluded the story with that phrase because it depicts her maturation. She acknowledges that she was ill - prepared for the challenges that awaited her. For example, she failed her test, yet instead of lamenting, she simply stated, “I will take it again next year.” In the story, she also yearned for her homeland, which she genuinely missed. She coped with this longing by purchasing a winter hibiscus, which served not only as a reminder of her homeland but also of her grandmother. Overall, the main character demonstrated depth and maturity throughout the narrative.
145	9007	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner as it showcases Saeng's readiness to adapt to her environment, much like the hibiscus. Saeng must adapt to her new abode in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus must adapt to the approaching winter. Saeng vows to herself, “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” From this, one can infer that Saeng harbors hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was extremely hesitant to accept her new home. She remarks about the hibiscus, “it's not like the kind we had before.” However, she realized that the hibiscus could serve as a reminder of home and an impetus to change for her new dwelling. She understood that if the hibiscus could endure the winter, she could endure living in a new place.
146	9008	4	1	The author concludes the narrative by highlighting Saeng's vow to herself to retake the test upon the arrival of spring. Saeng struggles to acclimate to her new abode and refuses to abandon her efforts to integrate after a single setback. The painful contemplation of her homeland and the realization that she can never return haunt Saeng, yet memories of it assist her in coming to terms with her loss. The hibiscus and other familiar flora offer her solace, as they evoke recollections of home. When spring arrives, with the return of the geese and the blossoming of the hibiscus, Saeng will feel re - energized to take the test. Spring symbolizes an opportunity for a fresh attempt and a new start.
147	9009	4	1	The author concludes the story with the final paragraph, a choice made because the sentence reveals that Saeng will retake the test. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng informs her mother of her test failure. By the time spring arrives, the hibiscus will begin to bud, and Saeng will attempt the test once more. Additionally, the geese temporarily left their habitat due to snow. Saeng draws a parallel between herself and the geese as she yearns for her homeland. Just as the geese will return when the time is opportune, this is the conclusion the author reaches in the story's paragraph.
148	9010	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant symbolizes tenacity in surviving. In essence, the hibiscus bestows good fortune upon Saeng for her subsequent driving test after the winter season, when the hibiscus is in the budding stage. Moreover, the author concludes the sentence to disclose Saeng's future plans.
149	9011	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for multiple reasons. This passage demonstrates that Saeng will not capitulate; instead, she will await the next opportunity to take the test. It also implies that she will be thoroughly prepared and will possess a substantial amount of confidence in passing the test. It conveys to the reader that Saeng will persevere and complete the test. Her mother will be proud of her achievements, and it showcases Saeng's unwavering determination. Just as she declared, “Let's plant it, right now,” this instance illustrates that despite failing the test and disappointing her mother, Saeng will never surrender and retains hope in the plant, mirroring her mother's hope for her.
150	9012	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it delves into Saeng's silent vow, which stems from her reflections on past experiences with her mother and the plants in her garden. Saeng contemplates the state of affairs when spring returns, when the snow melts, the geese come back, and she will retake the test. This is what she silently vowed to herself. This is how I believe the author concludes the story with the inclusion of this paragraph.
151	9013	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph. This story revolves around @PERSON1, a young girl, and her mother. The girl is provided with funds to purchase plant seeds. She expends @MONEY1 on this plant. Her mother becomes perturbed, yet everything unfolds in an unexpected way, like having egg omelets with melon bits.
152	9014	4	1	The author concludes this narrative with this paragraph as she intends to demonstrate that after all that transpired, Saeng will persevere and strive diligently. For instance, when she stated, “When they return in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese come back and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test.” By ending the story thus, it leaves the reader in a state of suspense as they are uncertain if the geese will return. The author appears to be showing the reader that Saeng is beginning to acclimate to her new country and make it reminiscent of her old one. For example, when the mother said, “I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as lovely, but it's resilient enough to endure the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This indicates that they desire their new country to be more like their old one, and when it is, she will be content. Therefore, the author concludes this story with this paragraph to illustrate how she will adapt to the change in her environment.
153	9015	4	1	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she is eager for spring as her plant will blossom, which will re - evoke memories of her homeland. She anticipates taking the test in spring as she would have been able to remain and @MONTH1 pass the test then, since she failed it on her initial attempt. Perhaps she concluded the story with this paragraph because she @MONTH1 has an affinity for spring and can scarcely wait for its arrival.
154	9016	4	1	I am of the opinion that there is a significant rationale behind the author's choice to conclude the story with this paragraph. I surmise that the author will feel more at ease and prepared to take the test. I arrived at this conclusion because by waiting for winter to end to retake the test, she is allowing herself time for preparation. Additionally, she is awaiting the hibiscus plant to bud. What I can infer from her desire to wait for the hibiscus is the sense of comfort it brings. The entire story centers on how Saeng was able to console herself by recalling her past experiences in Vietnam. When she perceives that an important aspect of her life is returning, she can attain a state of comfort and concentration. I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wishes to emphasize the significance of this flower in relation to how Saeng lives her life.
155	9017	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey her sense of hope. She is convinced that she can pass the test when everything reverts to normal, in the spring. In spring, the geese will return and the hibiscus will be in bloom. This makes her feel more at ease in her new surroundings as it was always this way prior to her relocation. Moreover, she has an affection for the geese and the hibiscus, and these elements might render her more comfortable. This is the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to showcase her hope.
156	9018	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with this paragraph as they aimed to draw a comparison between Saeng's life and that of the plant. For instance, within the story, Saeng had just failed her driving examination, after which she spotted a plant that reminded her of her homeland. From the floral shop to her residence, she was equating her native land to the flower, which illustrates how she forms a connection with it. Thus, the concluding paragraph demonstrates that when the hibiscus begins to bud and enters a new stage, she too will embark on a new phase and pursue her driver's license.
157	9019	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve to adapt to the transformations in her life. In the story, Saeng fails her driver's test and struggles to acclimate to her new life in @LOCATION1. Nevertheless, upon observing that the hibiscus and geese are familiar, she becomes determined to adapt as well. Saeng purchases a hibiscus as it evokes memories of her homeland. This not only soothes her but also intensifies her longing for her former home. The hibiscus can thrive in both @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1, which aids Saeng in realizing that she can do the same. The author incorporates the geese because they assist Saeng in recognizing that she is growing more accustomed to things in the United States, enabling her to continue adapting. Saeng remarks that she now identifies the “V” formation of the geese. Realizing that she is becoming more attuned to @LOCATION1 and capable of survival bolsters her determination to retake and pass her driving test. The author includes this to encapsulate the story's theme of adapting to change.
158	9020	4	1	I surmise that the author included that sentence to establish a more intimate connection with the character, thereby enabling the reader to empathize with that individual.
159	9021	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to underscore the significance of new beginnings and to emphasize the theme within the story. The theme posits that one must surmount hardships and pursue new beginnings. Springtime serves as a symbol of a fresh start. Hence, the onset of spring will afford her the opportunity to commence anew with the driver's test. Additionally, the author employs the paragraph to showcase the symbolic attributes of everyday objects. Just as the hibiscus evokes memories of her home life, the geese will remind her of springtime.
160	9022	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author Minfong Ho concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it serves as a means of conveying that Saeng will put behind the past incident of failing her test and strive for better results the next time. It is as though the author is suggesting that she will undergo a rebirth, much like the hibiscus when spring arrives. Throughout the story, Saeng had to adjust, just as the hibiscus did. The hibiscus inspired Saeng to excel in her current circumstances. Therefore, after learning from the hibiscus, it marks a new beginning for Saeng.
161	9023	4	1	It serves as a thematic underpinning for the narrative. The hibiscus plants instill in her the motivation to undertake various endeavors. Presumably, it evokes recollections of her homeland, thereby inspiring her to venture into novel experiences. This holds significance within the story as it illustrates the profound importance of the hibiscus to Saeng.
162	9024	4	1	I surmise that the author opted to conclude the story in this manner to depict the girl reflecting upon her past and attaining a state of tranquility. In the presence of the flower, she experiences a sense of serenity. The writer intends to convey that regardless of one's accustomed circumstances, one can discover elements that bring about happiness and a sense of concentration.
163	9025	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the protagonist is resolute in passing that test and will not desist until she achieves success.
164	9026	4	1	The rationale behind my belief that the author ended the story with this paragraph is that she is demonstrating how the character has undergone maturation and development within her circumstances. This exemplifies that a single failure does not predestine subsequent failures. Moreover, it is acceptable to feel out of place, as there will invariably be moments in life when a new chapter commences. Thus, it is one's prerogative to seize the opportunity or remain entrenched in one's ways, but the decision ultimately lies with the individual.
165	9027	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the tale by stating, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ‘I—I failed the test.’” Similar to numerous children, Saeng failed her driving test and is deeply distraught about it. No one desires to fail at a task, and failing a test can be an acutely humiliating experience, especially when aware that others have already succeeded. The quote in the introductory paragraph, or the one in the question, is employed as a symbol. When the geese migrate back north, it symbolizes their readiness to “commence anew” or “make another attempt.” When the hibiscus begins to bud, it represents the initiation of a new life cycle. Observing these natural phenomena repeating their cycles empowers Saeng to strive for success and persevere. She realizes that failure is an inherent part of life and that success often follows failure. Minfong concludes with this quote because she comprehends that regardless of the challenges one encounters, one must persevere and continue to strive in order to achieve success. She recognizes that success is the result of hard work and commitment, and it is these qualities that forge a remarkable and resilient individual.
166	9028	4	1	The rationale behind the author concluding the paragraph with that particular sentence is to convey to the reader that the situation is not concluded. The author intends for the reader to understand that @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget, and that all these events are bound to recur.
167	9029	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the statement “I will take that test again,” signifying that the challenges she is currently facing will resurface, yet next time she will be better prepared. Saeng endures great difficulty when relocating to another country and acclimating to the new environment. Her mother offers support as she navigates through the winter. The hibiscus she purchased serves as a symbol representing more than itself. In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus,” this hibiscus was bought during her most trying times. She persevered through the winter with the hibiscus, and in the story's final paragraph, she expresses, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” She is envisioning the future and how she “Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring.” She eagerly anticipates the end of winter and awaits the arrival of spring.
168	9030	4	1	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to inform us of her actions upon her return in the spring. This implies that once she returns, she will engage in the care of the plants. When she returns, she hopes for the snow to melt and for all to be well. This is the message the author conveys through the story.
169	9031	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with the paragraph to reassure the reader that she will return. Additionally, the author chooses this way of ending the story to illustrate that regardless of one's life journey, there will always be someone or something to provide assurance. The author also aims to evoke in the reader a sense of kinship with the character, suggesting that no matter how out of place one may feel, there is always something relatable.
170	9032	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to entice us to purchase his upcoming book or to heighten our excitement.
171	9033	4	1	"In this narrative, the author decides to conclude the story with the following paragraph: ""When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows dissolve and the geese reappear and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will undertake that test again."" This is because she desires to take the test when everything is serene; for example, she wishes for all the elements she adores in her surroundings, such as the flowers, the geese, and the weather. Another reason the author ends the story with this paragraph is that she yearns for an environment akin to the one in her homeland. For instance, there was no snow, and it was like springtime throughout the year. This is why the author chose to end the story with that particular paragraph."
172	9034	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that she finds solace in the recollections of her native land and truly appreciates the allure of tropical flora. She posits that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not in bloom, she cannot pass the test until it does. ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had previously contemplated had, through the unceasing recurrence of seasons upon seasons, become nearly familiar to her."" This demonstrates her profound belief in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants, as she reflects on other instances when things were peculiar during winter and more favorable in spring and other seasons when the plants are budding. Hence, she believes she will indeed pass the driver's test when she feels at ease, when the plants have blossomed."
173	9035	4	1	The southward migration of geese during winter and the budding of hibiscus are familiar phenomena to Saeng. The author chose to conclude the story in this manner to convey that Saeng derived comfort from the things to which she was accustomed. Saeng desired the presence of geese and hibiscus to feel more at ease while taking her driving test. Saeng still yearns for her homeland and does not fully feel as though she belongs in the United States. The hibiscus evokes a sense of comfort, making her feel as if she has returned home to Vietnam. Saeng remains homesick because she longs for things to revert to their former state. The plants in the greenhouse, coupled with the disappointment of failing her driving test, have led her to the emotional state she is in. In the penultimate paragraph, the author discusses the sense of repetition Saeng experiences when observing the V - formation. Saeng perceives that in winter, she will not have the same comforting feeling as when she can behold the hibiscus and the geese soaring overhead. It is stated that when Saeng arrived in [LOCATION2], she had nothing that was familiar to her. Now, she derives that feeling from the geese and the plants. The author's conclusion, stating that Saeng will take her driving test when winter ends, is an apt closing as it provides some insight into Saeng's future actions.
174	9036	4	1	"I opine that the author concludes the sentence ""Then they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" because it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese return, it will be spring, and thus it will be time to resume school. I believe this is the underlying reason."
175	9037	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the tale with an unconventional ending. ""When they come back,"" Saeng silently vowed to herself, ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Beyond the literal meaning, the author is demonstrating how Saeng is acclimating to the new country. By failing her driver's test, she also failed in adapting to and accepting the new nation. By vowing to try again, it also reveals her willingness to give the country another opportunity. ""She found she was still too tremulous to utter the words at home."" I believe this indicates that she still did not regard this country as her home; she remained ensnared in her past. In essence, the author's choice of ending effectively portrays Saeng's ongoing struggle with identity and her tentative steps towards acceptance."
176	9038	4	1	The author concludes this narrative within the paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng will not desist merely because she failed on her initial attempt. It further indicates that she will not allow certain circumstances to subdue her.
177	9039	4	1	The final sentence of a narrative typically holds the greatest significance. I am of the opinion that the author concluded the story in this manner for multiple reasons. For instance, I surmise that the author did so to instill in the reader a profound sense of resolve. The story quotes, “I will take that test again.” Through the utilization of the word “will,” the author showcases the girl's determination. She did not state that she would endeavor to; she affirmed that she will, without a shadow of a doubt. I also believe that the author ended the story in this way to accentuate the theme of new beginnings. The story quotes, “when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again.” This illustrates that in spring, the commencement of new life, she will take the test. This is the rationale behind my belief that the author concluded the story in this fashion.
178	9040	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a prudent decision to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This passage intimates to the reader that Saeng intends to amalgamate her new and old lives. Her old life is symbolized by the hibiscus; she is accustomed to the constants from her homeland. The geese represent her new life; they have become “almost familiar to her now.” The impediment she confronts is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new facets of Saeng's life are integrated, Saeng will be capable of surmounting her “obstacle,” and all will be well. With the geese on the ground, Saeng's life will have come full circle.
179	9041	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it is crucial when she states that when the geese return and the hibiscus is in bloom, she declares that she will take that test again, thereby informing the reader of the time when she will retake the test. This is the reason it is included in the story.
180	9042	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I opine that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it emphasizes that Saeng is willing to retake the test when the appropriate time arrives. I also believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the second-to-last paragraph of the story, it states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had regarded as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This sentence reveals to me that Saeng is gradually acclimating to the new place. Additionally, it shows how she is altering her perspective on the plant and the fact that even though it is not the same, it can still hold meaning. Therefore, I believe that the author made a judicious choice in ending the story with this paragraph.
181	9043	4	1	The final paragraph asserts, “In the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test.” I surmise that the author concludes with this paragraph to convey that when her new abode mirrors her former one, she may feel more self - assured and at ease, rather than experiencing the frigid winter, a stark contrast to her previous dwelling. The sensation of her old home within the new one will render her more optimistic and comfortable. Consequently, she will take the test feeling at home and achieve success.
182	9044	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, the author depicts how the girl believes that through her recollections and once she adapts to the new culture, she will muster the courage to retake the test she failed on that day. Saeng yearns deeply for her homeland and fails to recognize the resemblances between her new and old homes. “She realized that many of the things she had once regarded as peculiar had, through the unobtrusive recurrence of seasons, become nearly familiar to her.” Initially reluctant to embrace the relocation, Saeng begins to accumulate new memories while retaining the old ones. At first, everything was vastly different, but now she is starting to recall aspects of her new home, a sign of comfort. “She found that she was still too tremulous to utter the words at home, for fear of breaking into tears again.” Given Saeng's emotional transformation, the concluding paragraph indicates that there is hope for her to move forward in her new home. She is gradually building confidence and knows that once she does, she can take the test and succeed. The author demonstrates that positive change is attainable if one is willing to adapt. Not everything may be as ideal as one anticipates, but courage can forge a happy home filled with both new and old memories, as Saeng realizes in the last paragraph.
183	9045	4	1	The author merely states the evident in this brief story. This excerpt primarily implies that upon the arrival of spring, she will return to the greenhouse or the area teeming with plants. Once there, the girl will endeavor to procure the plant that grows wild in her native country and introduce it to her new home.
184	9046	4	1	The reason the author concludes the story with such a paragraph is, in my view, to portray Saeng as an individual who refuses to capitulate and persists in growth, much like the hibiscus plant. Moreover, as she discerns that most of the things she once deemed strange have, through the silent succession of seasons, become nearly familiar to her. Saeng acknowledges that she will still have the next season when the plant has flourished and the geese form their distinctive V - formation again.
185	9047	4	1	Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's sentiments. In the paragraph, Saeng's statement “I will take that test again” implies whether she will endure the same circumstances. Also @CAPS1.
186	9048	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to demonstrate that a felicitous ending is always attainable. The geese made their return, and the girl exuded contentment as a result.
187	9049	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph since these are all aspects she is not going to abandon. She intends to convey that when everything she has faith in achieves success, that is when she will undertake her driving test. Her mother remarks that the flower will never yield and is robust enough to endure the winter. The geese will invariably return. This is precisely what she will do regarding her test. She will not relinquish the test; instead, she will persist in her efforts until she passes.
188	9050	4	1	Saeng experiences a greater sense of comfort during spring as it evokes memories of her homeland. Presumably, she had never encountered snow or winter previously. Thus, nothing during this season reminds her of home. Conversely, spring does, as the geese return and the hibiscus blossoms anew, rendering everything reminiscent of her home once more. Confidence is what she gains when spring arrives again.
189	9051	4	1	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as it encapsulates all that the hibiscus has bestowed upon Saeng in terms of strength and courage. Similar to the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in this new country, and the hibiscus aids her in recognizing the significance of adapting for her survival to live happily. She cannot perpetually dwell in the past but must learn to appreciate her current abode. Therefore, when the author writes, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it directly symbolizes Saeng blossoming or opening her mind to novel ways, such as learning to drive.
190	9052	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author of “Winter Hibiscus” employed this as the final paragraph because it implies that when she beholds the hibiscus, it will rekindle memories of home, which will offer encouragement for the test. “The geese symbolize Saeng's resolve to pass the test and assimilate into the new country. Saeng explains, “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive silhouette was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.” This quote conjures a vivid image in my mind, indicating that Saeng will truly embark on that test when she receives encouragement not only from the geese but also from the hibiscus.
191	9053	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph as it, in a sense, conveys the message that everything will be well. Saeng intends to retake her driver's test, and all has reverted to the state she most prefers. It instills a sense of hope, suggesting that all will be fine for her. Moreover, it implies that she is about to start making the most of life. I believe this is the reason the author concludes with that paragraph.
192	9054	4	1	The author employs this paragraph to conclude the story as it demonstrates how Saeng desires to acclimate to this country and has already begun to comprehend and appreciate it. When it states “and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it serves as a metaphor for herself, similar to how the hibiscus starts to bloom and thrive, just as she is commencing to blossom and prosper. This is the rationale behind the author ending with this passage.
193	9055	4	1	Saeng declared that once the tree she purchased begins to bud, she will retake the test. Her statement implies that without that plant, she lacks the inclination to take the test. The reason is that the plant has accompanied her throughout her life. She also believes that she is unable to undertake the test without that plant. Saeng means that since she has had such a plant throughout her life, she perceives it as a necessity, though I opine that she does not truly require it. I surmise that it merely “soothes” her.
194	9056	4	1	The author did not consider Saeng prepared to take the test until she had a more comprehensive understanding of it. Saeng was preoccupied with gardening as she had no friends at school and was reluctant to go there as she would have no one to converse with. It is fortunate that Saeng made a vow because she would never discover whether she would perform well or poorly. Consequently, the author realized that Saeng would take the test and succeed.
195	9057	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph primarily because she wishes to accentuate her recollections of her homeland by stating that she will retake the driving test the following spring. This is because she is aware that as soon as spring returns, a multitude of memories will resurface. During spring, animals emerge, and trees bloom, rendering it an ideal time for her to retake the test, bolstered by the memories of her country.
196	9058	4	1	After perusing the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative in a distinctive manner that showcases a tenacity for survival. For instance, within the text, the author delineates how the plant “dok faeng - noi” has acclimated to its frigid environment, differing from those in its native habitat. This exemplifies the concept of survival by virtue of the fact that in the past, this plant migrated to a locale that initially seemed temperate. However, when confronted with cold conditions, it discovered ways to transform itself and adapt, all driven by the instinct to endure. Another illustration in the text is the protagonist Saeng resolving to herself that come spring, she will endeavor to retake the test. This manifests the will to survive because upon failing the test, Saeng experienced a profound sense of melancholy and defeat. The fact that she summoned the courage to prepare for the test in spring indicates how, as a human being, she yearns for life. To thrive in a new country, she must adapt by passing that test to emerge as a survivor.
197	9059	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to depict the account of snow on the roads. He instructs people on how to be vigilant about their path. In essence, the paragraph reveals that he has persevered through the snowstorm, underscoring the ability to overcome challenging circumstances and reach a point of safety and resolution.
198	9060	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng pledges to herself that in spring, when the snow dissipates, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to blossom, she will retake the test. The author concludes with this paragraph as the hibiscus provides her with solace reminiscent of home and bolsters her confidence. The quote “Almost familiar to her now” from the story indicates that things are gradually falling into place, and she is starting to find comfort as it makes her realize that her current abode can bear resemblance to her former home. The presence of the hibiscus evokes memories of the flowers they once had in their previous residence. Both the mother and the daughter cherish the flower they discovered as it bears similarity to what they had back home. For example, in the story, the mother remarks, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to endure the cold months here.” This demonstrates their appreciation for its resemblance to the old hibiscus. In conclusion, the author ends the story with that paragraph as it enables readers to comprehend the significance of the girl's recollections of her former dwelling.
199	9061	4	1	The author selects this ending to illustrate that Saeng has not relinquished hope regarding her current mode of living. It demonstrates that despite her deep affection for her hometown and the wealth of memories and emotions associated with it, she took the test and failed, and the pressures of her new environment seemed overwhelming. Although she has not fully assimilated, she will exert her utmost effort to surmount the challenges that come her way. Ending the story in this manner instills hope in the reader, rather than leaving them with the impression that she merely purchased a flower after failing a test and moved on. For example, upon failing the test, Saeng appeared distraught and enraged. “I - I failed the test,” Saeng uttered. For a protracted moment, Mrs. Panouvong remained silent. Saeng dared not meet her mother's gaze. Instead, she fixated on the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it into pieces. It enraged Saeng that she had to forsake her idyllic past for a life that was unfamiliar and arduous. When confronted with adversity, extreme emotional reactions ensue. Saeng merely required hope, and the author chose this ending to convey to the reader that there is a glimmer of hope.
200	9062	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author Minfong Ho concludes the narrative as she does for a multitude of reasons. These reasons likely encompass the desire to convey themes of resilience, adaptation, and the power of hope. By ending the story in a particular way, she allows readers to reflect on the journey of the characters and the lessons they have learned, ultimately leaving a lasting impression on the audience's understanding of the story's core messages.
201	9063	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it comprehensively encapsulates and consolidates the entire story. It elucidates that she anticipates the spring season when the hibiscus blossoms.
202	9064	4	1	"The rationale behind her concluding the story with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take them again"" is that she is positing that the birds have a perpetual habitat, and the plant can thrive here regardless of circumstances. She implies that she too can persevere if she makes an effort. Thus, she will await the return of the birds and the budding of the plant in her new abode, at which point everything will be in order, and she will be capable of taking the test as she comprehends and believes she will feel more secure and significantly better."
203	9065	4	1	The story concludes in this manner for several reasons. Firstly, the author ends the story to prompt readers to contemplate the potential events in a sequel. Secondly, it paves the way for the creation of a second part. This is the reason why the story concludes in such a fashion.
204	9066	4	1	She made this vow because just as the geese are certain to return, so shall she. Moreover, just as they subject themselves to the rigors of learning and growth, she too will do the same. Furthermore, having endured the trials of love, survival, and family tradition, she will recognize that her return is predestined. For instance, the geese come to rear their young for the arduous journey ahead and to help them realize that they will always return as their lives originated there and to evade the harsh winter and the threat of mankind that endangers their existence. The winter months are extremely severe, so they understand the necessity of leaving for self - preservation. She gleans the lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival.
205	9067	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as he made a commitment to himself to retake the test. He likely uttered this because there is always an opportunity for a subsequent attempt at everything. Primarily, he said it to remind himself that there is always another chance for every endeavor. Finally, it is essential that most people understand that everyone deserves a second opportunity.
206	9068	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner as the seasons are transitioning, completing their cycle and commencing a new one. Consequently, I opine that this is an excellent approach to conclude a story of this nature, as it effectively establishes a mood and atmosphere at the story's denouement.
207	9069	4	1	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph as it conveys the story's theme of adapting to life's changes. Numerous aspects have transformed for Saeng, and she has yet to fully acclimate to the new way of life. Nevertheless, she learns that she must be resolute in adapting and surviving, much like the hibiscus. The text states, “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding.” The hibiscus teaches Saeng never to surrender, just as the hibiscus endures and survives through the winter. She learns to be determined, and despite failing the test initially, her memories have assisted her, and she intends to attempt it again. These concepts are present in the last paragraph as they encapsulate the idea of persevering even when one feels out of place. She has gradually become accustomed to this new location and now recognizes the seasons as she contemplates this final thought.
208	9070	4	1	To establish a tone and discuss their appearance, that brief paragraph can also initiate another book or inspire one to engage in the study of various subjects. It can also draw parallels between one's life and that of the geese, elucidating the hardships one has endured.
209	9071	4	1	The author opts to conclude this story in this fashion for multiple reasons. Throughout the narrative, the author provides subtle indications of Saeng's homesickness. He correlates this with the flower's resilience to survive the winter months, implying that she, too, will persevere. Although the flower differs from the ones she had at home, change is inescapable, and at the very least, she can cling to that. Therefore, I believe the author decides to end the story in this way to convey that, just like the plant, she will survive and endeavor to adapt in the spring, similar to her approach to the driving test.
210	9072	4	1	The author concluded in that manner because he was the one who evaluated the lines beneath what you write. Evaluating to a higher standard and with greater precision. Amidst all the circumstances, he was surprised to be pleasantly separated by the outcome. Thus, it bestows one with a heightened sense of determination to persevere until the author's conclusion.
211	9073	4	1	"I am convinced that the author incorporated this paragraph to demonstrate that she did not capitulate, to illustrate that she persevered after experiencing failure. Saeng informed her mother, ""I failed the test."" Additionally, it was intended to convey her pride and elation at the prospect of retaking the test. I, too, have encountered test failures. I also declared that I would retake them, yet I did not follow through. Hence, the author included this to showcase her unwavering determination."
212	9074	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it enables the reader to recognize that there remains a possibility for Saeng; she is not relinquishing hope in herself or the test. During the reading, one will discover that Saeng finds solace in recollections of her native land, and evidently, this relocation to another country posed significant challenges for her. In the story, the author writes, ""It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had anticipated it would feel."" The tactile sensation and fragrance of the hibiscus flower provided her with comfort. Subsequently, she went on to purchase the plant, as she had failed the test and required something to rejuvenate her spirits once more. The author chose to conclude the story with Saeng stating that once ""this hibiscus plant is budding, then I will take that test again"" because, as the reader should have discerned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the sole positive element in her life since the move. It is instilling in her the motivation to retake the driver's test, and it also conveys to the reader that Saeng is not giving up."
213	9075	4	1	"Minfong Ho concluded the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a powerful paragraph to showcase Saeng's passion and resolve in her new abode to complete the test. When the closing sentences assert that Saeng ""vowed"" to pass the test, it reveals her tenacity to persevere. This determination may stem from memories of her grandmother and the flowers that vividly reminded her of her former home. Saeng's courage to confront her homesickness serves as the foundation of the story, and by ending it with such a bold assertion, Minfong Ho transforms this seemingly melancholic tale into a narrative of willpower and the drive to pass her test. ""Winter Hibiscus"" is a passage replete with heartache, despair, and a longing for a bygone life. By concluding the story with the uplifting promise from Saeng, Minfong Ho imparts a happy ending to what could have been a sorrowful tale."
214	9076	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because the season is drawing to a close, and concurrently, the narrative is reaching its denouement. This conclusion effectively aligns the end of the story with the natural progression of the season, creating a sense of closure and finality.
215	9077	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this particular type of paragraph because the author is aware that it is bound to recur. I am cognizant of this because in that paragraph, it states, ""In the spring... I will take this test again."" She is merely preparing herself for the upcoming year. This is the rationale behind my belief that this paragraph concluded the story, as it foreshadows future events and provides a sense of continuity and purpose."
216	9078	4	1	After dinner, Saeng ruminated upon the test. She was cognizant that she could perform far better than previously. Consequently, she made a solemn oath to herself, declaring that once winter finally receded and spring commenced, she would retake the test, and this time, she would triumph resoundingly.
217	9079	4	1	Saeng desires to retake the test when the outdoors are resplendent and the hibiscus is in bud. The plant symbolizes the glorious feat of passing the test. It will aid her in surmounting the test by being robust, resilient, and exquisitely formed. These attributes mirror both the girl and the flower. The day was propitious, and she wishes to take the test on that very day. The plant was sturdy and unyielding. This reflects the girl during the time she failed. She informed her mother, who was highly empathetic. The plant represents all that is beautiful, as do the geese. The girl yearns to achieve success at that particular time of day and believes she will succeed next time. Upon completing and passing her test, she wishes to return home to the idyllic surroundings to commemorate that day. The author concluded with that statement to underscore the significance of the plant and the environment when she aims to pass the test.
218	9080	4	1	"The author may have concluded the narrative with that paragraph as she sought to remind the reader of the profound sincerity with which ""Saeng"" regarded the hibiscus flower. I posit this because throughout the story, @PERSON1 exhibited great empathy towards the flower. I surmise that she felt a deep connection to the flower."
219	9081	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it symbolizes a new beginning. Saeng states, “I – I failed the test.” She is also profoundly despondent; she is making a commitment to embark on a fresh start in life, much like the world does every spring. The theme of the story is that when life becomes arduous, one should adopt a novel approach. She intends to retake the driver's test.
220	9082	4	1	The author concludes the story with this passage to illustrate that Saeng will be prepared to take the test in due course. First, she must mature and acclimate to the new environment, just as the hibiscus flower and the geese do. The hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside the store. The geese are adapting to the environment by migrating south for the winter. Saeng still needs to acquire more knowledge and adjust before she can pass her driver's test. By ending the story with this paragraph, it demonstrates that Saeng has realized what she must do. She needs to cease dwelling on her former home and initiate her new life in a foreign country.
221	9083	4	1	"Minfong Ho concluded her narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" with an optimistic statement. She chose this ending as the protagonist of the story was on the verge of losing hope. Saeng resolved to retake the driving examination when her hibiscus flower was in bloom. This flower evokes memories of her former life in Vietnam with her grandmother. ""Saeng could almost sense the delicate strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly cleansed, as she combed it with the fine - toothed buffalo - horn comb"". She preferred her life in Vietnam to her life in @LOCATION2. She intended to wait until ""this hibiscus is budding"" so that she could feel more at ease and content. The author aimed to end the story in this manner to ensure Saeng's happiness."
222	9084	4	1	"The author concluded the story in that way because she was despondent and sought to instill hope in the readers, emphasizing that one should never abandon any pursuit and should consistently persevere. Moreover, it concludes on a positive note; if it had ended with ""I stayed up in my @CAPS1 crying"", it would not have been a favorable conclusion. This ending offers hope to the readers and also encourages them to practice. This is because when spring draws to a close, the woman will engage in driving practice so that when she takes the test, she will not fail. Additionally, the girl becomes more cheerful towards the end, which elates the readers. In conclusion, that ending for the story was a judicious choice for multiple reasons, such as making the readers happy, imparting the courage to never give up, and prompting them to practice something if they fail it on the first attempt. It also encourages helping one's mother when she is planting or uprooting plants."
223	9085	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to elaborate on the theme and to foreshadow what the main character will undertake after planting the hibiscus. I opine that the theme of this story is adapting to life's changes, and the author reinforces this theme in the final paragraph. In the concluding paragraph, the author writes, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author showcases how Saeng learns to adapt when circumstances in her life transform. In this case, Saeng fails her driver's test, and to cope with this setback, she purchases a hibiscus to remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for the test once the geese... (THIS @CAPS1 IS @CAPS2)."
224	9086	4	1	She ensured that she would not neglect to retake the test.
225	9087	4	1	Saeng did not relinquish her belief in herself. She declared that she would attempt it once more, with the possibility of passing. One does not always succeed on the initial attempt; it sometimes requires time. Saeng inspires others to never abandon their efforts merely because they did not achieve success on the first try. She also cultivates self - confidence. That is the reason why the author concluded the story in such a manner.
226	9088	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a paragraph in which Saeng vows to retake the examination in spring. This is because the author intends to convey that the geese and the hibiscus plant symbolize a form of rebirth or revival for Saeng. The author aims to conclude the story on an optimistic note. Spring is an archetypal season, a period of birth and growth. After Saeng failed the initial test, she encountered the hibiscus, which transported her back to her memories in Vietnam, providing her with comfort. She believes that perhaps when she witnesses the plant thriving and the geese returning, she will experience that same revival once more.
227	9089	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the final paragraph due to Saeng's failure in the test at the story's onset. After interacting with the plants and acquiring new knowledge, it is only natural for Saeng to retake the test in spring, which marks the story's conclusion. This perspective is based on the fact that Saeng learned she must adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The plant reminded her of this when she observed the geese flying in a ""V"" formation, reminiscent of her home in Vietnam. She realized that the situation was similar to that in Vietnam, and to adapt to the changes in @LOCATION1, she must retake the driver's test. Moreover, ending the story with Saeng taking the driver's test in spring is fitting because the geese will return, and the hibiscus will be in bud. This represents a new beginning not only for them but also for Saeng."
228	9090	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng is resolved to make another attempt to obtain a plant that will evoke memories of her grandmother and her former home, where she hopes to return one day in @MONTH1. In this way, she can behold the genuine flower she adores rather than a substitute.
229	9091	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate that Saeng is not succumbing to defeat. Come spring, when she sees the plant, it will trigger recollections of her homeland, alleviating her sense of homesickness. The quote, ""Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world,"" reveals that the sight of familiar plants reminds her of home. Thus, when her plant blossoms in spring, she will find solace and a greater sense of belonging, which will empower her to pass the driving test. Just as the plant flourishes, so does her comfort level."
230	9092	4	1	I surmise that the author was discussing the snow, which had accumulated outdoors. As the situation evolved, the snow began to melt.
231	9093	4	1	He concluded the narrative with that sentence as it indicated that she had gleaned a lesson in life. Throughout her journey back to the place of her origin, she yearned for her friends, I'm certain, and for witnessing her mother tending to the garden during this frigid season. I surmise they are impoverished in a certain sense. In conclusion, he selected this sentence as it appears that she learned a lesson in life and is even commencing anew, yet with a deeper comprehension in her learning.
232	9094	4	1	Saeng utters this in the paragraph as she aspires to render her mother proud of her; thus, she intends to retake the test subsequent to winter.
233	9095	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it exudes greater determination since she adores the hibiscus. What better manner to conclude the story than by having her compare herself to the hibiscus? When she states, “In the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” she implies that the snow is impeding the hibiscus. Hence, the failure is hindering her. So, she will engage in reading to prepare for the arrival of spring when the hibiscus is budding, and then she will also flourish by passing her test.
234	9096	4	1	In the article, the author concludes the story with Saeng pledging to herself that “in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because the spring and the hibiscus evoke memories of her homeland. For instance, in the article, she becomes tremulous as she is unable to utter “home” due to her profound longing for it. Thus, she seeks objects that remind her of it, such as a plant named dok faeng - noi. Although it is not the actual plant, she acquires it to reminisce about her place of origin. In conclusion, Saeng discovers a plant; she cherishes the spring as it reminds her of home. What about you? What evokes memories of your home? Ponder upon it.
235	9097	4	1	The rationale behind the author's choice to conclude this story with this paragraph is to convey to the reader that circumstances improve as time progresses. Saeng failed the driver's test because she was ill - prepared. The flower blossomed prematurely. The author is suggesting that one must exercise patience, and favorable outcomes will present themselves.
236	9098	4	1	"The author elected to conclude the paragraph with the sentence ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" as it demonstrates the correlation between the resilience of the hibiscus and Saeng's fortitude. In the narrative, after failing her driver's test, Saeng sought solace in a hibiscus native to her homeland. When she arrived home, her mother remarked, ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as aesthetically pleasing, but it's robust enough to endure the frigid months here."" This indicates that Saeng is wavering in her new foreign country. The concluding quote encapsulates that Saeng finds strength in the resilience of the flowers, almost contemplating that if a flower can thrive in a land far from its origin, why can't she?"
237	9099	4	1	When she is adequately prepared and in a propitious state, she asserts that she will retake the test. Once she is fully ready, the external environment is conducive, and she has amassed sufficient self - assurance, she will possess the confidence to attempt the test anew. The author endeavors to convey her sentiments regarding disappointing her mother.
238	9100	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it holds significance for the narrative and effectively brings the story to a close. It elucidates that the girl is commencing to acclimate to the new locale and is resolved to make greater efforts to integrate harmoniously. By stating that she will retake the test, it implies that she will approach it from a novel perspective. The author placed this at the end to make sense of the entire narrative and to illustrate the girl's transformation.
239	9101	4	1	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the author surmises that Saeng will be adequately prepared to undertake the test at that specific juncture."
240	9102	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it reveals that she still harbors hope. The hibiscus endows her with hope and fortitude. Come spring, she will retake her test with the aspiration of achieving success. This is the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph.
241	9103	4	1	"In the final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes by stating, ""When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows dissolve and the geese reappear and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test."" I surmise that the author concludes with this quote as it demonstrates her resolve to surmount this obstacle. For Saeng, the hibiscus symbolizes solace and the capacity to overcome. Saeng is remarkably resilient, and she relies on the determination that stems from her past. The author concluded with that because it showcases Saeng's determination."
242	9104	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story in that paragraph to illustrate the profound significance of that flower to Saeng. The text indicates, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng excavated a hole and meticulously lowered the 'winter Hibiscus' into it."" This reveals to the reader that having this plant in her garden holds great meaning for Saeng. Moreover, the concluding statement aids the reader in comprehending her affection for her new country. Additionally, the concluding paragraph conveys comfort during a time of disappointment. In the story, it is stated, ""Its flowers are not as lovely, yet it is robust enough to endure the frigid months here, this winter hibiscus."" This also demonstrates the bond between Saeng and the flower and how it supports her through every circumstance."
243	9105	4	1	I opine that she included this because she requires time to mature, much like the plant, before retaking the test. Occasionally, one needs additional time to pass a test. Navigating through school imparts more than just the knowledge we are required to possess; it facilitates our personal growth and equips us with the ability to understand life. As a tenth - grader, I am aware that I understand life more profoundly than I did in first grade. She still has substantial mental growth to undergo regarding her past and present.
244	9106	4	1	"I am of the belief that the author concluded the story with this line to indicate that hope for the girl still persisted and that perhaps the flower had significantly inspired her. When she says, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" she deliberately selected this time to embark on a new beginning and attempt once more, just as everything else mentioned. When it states, ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" it shows that the flower is blossoming anew, commencing afresh, just as she would strive to do when she endeavors to succeed in passing the test she must pass. Furthermore, the tone in which she uttered this conveyed hope; she was hopeful and determined that she would surely pass the next time."
245	9107	4	1	The author brings the story to a close with this paragraph to convey that while this specific narrative has ended, Saeng's life will persist. The paragraph offers closure to the reader and elucidates that in due course, Saeng will retake the test once she has further assimilated into @LOCATION1 culture.
246	9108	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she desires the protagonist to attain success and engage in virtuous deeds.
247	9109	4	1	In the response elucidating why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, it is because the story pertains to a plant that regrows annually around the same period. The paragraph implies that, in my view, when the plant reappears in spring and the geese return, it represents another test of growth and preventing the plant from withering.
248	9110	4	1	"From the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes this narrative with the paragraph where Saeng silently vows because it serves to demonstrate Saeng's resolve. The hibiscus, the plant she discovered, closely resembling the one at ""home,"" symbolizes her comfort. The hibiscus symbolized her tenacity in life. ""Through the quiet recurrence of season upon season, nearly familiar to her now,"" from this, one can infer that Saeng is contemplating how she recognized the geese. It instills greater self - confidence in her. From this, ""like the Geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched,"" and this indicates that there is still hope within her. This paragraph conclusion the author reached ties together what Saeng is now hoping for and believing in."
249	9111	4	1	Saeng makes this vow to herself at the story's conclusion to demonstrate her ability to adapt to this change, much like the hibiscus will blossom. She is aware that it will be arduous and time - consuming, yet ultimately, she will attain approval and happiness. We can discern the difficulty she faces from the way she breaks down in tears and the manner in which she converses with her mother. By planting the hibiscus, she symbolizes that circumstances will improve if she does not remain overly fixated on the past.
250	9112	4	1	"The author concludes the paragraph with a statement uttered by Saeng. It is an exceptionally profound statement. The author ends with this to illustrate that she is motivated and resolute in her actions. She manifests her motivation in numerous ways. She says, ""Here let me assist you, mother."" This reveals that she is motivated by aiding her mother to complete what she initiated. She also exhibits determination by stating, ""almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had regarded as strange before had become, through a quiet repetition of season upon season, nearly familiar now."" This shows that she is eager to act and no longer deems it peculiar. This is the reason why the author concludes with that statement."
251	9113	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this: ""When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow dissipates and the geese come back and this hibiscus is in bloom, then I shall retake that test!"" as the author is the one who crafted the story. One piece of information is that her family relocated to the United @ORGANIZATION1 from Vietnam. Another is that the author might have based this story on herself. Saeng fails her driving examination."
252	9114	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to illustrate that the narrator comprehends that despite being in a new country, certain aspects remain unchanged. Consequently, she becomes resolute to pass the test. For instance, the narrator stated, ""She realized that many of the things she had previously regarded as peculiar had, through the rapid succession of seasons, become familiar to her."" This quotation demonstrates that the narrator has recognized that although aspects of life have transformed, some things stay the same. It also indicates that some things, like the test, were unfamiliar to her but now that she is acquainted with it, she can pass. The narrator also said, ""Saeng did not dare to meet her mother's gaze."" This quote reveals that the narrator was disheartened with herself for failing the test. This implies that the test was of great significance to her, with the pressure to pass, and now, having adjusted to the new situation, she is prepared to pass the test. However, she will be better prepared. The theme of this story could be that discouraging things are inevitable. The narrator has endured numerous challenges recently, yet through the passage of seasons... she perseveres."
253	9115	4	1	"The author exhibits a readiness to exert greater effort in this story. She asserts, ""In the spring, when the snow thaws and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test."" I surmise that the author realizes she will have to adapt. Additionally, stating that she will await the spring implies she intends to try again and not abandon the endeavor. The author ascribes sentimental value to... Since she is waiting for the hibiscus to blossom, I believe she is associating the hibiscus with her homeland. Since she has left her country, the hibiscus is the closest connection she has to it, and thus, she will wait alongside the flower."
254	9116	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that Saeng now contemplates images linked to memories in her new abode, as well as images she recalls from Vietnam. At the onset of the story, in the floral shop, she reminisces about her grandmother, along with a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other elements that evoke certain emotions and experiences. At the story's conclusion, she employs both the hibiscus, which evokes memories of her former home, and the Canadian geese, which no longer seem so foreign to her, to symbolize the passage of time. She now perceives her new home as containing familiar elements associated with memories, just as her former home did.
255	9117	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that in the story, the protagonist expressed a desire for something and brought it home to show her mother. Then, her mother regarded her curiously because, as the story stated, ""You what? Her mother stared at her incredulously."" Subsequently, she explained that she had failed the driver's test but did not surrender. Thus, at the end of the story, she declared that she would retake the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph."
256	9118	4	1	"The narrative concludes with ""When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese reappear and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake the test."" The author finalizes the story thusly to demonstrate resolve to attempt once more and to pass her driving examination the following year. Moreover, the blossoms reminded her of her homeland in Vietnam. (For instance, ""Plants that she had not even realized she knew but had forgotten lured her back into her childhood realm."") And by next year when the flowers blossom, she would be more steadfast and prepared for the test anew. Additionally, the blooming flowers symbolize commencing a new life, and perhaps it could be the same for Saeng by passing her driver's test. That is why the author ends with that statement."
257	9119	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the narrative with the paragraph as it conveys the message of unwavering perseverance. She is resolute in surmounting every obstacle. I believe she is indicating that she will undertake the test repeatedly until she attains success. This is the reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph, as one should never abandon hope.
258	9121	4	1	"In the tale ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story by stating, ""When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself in the spring, when the snow thaws and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will retake that test."" The author concludes the story with this passage because it implies that regardless of Saeng failing the driving test initially, she will not desist until she passes and obtains her driver's license. The author also concludes the story with this paragraph as it suggests that Saeng can await the end of winter to witness the hibiscus in bud."
259	9122	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes in a manner that harkens back to the initial conflict of the protagonist failing her driver's test. The author does this to draw the reader back and simultaneously aids the reader in foreshadowing future events. ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This sentence informs the reader that with the assistance of a plant reminiscent of those in her homeland, it will facilitate her moving forward. When the hibiscus initiates a new cycle by budding in the spring, Saeng will do the same by retaking her driver's test. By using this as a conclusion, the author thus avoids leaving the reader perplexed about ""What transpired with the driver's test? What was the purpose of that?"
260	9123	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to elucidate her overarching intent. For example, when she returned, she felt elated because she had come back to her rightful place. One reason is that what she ""vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding"" implies that returning was likely the most prudent course of action she could have taken."
261	9124	4	1	It appears to me that the rationale behind the author's choice of such an ending is to employ sarcasm and emphasize the point being made, clearly indicating an unwillingness to retake the test. Essentially, one would have to resort to extreme measures, such as taking the author's life, to compel a retake of that test.
262	9125	4	1	I surmise that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because she intends to retest when the hibiscus reappears. As evidence, the last paragraph states, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is the reason I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
263	9126	4	1	The author chose this as the conclusion because it mimics a cycle. The story does not conclude at the end of the cycle, as leaving readers in a state of curiosity creates suspense. Overall, this is a well - crafted story with a fitting conclusion.
264	9127	4	1	In Minfong Ho's short story “Winter Hibiscus,” a teenage girl fails a driving test but pledges to retake it in spring. The story concludes in this manner to signify that the girl will experience a new beginning. For instance, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (Ho). The hibiscus serves as a link to her homeland. When it buds, signifying a new start, she believes she can also embark on a fresh journey. This is the reason for the story's ending.
265	9128	4	1	These are several reasons for the author's choice of concluding the story in this manner. Firstly, the majority of the story is written in a serious and straightforward tone. Ending with a quote or riddle compels the reader to contemplate the conclusion. It would be unremarkable to end with a simple account of what transpired, so the author added an element that prompts deeper thought than a typical conclusion. The author ended the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it offers a unique touch.
266	9129	4	1	Due to her determination to practice and enhance her driving skills, once the flower blossoms, she will retake the test. Moreover, she is resolved to exert greater effort during the subsequent attempt.
267	9130	4	1	The author incorporates that particular paragraph to enable readers to form a mental image rather than merely relying on the absence of a visual representation. When one can conjure a mental picture, it proves effective for visualization.
268	9131	4	1	The author concludes with that statement as it implies her intention to strive through an entire season without yearning for home. Having failed in winter, she will make another attempt in spring. One can discern this by noting her references to the plant evoking memories of life before their relocation to the city. For instance, the scent of the plant seems to transport her back to her childhood when the plants grew wild and were beautiful.
269	9132	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes with the line, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This serves as a symbol of hope for the reader, preventing an open - ended conclusion and offering an element to anticipate. Additionally, when the geese return and the hibiscus is in bloom, Saeng will feel more at ease as she has adapted to the new environment and made new acquaintances. The blooming hibiscus will also evoke fond memories of her homeland, aiding her in achieving her goal of passing the test. I believe the author ended the story this way to entice readers to reread it or recommend it to others. As someone who dislikes stories that end abruptly without closure, the author addresses this by informing the reader that Saeng intends to retake and pass the test."
270	9133	4	1	"The final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" states, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes with this statement to convey that Saeng harbors hope and will continue to acclimate to her new surroundings in @LOCATION2 @CAPS1. In the story, Saeng realizes that her connection to her home in Vietnam is not as tenuous as she initially thought. In the florist shops, plants she had forgotten but once knew draw her back to her childhood. These plants also exist in @LOCATION2. She fails ""the test"" by purchasing a winter hibiscus after succumbing to homesickness. By the story's end, she acknowledges that she is growing more accustomed to her new life, which is ""almost familiar to her now,"" like the sight of geese flying overhead. The statement in the last paragraph indicates that by spring, she hopes to overcome homesickness and regard @LOCATION2 with its geese and winter hibiscuses as her home."
271	9134	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in such a manner to illustrate Saeng's newly discovered resolve. The entire tale revolves around Saeng's journey during one afternoon to come to terms with her new abode. Thus, it appears fitting to conclude with Saeng's determination to pass her driving examination and make life thrive in @LOCATION1. The story addresses several elements that Saeng encounters, which make her feel at ease. Such as “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus.” These @CAPS1 prompt Saeng to feel more at home and render it appropriate to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will remain in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus, which is “strong enough to endure the cold months; that’s what matters.” This aligns with Saeng's determination to persevere through her new life. Finally, the geese that Saeng identifies indicate that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar.” These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she cannot turn back. The entire story is replete with events like the aforementioned three, which contribute to the @CAPS2 determination. Hence, it is fitting to conclude the story with her determination regarding it.
272	9135	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it signifies the onset of a new beginning. For instance, the fact that they relocated to a different nation. This is what the author implies when referring to the arrival of spring. Spring symbolizes a new existence, which is precisely what Saeng and her mother are embarking upon. Additionally, the snow represents a shroud of the past and arduous times. Last but not least, when the hibiscus begins to bud, it also denotes a new commencement. Therefore, when all these elements are combined, one can infer that the difficult times dissipate as the snow melts, followed by a new beginning when spring commences and the flower buds. This is the reason why the author included this paragraph in the story, as they required a fresh start.
273	9136	4	1	The author has determined that sentence to serve as the concluding sentence because Saeng believes she merits another opportunity to take the garden test, having previously failed it and consequently disappointing her mother. Moreover, as Saeng states at the end of the story, she will exhibit greater confidence when retaking the garden test.
274	9137	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with the paragraph due to its representation of the culmination of winter.
275	9138	4	1	The author likely concludes the story in such a fashion as it engenders a sense of hope and intrigue. I perceive that the story fundamentally revolves around overcoming obstacles. For example, Saeng took a driving test and failed it. She also seemed somewhat overwhelmed by the concept of “home.” Evidently, Saeng is concerned about failing the test; otherwise, she would not have dedicated time to ruminating on it, which led her to a greenhouse. At the greenhouse, she was seeking a specific plant to purchase, which reminded her of home. Contemplating home and her grandmother distresses her. Saeng experiences an internal conflict within herself, and the author concludes the story in this way to endow the reader with a sense of hope for Saeng and a feeling of intrigue.
276	9139	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it demonstrates that she will not readily capitulate after a single failure. This paragraph further reveals that she is endeavoring to develop an affinity for this country to the greatest extent possible, and she anticipates the arrival of spring when the hibiscus blossoms. This will evoke memories of her homeland while also reminding her of her new life in @LOCATION1.
277	9140	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph since Saeng was unable to obtain a particular plant as it perished, yet winter has concluded and spring has arrived, presenting her with an opportunity to acquire that flower. For instance, in the story, it states that Saeng collapsed and sobbed. It was already twilight when Saeng reached her residence. It is not her fault, as the story mentions that the wind was intensifying, stripping away the last remnants of green and chicory weeds. The author concludes in this way because there will be a subsequent occasion when Saeng will be seen again clutching a beautiful plant.
278	9141	4	1	"I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng desires to complete or @CAPS2 Retake the Test upon their return. Additionally, the author is @CAPS3 exhorting people @CAPS4 not to abandon their pursuits. Subsequently, she asserts, ""When the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake that test."" This implies that she will not relinquish her efforts in the least."
279	9142	4	1	The author concluded the story with that sentence because in the spring, Saeng intends to retake the test, and her hibiscus will finally be in bud. Saeng is going to retake the test as she failed it the @CAPS1 time she attempted it. This is the reason why the author included that sentence at the conclusion of the story.
280	9143	4	1	The author included this paragraph at the conclusion of the story to symbolize a new beginning. I believe this because when spring arrives and the hibiscus commences to bud, it will evoke recollections of her native land, and she will embark on a fresh attempt at the test.
281	9144	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as Saeng has pledged to retake the examination in the spring and will possess greater confidence when the snow dissipates, the geese return, and the hibiscus commences budding. “A surge of loss so profound and intense that it pricked Saeng’s eye now enveloped her.” Saeng experiences solitude as she hails from a different nation and yearns for everything she once knew and adored. Presently, she has the hibiscus to evoke memories of her homeland.
282	9145	4	1	The author employs this paragraph to conclude her tale, demonstrating that there was contemplation and a process involved during which she was learning and evolving. Initially, Saeng is extremely ill - at - ease and disheartened with herself. “I - I failed the test,” Saeng utters. “For an extended moment, Mrs. Pan Ouvong remained silent.” One can discern that initially, the mother is disappointed, and as they converse while planting, the atmosphere is alleviated. “How would you fancy an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” “I’d relish it,” Saeng replied. Her mood has now brightened, and she is making a composed, rational decision to attempt again, which is a sensible choice when she is in a positive state of mind rather than being upset and distraught.
283	9146	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” it features an unconventional ending. There are numerous reasons why the author chose to conclude the story in this manner. Firstly, the girl failed the test, which rendered her silent. When she agreed to retake the test, it is a sign of the will to persevere, and it indicates that she is striving towards her goal until she achieves it. Finally, the ending could symbolize a new beginning, akin to when the snow melts and transforms winter into spring. This is the significance of the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” and the rationale behind the author’s conclusion.
284	9147	4	1	The author concludes with this sentence as it reveals that Saeng intends to endeavor to acclimate to her new abode. It conveys that Saeng will no longer lament and be sorrowful but will adapt and continue her life. The author includes this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at - at - ”. This occurs when Saeng has just returned home and conversed with her mother, and she is deeply saddened as she reminisces about old memories from her former home. However, by adding the last statement of the story, it shows that Saeng has resolved to move forward in life and cease being sad. She has set a goal to accept the situation. This is the reason why the author concludes the story in this way.
285	9148	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because he aimed to convey that the hibiscus symbolizes a source of solace during a period of disappointment for Saeng. She encountered the plant immediately after failing her driving test.
286	9149	4	1	Authors employ conclusions to conclude a narrative or prompt readers to engage in contemplation. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author utilizes the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This conclusion serves to illustrate that she will adapt to this culture. For instance, when she is in the garden shop, she succumbs to tears; it states “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” It can be inferred that she cries not because she struggles to fit in but because she failed her test and doubts her ability to do so. Thus, she motivates herself at the story's end to attempt the test once more. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng will retake the test to integrate into this new world.
287	9150	4	1	The reason the author concludes the story in this manner is to convey that the protagonist will not abandon her efforts. The author aims to illustrate that she will retake the test, exert greater effort to surmount her challenges, and persevere. The author intends to show that she is not a quitter and is imbued with determination despite facing conflicts. In essence, the conclusion emphasizes her unwavering resolve to confront difficulties head - on and not yield to setbacks.
288	9151	4	1	What motivated the author to conclude the story with this particular paragraph? It is postulated that the author included this paragraph as it foreshadows the protagonist's future actions. For example, in the story, she confided in her mother, “I failed…” As she was planting the flower in the garden, a flock of geese was migrating southward. This conclusion provides a glimpse into her current state of mind and the events surrounding her, suggesting that her journey has a connection with the changing seasons and her own self - evaluation.
289	9152	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as the protagonist is resolved to make another attempt. When she declared “Then I will take that test again,” it indicates her awareness of a second opportunity. This showcases her strong - willed nature and her reluctance to surrender easily. What she conveys in the last paragraph is the principle of perseverance: if one fails initially, one should persist. In the story, it is stated “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season.” From this passage, it is evident that she is already undergoing a transformation. Therefore, it is anticipated that she will perform admirably in her next attempt.
290	9153	4	1	It is posited that the author chose to conclude the story in this way to showcase the protagonist's determination to pass the test. The test entailed the ability to cultivate the garden. This is evident from the statement “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This indicates that the test was associated with spring and the blossoming of flowers, implying that she was attempting to nurture plant growth. In the story, her assistance to her mother in the garden is mentioned. Hence, it is surmised that when the plants failed to thrive, she was resolved to try again. This is why it is believed that the author chose to end the story with the statement about retaking the test in the spring, highlighting her tenacity and hope for future success.
291	9154	4	1	The author incorporates this paragraph as it evokes recollections from the time when Saeng laid down the soil during the “winter hibiscus,” and a flock of Canada geese soared past her. When Saeng initially failed her test, she lacked the courage to meet her mother's gaze. She relied on the hibiscus, which either spurred her desire to retake the test or influenced her decision to wait until they rebudded.
292	9155	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to encapsulate all the elements discussed within the story. Throughout the story, there is mention of the spring season, and currently, Saeng and her mother engage in the activity of planting flowers and tending to various things.
293	9156	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that she will not capitulate as long as others do not. I hold this view because the birds and the hibiscus will only reappear if they endure. This implies that they will remain resilient in the interim, much like her. She will persevere through her new surroundings and adapt to conform to the norms of @CAPS1 life.
294	9157	4	1	I believe that the author concludes the story in this manner because it will incite readers' curiosity to peruse the subsequent story to ascertain whether the test is passed, thereby infusing the narrative with suspense.
295	9158	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it symbolizes Saeng's resolve to attempt again and surmount the obstacles in her path. Instead of having her explicitly state “I will try again next spring,” this approach showcases diction and presents her objective or decision in an alternative manner. For instance, it states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now.” Initially, the sight of geese flying in the sky was novel to her, but now she has grown accustomed to it. Perhaps the author is alluding to the geese, suggesting that the driving test will become familiar, and she will pass it, just as she became accustomed to and familiar with the geese. Since her family migrated from Vietnam to @LOCATION1, she has been adapting to the changes and circumstances in her life. Nevertheless, Saeng appears determined to survive and overcome these challenges. The paragraph essentially conveys that she will retake the test next spring, yet the author included it to illustrate diction by emphasizing the geese, which represent learning something new, and the hibiscus, which symbolizes something familiar. It accentuates the story's central theme, which is the importance of not giving up and the will to survive.
296	9159	4	1	The author, an ardent admirer of @CAPS1 plants, commences her @CAPS2 endeavor after each winter to ascertain whether she can cultivate and nurture exquisite plants. The spring @ORGANIZATION1 stands as the sole @ORGANIZATION1 where one can grow unique plants akin to those she cultivates. Her objective is to cultivate a garden replete with beautiful plants and vegetables. The author will exert diligent effort, much like her mother did, to breathe life into the gardens, particularly following the winter.
297	9160	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph. He expounded upon the resplendence of nature. He also opined that since Saeng held a profound affection for nature, she would return to school to complete the test despite having the option to remain at home tending to the plants in the garden. This is why I surmise that the author chose to conclude with that paragraph, as it likely depicts his fondness for nature.
298	9161	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the narrative with that specific paragraph to symbolize nascent beginnings. The story revolves around the sense of failure and shame experienced by Saeng upon failing her driving test, and how the discovery of a familiar hibiscus plant bestowed upon her a new opportunity for life. By purchasing the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her homeland, and by providing that solitary hibiscus with a novel and unfamiliar environment in which to flourish, just as she was, she was able to forge a connection with the plant. Spring symbolizes the onset of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the commencement of its new life. Consequently, Saeng desires to restart her life when the plant initiates its new life cycle and retake her driving test.
299	9162	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the symbolism within it conveys that when all returns to normalcy and “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” This implies that she will be willing to move forward and attempt to adapt.
300	9163	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph regarding retaking the test to illustrate that Saeng is becoming more acclimated to @LOCATION2, that our memories endure indefinitely, and that even the most diminutive of objects can encapsulate memories for us. The paragraph demonstrates Saeng's increasing acclimation to @LOCATION2 by revealing that she will not abandon @LOCATION2 and will persevere in comprehending our customs. The final paragraph also showcases the everlasting nature of our memories through the hibiscus symbolizing Vietnam and her home there. It further indicates that she can initiate a new chapter here, much like the hibiscus does at her residence. Finally, the paragraph reveals that even the smallest of things can preserve our memories, as the hibiscus represents her home in Vietnam. The hibiscus evokes numerous memories for Saeng and aids her in coping with @LOCATION2. This is how the last paragraph conveys that Saeng is growing accustomed to @LOCATION2, that our memories are eternal, and that the smallest things can hold memories.
301	9164	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” penned by @PERSON1, a teenage girl named Saeng, along with her family, has relocated to the United States from Vietnam. After failing her driver's examination, Saeng is making her way home when she encounters a familiar plant. Subsequently, she enters a florist establishment to acquire the plant. Upon reaching home, she informs her mother of her test failure. Naturally, her mother is dismayed, yet she prepares dinner and tends to the “winter hibiscus.” At the conclusion of the story, Saeng muses to herself, “When they return, in spring, when the snow thaws and the geese come back and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will take that test once more.” I surmise that Saeng declares she will retake the test in spring because she now feels self - assured and content, as she has grown accustomed to the plant she possesses, and her mother is not overly angry with her. She senses that everything will be well and that she can retake the test in spring, when life is flourishing.
302	9165	4	1	The author concludes the story with this particular line as it demonstrates that the geese derived inspiration from the flower to return, persevere, and refrain from surrendering. For instance, Saeng privately vowed, “In the spring when the snows dissolve and the geese come back and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will take that test again.” This quotation reveals that the hibiscus was the impetus for her resolve. Moreover, it indicates that she would return, just as the geese did. This is precisely why the author chose to conclude the story with that line, as she aimed to depict Saeng being inspired and not giving up.
303	9166	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I opine that the author concludes with that paragraph as it showcases her determination to succeed. “When they return,” Saeng silently promised herself, “in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese come back and the hibiscus begins to bud, then I will take the test again.” This exemplifies her determination because geese migrate annually and flowers invariably bloom each year. She will persist in her efforts, just as the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be resolute in passing the test and assimilating into her new environment sooner or later. Had she not been determined, she might never pass the test nor integrate into her new society.
304	9167	4	1	I posit that the author concludes the story with this sentence to illustrate how she has surmounted emotional hurdles and how the hibiscus plant serves as a symbol of hope for the future. At the onset of the story, Saeng is disheartened about failing her driver's test, and on top of that, she becomes distressed upon seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story, it states, ‘When she reached the hibiscus, she extended her hand and tenderly touched a petal. And besides, it was yet another friend, a small shrub.’” This quote reveals how these plants evoke memories of her homeland, which she deeply misses and holds dear. By bringing this plant back to her residence, it is as if she is bringing a fragment of her homeland. This quote, “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” indicates that Saeng has regained hope in her life. This represents a significant turning point in her life that will render her much happier in @LOCATION1, which is the reason the author ended the story with this sentence.
305	9168	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because she is not prepared to progress with her life. When all circumstances revert to normal, she will take that test and move forward. However, until her flowers wither, she will not concern herself with school. For example, she wrote, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had previously regarded as peculiar had, through the unobtrusive recurrence of season after season, become nearly familiar to her now, like geese.” This implies that she has become accustomed to change and has accepted the situation.
306	9169	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with that statement because the snow fails to melt in spring, the geese do not return in winter, and the hibiscus does not begin to bud until spring either. The hibiscus is a resplendent plant that Saeng adored.
307	9170	4	1	The entire narrative regarding Saeng's purchase of the hibiscus is a reaction to her failing the driving test, which devastated her. She desires to be reminded of her former homeland, where she was not required to pass driving lessons. Thus, she visits a greenhouse to seek plants similar to those she once had in her native land. She undertakes this endeavor to attempt to alleviate her distress, yet “in the warm, humid sanctuary of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Saeng perceives herself as a failure, and the hibiscus bestows upon her hope and recollections of her old country. Her mother clearly discerns and comprehends this when she refrains from scolding Saeng for spending $NUM1 on the plant. “I’m glad you got it,” Saeng’s mother remarks because she is aware that it consoles her daughter. Together, they tend to the hibiscus. By doing so, they are sowing Saeng’s hope for growth, not only to pass the driving test but also to thrive in the new country. The story concludes with those lines because Saeng determines that if the hibiscus can grow, then so can she. She will be prepared to confront the driving test with hope and support, having adapted. Although the hibiscus is not the one she had in the old country, she knows that they can acclimate to their surroundings, just as the plant has in the new country. The plant will flourish if it can adapt, and Saeng can prosper if she adapts to this new country.
308	9171	4	1	The author endeavors to convey that Saeng will never relinquish her efforts and that her confidence will burgeon, enabling her to retake her test, much like the hibiscus in spring. The comparison of Saeng to the hibiscus plant in the final paragraph serves to illustrate how she will develop and progress to retake the test when the opportune moment arrives. The melting snow symbolizes the dissipation of her sorrows, while the sun represents her future success and growth, akin to the hibiscus plant she purchased. The plant’s growth in the sunlight would signify her confidence to take the test next time, dispelling the frigid snow, which is analogous to her negative self - esteem and attitude. The author chose to compare Saeng to the plant in the last paragraph to demonstrate its relevance to her life and attitude, and how her life will transform as a consequence of the hibiscus plant.
309	9172	4	1	The author concludes her story with this paragraph as it truly showcases the spirit and tenacity that Saeng possesses. Moreover, it reveals a great deal about her character and concludes the story in a powerful manner. This is the reason why she ended the story in such a way.
310	9173	4	1	When the snow thaws and the geese return, it signifies that spring is nearly upon us.
311	9174	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she perceived herself to be prepared for the new assessment. The text indicates that after trudging home subsequent to failing the linear driver test, she spots a familiar plant. Subsequently, she visits a florist's establishment to ascertain if the plant is available for purchase. She will retake the test as she believes she possesses the confidence to pass it the next time.
312	9175	4	1	The author concludes this segment in the conclusion to illustrate the fortitude the girl exhibits in immigrating to @LOCATION1. After failing her driver's test, Saeng felt defeated and worthless. Her mother took this into account and did not reprimand her for buying the flower. In fact, she decided to plant the flower to demonstrate to Saeng that all would ultimately be well. When Saeng witnessed her mother's actions, she was inundated with determination and took over the task of planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is arduous, and numerous immigrants encounter daily challenges. Saeng's mother was outside in the cold, planting and striving to make the best of her circumstances. By setting this example, Saeng realized that she too could optimize her situation. This is why, in the end, Saeng resolves to retake her driver's test and ultimately adopt the same outlook as her mother.
313	9176	4	1	They can juxtapose the story and this statement because in the story, the protagonist does not capitulate, and the same holds true for the individual taking the test again. They did not relinquish their efforts as they are retaking it.
314	9177	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph in anticipation. The conclusion drawn by the author is to convey that over that period, Saeng will have surmounted that setback and will be better equipped for the test on her second attempt. The text details how Saeng recognized that many of the things she once regarded as peculiar have now become nearly familiar, which represents an improvement.
315	9178	4	1	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to depict the transformation in Saeng's disposition and attitude towards her new life in @LOCATION1. Since spring symbolizes rejuvenation, the author's inclusion of this is not coincidental. Spring will mark Saeng's period of rebirth, during which she can take the test and initiate her new life in @LOCATION1. ""When the snow melts"" is incorporated because winter symbolizes desolation, and as the snow recedes, so will Saeng's apprehensions."
316	9179	4	1	In the spring, do you notice that the snows dissolve and the grass, though not initially appealing, transforms into a muddied expanse? This muddy terrain is a haven for pigs, which delight in wallowing within it. Consider a muddy thoroughfare; it showcases the impact winter can have. Reflect on the trees now, their branches biding their time to rejuvenate and thrive. Such is the essence of a fulfilling existence.
317	9180	4	1	The author opted to conclude the final paragraph with the narrative to demonstrate that she has not relinquished hope. This is evident as it states, “overhead...geese...honk...familiar to Saeng now (second to last paragraph).” When Saeng purchases the hibiscus, it serves as a repository of numerous memories from her homeland, providing her with the impetus to persevere. The sight of her mother preparing an “omelet with slices of bitter melon” brought tears to her eyes. This poignant reminder of home instilled in her the hope to persist and not abandon her efforts.
318	9181	4	1	Saeng harbors a profound affection for flowers and plants. The author concludes this segment with the anecdote as it seamlessly aligns with the overarching narrative. During spring, when the snow dissipates, Saeng eagerly anticipates the conclusion of winter so that she can once again behold the flora. Saeng appreciates the intrinsic value of plants and derives pleasure from cultivating them. The author incorporates this passage to illustrate Saeng's deep - seated infatuation with plants. She was so eager that she could scarcely wait for the winter break to conclude.
319	9182	4	1	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to illustrate Saeng's profound sense of connection to the plant, which serves as a poignant reminder of her homeland. This connection holds significant importance as it exemplifies how individuals can discover means to cope with life's transitions. Saeng achieves this by purchasing and cultivating the hibiscus plant, enabling her to gaze upon it and be transported back to her home. Moreover, she acquires the plant as it serves as a source of motivation to retake the examination she failed in the spring when the flower begins to bloom.
320	9183	4	1	Since she is disoriented and has yet to acclimate to the country she currently resides in, she struggles to concentrate on her test. However, once the flower blossoms, as it evokes a sense of home, she believes that her performance on the test will improve. She firmly holds the conviction that this familiar connection will enhance her ability to focus and achieve better results on the examination.
321	9184	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as the hibiscus brings her solace. She states, “When they return in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese come back and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test.” Given that the author failed the test as recounted in the story, she will find comfort in retaking the test when the hibiscus reappears after the snow - bound season.
322	9185	4	1	The author concludes the story by stating that when the geese return in the spring, she will attempt to pass the test. This adheres to the adage “if at first you don't succeed, try again.” Moreover, the author concludes with this statement to illustrate that Saeng has resided in the @LOCATION2 for several years and still yearns for her homeland in Vietnam.
323	9186	4	1	She believes she will succeed in the test because in spring, nature rejuvenates. Flowers recommence their growth, trees regain their verdure, and everything assumes a fresh green hue. The geese are returning, animals are emerging from their hiding places, and people visit the beach to divert themselves. This might be what she desires to do.
324	9187	4	1	The author most likely concludes this narrative with the quote due to her rekindled hope. She was deeply despondent as she had failed the driving test. When she beheld the hibiscus flower, her emotions were further heightened as she yearned for her home. However, when she saw the geese as she completed planting the flower, she resolved to retake the test the following spring.
325	9188	4	1	The author concludes the story with the statement, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to depict Saeng's maturation. As another year elapses, Saeng will become more at ease with her situation and prepared to initiate anew, much like all the plants that will be in bloom and bud. Failing her driver's test greatly distressed Saeng. By waiting another year, she will have the opportunity to practice more and improve. Thus, when she retakes the test, she will be a more proficient driver, having had the time to practice and start afresh. It is akin to a new beginning for Saeng. Another year has passed, and just as her familiar plant buds and starts anew, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, she can better identify with it. As it buds and starts afresh, Saeng too will embark on a new journey. In conclusion, this is the reason the author concluded the story with that phrase.
326	9189	4	1	I opine that the author incorporates this paragraph into the story as it is reasonable that the geese return home after the snow thaws and Saeng endeavors to retake her test around that period.
327	9190	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with the statement “When they come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to illustrate that Saeng is prepared to adapt, yet still requires time. Throughout the tale, Saeng grapples with the challenge of relocating from her homeland to an unfamiliar locale hundreds of miles away. Nevertheless, Saeng is not yet ready to relinquish her connection to her home. Consequently, she attempts to cling to her past memories, only to discover that in @LOCATION1, everything diverges. When she acquires a plant that is familiar to her, she realizes that even it is different in @LOCATION1 and becomes irate that it fails to meet her expectations. However, by the conclusion of the story, she recognizes that difference is not always negative and vows to endeavor to embrace this new culture, though she is aware that it will still take a considerable amount of time before she is fully prepared to do so.
328	9191	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that particular ending paragraph because when spring arrives, she intends to make another attempt. As I was reading this story, it is stated that her mother inquired, “What happened?” And Saeng replied, “I - I failed the test.” Thus, I am speculating that her mother will offer her greater assistance with her studies and gardening. When the snow melts, Saeng pledges to herself that this time she will exert more effort and pass the test.
329	9192	4	1	The rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph is that it is at that juncture when she will retake the test. Additionally, the geese prompt her to realize that numerous things she once perceived as peculiar have now become familiar, much like the geese themselves. This transformation occurs through the tranquil recurrence of season after season.
330	9193	4	1	She concludes with that paragraph as it symbolizes a fresh start. When the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud, it is akin to a restart, enabling her to make another attempt at dealing with her recollections of home and her adaptation to the new country. I believe she will be better equipped to handle it and retake the test, which demonstrates her resolve not to surrender.
331	9194	4	1	"She laments that due to her inability to preserve the tropical plant alive, she is discontented with herself. This is the reason she declared, ""In the spring, when the snow thaws and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I shall retake that test."" After her failure, her mother consoled her, saying it would be all right and that she could always attempt it again."
332	9195	4	1	I posit that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as she is conveying to both the reader and herself, in my perspective, that she will once more engage in gardening to ascertain if it piques her interest. I surmise that the author endeavors to express this because at the onset of the story, she exhibits no inclination towards the garden or the world around her. For instance, when she was tasked with purchasing only garden seeds, she utilized some of her mother's money to buy herself a Big Mac. In conclusion, I believe that what I have articulated clearly delineates the author's sentiments and the rationale behind her choice of ending the story in such a manner.
333	9196	4	1	The author concludes the story with the statement “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because Saeng had previously failed the test and now aspires to pass it. On that day, she gleaned a wealth of knowledge from her mother, which entirely transformed her outlook on life.
334	9197	4	1	The author may have concluded the story with that sentence to demonstrate that she still values the test more than a mere plant that is likely to perish. Additionally, since she must pass the test, the author implies that ultimately, the girl will succeed and will not have to retake it. Moreover, the author conveys that life is not solely about expensive material possessions, but rather that education holds greater significance than anything else.
335	9198	4	1	The rationale behind Minfong Ho, the author, concluding the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the last paragraph is that in the narrative, the girl undertook a test. Although the nature of the test remains unspecified, she failed it and returned with a saebba hedge, a domesticated plant for the family. The family holds this plant dear. As inferred from the story, they are newcomers to a country, specifically @LOCATION1, having migrated from Vietnam. She went for her driving test and returned home unsuccessful. One of the inquiries her mother posed was, “Why do you squander so much money on this exquisite plant when you could have had the renowned Big Macs,” which was the mother's attempt to refer to their favorite fast - food sandwich. The reason the daughter returned with the plant is that she felt she had let her parents down on the driving test. She desires to retry. “When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again.” She is confident that the next time she takes the test, she will pass, sparing herself the shame and making her parents proud. Passing the test holds great honor for the family, as in Vietnam, few people drive, and it is something they wish their daughter to achieve.
336	9199	4	1	It is evident that Saeng is ensnared in the throes of struggle during a period of profound homesickness subsequent to her recent relocation from Vietnam. However, as time progresses, she will acquire the ability to strike a balance between the affection she harbors for her new country and that for her homeland. As Saeng traverses the narrative, it becomes manifest that she yearns for recollections of her native land, yet is commencing to discover novel aspects to relish about her new abode. For instance, while she is deeply moved by the memories evoked by the hibiscus flower, she is captivated by the novel experiences, such as consuming Big @CAPS1 and befriending new companions. Although homesickness has precipitated her struggle, she is cognizant that with the passage of time, she will be capable of surmounting the hurdle of forsaking the old ways for the new, without entirely eradicating either. She is firmly convinced that by spring, she will be able to overcome this impediment and possess the confidence to confront any challenges that may emerge in her future.
337	9200	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's vow to convey a sense of transformation in Saeng. The winter season is exceedingly harsh, as Saeng's mother had remarked, yet spring is the time when all things rejuvenate. I believe this symbolizes a shift within Saeng. Although winter is arduous and one may be buffeted by the wind, when spring arrives, she will attempt the test anew and come to life, relishing the @LOCATION1 despite being far from the rain. The author made a judicious decision to conclude the story with that vow.
338	9201	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as he endeavors to convey that whenever something departs from its abode, it invariably returns. The hibiscus serves as a poignant reminder of her homeland, which is where she yearns to be. Saeng failed her driver's test and declared that when the geese return, she will retake it. The plant evokes memories of home, yet as she states, “Not like the tired we had before” (Ho). She is implying that the ones in Vietnam are superior, and she longs to return as she misses it deeply.
339	9202	4	1	Saeng is discussing the resurgence of flowers during the spring season. She is pledging to retake the test after the snow has melted and is determined to persevere. “The wind was blowing more forcefully, stripping away the last vestiges of green from the chicory weeds that were growing.” Thus, she is eagerly anticipating the return of spring so that she can attempt to plant once more.
340	9203	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it posits that when everything reverts to its former state, she will undertake all endeavors anew so that circumstances are not as they once were, and she desires a change.
341	9204	4	1	The young girl, Saeng, appears to have a deep affinity for nature and takes delight when spring arrives. As she stated, a new natural cycle will commence, and she will be spurred on to retake the test she previously failed. The author most likely concluded the text with this paragraph to illustrate that there will be hope for Saeng, and she will undertake the necessary actions to achieve comfort in her new home country. The entire narrative details her ongoing dissatisfaction with her new abode, yet it transitions to a scenario of new opportunities and a fresh start, which the author conveys through the symbolism of springtime.
342	9205	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to imply that by this juncture, Saeng may have acclimated to her new dwelling. I surmise this because when I relocated, I initially disliked the new place as I had few companions. However, after a year or two, I adjusted well as I had made numerous friends. This parallels Saeng's situation, as she yearns for her former home, often reminiscing about it and shedding tears. For instance, upon seeing a plant that was also present in her old home, she began to cry due to her nostalgia. In conclusion, this is the rationale behind the author's decision to include this at the story's conclusion.
343	9206	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author incorporated a significant element at the end when Saeng made a vow. The motivation behind her statement is that once everything in her life recommences, she will regain her love for life and transform into a considerably happier individual. This vow serves as a poignant indication of her hope for a better future, suggesting that despite the challenges she has faced, she anticipates a positive change and the restoration of her well - being."
344	9207	4	1	The author in this passage does this as it demonstrates what she intends to do after experiencing failure. This narrative reveals what she must undertake, drawing inspiration from the geese. The geese, perhaps symbolizing perseverance or a natural rhythm of renewal, offer a model for her to follow. By observing their behavior, she can find the motivation and direction to overcome her setbacks and move forward in her journey.
345	9208	4	1	I posit that the author opted to conclude with that particular paragraph because it symbolizes new beginnings and the prospect of starting afresh. When Saeng fails her driving test, she experiences a moment of vulnerability, feeling isolated. Subsequently, she encounters a plant that evokes memories of her homeland, Vietnam. In a sense, the plant provides solace to her. The quote “its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here” conveys that Saeng's mother is highlighting how, like the flower, Saeng may be out of place but possesses the fortitude and resolve to thrive. In the concluding paragraph, Saeng determines that, akin to the flower and the birds, she can summon the courage to confront her fears. She resolves to retake the tests, signifying her readiness to embrace a new chapter and overcome her past failures.
346	9209	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate that she will not capitulate and to convey the same message to her mother.
347	9210	4	1	I surmise that the author was alluding to a new beginning. I posit this due to the resurgence of everything. Additionally, I assert it because Saeng now comprehends what holds significance and will approach it with due solemnity. That is my interpretation of what the author intended at the conclusion of the story.
348	9211	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, a young girl and her mother relocate to a novel locale, and the daughter, Saeng, encounters considerable difficulty. Saeng discovers a plant named dok faeng - noi that evokes memories of her homeland. Consequently, she purchases it and brings it home to present to her mother. Initially, her mother is perturbed as she spent @NUM1 dollars on the plant. However, upon perceiving her daughter's self - disappointment, she derives pleasure from the exquisite plant while she is preparing dinner. Meanwhile, Saeng plants the beautiful plant and vows to herself that when the geese return, the hibiscus buds, and spring arrives, she will retake the test. She discovers inner strength and the fortitude to perform better. I opine that the author aimed to illustrate how Saeng acquired self - respect by the end of the passage. This is the rationale behind the author's choice of ending the story in such a manner.
349	9212	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it encapsulates the essence of the entire narrative. It revolves around how Saeng yearns for her homeland and fails the test subsequent to purchasing the hibiscus. Saeng fails the test because she succumbs to the allure of the flower and reminisces about home, which induces sadness. In the final paragraph, she asserts that when the geese return in spring, she will have acclimated to the new country and home and will not fail the test. If she is enticed by something associated with her homeland, she will resist it as it will bring her sorrow. The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it represents the central theme of the narrative, depicting her adaptation to the new abode.
350	9213	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” written by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to comprehensively summarize the entire plot. Moreover, the author employs this technique to pique the reader's curiosity and leave them in a state of contemplation.
351	9214	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the statement, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to illustrate that despite failing her test, she is not succumbing and will persevere through this setback and continue her efforts. This denouement reveals the determination residing in Saeng's heart. Saeng possesses sufficient resolve within her to persevere even after failing her test and disappointing her grandmother, as she continues to strive and attempt to achieve for her grandmother and herself. I truly appreciated this conclusion and am gratified that the author chose to employ this ending in the story.
352	9215	4	1	The failure of the driver's test deeply perturbed Saeng. Moreover, having to relocate to a new country and the loss of her grandmother exacerbated her distress. The hibiscus plant in this narrative serves as a symbol. It represents her life and evokes memories of her life in Vietnam. The manner in which memories surface as she beholds these flowers reflects her emotional state. It encapsulates the essence of embarking on a new journey and surmounting obstacles. When she utters, “... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it signifies her fresh start and her ability to endure the arduous times, symbolized by winter. It is a representation of herself and the hardships she will overcome.
353	9216	4	1	In the story, the author brings the narrative to a close in the final paragraph, demonstrating that even amidst adversity, Saeng perseveres and endeavors to lead a normal life following her relocation. For instance, when it states, “Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring I will take the test again,” it showcases that even after a single failure, one should never abandon their pursuit and should not disregard the past.
354	9217	4	1	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Minfong Ho, concludes the tale with a profound paragraph. The author penned, “When they come back... in the spring... then I will take that test again” (No). Saeng mused to herself, signifying her intention to move forward in the spring. It also indicates that Saeng can surmount the setback of failing the test. The narrative further asserts, “... in the spring... when... this hibiscus is budding...” (No). The season of spring symbolically represents a new and rejuvenating beginning. When the flower begins to bud, it commences a new phase of life. Similarly, Saeng initiates a fresh start when she decides to take the test in the spring. Ultimately, this demonstrates that Saeng can adapt to her new life by acquiring a familiar plant. The hibiscus assisted her in weathering the disappointing periods. The geese also served as a reminder that certain aspects of her homeland remained unchanged. Minfong Ho concluded the story with this paragraph to accentuate Saeng's adaptability.
355	9218	4	1	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to convey to the audience that she intends to retake the test and make another attempt. She aspires to be akin to the flowers, yet she requires time, and thus, when they bloom, she will act.
356	9219	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, the tale concludes with Saeng privately pledging to herself that she will retake the test in the spring. The author most likely ends the story in this manner as it illustrates how Saeng is gradually overcoming her distress. The test in the spring coincides with the period when the hibiscus is in @LOCATION1. This is evident when Saeng utters, “I - I failed the test (@NUM1).” This indicates @CAPS2 leaving her native land, which exacerbates her sorrow. Nevertheless, she then vows to herself that in the spring when the flowers are in @LOCATION1, she will attempt the test again. She expresses this determination when she says to herself, “…in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” (pg @NUM2) This showcases her ability to surmount her grief, become resolute, and look forward to retaking the test.
357	9220	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the statement, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, when the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author employs this ending to demonstrate how Saeng is gradually adapting to change while still cherishing her origins. This is manifested through the combined use of the symbols of geese and hibiscus. The geese symbolize the new abode and the unfamiliar sounds to which Saeng must acclimate. Meanwhile, the hibiscus represents the nostalgic memories of her past and her homeland. The juxtaposition of these symbols indicates that she has come to embrace both places. By @CAPS1 stating that she will take the test again in the spring, it reveals her readiness for the transformation. The test symbolizes her sentiment towards @LOCATION1, and by passing the test, she allows herself to progress with @LOCATION1 and adapt to the changes in her life.
358	9221	4	1	They utilized this sentence because she yearns to witness the flower in bud, as it evokes a sense of homecoming. Subsequently, she will undertake the test. Moreover, she will experience a sense of fortune and be reminded of her homeland, prompting Saeng to silently vow to herself. This vow reflects her emotional connection to the flower and her determination to face the test with a renewed sense of hope and familiarity.
359	9222	4	1	The author concludes the story with the sentence, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The narrative details most of the arduous times and obstacles that Saeng has endured. The two primary hurdles in this story were relocating to a new place and failing her arriving test. Saeng struggled immensely to overcome these incidents and others. Therefore, I surmise that this sentence was placed at the end so that readers could perceive that she would be all right and triumph over all that had transpired. Now, we are aware that this special plant will assist Saeng in confronting future challenges, serving as a source of strength and inspiration for her resilience.
360	9223	4	1	After perusing the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I am of the opinion that the quote, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” was included in the story for a specific purpose. I believe that this quote concludes the story as it instills a tone and sense of hope. For instance, the story states that “Saeng dug a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it.” This reveals that this plant holds great significance for her. The narrative conveys to the reader that the plant is associated with memories of her grandmother. It represents hope for Saeng as it consistently evokes the happy memories she once had, which motivate her to better cope with her loss. Hence, the quote concludes the story as it pertains to Saeng’s yearning for hope and tranquility. It symbolizes that when the plant blossoms in the spring, she will acquire a newly - found sense of hope and happiness, marking a new chapter of optimism in her life.
361	9224	4	1	“Winter Hibiscus,” penned by Minfong Ho, is a narrative concerning the transition to @LOCATION1 and the protagonist's inherent capacity for resilience. Saeng failed her driver's examination and was crestfallen as she made her way home. She halted at a florist establishment upon sighting a plant that she deemed reminiscent of the one she had in her native land. The reappearance of this plant evoked recollections of her homeland. She planted it upon arriving home and resolved to retake the driving test when the geese returned. The plant served as a source of encouragement for her.
362	9225	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the given paragraph as the story revolved around her acclimatization to the cyclical nature of natural phenomena. Hence, she appended the final paragraph stating that when all events recur, she will act in the same manner. This is the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with that paragraph.
363	9226	4	1	I surmise that the author includes that part because she might have encountered setbacks and requires additional time to study to achieve @NUM1. Other than that, it pertains to that novel aspect.
364	9227	4	1	The author employs this sentence to conclude the story in order to demonstrate that Saeng's hope has been rekindled. Throughout the narrative, Saeng is despondent and yearns for her homeland. She experiences a sense of despair in this unfamiliar territory. The hibiscus serves as a poignant reminder of home and evokes memories of her time with her grandmother at home, which intensifies her longing to return. The author incorporates the part about the geese departing as they, too, must leave their abode. The hibiscus symbolizes her fortitude and her ability to persevere through the transition to this alien land.
365	9228	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will not succumb to defeat and will persist in her efforts. In the tale, all the recollections of her former country inspired her to be steadfast. For instance, the flower initially elicited sadness but ultimately had a salutary effect on her. Moreover, at the onset, she was averse to the new changes and pined for home, yet by the end, some of the same memories from her homeland resurfaced in her new country. These are the reasons I believe the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph.
366	9229	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, I posit that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph as it demonstrates that if the hibiscus plant possesses sufficient fortitude to resurge and thrive, then Saeng has ample strength to rebound and retake the test. For instance, within the story, it states, “but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This quotation illustrates the resilience of the hibiscus plant. Saeng perceives that if the plant can recuperate after a frigid winter, then she can reappear for the test subsequent to her failure. Overall, I opine that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants exhibit remarkable strength.
367	9230	4	1	In this narrative, it delves into the parallels between Saeng and the hibiscus plant in terms of their adaptability to their surroundings and how both will persevere, much like Saeng with her “test.” I discern this because it states, “Then I will take that test again.” Her utterance implies her resolve to thrive anew, akin to the hibiscus plant. In conclusion, she truly bears a striking resemblance to the plant and will endure through numerous seasons, adapting to changes just as the hibiscus does.
368	9231	4	1	The author concluded the story with the final paragraph as the arrival of spring brings the return of geese, and she will regain self - confidence. This newfound self - assurance will enable her to retake the test and concentrate more intently on it, ultimately facilitating a better performance.
369	9232	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it aligns seamlessly with the overall plot. In the story, Saeng embarked on a quest to find the plant that evoked memories of her grandmother. Upon discovering the plant, thoughts of her grandmother flooded her mind, and she wept. I surmise that she was assessing her ability to move forward in life, yet she fell short. Hence, I believe she purchased the plant so that she could attempt again when the plant blossoms.
370	9233	4	1	He aspires to learn the essence of the hibiscus spirit. One should not cower in the face of adversity. Instead, one must forge ahead, ceaselessly pursuing the acquisition of knowledge and skills one desires, and then success will be within reach. Just as the hibiscus showcases tenacious vitality by battling against the environment, the author employs this paragraph to conclude the story. The underlying purpose is that Saeng will retake the test, much like the hibiscus will sprout buds when spring arrives.
371	9234	4	1	When they return, Saeng silently pledged to herself. In spring, as the hibiscus begins to bud, she will undertake the test. It is believed that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as she intends to test them once more.
372	9235	4	1	The author concluded the narrative in such a manner because that is precisely how the story commenced. At the outset, the young girl was observing the flora and fauna. Hence, the author deemed it fitting to conclude the story in the same vein as it began. Moreover, the bond Saeng shares with the plants and flowers will be rekindled in spring when all is in bloom and resplendent. This illustrates that the plants offer solace during her arduous times. This is the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude with Saeng and the plants.
373	9236	4	1	"In Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with a profound paragraph. The author endeavors to convey a message to Saeng. When Saeng witnessed the geese ""gradually vanishing into the distance,"" she reflected upon herself. ""When they return,"" Saeng will also resume her schooling. ""The geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" signifies that Saeng will return to school as a transformed individual. ""This hibiscus is budding"" indicates that Saeng is still evolving, akin to the hibiscus. Subsequently, she will retake the test as it represents a fresh start and a new beginning for her. Spring serves as an archetype of rebirth and a new existence. Just as the flowers will flourish and commence a new life, so will Saeng."
374	9237	4	1	"Saeng made a solemn vow to herself that when the hibiscus recommences budding, she will retake the test. The hibiscus symbolizes hope for Saeng, suggesting that a second attempt can yield positive outcomes. The author concludes the story with this vow as it embodies Saeng's final glimmer of hope. For instance, the hibiscus provided solace to her in a foreign country with unfamiliar surroundings and also articulates her emotions. Her vow demonstrates her resolve not to succumb despite her initial setback. As exemplified by the quote, ""Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral"" (Ho), this elucidates the profound significance the plant held for her. This is the reason the author concluded the story with a vow."
375	9238	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination. Her family left behind a great deal in Vietnam. She retained the memories of her grandmother and the hibiscus. In the new location, they are grappling with difficulties, as implied by the mother's reaction to the cost. The hibiscus she purchased served as a source of comfort. She opines that if the plant can endure the harsh winter conditions, she can persevere despite the disparities in the new location. Passing the driver's exam is a common achievement and a means for her to acclimate to her surroundings and integrate.
376	9239	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this statement as it demonstrates the girl's willingness to surmount obstacles. Despite potentially having faltered once in @MONTH1, she will persist in her efforts. Moreover, it reveals a connection between the geese, the hibiscus, and the girl's aspiration to overcome her challenges. Additionally, the girl desires to overcome her obstacle at a specific juncture.
377	9240	4	1	In the concluding paragraph, when she stated that she would retake the test in the spring, a time when all the snow thaws and the hibiscus blossoms, she made this declaration because it is her preferred season of the year. Consequently, she will feel more self - assured during that period. For instance, when she discusses the Madagascar hibiscus that thrives through bricks, her affection for hibiscuses is evident. Thus, she wishes to take the test when she is at her best.
378	9241	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author concluded the story with that paragraph to convey to readers that Saeng is a survivor, much like the hibiscus. Saeng has yet to fully acclimate to America and perceives that this plant evokes memories of her homeland.
379	9242	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because spring symbolizes a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test, she desires to embark on a fresh start in the spring, mirroring the rejuvenation of flowers. Despite the hibiscus currently withering, she knows it will regenerate. The arrival of spring is a time for renewal, a period when new life emerges, flowers are in bloom, and a new chapter commences.
380	9243	4	1	The author concludes the sentence in this way to illustrate that Saeng is an extremely determined young woman. Regardless of the number of times she fails, she consistently perseveres until she achieves success. By doing so, the author showcases Saeng's beliefs: that no matter how arduous or substantial the challenge, she will continue until she completes what she has initiated. Moving was an arduous experience for her; she struggled to communicate with others and found it difficult to make friends, as being the new one is never easy. Relocating made her view things differently. However, as time passed, she mastered the situation. This is what the author intended to convey by concluding the story in this way: as long as one tries, success can be attained.
381	9244	4	1	"In the narrative, a young girl named Saeng undertakes an examination but unfortunately fails. She intends to retake it the following spring. This is why the last paragraph states: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is in bud, then I will take the test again."" The author concludes the story with this ending. In the story, it mentions the hibiscus flowers. Thus, instead of simply stating she will retake the test next spring, it says when the hibiscus flowers bud, which will be springtime."
382	9245	4	1	The author concludes the story in such a manner to convey to the readers that the daughter, Saeng, will return and retake the test. She has a profound affection for the garden; consequently, she will not forget the rejuvenating effect spring has had on her.
383	9246	4	1	It demonstrates her deep - seated affection for her plants. The narrative elaborates on all the plants and her fondness for them. She perceives them as all being distinct and finds greater enjoyment in the plants than in school or any other aspect of her life.
384	9247	4	1	"Minfong, who concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph, does so because it showcases @CAPS1's resolve to achieve success in her new country despite the impediments she encounters. The winter hibiscus serves as a reminder for Saeng to be as resilient as the hibiscus that endures winter. In Saeng's case, it means passing the driving test. The text states, ""....but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus...."" (Ho @NUM1). Saeng realizes that she, too, must be ""strong"" like the ""winter hibiscus."" She also comes to the realization that she is beginning to acclimate to the new country, as she writes, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become almost familiar..."" (Ho @NUM1). Saeng is aware that she can adapt and is determined to succeed. The author concludes, ""..in the spring, the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho @NUM1). The ""spring"" will mark Saeng's new start."
385	9248	4	1	"In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, penned by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative with the final paragraph as he aims to convey that when the flower revives and commences a new phase, Saeng will embark on a fresh start by retaking the test. For instance, ""Look how root - bound it is, poor thing"" indicates that the plant was on the verge of withering when she purchased it. Another example, ""I - I failed the test,"" reveals her dejection over failing the examination. So, in @CAPS1, both the flower and Saeng reached their ""breaking points."" The paragraph details how @CAPS2 was going to take a respite and await the flower's recovery before retaking the test."
386	9249	4	1	The author appended the final paragraph as Saeng's vow enables the reader to empathize with Saeng and her anguish, while also appreciating her optimism that circumstances will improve. I interpret the vow as indicating that once normalcy is restored, her situation in this new country will significantly ameliorate. The spring represents normalcy as the place she considers home, where normalcy prevails, is adorned with beautiful flowers, akin to spring. The melting snow symbolizes the dissipation of pain. The return of the geese signifies that Saeng is aware that things will get better, just as she knows the geese will return in spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which stand for happiness, so she will be more content when conditions improve.
387	9250	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this sentence as the young girl, Saeng, desires to retake the test and also wishes for her hibiscus to remain robust and continue flourishing. Consequently, she states that she will retake the test when her hibiscus commences blooming once more. This conclusion reflects Saeng's connection between the growth of the hibiscus and her own readiness to face the test again, demonstrating her determination and the symbolic significance she attributes to the plant.
388	9251	4	1	"Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho delves into an individual's pursuit of acceptance and adjustment to life's transformations. Saeng, the protagonist in the story, is grappling with her recent relocation from her Asian homeland to America. After failing a test, Saeng expends a considerable sum of money on a flower. When she seeks solace from her mother, Saeng silently makes a vow to herself. She vows, ""When they return in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese come back and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test."" @CAPS1 Ho chose to conclude the story in this manner as it epitomizes the journey of adaptation. Individually, Saeng was able to make a vow that revealed her acceptance of her new foreign abode in America, despite her enduring remembrance of her homeland."
389	9252	4	1	The author concludes this paragraph in the article because Ron is infatuated with the plant and utilizes it as a time - keeper to determine when she can take the test. If one is not a @CAPS1.S citizen, they are only permitted to take the driver's test once a year. This conclusion ties together Ron's unique relationship with the plant and the regulatory constraint regarding the driver's test, highlighting the significance of the plant in Ron's decision - making process.
390	9253	4	1	"The rationale for the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph is that Saeng aspires to undertake something beneficial for herself. I assert this because the last paragraph states, ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" which implies that she is striving for what is optimal for her well - being. This conclusion showcases Saeng's self - awareness and her proactive approach towards achieving personal growth and contentment."
391	9254	4	1	Saeng is under the impression that having failed the driving test, she will be unable to transition in a new country as she embarks on a quest to uncover her past. In plants, she discovers her past, recalling Vietnam in profound sorrow. The narration posits, “A wave of such depth and intensity that it pricked Saeng's eyes...” (No). She reminisces about and yearns for everything she once had; she longs for her country, her grandmother, and her former life. She returned home to her mother with a plant, disappointing her mother with the expense, yet her mother comprehends her pain. The narration states, “It's a beautiful plant,” she finally uttered sorrowfully, “you got it.” (No). Eventually, Saeng realizes the impact this plant has on her and how effortlessly it endures, and she makes a vow to herself. The narration states, “And if this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.”
392	9255	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is to illustrate or accentuate that if the hibiscus, a plant evoking memories of her homeland, can persevere, so can she. In the story, after the author failed her driving test and was on her way home, the sight of the flowers rekindled memories of home and connected her to her past, alleviating her sense of solitude. For instance, when the author remarks, “A wave of loss so profound and intense that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her.” This indicates her longing for home, and the flower provided a profound connection to her recollections. Additionally, when she says, “like the geese in the distinctive V against the sky,” it shows that the geese, much like her, were migrating to a new place to commence anew. This made her believe that if they could adapt and change, she too would be able to do so over time. In conclusion, the ending serves to further emphasize her sentiments towards her hometown and the new town she inhabits.
393	9256	4	1	The author concludes the story in such a manner as to draw parallels with the concepts of adaptation, change, and starting afresh. For example, geese migrate when the weather turns cold but always return, giving their habitat another opportunity. The hibiscus is another prime example; it typically buds on @DATE1 and endures the winter without perishing. It always makes a comeback. Saeng has evidently grasped this and pledged to retake her driver's test, as she believes it may yield a different outcome this time. The author aims to convey the message of “do not surrender.”
394	9257	4	1	Determination, assistance, and fortitude—these are the factors that lead me to believe the author concludes the story with the given paragraph. Firstly, determination is a key reason why Saeng will revisit and retake the test. Saeng failed her driver's test on the initial attempt and intends to bide her time and try again. She is resolute in taking alternative measures to pass the test. Secondly, I believe that assistance is a crucial factor behind the author's choice of this concluding paragraph. Saeng will require support to pass the test, and she believes that the hibiscus plant will aid her in not only passing the test but also in other endeavors. The author is demonstrating that she will return and be well - prepared. Finally, fortitude is the last significant factor for the author's selection of this paragraph to end the story. Saeng believes that the hibiscus plant will endow her with the strength to pass the test. The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will return and emerge stronger than before. These are the reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
395	9258	4	1	Mingfong Ho concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with the passage, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This concluding paragraph reveals that Saeng will not abandon her struggle to acclimate to this new environment. Saeng has endured arduous times, including relocating to the United States and failing her driver's test. In the greenhouse, Saeng even succumbs to her emotions and weeps. The hibiscus flower that Saeng purchased imposed a significant financial burden on the family, yet it held great significance for Saeng. This flower symbolized hope. When the flower blooms again, it will signify the opportune moment for her to retake her driver's test. The flower also represents the process of adapting to a new place. Just as Saeng adjusts to life in the United States, the hibiscus adapts to the new garden. This mutual adaptation showcases the resilience and hope that Saeng can draw upon in her new life.
396	9259	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the transformation of Saeng. Initially, Saeng was averse to taking the test and lacked self - assurance. Throughout the story, Saeng's mother provided unwavering support, understanding even when Saeng purchased a plant for @MONEY1 as it evoked memories of her homeland. After receiving comfort, Saeng has become more at ease and is now both prepared and more confident to retake the test. Thus, Saeng has undergone a notable change.
397	9260	4	1	The author concludes the story with the statement “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author selected this ending to convey the importance of maintaining faith. Throughout the narrative, Saeng remained somewhat nostalgic for her homeland, which might have influenced her performance on the driving test. If she were to wait a season or two, her homesickness would likely dissipate, enabling her to focus on achieving her goal. The longing for her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have had a significant impact on her, possibly contributing to her driving test failure. Another possible reason for the author's choice of ending is to alleviate the somber mood. Saeng's breakdown in the greenhouse had a profoundly melancholic atmosphere, and her vow to retake the test in spring serves to instill hope for her future.
398	9261	4	1	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to convey that the protagonist was unable to focus on the test due to her intense longing to return to her native country. This ending provides insight into the character's emotional state during the test and emphasizes the powerful pull of home on her psyche, effectively wrapping up the story's exploration of the character's internal conflict.
399	9262	4	1	The author likely concluded the story in this manner to convey the sense that Saeng will return and offer further assistance. Evidently, Saeng has an affinity for planting. Now that she has witnessed the potential positive outcomes of helping, it is highly probable that she will assist her mother with a greater variety of tasks. This ending suggests a growth in Saeng's sense of responsibility and connection to her family, thus rounding off the story's exploration of her character development.
400	9263	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with Saeng's thoughts. The idea of attempting the test when the hibiscus begins to bud serves to unify the narrative. The story primarily revolves around her search for a flower and the memories it evokes. However, she would not have visited the shop had she passed the test. This connection fosters a comprehensive understanding of the test and the hibiscus, highlighting the flower's significance. Both Saeng and the hibiscus are in unfamiliar circumstances and must adapt to survive. Saeng hails from Vietnam, and the flower is from a shop; both have been displaced to a new environment. In several respects, Saeng can be likened to the flower. She must adapt to her new home to thrive, just as the flower, exposed to the cold, must adapt to its surroundings. When Saeng realizes that the flower has survived the harsh winter, she will recognize that she, too, can endure life in @LOCATION2, giving her a sense of strength and focus.
401	9264	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the final paragraph presents a solemn vow by the protagonist, Saeng, to retake her driver's examination when spring arrives and her hibiscus begins to bud. The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it infuses a glimmer of hope into the poignant tale. It implies that Saeng will overcome her distress and transcend her yearning for her native country. “And in the warm, humid sanctuary of the greenhouse, Saeng succumbed to her emotions and wept.” Saeng was deeply sorrowful and forlorn. Every flower served as a poignant reminder of her homeland. She was despondent and homesick. Upon her return home, she planted a hibiscus in the frigid soil; when it blossoms in spring, it will symbolize a new beginning and a fresh opportunity. This signifies that Saeng will not abandon her hopes. Minfong Ho concludes “Winter Hibiscus” on an optimistic note with the last paragraph.
402	9265	4	1	The rationale behind concluding the story with Saeng's silent vow - “In the spring, when the snows recede, the geese return, and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will take that test again” - is to introduce an element of suspense. Implicitly, it suggests that Saeng has consumed all the plant, and thus, in the coming year, she will take the test without repeating such an act. This is precisely why the author chose to end the story in this manner.
403	9266	4	1	The author brings the story to a close with this paragraph. For instance, it imparts a positive and joyous denouement to the narrative, effectively concluding the story on an upbeat note.
404	9267	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to evoke in the reader a sense that the protagonist, Saeng, is on the verge of achieving something significant, symbolized by the hibiscus and the geese. An illustration of her accomplishments associated with the hibiscus is when the author recounts how she and her grandmother used to share quality time, engaging in various activities together. Her grandmother would style her hair and adorn it with a hibiscus flower. Moreover, the geese serve as a symbol of achievement. As she witnesses them soaring southward in the sky, they are embarking on a journey to a warmer climate to endure the harsh winter months, representing the successful pursuit of survival.
405	9268	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it serves to delineate the story's resolution. By doing so, the author ensures that readers are apprised of the outcome, thereby providing a sense of closure to the narrative.
406	9269	4	1	"The author culminates the story with this paragraph to conclude it on an upbeat note. Saeng's predicament is the ""tide of loss"" that engulfs her when she reminisces about her homeland. The entire narrative addresses Saeng's disheartening battle to discover happiness in her life in a novel, unfamiliar, and seemingly inhospitable country. This sense of loss and solitude is exacerbated by the test that Saeng failed. After a tale fraught with such gloom, the author showcases Saeng's newly - found self - assurance and hopefulness by ending the story with this paragraph."
407	9270	4	1	She concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she intends to convey to the story's readers that she is disinclined to abandon her efforts and is prepared to retake the test and achieve success.
408	9271	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that she has acclimated to her new abode. Moreover, it brings the story to a close, thus revealing her final musings to the reader. It is akin to the last thought, the ultimate topic, that one might associate with the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph: ""When they return, in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese reappear and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake that test."
409	9272	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as he desires to gauge the public's reaction.
410	9273	4	1	This adage implies that the snow has already descended upon their garden, and once it melts, they will be compelled to replant everything. This serves as an ideal denouement for the story. The narrative revolves around the growth of flowers in spring and how Saeng's mother cultivates fruits and vegetables in her garden. Given that it has snowed and there will be a considerable interval before spring returns, Saeng has extensive planning to undertake for the upcoming spring. The hibiscus will be in bloom, and the geese will make their return.
411	9274	4	1	In the narrative, I surmise that the author concludes the paragraph with this story as Saeng asserts that upon her return or the subsequent sighting of the hibiscus in bloom, she will undertake the test. Until then, she experiences a sense of displacement and deems herself unavailing within the present circumstances. She feels discomforted, and she believes that she will not achieve success until she is in her familiar abode, where it is harmonious for her.
412	9275	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph to demonstrate that she will return to a particular place and refrain from succumbing to emotional breakdown. Instead, she will come to terms with her losses and adapt to the changes.
413	9276	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as when snow falls, plants perish and will not regenerate until the snow thaws, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud. Then, she will observe how her garden will fare in the spring. Consequently, the author places this paragraph at the end because Saeng has a profound passion for gardening since her relocation to the United States. Since the family's move to the United States, they have been extremely content, enjoying dinners together and engaging in gardening. They relished every moment of planting.
414	9277	4	1	If one has ever had to relocate from their hometown or country, they understand the comforting nature of something from their former homeland in their new one. The fact that Saeng had geese, plants, and other elements provided her with sufficient solace to know that she can take the test the following spring. Throughout the story, it appeared that everything Saeng encountered, which she had in her native country of Vietnam, in some manner warmed and comforted her. Early in the narrative, it depicts her emotions as she traverses the greenhouse. Multiple times in the story, one could discern a sense of affection when she referred to plants by their native - language names. Throughout the story, one could consistently perceive the love and care she harbored. The author is aware of her fondness for these things and that they would inspire her. Hence, that is why he concluded the story in such a way.
415	9278	4	1	The author concludes this paragraph with the story due to the potential of the hibiscus. Thus, regardless of having previously taken and failed the test, Saeng will retake it. She is analogous to the hibiscus, which seems out of place yet is resolute to survive once the snow melts. Therefore, she will retake the test and utilize the hibiscus as her motivation.
416	9279	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” as the author intended the reader to observe the profound bond between the mother and the child through gardening. Amidst the various statements the author made regarding Saeng and Saeng's mother, the author demonstrated a means by which they had formed a connection, namely Saeng and her mother. I believe the manner in which the author crafted this story was quite ingenious. It was a rather captivating tale that kept one in suspense, speculating at the end of the year, filled with wonder. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story. I also appreciated the strong friendship between the daughter and the mother. It was heart - warming to witness the close rapport between them. Moreover, through this, the author revealed some of his thought processes. The author showcases a brilliant mind and sound thinking. This author is sharing a remarkable story of a girl and her mother, which sounded truly excellent to me. This story is about a gardening experience of a daughter and her mother who migrated from Vietnam to @ORGANIZATION1 to spend the remainder of their lives.
417	9280	4	1	There may be numerous reasons why the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph. It might be due to Saeng's desire to pass the test immediately to bring joy to her mother. It could also stem from the fact that she will require the ability to drive in the subsequent year for some purpose. Perhaps it is because it incurs expenses for her to keep retaking the test. Nevertheless, she holds a deep affection for her hibiscus.
418	9281	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate that Saeng is a resolute individual. It is symbolic that when the geese return, she will retake the test, as she had failed when they departed. The melting snow and the budding hibiscus signify spring, and spring typically represents the onset of a fresh and novel beginning. The last paragraph serves as a symbol for starting anew. Saeng was distressed about failing the test; “She said, ‘I – I failed the test.’” Her stuttering indicates her distress. Given her distress, it is prudent to allow time before she retakes the test. The author ended the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng is resilient and will embark on a fresh and new start.
419	9282	4	1	I perceive that the author concludes the story with the paragraph to convey that Saeng discovered a certain degree of solace in the flower. It also indicates that Saeng was not going to abandon her efforts and would persevere. Initially, she was sorrowful and dejected, but upon seeing the flower that reminded her of home, she became cheerful and did not feel as despondent about failing the test. The flower had a profound influence on her as it evoked memories of home. When she began to think about her grandmother, she grew somewhat sad, yet when she reflected on the flower and its significance to her, she derived comfort from it. I believe the author concludes the story in a positive and favorable way.
420	9283	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with the paragraph to instill hope in us. Saeng is going to retake the test she failed. Saeng is encountering difficulties in adapting to her new life. By waiting until the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is in bloom, Saeng grants herself time to acclimate and recuperate. The paragraph showcases Saeng's bravery and optimism regarding retaking the test.
421	9284	4	1	In truth, I am not entirely certain. Perhaps it is because she now feels a sense of assurance. It could be a psychological trial that all of us are bound to confront. Moreover, the return of the geese and the budding of the plants might also serve as a metaphorical test.
422	9285	4	1	The author opts to conclude the narrative with this paragraph to convey the themes of acceptance and perseverance. Saeng exhibits a profound attachment to the hibiscus plant as, for her, it symbolizes her homeland and all that she has left behind. This final line holds multiple significances. The melting of the snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus all signify a period of rejuvenation and fresh starts. The fact that Saeng desires to retake her test demonstrates how obstacles can be surmounted and goals attained.
423	9286	4	1	The story concludes in this manner because that is how the author intends for the girl's narrative to end. Since she has a deep affinity for flora, fauna, and all living organisms, she particularly favors the Madagascar periwinkle. The locations where she once resided are replete with plants, animals, and flowers, which ultimately influence the story's conclusion.
424	9287	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the tale with a paragraph that evokes emotions. The paragraph reveals that the girl, Saeng, is resolute in passing the test. For instance, the text states, “If the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This indicates that despite failing it once, she will not allow that set - back to impede her progress. The girl also subtly expresses her sentiments towards the geese and the plant. As the text mentions, “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” This implies that she does not regret purchasing the hibiscus, further highlighting her positive connection to these natural elements.
425	9288	4	1	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” in this fashion as she is cultivating a sense of optimism that Saeng harbors for the future. Saeng was deeply despondent while walking home after failing her driver's test. The author depicts this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold conditions symbolize Saeng's loss of hope. When she arrives home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother remarks that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This symbolizes Saeng's ability to persevere as well. At the story's end, Saeng spots geese and realizes that “many of the things she had once regarded as peculiar had, through the consistent recurrence of seasons, become nearly familiar to her.” This illustrates that she is truly adapting to her new home and has hope for the arrival of spring, the return of the geese, and the blooming of the hibiscus.
426	9289	4	1	Her objective in hunting was to capture them; this was the entirety of her goal and purpose. She was attempting to catch geese, having witnessed her grandparents endeavor to do so. Consequently, this is the reason she made that final statement.
427	9290	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she desires readers to comprehend that she did not abandon the plant and that she is resolute. For instance, the story states that Saeng said, “I - I failed the test.” She felt as if she had not achieved what she intended. Thus, at the story's conclusion, she declared, “I will take that test again.” This demonstrates the kind of person she is, and she will not simply surrender because she failed the first time.
428	9291	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because during spring, all things are reborn, and by spring, Saeng will have acclimated to her surroundings. An illustration of this is when the author states, “She realized that many of the things she had once regarded as strange had, through the quiet recurrence of season after season, become nearly familiar to her.” This implies that with each season, she becomes more accustomed to her new home, and it becomes more like her. Another instance is when the author writes, “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.” This evokes memories of her old home as she watches the geese.
429	9292	4	1	In the story, Saeng is compelled to adapt to an abrupt transformation when her family relocates from Vietnam to the United States. The narrative details how various elements in the new location trigger recollections of her life in Vietnam. The penultimate paragraph discusses the hibiscus, the geese, and the changing seasons. The final paragraph summarizes all these aspects and explains that as everything familiar to her from Vietnam is symbolized in the new location, she will persist in her efforts, such as learning to drive, and ultimately adapt to the changes the new location has brought. This indicates that Saeng can surmount the challenges presented by the new country and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the story's conclusion because it reflects the themes of change and adaptation throughout the narrative, with a particular emphasis on reflection. The author takes the time to elucidate how each individual element in the story reminds Saeng of her old home. In an attempt to elevate the story's tone from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author revisits each element in the final paragraph, demonstrating that there is hope for Saeng and her family.
430	9293	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it portrays Saeng as a compassionate individual towards nature. This can be inferred from the quote, “One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.” This quote indicates that she cares about the minutiae of nature. Another quote that showcases Saeng's compassion for nature is, “She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.” This reveals that Saeng is extremely caring towards a small plant, which is a part of nature. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with the aforementioned paragraph to illustrate that Saeng is a compassionate person towards nature.
431	9294	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it aids in elucidating the significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus holds great importance for her and her culture. In the presence of hibiscus, Saeng perceives that she can accomplish anything. This is the reason she initially failed the test. Consequently, she asserts that the subsequent time she takes the test, she will derive the strength from the hibiscus to facilitate her passing the test.
432	9295	4	1	This indicates that she has not relinquished her efforts and intends to strive diligently to adapt and thrive in this new territory. It concludes a sorrowful tale with a felicitous ending. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope, as does spring. This renders the entire scenario one of optimism; without this segment, the story would be melancholy, but with it, it becomes a narrative of hope. The manner in which the remainder of the story is recounted suggests that this is a turning point or a conclusion to the entire ordeal. It is a semblance of resolution without a definitive resolution.
433	9296	4	1	The author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate that after all the turmoil and disarray, she recognizes that it will require time to adjust. She realizes that given time to recuperate and commence anew, she will be prepared, much like the plant.
434	9297	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as she desires to set a future goal for herself. She aspires to pass the test and will exert great effort to achieve this next year. For instance, her mother was irate when she failed the test but soon forgot about it. Saeng, however, did not forget about her failure. She dedicated herself to the hibiscus as she adores that plant and would do anything for it.
435	9298	4	1	The author concludes the passage with this sentence to illustrate that in order to achieve success, one must persevere. Saeng will gradually adapt to her new country, but not if she squanders her time yearning to return to her homeland. The hibiscus serves as a reminder for her to initiate a new chapter and assimilate into society. Saeng will retake her driver's test when the plant blossoms again, commencing its life cycle afresh.
436	9299	4	1	She asserts that she will retake the test subsequent to the snow's thaw in the spring. Thus, she can observe the geese and the budding hibiscus while taking her test and endeavor to achieve a passing score.
437	9300	4	1	"The author concludes this narrative with this paragraph as it reflects Saeng's emotional state. She felt a profound connection to the geese and the hibiscus. ""She had raised her head and witnessed as their distinctiveness was imprinted,"" ""almost familiar to her at present."" She will retake the test in the spring. The hibiscus and the blossoms will uplift her spirits in the spring, enabling her to pass the test."
438	9301	4	1	"The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate how the hibiscus flower deeply permeated Saeng's life, endowing her with newly discovered courage and fortitude. For instance, while returning home after failing her driver's examination, Saeng encounters a flower and remarks, ""[I] felt a jolt of recognition so intense, it was nearly visceral."" This demonstrates the profound bond between Saeng and the hibiscus, and it is this connection that will sustain her through arduous times. Subsequently, Saeng enters a flower shop and identifies all the flowers there from her childhood. She realizes that her former residence boasted all these flowers, and Saeng harnesses this link to her past to further bolster her courage in adapting to her new life. Another example is when the text states, ""She realized that many of the things she once regarded as peculiar had become... almost familiar to her now."" Saeng arrives at this realization by listening to her mother discuss how the hibiscus flower, which typically thrived in her old home, would be able to survive here. She comprehends that she, too, will be capable of doing so and will no longer perceive things like the large @CAPS1 here as strange. In this manner, the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage, and strength."
439	9302	4	1	"When they return,"" Saeng silently vowed to herself. ""In the spring, when the snow dissipates and the geese reappear and the hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake the test."" This implies that upon their return, she must complete the test so that they need not fret about it later. During their journey, they encountered a plethora of diverse phenomena. The soil was frigid and compact, rendering it unworkable. She felt as though she was stepping into another realm, a sweltering, humid world teeming with verdure. @CAPS1 friends and countless shades and forms proliferated in an apparently haphazard profusion. And beside it stood yet another old acquaintance, a diminutive shrub with waxy foliage and delicate blossoms featuring purplish petals and white centers. It was already twilight when Saeng reached home. The wind was howling, tearing away the last remnants of green from the chicory weeds that sprouted through the cracks in the sidewalk. Evidently, they witnessed a multitude of things on their journey, sights they had never beheld before, such as the weeds growing through the sidewalk."
440	9303	4	1	I surmise that the author incorporates this to showcase an unwavering determination to pass this test regardless of the circumstances.
441	9304	4	1	The author may conclude the narrative with this as it demonstrates that the girl possessed confidence that upon the flower's blooming, she would be capable of passing. In her homeland, that flower held significant meaning for her, and it continues to do so. Evidently, this flower instills hope and pride in her. She once picked it alongside her grandmother and adorned her hair with it. Thus, when she beholds the flower, she will reminisce about her grandmother, which will inspire her to persevere. The flower is resilient and can endure winter conditions, so the girl is resolute that when the flower blossoms, she will be able to pass the test.
442	9305	4	1	The author concludes the story with “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because she aspired to cultivate hibiscus during the winter season. She had experienced failure on her initial attempt and sought to redeem herself on the subsequent try. Unwilling to fail once more, she adopted different approaches. She meticulously planted it and firmly patted the soil around the plant. This is the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with that paragraph.
443	9306	4	1	The girl's declaration that she will retake the test when the hibiscus blossoms indicates her longing for her country and her desire to maintain a connection. When she takes the test as the plant flowers, it is akin to receiving support from her homeland. The plant symbolizes her progress as her development parallels that of the plant. When she first obtained it, she was not prepared to venture out and engage in activities; she had not fully adapted to the environment, much like the hibiscus, which was not acclimated to the weather and had to await [DATE1] to bloom.
444	9307	4	1	“then I will take that test again” [NUM1] Saeng's overarching objective throughout the story was to undertake the test and achieve success. However, “[I - CAPS1] failed the test,” [Ho, NUM2] which served as the unifying element of the entire narrative. She yearned for solace and sought comfort in the “[CAPS2 Malik]” [Ho, NUM3]. This sight rekindled all the memories of her life “back home” [NUM1], which sustained her determination. Consequently, a bond with her mother emerged, and it kindled a new day of hope for her future in her new abode. Sufficient hope for her to proclaim, “when they come back in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
445	9308	4	1	The author concluded the story with this sentence as it serves as an effective conclusion. It is a fitting conclusion because it concludes by revealing what she intends to do. This is advantageous as it illustrates that Saeng had finally recognized that she must take the test, despite her profound appreciation for nature.
446	9309	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concluded the narrative with this passage as it indicates that Saeng intends to attempt the test once more. The author aimed to demonstrate that Saeng was not going to abandon the pursuit, for once the matter most significant to her was resolved, she would then retake the test. In the story, it is stated that ""Saeng did not dare meet her mother's gaze. Instead, she fixed her eyes on the hibiscus, which held great importance."
447	9310	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" it concludes with the statement, ""When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese reappear and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test."" The author concludes the story with this quote as the author perceives spring as a fresh start. The author understands the necessity of hard work and the need to commence anew. For instance, some students who fail the second semester view winter as an opportunity for a fresh beginning."
448	9311	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the winter season, and due to the snow, she is unable to take any action. The snow has made it such that she will have to take the test in the spring, thus bringing the story's circumstances to a point where the test is deferred until more favorable conditions.
449	9312	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has surmounted an impediment in her life and is learning to progress forward. In the story, Saeng frequently dwells on past recollections rather than creating new ones. For example, when Saeng visits the florist shop to acquire the plant, she begins to recall old memories from her homeland. When she spots the plant labeled ""jasmine,"" she thinks of her deceased grandmother and remembers how she used to adorn her hair with jasmine blossoms. Additionally, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is ""not an authentic one"" and also remarks that it is ""not like the kind we had previously."" Consequently, she constantly compares her new life to her old life in her homeland and does not allow her new experiences to be as fulfilling as her old ones. However, when the author concludes the story with that paragraph, it showcases the growth of the girl, Saeng, and her willingness to move on and create new memories, such as attempting to pass her driving test again."
450	9313	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the story is approaching its conclusion. The author adds that poignant touch, suggesting that it will regain strength and the exquisite flowers will bloom. This conveys to the readers that nature will persist, and the seasons will cycle back around, leaving the story with a sense of hope and continuity.
451	9314	4	1	This passage @NUM1 is included to inform the reader that it is winter. One can discern that it is winter because the passage mentions when the snow melts.
452	9315	4	1	Tisaeng failed her driver's examination after she went to “flour is it and bought” a plant. It was the “dok faeng ñ noi,” and she held cherished recollections regarding the plant. She recalled it from Vietnam and how it used to be ubiquitous at all times. She purchased “@CAPS1 hibiscus” as a source of solace for herself. The final paragraph states, “When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will take the test once more.” Saeng realized that events transpire for a purpose and opportunities present themselves repeatedly. Just as the geese migrate south and @CAPS2 as the seasons transform. She resolved that she would retake the test the next time she has an opportunity.
453	9316	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bloom, then I will take that test again.” To illustrate that the character has assimilated into her new surroundings. Similar to the environment, she is continuously undergoing transformations, and in the spring when all things that could not reach their peak during winter commence to flourish, she will as well. And when she begins to thrive and feels like her former self again, then she will be prepared to take the driving test and succeed. She will have reverted to her old self like the geese returning home when she has ceased weeping like the snow has finished melting, and when she has stopped crying like the snow has melted, and when she is ready to open up, just as the hibiscus starts to bud, she will be ready to take the test.
454	9317	4	1	Throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author conveys a sense of hope and comfort that Saeng derives when she reflects on the past. To sustain this sense of hope, the final sentence implies that Saeng will be in a more favorable position than she was at the onset of the story. For instance, at the beginning of the story, Saeng felt alienated, solitary, and out of place in her new country. However, as the story progresses, she begins to attain a sense of tranquility and assurance that her future will be more promising with the passage of time and her burgeoning confidence. In conclusion, the author employs the last sentence to evoke a feeling of hope for Saeng's future and her growing self - assurance.
455	9318	4	1	The significance of the last phrase is to determine whether the winter hibiscus can reseed and endure all circumstances to blossom into a flower for the year and repeat the cycle.
456	9319	4	1	Minfong Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to convey hope and rejuvenation for the character Saeng. Spring symbolizes birth and renewal, offering Saeng a second opportunity. Previously, she had failed what appears to be a significant test (possibly her citizenship test), which motivated her to attempt to recall her past, a past she deeply yearns for. The winter hibiscus seems to represent herself, as evidenced by this: “it’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng murmured; she was still too tremulous to utter the words at home, fearing she would break down in tears once more. “Not like the kind we had before,” her mother said softly. “Its flowers aren’t as lovely, but it’s resilient enough to endure the frigid months here, this winter hibiscus. That is what matters.” This precisely depicts Saeng’s situation—she is not the same, as joyous as she once was, yet she can persevere through difficult times and blossom in the spring to retake the test. This exemplifies the purpose of the last paragraph in “Winter Hibiscus,” which is to showcase the renewal and hope that Saeng will encounter.
457	9320	4	1	I surmise that this sentence was selected as the concluding sentence because it demonstrates that Saeng can succeed in the test. Despite being away from her native land, she retains the capability to accomplish tasks. Just as the plant that evokes memories of home reappears and commences growth, Saeng will follow suit. I believe it is an apt sentence to conclude with, leaving the reader pondering whether she will pass the test.
458	9321	4	1	She concludes the story with that because the flower bestows upon her strength. It instills hope in her and reminds her of her homeland. In her native place, such flowers were ubiquitous; thus, she had to purchase this one. She planted it so that it could thrive throughout the winter. After winter, the flower flourishes, and she passes her driver's test. As a reward, her mother acquires a genuine Vietnamese flower for her.
459	9322	4	1	I opine that he concludes his narrative with that paragraph because she realizes her error and desires to make amends with her mother. Additionally, she is demonstrating to her mother the depth of her affection for nature.
460	9323	4	1	I conjecture that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she initially failed her driving test and resolved within herself to retake it.
461	9324	4	1	I surmise that the author utilized that response as she was demonstrating that she had to endure another @DATE1 or engage in arduous labor in the act of planting flowers.
462	9325	4	1	The author concluded the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” in the manner she did to showcase Saeng's resolve. At one juncture in the story, the author penned, “she was still too unsteady to utter the words at home.” Saeng deeply yearned for her former life and native country. She frequently ponders when she will be able to return and relish herself, as she still struggles to adapt to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that Saeng could be portrayed as an individual who would not readily capitulate. Despite her prior difficulties, the story's denouement offers new hope for Saeng to acclimate to her new environment. Moreover, when Saeng fails the test, the concluding sentence instills new hope. Saeng informed her mother, “I failed the test,” and she was truly disheartened when she said so. The closing sentence bestows new hope upon Saeng and the reader, suggesting that she will strive harder and perform better in the spring. The author exhibits Saeng's determination to surmount failure and carve out her own niche in life. In essence, the closing sentence in “Winter Hibiscus” serves to illustrate Saeng's determination.
463	9326	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she feels an affinity for the geese and her recollections are associated with the moments when she observes the geese. I believe that her examination is in school, yet she has faith that she will pass it by recalling her memories, as she feels connected to the external world. For instance, she adores flowers. This is precisely why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
464	9327	4	1	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a profoundly spiritual and self - assured paragraph to convey that hope plays a pivotal role in our lives. In the story, “Saeng,” a foreign Chinese citizen, is captivated and awed by all the magnificent plants and natural elements within the greenhouse. She embarks on a quest to discover all the plants that evoke memories of her homeland and to correlate them with her past experiences. As she traverses the greenhouse, she softly utters and enunciates the names of the natural entities she beholds. “Saebba,” Saeng murmured, “Madagascar periwinkle,” its label declared. “How peculiar to see it in a pot,” Saeng mused. “Back home it simply grew wild!” However, as her tour progresses, she soon realizes that she is missing some of her memories and commences to weep. Upon reaching home, she is greeted by her mother. “I - I failed the test,” Saeng stated. Saeng's mother is moved by her remark and uplifts her spirits by planting the “hibiscus.” In the end, the author expresses profound sentiment by penning one final paragraph to evoke hope and emotion, signifying that everyone merits a second chance.
465	9328	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as he is essentially indicating that he will never undertake that test again. The author is depicting that the character dislikes this test and would prefer not to take it.
466	9329	4	1	The author of the narrative concludes it with a highly engaging paragraph. This paragraph delves into surmounting obstacles and encourages the reader to persevere. It is crucial to never abandon one's efforts and to persist until achieving success. In the story, Saeng had recently relocated from Vietnam and deeply yearned for it. Moreover, Saeng failed her driver's test, leaving her extremely despondent. She witnessed a flock of geese soaring above her and declared that when they return in the spring and her new plant begins to thrive, she will retake the driver's test. Geese must overcome the cold by migrating south for the winter as the frigid weather poses an impediment to them. Similarly, her new plant cannot grow until the temperature warms up. Her plant has to endure being diminutive until it can blossom in the spring. People encounter obstacles constantly. One must persevere to circumvent them.
467	9330	4	1	"The short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes as it does because the narrator recognizes that winter brings a novel chance or opportunity for a fresh start, a rebirth. One passage from the text that illustrates the narrator's hope is, ""Almost reluctantly, she realised that many of the things that she had regarded as peculiar before, through that quiet recurrence of season upon season, were almost familiar to her now"" (Ho @NUM1). This text passage reveals that she understood that many things that seemed purposeless to her before suddenly had significance. She grasped that there is a new rejuvenation in the spring. The concluding sentences state that she will retake the test in the spring. She now comprehends that she has an entirely new opportunity and life to initiate. The concluding sentence of ""Winter Hibiscus"" represents a realization of opportunity with the onset of spring."
468	9331	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate the motivation and self - assurance Saeng has acquired after her encounter with the plant. There are numerous reasons and instances that substantiate this. One reason is that the author wishes to showcase the transformation in Saeng from after her initial test to when she purchased the flower to soothe herself. For instance, after failing the driving test, Saeng visits the florist. When she beholds this plant, her childhood memories resurface, and she forgets about the test. This flower inspires her to obtain her license. Another reason is that it illustrates how this experience has instilled confidence in her. For example, after the setback, she returns proclaiming, ""... I will take the test again."" In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to depict how confident Saeng has become through her experience."
469	9332	4	1	The author concludes the story with that statement at the end because he intends to convey that Saeng will not capitulate, much like the hibiscus. For example, the hibiscus endeavors to survive the winter and blossoms anew in the spring. Saeng will also endure the hardships and commence afresh in the spring to retake the test. The author aimed to show the readers that Saeng is akin to the hibiscus in the sense that she has to start over and retry what she has failed, just as if the hibiscus had perished in the winter. By drawing this parallel, the author emphasizes Saeng's resilience and determination to overcome her setbacks.
470	9333	4	1	My response is that since the topic pertains to winter, it is indeed likely to revolve around activities such as strolling in winter and deriving enjoyment from such experiences. Winter offers a unique ambiance that can be filled with various pleasures, and these activities are often associated with the season. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the content would cover such aspects related to winter.
471	9334	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in such a manner to pique the reader's interest and convey that the events will recurrently transpire year after year.
472	9335	4	1	The author concludes the story with that specific paragraph as he intends to illustrate that the flower served as her inspiration to undertake the test previously. My rationale for this response is that throughout the narrative, @PERSON1 was consistently either tending to the hibiscus or in possession of one. Evidently, this indicated to me that she was inspired by the flower's beauty. In conclusion, the author concludes the story thusly to emphasize the significance of the Hibiscus flower to Saeng.
473	9336	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because it symbolizes the new birth that is about to occur. It is as though she is suggesting that she will enter a state of dormancy during winter, and when spring arrives and all things commence a new life cycle, so will she. Saeng “realized that many of the things she had once regarded as peculiar had, through the quiet repetition of season after season, become nearly familiar to her.” She is implying that when the new season begins, it will mark her new beginning, and she will adopt a different perspective on her new life.
474	9337	4	1	The author concludes the story in this way to comprehensively conclude all elements. The author integrated nature and its descriptions. This was done so that the reader could form a mental image of how “beautiful or serene” spring is presumably.
475	9338	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it implies that her strength will manifest when the flowers bloom, enabling her to take the test.
476	9339	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" author Minfong Ho concludes the story in that paragraph as she intends to illustrate the determination the girl within the story exhibits. Initially, the girl was unable to resist and purchased the costly flower. Nevertheless, not wanting to disappoint her mother, she was resolute to ""pass the test."" In spring, when it is time to acquire more seeds, the girl desires to be capable of buying them. Thus, the author is depicting the trait of determination that the girl embodies."
477	9340	4	1	The author concludes the story with the statement “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because the budding of the hibiscus would symbolize a new beginning, and Saeng's decision to retake the test offers her an opportunity for a fresh start and another attempt. Just as the hibiscus persists in budding, Saeng should persevere in her efforts.
478	9341	4	1	In the final paragraph of the story, the author concludes it in such a manner because the author aims to convey that the hibiscus serves as a symbol of surmounting obstacles. For instance, Saeng's mother remarks, “Its flowers aren't pretty, but it's strong enough to endure the cold months.” This symbolizes the ability to overcome obstacles as the flower withstands the harsh conditions of the cold months. In Saeng's situation, she is a girl who will thrive in a foreign country. Hence, in the last paragraph, when Saeng silently vows to herself that she will retake the driver's test when the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, she employs the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the setback of failing the test. This is why the author chose to end the story with that final paragraph.
479	9342	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as he sought to convey a sense of Saeng's determination to complete what she had initiated. She had failed the driver's test and was deeply disheartened; for example, she began to weep and had “tear - stained and puffy eyes” as she reminisced about her homeland in Vietnam, her life, memories, and family. She can identify with the geese that migrate in winter and return, and just as new beginnings commence in spring, so will she. A fresh start akin to the blossoming hibiscus, a new start for the driver's test.
480	9343	4	1	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to demonstrate the advice that since Saeng did not give up, neither should others. I believe that this paragraph describes a principle of life, which is “never give up.” Despite failing initially, Saeng remains willing to make another attempt, setting an example for perseverance.
481	9344	4	1	When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in the spring, when the snows dissolve, the geese reappear, and this hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. It is believed that the author incorporated this into the story to illustrate that one should not procrastinate. One ought to address matters as they arise. Thus, in the story, the girl serves as a negative example. It is thought that the author aimed to emphasize the importance of not doing so. Overall, including this phrase in the story was a prudent decision to attempt to demonstrate the appropriate approach to handling such specific situations.
482	9345	4	1	She ought to learn that one cannot substitute a plant with an identical one and anticipate it to be equivalent. She needs to grasp this life lesson, which is essential for her understanding of the uniqueness and irreplaceability in nature.
483	9346	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will align with nature and endeavor to assimilate into her new land. Saeng has failed her driver's test and feels alienated in her new abode. The text states, ""As Saebba nedae tall and lush. And surrounded there garden"" (No 1). When she beholds the @CAPS1, it evokes memories of her former home where she felt a sense of belonging. Now, she wishes to await the growth of that flower before retaking the driver's test. Additionally, she witnesses geese soaring overhead as she plants her flower. The author writes, ""…She realized that many of the things that she had deemed peculiar before had become…almost familiar to her how"" (No @NUM1). The return of the geese in spring will now also remind her of her new identity and how she must strive to live contentedly in her new environment. In the final paragraph, the author pens, ""I will take that test again"" (No @NUM1). This conveys the sense of Saeng attempting to initiate a fresh start in her new home."
484	9347	4	1	This is a potent sentence that exemplifies themes within the story. Saeng is resolute in trying again as she has been consoled by the symbol of her homeland. This sentence reveals the impact the plant has had on Saeng's spirit and showcases how that symbol aids in her healing. The sentence effectively concludes the story and underscores the significance of the hibiscus. In the story, @CAPS1 depicts the plant as a companion and a reminder of her homeland. Once she witnesses the plant in full bloom, she will know that she can retake the test. The paragraph serves as an excellent conclusion to the passage as it encapsulates all that the hibiscus has signified for Saeng.
485	9348	4	1	It is opined that the author intends to convey the message of never surrendering. It is also believed that the author aims to showcase the beauty of nature. The author employed this device as in the story, Saeng failed the test, yet the ending indicates that she will retake it. The story mentions the winter hibiscus she planted, which is summarized in the conclusion. The conclusion essentially implies that there will be a new beginning, emphasizing the hope and resilience associated with nature and personal perseverance.
486	9349	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” as the paragraph itself had already reached a conclusion. It essentially summarized what she intended to do once more next time since she had already undertaken it. What the author conveys through this paragraph is that when the plants复苏 in the spring, she will have to recommence all the work, which was essentially the test.
487	9350	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to apprise the readers that she does not capitulate. They may have assumed that she deemed the tests back home to be of greater significance. Hence, she would not be concerned about passing this test as she yearns for her homeland and would not care about those tests.
488	9351	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story in such a manner as a metaphor to prompt readers to think beyond the conventional or the obvious. Alternatively, the author might have ended it thus so that people can form a mental image of what she was discussing.
489	9352	4	1	The rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph is to offer you an insight into how she perceives what transpired to her. This paragraph is her way of reassuring herself that everything is well and that she will perform better next time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to endow Saeng with an air of greater self - confidence. In the middle of the story, during her conversation with her mother, she seemed lacking in self - assurance. Thus, this paragraph made her appear certain of herself, as if she knew precisely what she was going to do.
490	9353	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” I believe that the author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can regenerate and produce new flowers, Saeng should do the same. Therefore, that is the reason why the author appended that quote to the end of the story.
491	9354	4	1	"At the onset of the narrative, Saeng failed her driver's examination. Subsequently, she chanced upon a hibiscus plant and procured it as it evoked memories of her sojourn in Vietnam. As she put it, ""The familiar aroma permeated her lungs, and Saeng could almost sense the delicate strands of her grandmother's long, grey tresses."" The flower served as a poignant reminder of her grandmother. Her mother remarked, ""I've witnessed this kind blossoming along the lake. Its flowers may not be as resplendent, yet it is robust enough to endure the frigid months."" She was endeavoring to console her daughter. The text further states, ""Overhead, a flock of Canada geese soared by, their distinct honks, once foreign, now almost familiar to Saeng. She came to realize that numerous things she had previously regarded as peculiar had gradually become part of her new normal."
492	9355	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this particular paragraph as, by the end, the character realizes that the phenomena that once seemed anomalous were merely manifestations of the changing seasons and the cycle of plants. Hence, the author included this paragraph at the conclusion because, come spring, the character returns to school to retake the test, signifying a new beginning and the acceptance of these natural changes.
493	9356	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner as it indicates that upon discovering the plant, the protagonist will obtain her license, thus serving as a poignant reminder for her. Additionally, it is surmised that the author chose this approach because, much like the plant that rejuvenates when it blooms, when the protagonist decides to take another shot at the test, she is embarking on a fresh start, symbolizing renewal and the potential for success.
494	9357	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that the tranquility bestowed by the flower will bolster the protagonist's confidence, compelling her not to abandon her efforts. This is evident from the narrative where the main character fails her driving test, yet the sight of the flower evokes memories of her homeland in Vietnam. Moreover, the flower's tendency to bloom in spring and its persistent blossoming serves as a metaphor for resilience. The protagonist recognizes that just as the flower never ceases to bloom, she too should persevere. The plant imparts the strength necessary for her to attempt the test again. In essence, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to highlight the profound influence of the flower on the protagonist and her new - found determination to persevere.
495	9358	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this concluding paragraph because it amalgamates two imperfect circumstances. When the character stated, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" She aims to prove her point and resolve the situation, suggesting that by aligning her attempt with the natural cycle of renewal, she can overcome the challenges she has faced."
496	9359	4	1	The author posits that she would undertake the test anew in the spring rather than the winter, as she would be more focused, enabling her to concentrate solely on the test rather than on planting.
497	9360	4	1	I opine that she concluded the story in such a manner because throughout the entire narrative, she endeavors to exert herself diligently. The final sentence implies that the journey is not over, indicating that she will return to retake the test. She strives to validate herself throughout the book and will persist in working assiduously to attain her desires.
498	9361	4	1	In the narrative, the author concludes the story as she does due to its metaphorical nature. I assert this because she is comparing herself to the hibiscus plant. Just as a hibiscus is tested to overcome conditions like the cold, for instance, in the text, the author states, “Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus.” Similar to the hibiscus, she will bloom again and face the test of surviving the cold, thus having an opportunity to pass her own test, which is why the author concludes the story in this way.
499	9362	4	1	The concluding paragraph in the story “Winter Hibiscus” conveys the profound message of transformation from a state of cold, distant inability to adapt to a new existence. Saeng correlates her metamorphosis with the transition of seasons from winter to spring. This is evidently demonstrated as it states, “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” She embraces this as a fresh opportunity to commence anew and then attempt to pass the test. The change from winter to spring symbolizes Saeng's arduous struggle to adapt to her new home. Subsequently, as the geese return and the hibiscus adapts to its new environment, it serves as a symbol that Saeng follows. Although she is from her old home in Vietnam, she can now also thrive elsewhere.
500	9363	4	1	The author concludes the story with this passage because it has the most profound impact. The ending also conveys the most significant meaning. The significance of the last paragraph is that time will assist her in acclimating to her current place of residence. It also integrates the hibiscus flower and its potential to bloom again, which could have a dual meaning, suggesting that the author's life will also flourish once more. Overall, it is an effective way to conclude the story.
501	9364	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” I surmise that the story concludes as it does, with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This is because by setting a goal, Saeng is surmounting her disappointment and the discomfort of residing in a new country. The archetypal significance of a flower bud is prosperity, novelty, and growth. This demonstrates her development, which is crucial in life, and that is why the story ends in this manner. It is an optimistic conclusion.
502	9365	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it reveals that she has recognized her bond with the hibiscus plant. Throughout the story, Saeng contemplates the native plants she has previously witnessed that are now in @LOCATION1. She observes how they have adapted to life there, such as how the hibiscus can endure the winter. Saeng realizes that she, too, must adapt to her new abode. She does not necessarily need to adapt merely to survive but to achieve success. She vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding (reinitiating its growth cycle), she will also restart and retake the test, thereby concluding her journey of adaptation.
503	9366	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author's final paragraph illustrates the profound significance of the hibiscus to her. The author employs symbolism when discussing the hibiscus, as it is a resilient plant, much like the girl who needs to be strong to pass the driving test. The author places the paragraph at the end to convey that if the hibiscus can rejuvenate after winter, so can the girl. In summary, the author utilized the last paragraph to underscore the meaning of the hibiscus, emphasizing its role as a symbol of hope and resilience.
504	9367	4	1	The story is replete with emotion and nostalgia, rendering it somewhat melancholy. Hence, the author intended to conclude with a message of hope. After Saeng failed the test and “in the main shelter of the greenhouse (she) broke down and wept,” it is inspiring to learn that she will persevere despite all her adversities. I am acutely aware that homesickness can be quite severe, and summoning the fortitude to persevere and make the “promise to take that test again” can be extremely arduous yet rewarding. The author also employed the ending to ascribe another meaning to the hibiscus, for “when the geese return and the hibiscus is blooming,” signifying that when winter is over and difficult times have passed, there will be new hope in a fresh, beautiful spring, thus offering a glimmer of optimism in the face of hardship.
505	9368	4	1	The rationale behind the author concluding the story with that paragraph is that it essentially elucidates everything one needs to know for the ending. It essentially clarifies that she is willing to invest time in studying for the test she previously took and failed and intends to retake it once spring arrives. For instance, the geese had migrated for the winter, and once they return in the spring, she will retake the test. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it most effectively explains the denouement of the story, providing a clear and comprehensive ending to the narrative.
506	9369	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the development or optimism that Saeng harbors, indicating her potential to feel at ease in the United States. When she uttered, “I - I failed the test,” I interpreted it as a failure in the assessment to determine whether she had overcome her attachment to her homeland and if...
507	9370	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” This demonstrates that one ought to strive for what is right and what one believes in.
508	9371	4	1	Saeng aspired to exhibit her strength and resolve. She aimed to make the most of circumstances with the resources at her disposal. The significant relocation to another country had caused her to lose a substantial amount of hope. The winter exacerbated her melancholic yearning for her homeland. She purchased the flower, in a sense, to evoke a connection to her home. When spring arrives, she will rejuvenate alongside the flower and retake the test. This is her new abode with a new hibiscus. After all, winter is not conducive to a flower's flourishing.
509	9372	4	1	Saeng did experience a sense of fulfillment, yet also a twinge of longing. Purchasing an item that could offer solace but simultaneously evoke memories of her homeland. Her mother expressed mild annoyance regarding the expense. Nevertheless, Saeng vowed silently to herself that in the spring, she would retake the test.
510	9373	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I opine that the author concludes the story with that paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng possesses the confidence to undertake the driving test.
511	9374	4	1	The author concludes the narrative at that juncture as it maintains an air of suspense, leaving the reader speculating about the impending events. This encapsulates all the essential information regarding the story. The author has already divulged the significant segments, and the future unfolds as an entirely distinct tale. Whether Saeng passes the test or what transpires during the winter holds little import. The author has apprised us of all there is to know about the significance of this individual and her mother.
512	9375	4	1	Saeng experiences a sense of estrangement in her new abode and unfamiliar country. She silently pledges that within a year, she will retake the test. She vows that in the course of a year, she will acclimate to her new dwelling and country and resume savoring life. The author concludes with this paragraph as it is hoped that the girl Saeng will come to appreciate her new home, and within a year, she will grow accustomed to the happenings in her new country. Saeng merely feels out of place and desires to bide her time before attempting to retake the test. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has made a vow to herself, and it is hoped that she will uphold it and bring it to fruition.
513	9376	4	1	The author may have concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng is not inclined to cease striving; rather, she is determined to exert greater effort. As she witnesses the geese adapting, she opts to persevere and make their new home function. After they vanish, she rallies herself and declares that she is resolved to try again. By doing so, she commits herself to exploring alternative approaches to adapt to the changes.
514	9377	4	1	I surmise that she concludes the story with this paragraph because she intends to take the test at a more opportune time when it will not impose such a strenuous burden on her. The weather will be warm once more, and the cold will be less severe.
515	9378	4	1	The story reaches its conclusion with this paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, the spring season is characterized by warmth and sunshine, which contributes to ending the story on an optimistic note. Secondly, it demonstrates that Saeng can adapt to her new home, much like the hibiscus endures through the winter. Finally, it showcases Saeng's determination and her resolve not to disappoint her mother. This is why the story concludes with that paragraph.
516	9379	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate that if others can adapt, then so can she. ""In the spring, when the snows dissipate and the geese return and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will undertake that test once more."" I selected this statement as it indicates that if they can recover after all that has transpired, she can as well. She ought to be capable of adapting to a new locale just as they do."
517	9380	4	1	"Authors frequently conclude stories with paragraphs that prompt readers to ponder what unfolds next. In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, there exists an ending paragraph precisely of this nature. The author concludes it in such a manner because she is looking forward to the future. She asserts that she will take the test when the snow thaws, the geese return, and the hibiscus blossoms. She perceives it as a new beginning. She desires to start afresh. Moreover, the geese, the blooming hibiscus, and the melted snow instill in her the hope that she will pass her test. She believes that now that they have a hibiscus, it might be more reminiscent of where she once lived. Authors employ endings that arouse curiosity so that readers engage in contemplation."
518	9381	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to enable readers to comprehend the events within the narrative. For instance, when it is stated that ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself: in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" the intention is to gauge the perspectives of the characters in the story, facilitating readers' understanding of the author's intent."
519	9382	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph as both the geese and the hibiscus are elements familiar to Saeng. They evoke memories of her homeland. When these familiar entities reappear, she will possess the fortitude to retake the test and, hopefully, achieve better results. The narrator remarks, ""Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now."" This exemplifies how the geese symbolize the familiar aspects of her homeland that assist Saeng in feeling more at ease in her new abode."
520	9383	4	1	"The author incorporated that paragraph because the hibiscus plant evokes recollections of her homeland and aids her in achieving certain feats. I discern that the hibiscus hails from her native land as in the story, she utters, ""I mean, not like the kind we had at...at..."" She discovers that she is still too tremulous to articulate the words ""at home."" She yearns for her homeland, and this plant helps her revive memories of being there. Consequently, the author included that paragraph to convey to the reader her longing for her native land."
521	9384	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph, contemplating why @CAPS1 it holds significance to them regarding Saeng. It pertains to something personal about her past or her place of origin. She is attempting to convey that upon her return in the spring, she intends to retake the school test. Alternatively, she plans to replant something in the spring @CAPS1. As snow @CAPS2 and it is too frigid to plant anything. Her place of origin is truly important to her; she misses it and desires to return.
522	9385	4	1	The author concludes the story with the statement “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. She does so because, within the story, this plant has instilled in her a great deal of self - confidence to @MONTH1 perform better in the future.
523	9386	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner for several reasons. Firstly, she will have gained more experience in her new country. Since she left her homeland only a few months prior, in approximately six more months, she will be more knowledgeable about the ways of the new country. This will render her more capable of passing the @CAPS1 Ed test. Additionally, in the spring, the flower will regain its beauty, and this will endow her with new - found strength that will enable her to pass. The intervening few months will allow the author time to prepare mentally and physically for the exam. Mentally, she will be able to study and acquire all the necessary knowledge. Physically, the passage of time will also teach her new things.
524	9387	4	1	To overcome her failure, Saeng purchased a flower that evoked memories of her home. Saeng began to weep upon buying the flower as she yearned to be back home. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate that she will take the test when she feels as if she is at home. “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” Saeng murmured to herself. These elements make her feel welcome, and such a feeling will aid her in the test. The paragraph concludes the story with all the elements that make her comfortable. This conclusion helps the reader comprehend what reminds her of home and also explains the significance of the hibiscus flower to her. Buying the flower alleviates her troubles, and seeing the geese fly reminds her of her home. The author concludes the story with the memories that will assist Saeng in the future.
525	9388	4	1	I believe the author concluded this story with this ending because everyone deserves fresh starts or second chances. I surmise that the author was imparting a message suggesting that if one fails once, they should at least make another attempt. When Saeng failed the test, it appeared that her self - esteem declined. Her mother attempted to console her, and eventually, she realized that it would be unwise to give up without trying again with a fresh start.
526	9389	4	1	Minfong Ho incorporated the final paragraph in the narrative as it alluded to the notion that Saeng experienced a greater sense of well - being and confidence when recollecting her homeland. When Saeng beheld the hibiscus, she felt an emotion “so intense, it was almost visceral.” Ho employed the flower ingeniously. She noted that the winter hibiscus is robust enough to endure the frigid months, which, after reading the last paragraph, made readers surmise that this flower must endow Saeng with hope and confidence. Additionally, the geese form a V, which, one may infer, represents Vietnam to Saeng, an idea the author aims to instill in her readers. This is the rationale behind the mention of “and the geese return.” in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wishes for her readers to recognize that the objects that bring us comfort and happiness ultimately render us strong and confident. The author executed a remarkable task by inserting that concluding thought into the last paragraph as it precisely encapsulates the lesson, which is that one should engage in activities when they feel confident and at home. One may be diminutive and delicate, but if one “plants” oneself, one can flourish with self - assurance.
527	9390	4	1	The concluding paragraph of the story serves as the author's means of demonstrating Saeng's yearning for an early arrival of spring so that she can behold her hibiscus. Should spring not arrive promptly, she will be unable to see her hibiscus, and the snow will not melt. When Saeng ascends, she harbors the hope that she can undertake the test. In essence, this final paragraph effectively conveys Saeng's anticipation and the significance of spring and the hibiscus in her life.
528	9391	4	1	The author concludes the story with the sentence “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because the winter hibiscus symbolizes a fresh start for her. For instance, in her hometown, she had hibiscuses, and life was serene and ordinary; she led her life as usual. However, upon relocating to the U.S., she lacked hibiscuses, failed her driving test, felt out of place, and struggled to fit in. Thus, when she spotted the winter hibiscus, she felt as though she had discovered something that could help her feel at home or at peace. She experienced a sense of security. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that sentence because it marks a new beginning for her, and the hibiscus represents a fresh start, signifying that she can overcome her challenges and move forward.
529	9392	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it mirrors her own life, suggesting that she will have another opportunity, much like the geese that will return. The reason the last part relates to her life is that it mentions spring. Spring is typically a favorable time of the year as it grows warmer towards @DATE2, and flowers reappear. The hibiscus plant will bloom anew, which, in a sense, will rekindle her warm memories of her former home. Subsequently, that will be the opportune moment to retake the driving test she failed before purchasing the plant. The author included this final part as it seamlessly ties in with and complements the story, enhancing its overall coherence and meaning.
530	9393	4	1	The reason the author concludes the story with a single brief paragraph is that sometimes, the minutiae hold the greatest significance. The author believed that within two sentences, he could summarize the most crucial elements of the story. In my opinion, the author accomplished this task admirably. By condensing the key ideas into a concise paragraph, the author effectively emphasized the core message of the story, demonstrating that even a small portion of text can convey profound meaning.
531	9394	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph as Saeng must retake the test entirely. She believes that when the hibiscus blossoms and the snow melts (@MONTH1), there is a greater likelihood of success. Thus, Saeng intends to attempt the test after the snow has melted and the hibiscus has bloomed.
532	9395	4	1	The author concludes with this sentence for several reasons. Saeng believes she cannot succeed until spring, as that is when the geese return and the hibiscus buds. In a sense, she feels that she will also flourish in spring and be capable of passing the test.
533	9396	4	1	I surmise that the author incorporates this paragraph into the story because the grandmother might perceive it as a test to gauge what she can accomplish within @CAPS1 time. The grandmother might even exceed the expected level of productivity @CAPS2.
534	9397	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story in such a manner because @MONTH1 indicates that by that time, she will be prepared to retake the test. Another perspective is that @MONTH1 represents the time in spring when she will be well - prepared and more self - assured. Perhaps the author intended to convey that just as spring ushers in a new beginning, it will also mark a fresh start for her.
535	9398	4	1	I believe that the author concludes the story with that paragraph as Saeng asserts her intention to try again. For instance, despite failing her driving test, she resolves to retake it after the experience of planting with her mother. It appears that planting the hibiscus has instilled in her the confidence to strive for success once more. In the story, she seemed to be growing accustomed to planting. For example, having achieved something through planting, she now knows she can retake the test and attain success. In conclusion, this is why I think the author ended the story with that paragraph.
536	9399	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a thought - provoking statement as she aims to accentuate the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Similar to Saeng, the hibiscus finds itself in a novel environment and must acclimate to the surroundings. Since Saeng had recently failed her driving test, she is dejected about it. The concluding sentence makes one recognize that Saeng can surmount her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the inhospitable surroundings.
537	9400	4	1	The author incorporates this as the final paragraph as it may offer hope to Saeng's mother. It can provide hope because they genuinely require Saeng to pass the test.
538	9401	4	1	It was of utmost significance that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph. It re - established the significance of the hibiscus and its importance to Saeng. It demonstrated the determination she exhibited in overcoming the challenges of living in a new place. Without this paragraph, we would have been left speculating about Saeng's future. In some stories, such an open - ended approach might have been effective, but in this case, it was necessary. When she first beheld the hibiscus, she broke down as she could not recall her homeland. This is precisely why the hibiscus is so crucial to the story. By restating its importance at the end, it assisted the reader in understanding what was to follow, even though the story had concluded. It was essential to reiterate this. The last paragraph states, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds symbolize a new beginning for Saeng and a fresh opportunity to overcome her problems. This paragraph was highly important, and without it, these events would have remained unresolved. As a reader, the meaning of the story becomes much clearer with its inclusion.
539	9402	4	1	Including the reference to taking the test again when “the hibiscus is budding” imparts a sense of closure and a moral to an otherwise open - ended conclusion. Saeng fails the driver's test early in the narrative, and on her way home, she purchases a hibiscus. The reader does not perceive a connection until this final paragraph. The hibiscus symbolizes perseverance and fortitude. After a severe winter, this hibiscus can blossom anew and continue to thrive. Even after relocating from Vietnam and struggling to adapt, Saeng must recuperate and persevere. Just as the flower blooms again, so will Saeng. She will retake the test and succeed. She will adapt to her environment and persevere, much like the hibiscus.
540	9403	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” because the author initiated the story after Saeng failed her driving test. Saeng is reminded of her homeland by the hibiscus. After Saeng desired to have the hibiscus in the garden, “a flock of Canada geese flew by.” As they passed by, Saeng felt a sense of comfort and vowed to herself what set everything in motion. Had Saeng passed the driving test, she would never have discovered the hibiscus.
541	9404	4	1	The author incorporates this because her mother undertook the test and successfully passed it, and the daughter aspired to follow suit, just like her mother. Moreover, she can only attempt it in the spring as there are no blossoms during winter.
542	9405	4	1	I believe the author endeavors to demonstrate that Saeng is finally commencing to accept and surmount the hardships in life. It indicates that she has ultimately acclimated to @LOCATION1 and its customs, yet she has not forgotten her heritage. “But she had herself much preferred it to a big Mac.” This also validates that she will maintain a positive attitude and not allow despair to overwhelm her. She will retake it and persevere. Initially, she regarded her life circumstances with a certain perspective. However, after visiting the floral shop, she discovers a more cheerful, optimistic outlook on her situation and resolves to take action.
543	9406	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with that paragraph for multiple reasons. One reason I conjecture is that she is signifying that winter has arrived, and once winter subsides, she will resume flowering and planting. In the story, it stated, “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now…” Thus, she must await winter's departure, after which the hibiscus will commence growing and will hopefully thrive by spring. This is why I believe she concluded the story in this manner.
544	9407	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the query of “what about her test?” necessitated an answer, and that was when she felt at ease enough to undertake it. In the text, to her, the plant felt sleek and cool, just as she had anticipated, which was reassuring. She enclosed her palm around it and clasped it firmly. That, at least, she could cling to. Unlike her grandmother, she experienced a profound and intense wave of loss that pricked her eyes with sorrow and perhaps disappointment, which she might not wish to confront for some time, as hinted at in the conclusion. Her mother even emitted a small exclamation of surprise and delight upon seeing the flower, even before being astounded when Saeng reveals she paid over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I opine that she will be more at ease at the designated time because she will have both new and familiar things to return to, such as the geese and the plant.
545	9408	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes this ending paragraph as she intends to illustrate that the next time, she will be well - prepared and equipped to face the garden and the challenges it presents. During this initial attempt, she was ill - prepared and lacked knowledge about the winter hibiscus since she had never engaged in such an activity before.
546	9409	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” the tale concludes with the statement, “In the spring, when the snows dissipate, the geese return, and this hibiscus commences budding, then I will undertake that test once more.” The rationale behind the author ending the story in such a manner is that it demonstrates that even though she, in @MONTH1, failed the test on one occasion, she will not abandon her efforts merely due to an adjustment or change. The hibiscus prompts the reader to recognize that just as the flora where she resides can adapt, so too can she.
547	9410	4	1	The rationale for her ending the story in such a fashion is that when all things are in bloom, she will experience a greater sense of belonging and well - being. I posit this because the young girl was accustomed to assisting her grandmother with her hair prior to her relocation. Thus, if the flower is blossoming, it will evoke memories of her grandmother, which will serve as motivation to perform well on the test.
548	9411	4	1	The author brings the story to a close with this paragraph as it constitutes a personification encompassing the melting of snow, the return of geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. It elucidates moments in the passage of time. Moreover, the author depicts the extent of the hibiscus's isolation.
549	9412	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with that particular paragraph as it conveys Saeng's sentiments regarding the approaching winter and how she must await the return of spring to retake her test.
550	9413	4	1	Saeng exhibits concern for the flowers. She holds a special regard for them. The natural phenomenon of their distinctive growth intrigues her.
551	9414	4	1	In the narrative, I am uncertain as to why the author integrated the story in such a manner; truly, I am at a loss. Perhaps the protagonist was alluding to having completed all her examinations and would not retake them. The time had come. She was in school, and when one took that particular test, it was a symbol of a certain kind of fortune. Now, on @DATE1, the school term has concluded.
552	9415	4	1	The reason the author incorporates this paragraph into the story is that at the story's conclusion, an ending was requisite. Additionally, the author selected a conclusion that would optimally suit the narrative.
553	9416	4	1	I opine that the author opted to conclude the story in this fashion because the narrative revolved around perseverance. For instance, the story was centered on the winter hibiscus plant. This serves as an apt example as, in the end, Saeng pledges that she will persevere and retake her test, just as the hibiscus endures and thrives through the winter, refusing to wither. Another illustration is that @CAPS1's mother worked outdoors in the cold to complete her gardening. This is relevant to the story as she remained in the frigid garden to finish her task; she could have quit and retreated to the warm house, much like Saeng could have given up and decided not to retake her test. However, she did not; she declared her intention to try again.
554	9417	4	1	I surmise that the author concluded the story thusly because it implies that the protagonist has not yet relinquished hope. Even though she failed on the first attempt, she is resolved to try again. The statement “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” suggests that when all is @CAPS1, she will endeavor to succeed once more, for if she passes, it will be @CAPS1. Regrettably, the story left much to be desired as I was unclear about what she had failed, which diminished my enjoyment of it.
555	9418	4	1	I believe the rationale behind the author ending the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again” is that, much like the plant had little chance of survival in the winter, the girl faced challenges when taking her driving test. However, in spring, the plant has the opportunity to bloom, just as she has a chance to pass the test, as there is a time and place for everything.
556	9419	4	1	Emotion, commitment, hope—all serve as rationales for the author's decision to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” @CAPS1, the final paragraph indicates that she harbors emotion. Moreover, it demonstrates her commitment, as she asserts that when the hibiscus returns, she will retake the test. Lastly, it evinces hope and her intention to redeem herself. These factors collectively explain the author's use of the last paragraph.
557	9420	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to underscore her newly - discovered resolve to surmount her obstacles. For instance, in the passage, she states, “she realized that many of the things she had deemed strange before had, through the tranquil recurrence of season after season, become nearly familiar to her.” At this juncture, she has an epiphany and realizes that life mirrors the seasons. In the concluding paragraph, she conveys this by declaring that in the spring, she will retake the test. This illustrates that just as the winter hibiscus endures a long winter and then blossoms in the spring, she must remain resilient during difficult times. Eventually, her time to “bloom” will arrive. @CAPS1 encounters arduous moments, yet we all must be robust and unwavering as we await our opportunity to “bloom.”
558	9421	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph as he aimed to convey that she would not capitulate merely because she failed once. She had already failed the test on one occasion and was deeply despondent about it. Subsequently, she purchased a plant. Saeng's mother informed her that they would approach it correctly. Saeng was in tears when she confided in her mother. Her mother, however, was remarkably understanding, despite having the potential to be extremely irate. They could have utilized a plant they had cultivated. Currently, the plant @MONTH1 may not grow as expected. She ought to have procured a genuine plant from someone else.
559	9422	4	1	Determination, a new beginning, and symbolism—each are the reasons I opine the author concluded the story with this paragraph. After purchasing the plant, she discovers new hope and is newly resolved to pass the test she writes about. As she observes the geese soaring overhead, she discerns the determination they must possess and vows to perform better on the test the following year. With the new flower, she perceives herself as embarking on a fresh start, enabling her to pass this test that appears significant to her. When the author writes, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it exhibits symbolism. By describing the flower budding anew, it symbolizes Saeng's desire to initiate a new phase. Determination, a new beginning, and symbolism—each are the reasons I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
560	9423	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho concludes the story with the statement, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” as it demonstrates that Saeng has overcome her problem and vowed to rectify it. By ending with this statement, the author shows that the splendor of nature can assist one in surmounting their difficulties, as it did for Saeng. Upon witnessing the geese's migratory flight and the “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng “realized that many of the things she had regarded as strange before had, through the serene repetition of season after season, become nearly familiar to her now. Like the geese.” Saeng realized that the test, although initially strange and unfamiliar to her, had become familiar due to her experiences with nature, specifically seeing the geese and the “Winter Hibiscus.” This plant also evokes memories of her past in Vietnam and all the pleasant times at her home. “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed.” The experience makes her recall positive moments. The plant fills her with such joy that she ceases to dwell on the past and instead focuses on the future, on retaking the test and her new life in the United States.
561	9424	4	1	The rationale behind the author's inclusion of the final line in the story's conclusion is to illustrate the joys and sorrows, indicating that even though they are nearly over, she does not wish for it to end. However, she is aware that it will recommence. Next year, when circumstances revert to the state they were in before everything transformed, this cycle will repeat. This is precisely why I believe the author incorporated that line into the narrative.
562	9425	4	1	The author concluded the narrative by having Saeng vow to herself, “In the spring, when the snows thaw, the geese return, and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake that test,” to convey her resolve to adapt to new circumstances and to signify the change to which she was acclimating. Depicting spring was crucial in the conclusion as it portrayed what Saeng initially perceived as peculiar in @LOCATION1 but later grew accustomed to the changing seasons and weather. Once she recognized the necessity of dealing with change, she understood that she would need to attempt the driving test once more. It was of great significance that the author's conclusion was “In the spring, when the snows thaw, the geese return, and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake that test,” as it expressed how Saeng was embracing change in her life.
563	9426	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author employs the hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unforeseen locations, adaptation to a new life, and Saeng's homeland at the story's conclusion. I surmise that the author realizes that despite her failure in the test, all will be well. While gazing at the hibiscus, she reminisces about her former life, which she cherished, and is reminded of the inherent beauty that can be discovered in a hibiscus flower. In life, I believe everyone should always bear in mind that even though one may experience disappointment at times, we must keep in mind the fact that life persists. There will always be another opportunity, as long as one can find tranquility and beauty in something positive.
564	9427	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate the resemblance between Saeng and the plant. The plant represents Saeng's fortitude and capabilities. She understands that only when she becomes stronger, akin to the plant in spring, will she be prepared to retake the test. Her aspirations will be as robust as the plant in spring. This is the reason why the author ended with that paragraph.
565	9428	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it alludes to prior events within the narrative. For instance, it states, “and this hibiscus is budding,” which harks back to the story's onset when Saeng first encountered the hibiscus plant, evoking memories of her homeland. This is an effective method of concluding a story. I would not alter it in any way if given the opportunity. Additionally, in the summary preceding the story, it mentions that she failed her driver's test, and in the final paragraph, it states, “then I will take that test again.” I believe Saeng lacked confidence before taking the test due to her new environment, but now that she is familiar with everything and has discovered a pastime, she will contemplate passing when retaking the test. I think she intends to start anew and put the failure behind her.
566	9429	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she has surmounted challenges and desires to retake the quiz for her own self - affirmation, proving her capabilities solely to herself, not to others. She declares, “When they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow thaws and the geese return and the hibiscus is in bud, then I will take that test again.” Evidently, she expresses her intent to retake the test. Thus, she is not succumbing to external pressure but is undertaking it to prove her mettle to herself and no one else.
567	9430	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, a young girl named Saeng reminisces about her life prior to relocating to @LOCATION1. She yearns for her homeland and all the cherished aspects of her former life. Towards the story's denouement, the author incorporates a paragraph where Saeng pledges to retake her driver's test once winter subsides, when the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a specific purpose. The author aims to illustrate that Saeng possesses the resilience to endure the winter, much like the hibiscus, and will be prepared when the arduous days of winter end and the idyllic days of spring arrive. Saeng's mother remarks, “…it's strong enough to make it through the cold months… That's what matters.” The winter hibiscus serves as a direct parallel to Saeng, as both are robust enough to withstand the winter months.
568	9431	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to pique the reader's interest and leave them craving more. When an author concludes a chapter of a story or an episode of a show, employing a cliff - hanger is often a prudent strategy to engage the audience. This technique is prevalent in numerous stories I have perused. In my @CAPS1, the @PERSON1 book consistently concludes with a cliff - hanger. For instance, at the end of the third book, one of the soldiers meets his demise, yet the identity of the perpetrator remains unknown until the subsequent book.
569	9432	4	1	The author concludes this story in such a manner to convey that the girl will not abandon her efforts to assimilate into this new country. The author's choice of conclusion implies that the journey is far from over. Despite the test resulting in failure, the author suggests that success will be attainable in the next attempt. The author leads the reader to understand that the young girl attaches significance to the test and wishes to demonstrate to others that she can pass it. The flowers evoke memories of her homeland, and she believes that with this connection, she can retake the test and achieve the right outcome.
570	9434	4	1	I opine that the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng disliked the cold, hence she would await the snow's melting and the geese's return to test the plants anew. Additionally, I believe the author added it to indicate that Saeng would return to visit her mother.
571	9435	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph since Saeng failed the examination, and she will retake the test in the spring.
572	9436	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it offers closure to both Saeng and the narrative. Saeng was disheartened by her test failure; however, towards the story's conclusion, she realizes that events occur, and at times, we lack control over them. Nevertheless, one must rise again if circumstances knock one down. Upon observing the geese and the hibiscus, she understands that everyone and everything must constantly adapt to new situations. Saeng might have failed her driving test because driving norms differ in Vietnam, so she will have to acclimate to the local driving style, along with all the rules and regulations. This is the reason the author concludes the paragraph in such a manner.
573	9437	4	1	Saeng undertook a test but did not quite succeed. She was apprehensive about informing her mother, yet she had to do so regardless. Her mother became distressed due to her failure. Saeng is aware that immediately after winter concludes, she will retake the same test and hopes to pass it this time.
574	9438	4	1	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author incorporates the phrase, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” as she intended to conclude the story with Saeng discovering positive perspectives on her new home and the future, and anticipating it with optimism. Throughout the short story, Saeng exhibits a melancholic disposition regarding her new home, as the plants remind her of her former abode. “I mean it’s not the kind we at - at -” she found herself still too tremulous to utter the words “at home,” and finally burst into tears again. This phrase demonstrates that Saeng deeply missed her home and was genuinely sorrowful about it. The aforementioned concluding phrase indicates that she found the fortitude to view the future of her new home positively.
575	9439	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the story's onset, Saeng attempted a driving test but failed. Subsequently, she purchased a hibiscus that evokes memories of home and provides her with strength and solace. Her mother utters this at the end as she is aware that Saeng is struggling to adapt to her new country. She does not wish to burden her further, knowing that Saeng is extremely upset. Instead, she tries to make amends by buying her a flower. She states that by next spring, Saeng should be adjusted and prepared for the test because the flower should instill hope in her. She wants Saeng to know that she is there for her.
576	9440	4	1	I surmise that the author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the narrative with the statement “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” for multiple reasons. Firstly, it demonstrates her tenacity and refusal to succumb. Secondly, it instills a sense of anticipation and optimism regarding future prospects. Lastly, it leaves the reader in a state of speculation, pondering whether she will succeed on her subsequent attempt. This is likely the rationale behind the author's choice of ending.
577	9441	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the paragraph to illustrate the correlation between the hibiscus and Saeng. The hibiscus must endure the winter until spring, when it can flourish and attain grandeur and beauty. Saeng draws a parallel to the flower, asserting that if the flower can endure confinement within a plastic container and withstand the elements, she too can surmount the challenges accompanying the environmental transition. She perceives herself as akin to the hibiscus at present, entrapped due to the unfamiliarity of the area and compelled to adapt. Just as the container is foreign to the flower, accustomed to freedom, once planted, it will assimilate into its surroundings and thrive. Similarly, once Saeng accepts the change and exhibits willingness to commence anew, she will embark on a journey of growth, rendering her driving test more manageable. In conclusion, this is the reason the author concluded the paragraph with this sentence.
578	9442	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the protagonist, Saeng, proclaiming that she will undertake the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I posit that the hibiscus and the driver's test are analogous to the blooming of a flower. If it withers initially, it can subsequently blossom, hence the author incorporated this to signify that Saeng experienced a setback initially but will flourish come spring. It also serves as a symbol of her continuous rejuvenation. The author's intent behind the concluding line was foreshadowed earlier when Saeng was disheartened by her failure in the test. She is distraught over failing her driver's test, yet upon sighting a flower from her homeland, she experiences a surge of inspiration and begins to shed a few tears. This exemplifies her transformation as she transitions from a despondent state to an optimistic one after encountering the flower associated with her childhood recollections. Her ebb and flow are further evident when she conveys the test results to her mother. Initially, she is fraught with anxiety and fear, so much so that she tears a leaf off and shreds it. Her mother then wipes away the green residue and urges her to plant it. Saeng then receives a morale boost and begins to feel better. This once again depicts her revival, as she anticipated her mother's reproach for failing the test but instead witnesses her acceptance of the plant, signifying her resurgence. Saeng encounters obstacles throughout the story but manages to rise above them, empowering herself with determination to achieve her objective. She is resolute in passing the test when spring arrives, akin to the blossoming of the hibiscus.
579	9443	4	1	The author presumably incorporates the segment of the story within the paragraph to augment the level of detail. The author endeavors to expound upon the life that Saeng had silently vowed to herself in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, stating that when the flowers resume blooming and spring arrives once more, that is when she will retake the test and achieve success this time.
580	9444	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate that Saeng possesses the fortitude to attempt again something at which she initially failed. She regarded the plant as a cherished memory and a marker of time. Saeng planted it as a poignant reminder of her homeland and her commitment. Saeng remarked, “It's not a real one,” “Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng held a deep affection for her home and yearned to return, yet her newfound promise took precedence.
581	9445	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it ushers in an entirely new diurnal phase. This assertion implies that she will undertake the test on a nascent day. For instance, the geese return, signifying the arrival of spring, and the hibiscus buds; since she has the test in spring, this elucidates why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
582	9446	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she intends to take the driving examination during the vernal season. Spring serves as a symbol of sanguine emotions, and she derives such positive sentiments from the blossoming of the winter hibiscus.
583	9447	4	1	They were compelled to return, and so they did. As they traversed into an alternate realm in the corner, they re - entered the world of their childhood precisely as she had anticipated it would feel.
584	9448	4	1	This concluding paragraph is penned for multiple reasons. Firstly, she will make another attempt when she deems the moment opportune. Analogous to the geese's return, Saeng will return to take the test, and the Hibiscus plant will also flower anew. She believes it is the appropriate course of action and that it will be the right juncture to return and take the test. This paragraph aptly depicts Saeng in terms of her way of life and her resolve to retake the test when she feels it is fitting.
585	9449	4	1	"I opine that the author concludes the work as she is demonstrating Saeng's tenacity to pass the test. ""She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes."" (Ho) This citation indicates that passing the test held great significance for Saeng. She wept because she was unable to refrain from purchasing the plant and subsequently failed the test. Her aversion to failure was manifested through her tears. ""Then I will take the test again."" (Ho) This quote reveals that despite her failure, she is resolute in passing the test and achieving success. The setback pained her deeply, and thus she is eager to try again and succeed as she is steadfast in her determination. This is crucial as Saeng exemplifies that determination is the linchpin of success, and she is unwavering in her resolve."
586	9450	4	1	"The author employs this paragraph to conclude the narrative, thereby demonstrating Saeng's tenacity and her acclimation to her new abode. This showcases her determination as it states, ""I will take that test again."" This also indicates that she has adapted to her new home."
587	9451	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph due to her distress over having moved. She is also aggrieved about failing her driver's test. Consequently, she planted the plant and asserts that when spring arrives, she will retake her driver's test.
588	9452	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative with a paragraph in which Saeng vows to take the test once more in the spring. Minfong utilizes this paragraph as it conveys the message of perseverance, even in the face of initial failure. For instance, Saeng recently failed her driver's test, but after purchasing the hibiscus and delving deeper into the matter, she realized she should not abandon her efforts."
589	9453	4	1	The author concludes with this sentence for the purpose of emphasis. It diverts Saeng's attention from the flower, allowing her to concentrate on her test. By deferring the test until the following spring, it provides her with something to anticipate. This statement also illustrates the principle that one should never relinquish any endeavor. The author concludes on a positive note by elucidating this. The last paragraph also serves as a respite from the remainder of the story and from Saeng's prior actions. It encapsulates Saeng's final reflections.
590	9454	4	1	"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph to convey that when the hibiscus begins to regenerate, she will resume her initial pursuit. I think this is the reason because she states, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is flourishing, then I will take that test again."
591	9455	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a paragraph to ensure that readers engage with the text rather than merely speculating about the story's progression.
592	9456	4	1	The author's conclusion in the story posits that following collective effort and diligent labor, one should sustain the momentum annually, notwithstanding potential changes.
593	9457	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to evoke a sense of hope. Saeng endured a challenging period, from failing the examination to grappling with profound feelings of loss. However, after discovering the hibiscus and planting it, she appeared to attain enlightenment. Although she yearned for her homeland, the memories provided solace. Her determination is evident as she declares her intention to retake the test and seems to have bolstered self - confidence. The author notes that Saeng will retake the test in the spring. In the realm of archetypes, spring symbolizes new beginnings and life. When the hibiscus begins to bud, signifying rebirth, she will undertake the test, marking a fresh and more auspicious start for Saeng.
594	9458	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate determination. It reveals that Saeng desires to allocate time to acclimate to her new life and surroundings. Subsequently, she contemplates that this place may gradually feel like home. She opines that perhaps, after becoming accustomed to the new environment over time, she will have a greater likelihood of passing the test. Her resolve to pass the test remains steadfast.
595	9459	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as when Saeng spoke these words to herself, she pledged not to abandon her pursuit of obtaining her license, and the hibiscus evokes a sense of homecoming. In the text, when the mother remarks, ""@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's robust enough to endure the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters."" This statement alleviates Saeng's sorrow as she realizes that the hibiscus will remind her of the one from her homeland, endowing her with the impetus to attempt the test anew in the spring."
596	9460	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I opine that the author includes this passage to illustrate Saeng's tenacity. Saeng is tenacious as she repeatedly attempts this “test” and endeavors to acclimate to her new country. This is demonstrated in the story through the aforementioned quote. The quote reveals that Saeng can undertake something, fail, and then be resolute in trying again to achieve success. Additionally, in the story, Saeng has relocated from one country to another. This is a significant transition, and her self - confidence is highly indicative of tenacity. The manner in which the author concludes the story, with the given quote, undoubtedly portrays Saeng, the protagonist, as a tenacious individual, which is the purpose of the quote.
597	9461	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to prompt the audience to contemplate what was said and to incite a desire to read further. For instance, I once read a book that concluded with a question, and I was eager to discover the answer. Another example is when I read a book that ended with a statement. I then wished to read another book in the series, but it was unavailable, leaving me unaware of how the story concluded. This is why the author ends stories in such a way, to entice the reader to engage with another book based on the ending.
598	9462	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for multiple reasons. The author aimed to convey a sense of optimism, showcase the character's development, and illustrate impending change. In the final paragraph, when the character vows to retake the test, it instills a feeling that all will be well. Earlier in the story, she was weeping and yearning for her homeland, and the tone was fraught and sorrowful. This concluding paragraph implies that the tone has now become hopeful. Despite failing the test, she remains determined to try again. The author also included the paragraph to demonstrate the character's growth. Her declaration to try again indicates her increased strength and determination. Lastly, the author ended the story with that paragraph to foreshadow future events. The return of the geese, the melting of the snow, and the budding of the hibiscus all signify a change in seasons. This symbolizes the transformation within the character and foreshadows that circumstances will henceforth be different.
599	9463	4	1	The author concluded the story with that message because, upon reflection, not doing so would render the entire story incomplete and leave an opening for a sequel. It is evident that the overarching purpose of the story is to stimulate thought.
600	9464	4	1	I surmise that the author included this paragraph as it symbolizes a new beginning for the character. Just because she has faced difficulties does not imply that she will perpetually encounter hardships.
601	9465	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it held significant meaning for Saeng. Saeng failed her driving examination and was apprehensive about informing her mother that she had also expended nineteen dollars on “Dok Faeng - noi,” a flower/plant they had in their homeland. For instance, “As Saeng ambles home after failing her driver’s test, she spots a familiar plant.” The plant Saeng encountered was of great importance to her mother. “@PERSON1 emitted a small exclamation of surprise and joy.” “Dok faeng - noi,” she exclaimed. “Where did you acquire it?” This quote indicates that her mother was thrilled upon hearing about it. The story is concluded with that paragraph because, despite all Saeng had endured, her mother was pleased that she had purchased it. “It is a beautiful plant, this dok faeng - noi,” she finally remarked. “I am glad you obtained it.”
602	9466	4	1	Authors occasionally employ intricate sentences as their concluding sentences, which can pose challenges in comprehension. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes her tale by stating, “When they return. Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese reappear and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test.” The author utters this to illustrate that Saeng is not yet prepared to proceed and requires further learning. The mother is profoundly disappointed in her daughter for purchasing a plant that is exorbitantly priced, demonstrating her inexperience, as buying things based on one's emotions is erroneous. This is evident when they say, “I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” “You what?” She also remarks, “@CAPS1 facing. Now where did you obtain that,” revealing her astonishment at the expensive, beautiful plant. Authors utilize those paragraphs and sentences to showcase or summarize the story. The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes her narrative with the paragraph because Saeng should not have bought the plant merely due to her emotions and that she should attempt again the following year to avoid making mistakes.
603	9467	4	1	The author of the passage concludes the story with these statements to arouse curiosity. This piques curiosity through the allusion to spring and the return of the geese. Spring represents the commencement for numerous creatures on Earth; thus, Saeng endeavors to make a fresh start as she must await the arrival of spring. The hibiscus strengthens the sense of a new beginning, as each year new buds emerge, similar to how she can have a second opportunity. Saeng awaits spring because she is aware that it is the time when all other things generate new life, so she must bide her time until then to embark on her new beginning.
604	9468	4	1	I surmise that the reason the author concluded the story with that paragraph is that it will be the juncture when she believes she will be ready to retake the driver’s test. Prior to making that resolution, she was disheartened as she had failed the test. Perhaps she selected springtime because it affords her the opportunity to compose herself and practice in the interim between then and spring.
605	9469	4	1	The author incorporates this sentence, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to demonstrate her resolve. She is resolute in passing the test. Even though she is grappling with difficulties adapting to @LOCATION1, she aspires to succeed here. Hence, she will wait for a year and then attempt again when she is better equipped.
606	9470	4	1	From the narrative of the girl who has recently migrated from Vietnam to the United @ORGANIZATION1, it will prove arduous for her to comprehend anything, and any occurrence can evoke her recollections of Vietnam. The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the girl failed the test and wishes to witness the hibiscus in bloom. “I – I failed the test,” Saeng informed her mother. Her mother actually comprehends the reason behind this and will allow Saeng to keep the hibiscus as it will alleviate her distress. Saeng yearns for Vietnam deeply and is determined to surmount obstacles.
607	9471	4	1	The author concludes this paragraph to enhance its clarity, enabling readers to understand it more comprehensively. Moreover, the author aims to make it more prominent and impactful.
608	9472	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it conveys that over time, once she has fully acclimated to everything, she will be capable of taking the test. This is why she states, “...and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” “@CAPS1 all it requires is time. Time to warm up and time to grow.” Additionally, the paragraph is well - crafted and correlates with the entire narrative. Thus, she concluded with an excellent paragraph that is highly coherent with the story.
609	9473	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, Ho concludes the story with the paragraph since the flower symbolizes the protagonist's happiness associated with her homeland. The flower represents the past and a sense of comfort. Once Saeng began to plant the “winter hibiscus,” “she could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now.” All of Saeng's senses started to revive; she was elated. Similarly, the author employs the geese to illustrate Saeng's sense of comfort. The country around her began to feel like home, and she became familiar with her surroundings. Numerous references to home are made throughout the piece as home is a place of comfort and happiness. Therefore, Saeng would gain more confidence, which explains why Ho concluded with that sentence.
610	9474	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the @CAPS1 melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” as it holds a profound meaning similar to the essence of life. It implies that if one makes a mistake, it is acceptable; one should simply try again and strive for improvement.
611	9475	4	1	She concludes the paragraph with the story as she earnestly desires the audience to recognize that she is and consistently experiences enjoyment. Moreover, she adores her current location. She is making her mark in the world and delights in observing the flowers, “geese return, and this hibiscus is budding,” which indicates that her favorite activity is related to flowers.
612	9476	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to reiterate the significant elements within the narrative. “I will take that test again.” This refers to the test she failed on that day. The test that she failed evaluated her recollection of her homeland. Her former country held great importance for her. The part in the quote, “when they come back.... when they show me it and the geese return,” pertains to when she states, “She realized that many of the things she had previously regarded as peculiar had become… almost familiar to her. Like the geese.” She is suggesting that she is gradually acclimating to everything in this country, much like the geese that migrate south every winter. When she uses “and this hibiscus is budding,” she implies that she will recall all the things she forgot upon moving to this country. When she reached the hibiscus, she extended her hand and gently touched a petal. It felt smooth and cool, with a touch of velvet towards the center—just as she had anticipated. This entire statement essentially conveys that as this country becomes more familiar, she is beginning to forget aspects of her native country, but when the geese return, meaning on @DATE1, she will remember again and will retake the test of her knowledge and succeed.
613	9477	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he/she aims to convey the message that the plant represents a symbol of new beginnings, which symbolizes Saeng's vow. Additionally, in the story, caring for the plant instills in Saeng a sense of responsibility in obtaining her license. By nurturing the plant, it will teach her patience and that she needs to learn from the mistakes she has made.
614	9478	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that she is unwilling to abandon her new life. “I—I failed the test.” Saeng had failed her driver's test and was extremely disheartened. She also loathed her new residence. “She was still too nervous to feel at home.” She missed her old home and genuinely wanted to give up. After conversing with her mother, her hopes were rekindled. Thus, the author uses this paragraph to signify that she still harbors hope in the end, and when she is prepared, she will attempt it again. “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.”
615	9479	4	1	The author concludes this aspect of the story to convey the tone. The paragraph illustrates Saeng's determination to attempt the test again and achieve success. This imparts a lesson to the reader, emphasizing the importance of exerting one's utmost effort and not surrendering. The final paragraph concludes the story with an air of curiosity, piquing the reader's interest to learn more or discover whether she passes.
616	9480	4	1	I surmise that the concluding paragraph implies that after all other significant events and what is intended to transpire has occurred, she will undertake the test as it is essentially the final event that must take place. Moreover, I believe she will succeed in it because it is predestined to happen.
617	9481	4	1	I conjecture that Saeng made that tacit vow to herself because after the plant endures the arduous winter and once everything reverts to her preferred state and the plant commences budding anew, it symbolizes her difficult experience with relocation. Thus, if this plant she adores so deeply can persevere through it, then she can as well.
618	9482	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" as it accentuates Saeng's anguish upon arriving in an unfamiliar place and failing her initial test. Simultaneously, it underscores Saeng's determination to exert effort after encountering a flower reminiscent of one from her homeland. The flower itself holds great significance for Saeng; for instance, the text states, ""And besides it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers."" This excerpt illustrates Saeng's affection for her hometown through a flower she knows flourishes back home. Another instance is when Saeng imparted the disheartening news to her mother, ""I - I failed the test."" Her mother's attention was immediately drawn to the flower, and her mother could only offer solace. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower serves as Saeng's wellspring of strength as it is the sole familiar entity in the United States. Saeng aspires to exhibit the same resolve in her test as the flower demonstrates during the harsh winter."
619	9483	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the aforementioned paragraph to signify the correlation between the resurgence of the hibiscus's buds and the reemergence of Saeng's determination. In the photograph for question #@NUM1, the hibiscus flower appears out of place, as if it does not belong, akin to Saeng. The hibiscus represents the link to Saeng's past, as depicted when the author writes, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world."" The hibiscus is indigenous to her homeland, and by aiding Saeng in recollecting her past, she began to come to terms with the present and subsequently the future, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."
620	9484	4	1	Through this quotation, the author elucidates that Saeng will ultimately be prepared for her test. When the geese return, they are ready to conclude their migration, and when the hibiscus is budding, it is poised to transform into a resplendent flower. Saeng opines that in the spring, since the flower and the geese are prepared, she too will be ready.
621	9485	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as the narrator is now prepared to embrace and acclimate to her new surroundings, much like the flower would. Geese prefer warmth over cold; hence, they migrate south for the winter. Saeng's ""comfort zone"" is in @LOCATION1, where she holds numerous childhood recollections, including those of her grandmother and the hibiscus flower. She is accustomed to the flower thriving in a warm environment. Thus, when the geese return in spring and the flower blooms anew, she will be more ready to adapt to @CAPS1 life and take her driver's test. The geese and the hibiscus flower symbolize her cherished memories of her old home in @LOCATION1, which she deeply misses. After these occurrences, she endeavors to adapt to @CAPS1's way of life."
622	9486	4	1	Saeng would make a return to her native land.
623	9487	4	1	In the passage “Winter Hibiscus,” the author employs the phrase in the last paragraph: “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” I believe the author concluded the story with these words because Saeng is implying that just as the birds migrate away but return with the changing seasons, so too will she find the strength to persevere. An instance of this is when she describes the birds settling into the hibiscus, mingling with it. The last paragraph suggests that she anticipates staying for the next season and is resolute in pursuing her desires. This is what I glean from the last paragraph of the story “Winter Hibiscus” and what it signifies to me.
624	9488	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that when spring arrives and the geese are present, Saeng silently vows to herself that she will retake the permit test. This conclusion serves to highlight her determination and the hope for a new beginning with the changing of the seasons.
625	9489	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve to endure and find happiness in her new abode. Despite her dissatisfaction with her acquisition, she endeavors to render it more homely. When she states, “will take that test again,” she reveals her aspiration for a comfortable environment. By ending with this paragraph, it also showcases the resilience associated with the changing seasons. As Saeng will embark on a fresh start and persevere in her life. She is content for the time being but plans to gratify herself and her mother come spring. This paragraph also functions as a pledge to explore a novel way of life and forge friendships. The plant serves as a symbol of her impending transformation; she will explore and overcome her personal challenges, proving that she deserves happiness and a sense of belonging in her new home.
626	9490	4	1	The author terminated this paragraph in the narrative as it demonstrated that there exist geese that loiter around the garden during the spring season.
627	9491	4	1	In this tale, the author elucidates how arduous certain changes can prove to be. Additionally, the author expounds on how family and items from home, such as the flower, can offer solace. The essence of the story lies in depicting one of the author's life experiences.
628	9492	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes this segment because he intends to inform the reader that it was not the end for the young girl, and she would not abandon her pursuit of planting flowers. When spring arrives and the snow has melted, she will plant more flowers and observe their growth during the spring, despite the fact that it did not yield as favorable results as in the winter season. She did not allow setbacks to deter her. I believe the author endeavors to convey that if one undertakes an endeavor and it does not succeed, one should persevere, as perhaps a different outcome will ensue.
629	9493	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the narrative with, “When they come back take that test again.” She does so to illustrate that she still harbors hope and will not simply capitulate. She endured numerous hardships upon relocating and appeared to experience a sense of despondency within the story. After all her sorrow in the narrative, she finally regains the resolve to encourage herself to persist. “I will take that test again.” (This exhibits hope.) “And in the warm, humid sanctuary of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Evidently, she is distressed because the plant evokes memories of home. In conclusion, I deem it a sagacious decision to conclude the passage with a positive outlook.
630	9494	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, it conveys that Saeng will never cease striving. Secondly, something as unassuming as a flower can inspire someone to persevere, even when they seem to have no purpose. Saeng asserts that the flower is of such significance that exerting greater effort will motivate her to perform to the best of her ability. The author concludes with this sentence as it is highly impactful and instills courage in Saeng.
631	9495	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this as she had already failed the test and aspired to pass it subsequently, so as not to disappoint her mother.
632	9496	4	1	I surmise that what the narrator intends by uttering this is that she desires to return when everything is resplendent once more. She wishes to await the melting of all the snow and the return of the geese so that she can behold all the hues of the flowers. And if she succeeds in her test this time, she will be able to drive past all the flowers. That is what I believe the character implies in this story.
633	9497	4	1	The author of this narrative concludes the story with this paragraph as it elucidates how Saeng will not abandon her efforts, just as the hibiscus perseveres. Earlier in the story, it describes how the winter hibiscus endures. In the paragraph, when it states that the snows melt, this signifies that the seasons will progress, just as Saeng ought to persist and strive. Additionally, when the author mentions that the geese return, this indicates that the geese will continue to come back, just as Saeng should keep attempting to take the test.
634	9498	4	1	I conjecture that the author incorporated these lines in the last paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” Evidently, the author truly favored it.
635	9499	4	1	I opine that the author concludes those paragraphs to convey a deeper significance to the story. The author might have aimed to present more intricate details within the narrative.
636	9500	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she intends to illustrate how she will embark on a new beginning by retaking the examination, much as the hibiscus will commence anew by sprouting fresh blossoms. Saeng demonstrates how she will endeavor to surmount the impediments she must confront, just as the hibiscus flower and geese will overcome the winter. In the story, the author employs the hibiscus to symbolize the means of adapting to the vicissitudes of life. In a sense, the winter hibiscus personifies Saeng as the flower is acclimating to the circumstances, specifically winter. Similar to the hibiscus flower, Saeng must overcome the challenges of residing in a new country and retaking her driver's exam.
637	9501	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph 'When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.' In my view, the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story to demonstrate that Saeng is dedicated to adapting to her new abode and leaving behind her old one. For instance, in the story, Saeng was unable to utter 'I mean, not like the kind we had at home.' without breaking into tears. This exemplifies her sorrow and her inability to relinquish her past.
638	9502	4	1	The author could have concluded the story with that paragraph for numerous reasons. Likely, the author ended with the paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng was concerned with assimilating into her new environment and was neither a failure nor a quitter. Moreover, the author probably concluded the story in this manner to illustrate that Saeng was resolute in achieving success and in making her mother content. This is the rationale behind the author's choice to end the story with the paragraph.
639	9503	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus bestows upon Saeng a faint glimmer of hope. The hibiscus evokes memories of her homeland, Vietnam, which brings her joy. Additionally, the fact that the hibiscus she acquires can endure the winter, unlike the hibiscus of her native land, symbolizes Saeng's determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus represents Saeng's survival and adaptation to her new country, which will encompass her retaking her driving test.
640	9504	4	1	The author concludes her story with this statement for numerous reasons. Firstly, the hibiscus will regain its strength once the wind ceases to blow; thus, Saeng will also regain her strength. Moreover, Saeng is allowing herself time to adjust and become accustomed to her new surroundings. She is setting a tangible goal for herself. Saeng identifies with the flower, which offers her solace and evokes precious memories of the things she cherished and the things that brought her happiness, such as her home country and her grandmother.
641	9505	4	1	"The author of this narrative concludes it with this particular paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination. In the story, when Saeng sees the hibiscus plant, she is overjoyed. However, the act of recalling doing her grandmother's hair presents a challenge. She perceives this as a test for herself. She wishes to ascertain if she can persevere and refrain from dwelling on the past. When she is away from home, she remarks, ""I failed the test."" This indicates that although she desires to move on, it has not been as effortless as she anticipated. Thus, when the hibiscus symbolizes life in this paragraph, it demonstrates that Saeng is endeavoring to move forward and is distinct from her former self."
642	9506	4	1	In the narrative, it is my conviction that Saeng experiences sorrow as she yearns for her homeland and the hibiscus flower. She concludes the story adeptly as she can now attain a sense of tranquility within herself by awaiting the opportunity to retake the test. I surmise that this is the rationale behind her ending the story in such a manner, so as not to leave herself consumed by worry or anger. She can transform a pessimistic outlook into an optimistic one when she declares that she will retake the test when the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud.
643	9507	4	1	"The author concludes with this sentence as it demonstrates that Saeng intends to endeavor to acclimate to her new abode. It conveys that Saeng will no longer succumb to grief and sorrow but will adapt and proceed with her life. The author includes the statement, ""I mean, not like the kind we had @NUM1at -"". This occurs when Saeng has just returned home and conversed with her mother, and she is deeply saddened as she reminisces about the memories of her former residence. However, by appending the final statement of the story, it reveals that Saeng has resolved to move forward in life and cease being sorrowful. She has established a goal to accept her new circumstances. This is the reason why the author concludes the story in this fashion."
644	9508	4	1	"Numerous authors conclude their stories in diverse manners. Minfong Ho, however, concluded hers with what is nearly an aphorism. One reason for her ending the story in this way was that she subtly disclosed what might transpire to Saeng in the future. For instance, at the conclusion, it states, ""I will take that test again."" This informs the reader that the author might pen another story about Saeng when she retakes the test. A second example is that it showcases Saeng's strength and beauty, as well as her determination to try again. This is evident when the author states, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" Here, the mention of ""this hibiscus"" alludes to Saeng. Without these literary techniques and hints, we might remain oblivious to the possibility of a sequel and what could unfold."
645	9509	4	1	The author must have incorporated this element into the story to depict change. In all acts of giving, we reciprocate in some way, just as we replenish the author's creative vision. People often overlook the minor damages that accompany significant changes. The small ones are the turning points, and I must adhere to this understanding. Moreover, the old ways must be left behind. We all encounter arduous challenges, both large and small, but we must surmount them all to progress.
646	9510	4	1	This paragraph holds significant importance for the narrator to incorporate into the story. For example, Saeng asserts that her new abode with her floral companions is of greater significance than school and an examination. Moreover, Saeng has few acquaintances to visit at school, yet her hibiscus will evoke memories of all the old friends she has made. Saeng is simply reminding herself that once everything reverts to normal or aligns with her desires, she can attempt the test anew. In conclusion, the narrator employed this paragraph to convey Saeng's emotional state.
647	9511	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it effectively summarizes and brings the story to a close. It elucidates the relationship between nature, adaptation, and how these elements soothed her after the disappointment of failing the test, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the character's emotional journey.
648	9512	4	1	The author concludes this story with a sentence of this nature because as winter transitions into spring, the snow gradually melts, and trees and flowers burst into an array of colorful blossoms. After all the flowers have bloomed, the leaves emerge, and the pollen finds its way to the appropriate trees. Towards the end of @DATE2 as autumn sets in, the leaves begin to wither and change hue before eventually falling off. Subsequently, the cycle resumes with another bout of snowfall, highlighting the cyclical nature of the natural world.
649	9513	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” as it demonstrates that Saeng refuses to succumb to defeat. It illustrates that, as Saeng's mother remarks, “...but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus; that's what matters,” symbolizing Saeng's ability to overcome not only the setback of failing the driver's test but also the challenge of relocating to @LOCATION1. Although she is not the same as she was in her hometown, she possesses the resilience to navigate this life - altering change. Additionally, taking the test in the spring symbolizes a fresh start, a time when everything is renewed, and she has triumphed over her personal winter. This concluding paragraph is of utmost importance as it showcases Saeng's commitment to herself to surmount the challenges ahead and those yet to come. When Saeng says, “...When the snows melt...” it represents the juncture in her life when her past failures will transform into opportunities. She will approach the test with a renewed perspective on her life. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's indomitable spirit.
650	9514	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph: “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snow thaws and the geese return and this hibiscus begins to bud, then she will retake that test. Minpong Ho did so because Saeng had failed the test. Saeng was unable to locate the fine - toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Evidently, these items can be found after the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts to bud, signifying a time of renewal and the possibility of rediscovery.
651	9515	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's perspective on the future. It is an apt conclusion, integrating numerous elements from the story, and it demonstrates how Saeng has matured. Saeng alludes to “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” In this phrase, she exhibits a burgeoning acceptance and even an affinity for her new homeland. The geese are “familiar to Saeng now” despite her previously regarding them as “strange.” The hibiscus is a relic of her past, adapted to suit her present circumstances. Saeng's vow that she will “take that test again” in the spring, “When the snows melt…” etc., indicates that despite having lost so much—her home, her grandmother, her way of life—Saeng remains resolute in making the best of her situation. She intends to pass her driving test come spring, regardless of the obstacles. The concluding paragraph is a fitting means to conclude the story. It depicts how the threads of Saeng's past and present are interwoven and showcases her attitude towards the future. With its sanguine words, the final paragraph nearly reconciles the mood of optimism amidst regret. The author's phrasing was executed masterfully.
652	9516	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as the story contains the statement “I will take that test again.” This implies that the character is attempting to gauge the extent of her adaptation to life's changes. The story also mentions “when they come back,” which suggests that when the flowers return in the next season, she will assess how much she remembers of her homeland, her grandmother, and the pleasant experiences. In essence, this conclusion allows the reader to understand the character's journey of self - discovery and adaptation in the face of change.
653	9517	4	1	The rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph is to convey to the reader that there will be a subsequent installment. Additionally, it serves to illustrate that Saeng was discontented with the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding hibiscus. By ending the story in this manner, the author leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation for the next chapter while also highlighting Saeng's emotional state at this juncture in the narrative.
654	9518	4	1	Now that the narrator has imparted extensive knowledge about plants, it appears that the girl is intrigued by @CAPS1.R.@CAPS1. The novel world and the diverse plants that blossom and present a resplendent sight during the season suggest that the girl genuinely appreciates the plants and their unique characteristics. In my view, she is an intrepid girl who relishes exploring new realms and uncovering the mysteries that await explanation. Her curiosity and enthusiasm for the new environment make her an engaging character, and her adventures in this new world are likely to continue.
655	9519	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it reveals that Saeng can surmount her weaknesses and achieve success in her new abode. The quote “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” implies that she will attempt the @CAPS2 Test anew and endeavor other tests to foster a sense of belonging in her new location and to glean what she can from the experience. This conclusion showcases Saeng's tenacity and her determination to thrive in her new circumstances, leaving the reader with a sense of hope for her future.
656	9520	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for numerous reasons. Firstly, it serves to illustrate that Saeng is a resolute young girl. By pledging to take the “test” once more, she demonstrates her determination and refusal to surrender. Another rationale is that the author intended to emphasize the significance of the concept of Saeng's personality.
657	9521	4	1	Minfong Ho concluded the narrative with this passage as it showcases Saeng's resolve to pass the driver's test. The fact that she failed it caused her distress and elicited feelings of homesickness, similar to the impact of the familiar plant. However, in this final paragraph, she vows that she will surmount all the challenges of being in an unfamiliar place and compose herself to achieve her objective, just as the winter hibiscus does.
658	9522	4	1	The author incorporated this sentence into the paragraph because Saeng was an extremely determined young woman. She would persevere until she achieved success. Regardless of the duration or difficulty, she would accomplish the task. Just like the hibiscus flower depicted in the picture beside the highway, which appeared decidedly out of place yet would do anything to survive. It is arduous to remain strong during times when one can only rely on oneself, but Saeng draws determination from her losses and the resilience of the hibiscus flower.
659	9523	4	1	In the concluding statement, Saeng asserts that “when they return in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese reappear and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the story with this passage because she employs the hibiscus as an exemplar of survival. The hibiscus, like her, hails from another place, and she uses it to symbolize her well - being in the new location. In a sense, she is stating, “If the hibiscus endures this winter, then so shall I.” I believe she utilizes this as a conclusion to portray her uncertain attitude towards her new home.
660	9524	4	1	I believe the author selects this as the final paragraph because it conveys how Saeng desires to overcome adversity and exhibit strength despite missing her homeland. For instance, Saeng believed that since she wept upon seeing the hibiscus plant, she had failed, and she is convinced that she will grow stronger over time.
661	9525	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this particular paragraph to encapsulate the realization and resolve that Saeng attains. Initially, Saeng commences in a state of distress after failing her examination. When she spots the flower and proceeds to locate it at a shop, she is inundated by this subtle reminder of her former abode. That diminutive flower prompts her to recognize the profound longing she harbors for her old home, and purchasing it becomes an imperative for her. She presumably senses that with that flower, she will perpetually possess a fragment of home in this novel world. After discerning that memories are what truly matter and observing the flower's tenacity to endure a frigid winter, she cultivates the determination to retake the test. She pledges to do so as she has derived confidence from the flower's survival and her comprehension of significant memories. In summary, that concluding paragraph conveys these specific messages.
662	9526	4	1	The inspiration for the author stemmed from the flower. The flower boasted the capacity to withstand severe winters and acclimate to novel environments. She resolved that she would surmount its challenges, just as the flower overcomes its hurdles each winter. This realization spurred her to face her own obstacles with the same resilience as the flower, highlighting the profound impact nature can have on human motivation.
663	9527	4	1	Memory, promise, and life—all are concepts that elucidate why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Memory is one concept that aids in explaining the author's choice to conclude the narrative with this paragraph, as Saeng yearns for her former life and homeland. Promise is another concept, as Saeng makes a solemn vow that once spring returns, she will retake the test. Life is yet another concept, as Saeng acquires the flower and plants it so that it may thrive once spring arrives, and she declares that she will then retake the test. Memory, promise, and life serve to clarify why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Memories will resurface in the spring, alongside the promises she has made and the new life she wishes to initiate. Saeng is achieving this by planting the hibiscus, which evokes a multitude of memories from her past life.
664	9528	4	1	The author concludes the story with that statement due to the fact that the temperature had dropped, and all the flora were on the verge of perishing. This climatic shift serves as a significant backdrop for the story's conclusion, perhaps symbolizing the end of a cycle or the harshness of the current situation. By including this statement, the author adds a layer of realism and emotional depth to the narrative, emphasizing the vulnerability of the natural world and its potential impact on the characters.
665	9529	4	1	Reasons I surmise the author concludes with the statement at the top are as follows. I believe the author does so because she was extremely eager to pass the test. She assured herself and vowed to retake the test when the geese return and the snow melts. Another reason I think the author concludes in this manner is that she failed it on the first attempt, and it holds great significance for her, and she is highly eager to achieve a passing grade. This is why I believe the author incorporated this into the story, as it provides insight into the character's determination and the importance of the test within the narrative.
666	9530	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng failed her driver's examination. As she made her way home on foot, she espied a flower that evoked memories of her former abode. She procured the flower and returned to her new residence where her mother was engaged in gardening. They resolved to plant the flower in the garden. Once the flower was planted, a flock of geese soared overhead. Saeng then discerned that everything had become familiar to her, in contrast to when it was all quite alien. She concluded the story by stating that when the geese returned in spring, she would retake the test. She asserted that the flower would be in a state of blossoming, signifying growth, and she too would have acclimated and become familiar with everything, thus rendering her ready for the test when the geese were set to return home and the hibiscus was poised to bloom.
667	9531	4	1	The author undertakes this comparison with the plant because when the plant commences its blooming phase, the character's self - assurance will be restored. The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it imparts a certain profundity and significance to the story.
668	9532	4	1	The author concludes this narrative with the @CAPS1 paragraph to accentuate the story and render it more captivating, thereby piquing the reader's curiosity and compelling them to desire the continuation of the story to discover subsequent events.
669	9533	4	1	I surmise that the author incorporated this final paragraph into the story to demonstrate the character's steadfast determination to pass this test and the profound significance it holds for her. This, in my view, is the rationale behind the author's inclusion of this passage in the story.
670	9534	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it reveals the correlation between nature and the girl. The paragraph states, “...when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (No @NUM1). In spring, when all these phenomena occur, it serves as a symbol of life, birth, or rejuvenation. The return of the geese represents a symbolic “renewal.” When the snow melts, the reappearance of grass is an indication of life. When plants begin to bud, it is akin to a new birth. The character decides that when nature undergoes symbolic rebirth and renewal, she will embark on a fresh start, mirroring the cycle of nature.
671	9535	4	1	He concludes the narrative with his paragraph as he intended to convey that he would retake the test when it was not winter @CAPS1 and to illustrate how Saeng vowed to herself by stating that he or she would retake the test when it was not winter. This is because even @CAPS2 though the test was not passed in winter, it could have been passed during the period when the snow on the ground melted.
672	9536	4	1	In the narrative, the author incorporated that concluding paragraph. Had one read the remainder of the story, they would understand that the individual was referring to her intention to retake the test upon her return, as the weather would be far more pleasant than during her initial attempt. Another rationale for the author's inclusion of this concluding paragraph at the novel's end was to ascertain whether readers truly grasped the novel and the author's underlying purpose. Thus, the author initially aimed to ensure that readers would better comprehend the book's ending through that concluding paragraph. These are the reasons why I opine that the author appended that concluding paragraph to the novel's conclusion.
673	9537	4	1	Owing to their desire to complete the task, they crafted the ending to resemble the story's opening. I particularly appreciate the segment where the birds returned, causing some of the flowers to reappear. This element adds a touch of rejuvenation and hope to the narrative, tying up the story in a satisfying manner.
674	9538	4	1	Saeng and her mother must exhibit determination to exert their utmost efforts for survival. Saeng and her mother have endured numerous hardships, and when she failed the @CAPS1 test, she sank into deeper despair than before. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to offer readers an insight into the resolve required to adapt and thrive in an unfamiliar environment. Despite being far from their homeland, Saeng and her mother still relish the aspects of Vietnam, such as the flowers, hot peppers, and bitter melons. Although her friends disapprove of the taste, it does not deter her from savoring what she holds dear.
675	9539	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it demonstrates her unwavering perseverance and the certainty that she will eventually pass the test. She made a solemn vow to herself, which showcases her determination to surmount challenges. Moreover, it piques our curiosity and compels us to read further to discover whether she will fulfill her vow and succeed in the test. For instance, the story ends with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again.” This ending leaves us eager to learn of her future success.
676	9540	4	1	The author concluded the narrative in this manner because she held an alternative perspective of Saeng. He would surmise that during each season, she would be in a distinct mood, such that the garden would transform, and Saeng's mother would always be outdoors throughout every season.
677	9541	4	1	The author concludes this narrative with the paragraph as she is demonstrating how an element from a memory can render someone resolute. For instance, Saeng failed her driver's examination, yet upon approaching the hibiscus plant, it evoked memories of her former residence. Moreover, while she is planting the plant, she regards the geese with a novel sense of familiarity. This combination impels her to persevere and complete her test, as having two reminders of both homes comforts her, assuring her that she can readily adapt and cherish her memories as well.
678	9542	4	1	He posited that one should not abandon their efforts and ought to persist, akin to the tenacity of plants during springtime.
679	9543	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as she is making a commitment to herself to retake the test in order to achieve a passing grade. She intends to do so when spring arrives and the hibiscus begins to bud. She needs to undertake the test and commence driving. I believe it is a commendable practice when individuals vow to themselves to pursue certain goals.
680	9544	4	1	He is alluding to the way of life of Saeng and the activities they engage in. Additionally, he is describing the climatic characteristics of the area.
681	9545	4	1	The author elected to conclude the narrative with that particular phrase to convey that she will await the subsequent year and reiterate the entire process. She will patiently anticipate its arrival and repeat all these actions. She will await it and demonstrate that she can accomplish it once more and that she has now acclimated to residing there.
682	9546	4	1	The author concludes the story in such a manner to signify a novel commencement in the spring. Just as flowers blossom and sprout buds during springtime, she will transform into a renewed and superior individual. This is the rationale behind the author's choice to conclude the story in this fashion.
683	9547	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this passage to illustrate that Saeng will undertake the test anew and embark on a fresh start. Moreover, I opine that it conveys to the reader that if one fails at something initially, there is no cause for fear in revisiting and attempting it again. I also believe that the hibiscus serves as a symbol of her, as she failed the test in winter and is dissatisfied with her current situation. However, in spring, when the hibiscus bears buds, she will commence afresh with the test, and the flower will have a novel environment in which to thrive.
684	9548	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph as it prompts the reader to engage in interpretation and decision - making. It refrains from explicitly stating the purpose of the test or whether she passed it, leaving these aspects for the reader to determine. It also instills a sense of curiosity regarding what will transpire until then. The story's ending is open - ended, allowing it to assume any form the reader desires, and is subject to individual interpretation. Different individuals may ascribe diverse meanings to it.
685	9549	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it reveals when she intends to attempt the test and effect changes in her evolving life. For instance, she is despondent in the story as she failed the test and yearns to return home. If she succeeds in spring, she may endeavor to make alterations and settle here. This is the reason why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
686	9550	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has ultimately attained comfort in her new “home.” As the passage predominantly reflects Saeng's former life, it concludes in this manner to signify her acclimation to her novel way of life. For instance, the statement “in the spring, and the geese return…” demonstrates her familiarity with the geese and the natural environment of her new world. The author also employs this concluding paragraph to convey a sense of liberation. Saeng harbored numerous memories from her old life, which hindered her from embracing new experiences in her new abode. The author's use of this paragraph serves as an effective means to conclude the story, allowing the reader to envision the serene scene of the birds soaring away, symbolizing Saeng's escape from pain and her integration into her new world.
687	9551	4	1	This final paragraph unveils something extraordinary to the reader. Saeng was bestowed with new hope through her mother's understanding and the hibiscus plant. Initially, upon sighting the hibiscus that evoked memories of her homeland, she felt despondent, wretched, and out of place. However, upon returning home, the sight of the plant's roots buried in the soil instilled in her a renewed sense of determination. The flower serves as a metaphor for her. Just as it adapted to endure the frigid climate, or challenging circumstances in Saeng's case, she too can persevere. The roots represent her past; although they are buried, they are not forgotten. The actual flower symbolizes a fresh start for Saeng in a foreign country. The author, Minfong Ho, personified non - living elements within the story. This is the rationale behind the author's use of the last paragraph in the way she did.
688	9552	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's resolve. It also draws a parallel between the driver's test and the hibiscus plant. It implies that when all other things begin to thrive, she will also achieve success. She requires the inspiration from her surroundings to propel her forward. Throughout the narrative, Saeng is influenced by her environment. For example, when she is in the greenhouse, it transports her back to her childhood. “It was like stepping into another realm. A sweltering, humid world teeming with lush greenery… Plants that she had unconsciously recognized but had since forgotten lured her back into her childhood world.”
689	9553	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng discovers solace in the plant after failing her test. The plant evokes memories of her homeland and links her to her past experiences. Despite her initial test failure, she believes that through diligent study and another attempt, she can succeed. This parallels the hibiscus, which withers in winter but blossoms beautifully in spring. Saeng identifies with the plant's rebirth and feels that she can also embark on a new beginning and excel in the test. This is why the author includes the paragraph where Saeng vows to retake the test when spring arrives and the hibiscus blooms.
690	9554	4	1	The reason the author concludes the story by stating, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” is significant. The author ends the story in this way because Saeng is essentially expressing that the opportune moment will arrive for her to take the test, and she will pass it with self - confidence. As the changing seasons bring new life and growth, Saeng anticipates a similar transformation within herself, ready to face the test anew and emerge victorious.
691	9555	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that in due course, she will retake the test she failed, believing that the hibiscus will assist her in surmounting the obstacles. I surmise that she acquired the plant upon failing the test, hoping that with the plant's blossoming, it will provide her with a schedule indicating when she is prepared to attempt the test again.
692	9556	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it serves as a poignant synopsis of the events therein. All that transpired with Saeng during her time at the florist is encapsulated in what seems akin to a form of retribution. The root cause of Saeng's initial sorrow was her failure in the driving test. In the final paragraph, she pledges to retake the test when the hibiscus begins to bud. The hibiscus Saeng purchased will commence budding in spring, when the snow melts. The last paragraph of the story offers Saeng an opportunity to contend with her nostalgia during the winter. Finally, the geese flying south evoke sadness in Saeng, yet they ignite a spark within her. She tells herself that she will retake the driving test when the geese return, when the hibiscus buds, and when the snow melts.
693	9557	4	1	In the last paragraph, the author endeavors to convey what lies ahead. Once winter subsides, spring will arrive, signifying the return of the hibiscus, which will evoke a sense of home. Moreover, the return of the geese will prompt her to retake the quiz. To her, it is akin to a fresh start, and hopefully, she will succeed. Since she adores the hibiscus, its return might lead to a significant improvement in her performance. Overall, a new era is dawning.
694	9558	4	1	"I opine that the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concluded with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because it demonstrates the significance of the plant and how it will aid her in passing the test. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and overcomes all obstacles to survive, she too will surmount the hurdles to pass her driving test. For instance, in the story, it states ""When the snows melt and then geese return""; the author is correlating this to Saeng's struggle to pass the test with the challenges of surviving winter. It also reads ""Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly disappearing into the distance"". This quote implies that she will rise to the challenge and overcome it. In summary, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again"" showcases the parallel struggles of the flower, Saeng, and the geese to overcome their challenges and complete what they started."
695	9559	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it holds significance. The author posits that when these animals and living organisms seize their opportunities, she too will have hers. For example, the geese will be able to return, the hibiscus will have its chance to bud, and she will get an opportunity to take her driver's test. I infer this from the fact that Saeng's mother begins discussing how magnificent the plant will be in spring. She even remarks, ""But it's strong enough to make it through the cold months"". This suggests that the mother is attempting to convey to her that she will receive a second chance. Hence, the story concludes with that sentence."
696	9560	4	1	"Why does the author conclude the story with this paragraph? It describes the seasons, their transitions, and how they commence anew, bringing distinct changes. I believe this is why the story is titled ""Winter Hibiscus."" After spring comes winter. During spring, there are all those lovely, fragrant flowers. However, when spring departs and winter arrives, all the plants wither away and will never be as they once were."
697	9561	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng exhibits perseverance, steadfastly continuing her efforts. The author concludes the narrative with a concise yet profoundly meaningful paragraph. ""…in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" Through this statement, Saeng demonstrates an unwavering resolve not to abandon hope, to embrace new opportunities fairly, and to cherish the memory of her homeland. The author's decision to end the story in such an inspiring manner reinforces the central theme, revealing that a few words can convey a wealth of wisdom."
698	9562	4	1	The author opted to conclude the story with the final paragraph for multiple reasons. Saeng declares her intention to retake her driving test in the spring. Traditionally, spring symbolizes a fresh start or a new chance. Concluding the story with this archetype suggests that in the future, Saeng will have an opportunity to succeed in her test and make the most of her time in @LOCATION1, adapting to her new life. When she purchases the hibiscus plant, it evokes memories of her former home and the wonderful experiences she had there. The plant appears to instill hope in her, and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This indicates that having the hibiscus nearby will offer her hope of passing the test and adjusting to @LOCATION1 while still recalling her native Vietnam.
699	9563	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this statement to signify that when the plants resume their growth and the geese return, she will make another attempt. For instance, the plants must regenerate their petals, and the geese must rebuild their habitats and forage for food. The author implies that she will retake the test when the geese return and the plants flourish once more, highlighting the cyclical nature of renewal and opportunity.
700	9564	4	1	"The author penned this paragraph because the character entered the house to prepare dinner and would not see the garden again until later. With winter approaching, she would no longer play outdoors until the season passed. As she stated, ""In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This quotation elucidates the author's rationale for concluding the story with this paragraph, emphasizing the connection between the changing seasons, personal perseverance, and the anticipation of new beginnings."
701	9565	4	1	I must assert that the reason the narrator concluded with this is that it can be regarded as a solution when contemplated. Moreover, one typically places the solution solely at the end, which is precisely why she chose to position it there.
702	9566	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng is not capitulating and has discovered a pastime to anticipate. For instance, “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it; overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by.” This is the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph.
703	9567	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with that particular quote as it showcases an appreciation and understanding of the beauty and wonders of nature. Saeng expended a substantial amount of money to acquire a unique flower known as dok faeng - nol. Saeng was attempting to obtain a driver's license but was failing the test. During her test, she chanced upon that plant. Despite being ashamed of her test failure, she still presented the flower she had found to her mother, which differed from the one at home. Her mother was delighted with the flowers and comprehended that Saeng had failed her test. Her mother remarked about the flower, “Its flowers aren't as lovely, but it's robust enough to endure the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” This was a figurative expression suggesting that there is hope for Saeng to pass her test when she has acquired more skills and is prepared to attempt it again. Additionally, the geese flying away for the winter and returning in the spring symbolize a fresh start towards success.
704	9568	4	1	The author concludes in this manner because when the external environment becomes warm and pleasant, they will endeavor to take the test once more, as the current outdoor conditions are unfavorable.
705	9569	4	1	In actuality, it is an extremely potent final statement. Despite failing her driver's test, she has recognized that she must persevere in being resilient and patient. Soon, the geese will return, and the snow will thaw, and she will “re - engage” to take her test with the determination to succeed. Saeng purchased the hibiscus to evoke a sense of being back in Vietnam, believing it could fill the void in her heart where she yearns for her homeland. “I paid nineteen dollars for it,” she says, indicating both her disappointment at failing the test and the realization that a flower that is freely available in Vietnam is exorbitantly priced in the United States. As a tropical flower, the hibiscus will bloom in the spring, signifying the time when she will be ready to retake the test.
706	9570	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this ending as it demonstrates that should the plant revive and blossom, she will return to take the examination and strive to succeed this time. She is aware that it will be arduous for her to retake and pass this test, yet she is confident in her ability, just as she is certain that the plant will endure the winter and resurface to bloom in the spring. This instills in her the assurance that she can pass this test if the plant can withstand the harsh winter they are experiencing. Consequently, this is the reason the author concluded the story in such a manner.
707	9571	4	1	"In my estimation, the author concludes the story by stating that she will retake the driver's test because not only will she attempt the driver's test anew, but she will also attain greater comfort in her life. The driver's test is not the primary issue; rather, it is the adaptation to her new environment that is causing Saeng profound distress. For instance, in lines @NUM1, Saeng's thoughts are ""A wave of loss so profound and powerful stung Saeng's eyes now and swept over her,"" and ""in the warm, moist refuge of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept."" This indicates that Saeng is struggling to readjust to her new life and is reminded of her former memories from her place of origin, and she weeps because it has vanished. I believe that failing her driver's test was merely a minor trigger that finally led her to cry due to the stress, and when she said, ""and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again,"" it implies that she will surmount all obstacles and move forward."
708	9572	4	1	It was judicious of the author to conclude the story with this paragraph. Saeng held a deep affection for the hibiscus; thus, when spring arrives and the hibiscus blossoms, it will be an opportune moment to retake the test after having previously failed it. This would likely bolster her confidence to retake the driving test at the appropriate time. In conclusion, this is the rationale behind the author's choice to conclude the story with that paragraph.
709	9573	4	1	"The author concludes the story in this way as she is suggesting that she will evolve with the seasonal transition. She finds herself in a new country and has just failed her driver's test. She is disheartened, yet the hibiscus serves as a reminder of her homeland. In the story, @CAPS1's mother remarks, ""I've witnessed this kind blooming along the lake; it is robust enough to endure the winter."" I think Saeng can identify with this because if the flower can persevere through the winter, then she can thrive in a new country."
710	9574	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the narrative with this final paragraph: ""When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with that paragraph because at the onset, Saeng had procured a hibiscus plant as it reminded her of her hometown. (""Plants that she had not realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world."") So she acquired it, but due to the inclement weather at the time, Saeng had to retrieve the plant promptly and plant it in the garden. However, she failed to do so in a timely manner. This is the reason for the statement ""I will take that test again."" And she will retake it during the spring when the hibiscus blossoms once more. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph."
711	9575	4	1	"The author concludes the paragraph in this manner as it demonstrates that she is not inclined to abandon her efforts. I surmise this due to her silent vow to herself that she would retake the test during the spring. Additionally, it pertains to certain elements that are not entirely clear from the rather cryptic mention about ""aiudieres"" and ""gains in old years seeds an ezing"". In conclusion, this is the reason why the author concludes the paragraph in such a way."
712	9576	4	1	"The narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" is penned by Minfong Ho. The author concludes the story with the excerpt, ""When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow thaws and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I shall take the test once more."" The rationale behind this is to afford her time for adjustment. Saeng merely requires a modicum of solace as all of this is novel to her. These words employ figurative language as the geese reminded her of herself, ""Almost familiar to her now. Like geese."" In essence, this ending enriches the story's emotional resonance and character development."
713	9577	4	1	It is nearly spring, as he indicated. The snow is melting, the geese are returning, and the hibiscus is in the process of budding. The grass is burgeoning, the trees are sprouting buds, and the @CAPS1 are chirping. This depicts a vivid picture of the rejuvenation and vitality that spring brings, creating a sense of hope and new beginnings.
714	9578	4	1	"In the tale ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative with a captivating paragraph. The paragraph reads, ""When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese make their way back and this hibiscus is in bloom, then I will undertake that test again."" The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng was outside her comfort zone; she had relocated to a new country and yearned for everything she left behind, such as the flowers and the hibiscus. Thus, she would await until she felt at ease and at home once more to retake the test. In the text, it states, ""Through the tranquil recurrence of season after season, almost familiar to her now."" She was coming to realize that it was not as dire as she initially thought, and she was acclimating to the new environment. This ending effectively showcases Saeng's growth and resilience."
715	9579	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph, ""When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself in the spring, when the snows dissipate and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus is in the process of budding, then I will retake that test,"" in order to prompt the audience to engage in contemplation. It imparts an added measure of dramatic allure to the story, leaving a lasting impression on the readers."
716	9580	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to demonstrate that she will be well and persevere with resolve. The manner in which she discusses future periods indicates confidence that she will endure until spring. Her discourse regarding the test reflects her tenacity. The employment of the word “vowed” suggests that she will fulfill her assertion.
717	9581	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with this sentence as she is informing readers that she appreciates nature more than academia.
718	9582	4	1	The author concludes this narrative with this paragraph since the flower is referenced throughout the story, and the author states that when the hibiscus is in bloom, she will retake that test.
719	9583	4	1	The author concludes this narrative with this paragraph as she is conveying to us what will transpire beyond the story we are perusing. It implies that when the snow thaws, she will commence anew and reconstruct the greenhouse.
720	9584	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story as she does to illustrate determination. I additionally surmise that it symbolizes adaptation; as the season alters, so will Saeng, and she will retake the test. All will soon revert to normal and adapt, just as she will. Everything is “nearly familiar to her now” (@NUM1).
721	9585	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this denouement as it instills hope. It is akin to a felicitous conclusion to a poignant tale. Moreover, it represents her ultimate contemplation for the story and a fitting terminus.
722	9586	4	1	The author concludes this segment within the story since that is the juncture when she recommences cultivating plants, signifying her aspiration to initiate anew.
723	9587	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it elucidates that Saeng will make another attempt once spring arrives. For instance, the statement “I failed the test,” (Ho) indicates that Saeng indeed failed the test; however, she procured a hibiscus for her mother to plant in the garden. Her mother, remorseful about Saeng's failure, prepares food for her to alleviate her distress and help her forget about the setback. This is significant as it imparts a sense of solace and relief to Saeng, knowing she can approach the test with confidence the next time.
724	9588	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph due to several factors. Saeng made a silent vow to herself, which indicates that she has regained composure and has adapted well to her new country. She perceives the melting of the snow and the return of the geese, and declares that she will retake the test. This demonstrates that she has overcome the disappointment of the test. She is aware that she has the opportunity to retake it and perform better. She has a new perspective on her challenges and views her new country with fresh eyes. All aspects of her life are improving. These are the reasons that explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
725	9589	4	1	The author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to illustrate that she will embark on a new endeavor with a fresh start. When she encounters the flower, the clerk identifies it as a hibiscus. The hibiscus evokes memories of her childhood. Subsequently, she takes it home and presents the plant to her mother. Her mother responds with a “You what?” upon learning the cost from her daughter. The hibiscus, being a symbol of significance, instills in her a greater sense of hope. By stating that she will commence once the flower has blossomed and the geese have returned, she implies that she will make another attempt with a renewed and invigorated start.
726	9590	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve despite her melancholy. She yearns for Vietnam, yet she will attempt the test anew in the coming year. The author's lexical choices in the concluding paragraph evoke a sense of optimism and anticipation. In the story, Saeng is disheartened with herself for failing the test, yet purchasing the plant aids her as it reminds her of her homeland. The notions of Saeng's perseverance and the hopeful undertone of the story are encapsulated in this final paragraph.
727	9591	4	1	"The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph as it seemed to be a significant contemplation for ""Saeng"" and essentially served as the primary impetus for everything, or rather, the central theme of the narrative. She might also have concluded the story with that particular paragraph because it was her last and ultimate recollection of her former life or lifestyle prior to her current place of residence."
728	9592	4	1	The author concludes the story with “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because Saeng fails the test by expending her money on a Big Mac and lacking sufficient funds for the type of flower her mother had sent for. Since Saeng failed the test, she desires to retake it and bring joy to her mother.
729	9593	4	1	I surmise that the author ended the story with that sentence as it imparts an uplifting sentiment after the story was rather sorrowful. Saeng yearned for her homeland, was despondent, utilized the flowers as solace, was dejected about her driving test, and was genuinely fond of the plant. Thus, the last sentence appears to serve as a comforting haven, alleviating the reader's distress to some extent.
730	9594	4	1	The author concludes the story with these final lines to establish a tone of hope that forms a theme. Final lines wield a profound influence on the reader as they are the last words encountered. In this story, Saeng alludes to the time “when the snow melts.” Here, the snow symbolizes the sorrow she has endured since leaving home. At one juncture in the story, “Saeng broke down and wept!” Spring is a time for archetypal rejuvenation. Hence, “the snow will melt,” and her sorrow will dissipate. This engenders a tone of hope for happier times ahead. Next, Saeng refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting link to her former country. She described the plant as “yet another old friend.” If the hibiscus blossoms, then her new life will flourish as well, as she will be comforted to the point of feeling secure. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times she speaks of are followed by a vow to take the test again despite her initial failure. The author is employing the motif of hope to convey that we can overcome adversity. She demonstrates optimism towards spring and is willing to confront a challenge. Therefore, she conveys a life - lesson of courage through this hopeful conclusion.
731	9595	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it unveils the significance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the story, Saeng relocates from Vietnam and experiences profound homesickness. She fails her driving examination and is extremely despondent. When she encounters the familiar plant, she is reminded of her homeland in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus evokes fond recollections of her grandmother and simple elements such as her finely - toothed buffalo - horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water. Upon seeing the familiar plant, “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” This demonstrates the profound importance of the hibiscus to her. The author ended the story with that paragraph to illustrate how the winter hibiscus serves as a source of comfort for Saeng and will inspire her to perform better on her subsequent driving test.
732	9596	4	1	After perusing “Winter Hibiscus,” it is evident that Saeng is a resolute individual with an affinity for nature. It is also discernible that she is determined to pass the test. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the onset of the narrative, Saeng fails her driving test. She makes her way home on foot, and during her walk, she encounters a familiar plant. This transports her to her childhood realm. Had she not failed the test, she would never have walked home and chanced upon the plant. The author did not wish for readers to overlook the reason she walked home; otherwise, this encounter would have never transpired.
733	9597	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to indicate that in the forthcoming spring, Saeng will have another opportunity. The author portrays that Saeng will associate with the blooms of the hibiscus plant and retake the test. The author employs this technique to create a cliff - hanger, suggesting that there is more to Saeng's life yet to unfold. In the story, Saeng endeavors to adapt to change but is finding it arduous. Her mother attempts to console her, yet just as winter arrives, Saeng will have the subsequent spring to retake the driving test.
734	9598	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, … then I will take the test again” because Saeng, like the hibiscus, requires time to develop. Saeng did not perform well on a test but asserts that she will make another attempt after the snow melts and spring arrives. After relocating, Saeng feels isolated and yearns to return home, yet she senses in her heart that given time, she can persevere. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of the flowers in her home country, which aids her in realizing that she must relinquish her past and embrace the present.
735	9599	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it depicts Saeng exhibiting maturity and confidence, knowing that she can retake the test. When it states “Saeng vowed silently to herself,” it implies that she has contemplated everything, and the phrase is akin to her embarking on a fresh start.
736	9600	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a sentence regarding retaking her examination when the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud, as each symbolizes something distinct. The geese signify change, as they alter their habitat during winter, much like Saeng changes her environment by going to the plant location. The hibiscus evokes memories of her homeland, as similar flora can be found there. The budding hibiscus represents a new existence, akin to the life Saeng must lead in a new abode. Overall, the sentence with which the author concludes serves to illustrate Saeng's life in comparison to the geese and hibiscus.
737	9601	4	1	Saeng experienced elation as the snow receded, for she could scarcely contain her anticipation for spring's return. She yearned to witness the animals frolicking around her garden and the magnificent geese soaring in after their arduous hibernation. Thus, Saeng was eager to behold everything rejuvenated, confident that this time she would surely pass the test.
738	9602	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as Saeng awaited the conclusion of winter. Once winter had passed, Saeng would retake the test and plant the flower. Saeng held a deep affection for this hibiscus and was loath to see it perish during the winter months.
739	9603	4	1	"The author concluded the story with this paragraph to demonstrate how the flower bestowed strength upon the young girl. The girl found herself in an unfamiliar place, and back in her homeland, there were numerous resplendent flowers that she adored. Being in a new location devoid of these flowers deeply affected her, leaving her despondent. She yearned for her home, and the only solace she found was in the flowers. For example, the girl remarks, “It’s—it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", pausing because the pain of not being able to say “home” was too overwhelming. The flower she currently possesses is artificial, but when the real one blooms in spring, it will comfort her and instill the confidence to retake the test."
740	9604	4	1	"The author's conclusion conveys her sentiments. The author's conclusion implies, ""When the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is in bloom, then I will retake that test."" This suggests that she has undergone a transformation. For instance, retaking the test signifies her willingness to embrace change. It also indicates her readiness to confront new challenges. To her, the test represents the preparation to embark on something novel. This is the insight I gleaned from the conclusion."
741	9605	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng harbored hope. It demonstrates that hope still persists. The concluding paragraph prompts the reader to formulate their own ending for Saeng. I prefer to envision Saeng beside a sprawling garden and successfully passing the test.
742	9606	4	1	I opine that the author concluded the narrative with this paragraph for multiple reasons. This final paragraph amalgamates and consolidates all the concluding ideas. It conveys that in spring, when all nature stirs to life, Saeng will muster the fortitude to retake the test. The central concepts expressed in the final paragraph illustrate how Saeng and her mother have adapted, and that new beginnings and possibilities emerge in spring. The text states, “I know,” her mother murmured softly. “I’ve witnessed this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers may not be as resplendent, yet it’s robust enough to endure the frigid months here, this winter hibiscus.” This symbolizes that despite life being different away from Saeng's homeland, they will adapt and persevere in their unique manner.
743	9607	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner as it reveals that Saeng must recuperate from the setback of failing the test before she can attempt it anew. Saeng is already cognizant that she can recover. She realizes that she has acclimated to her current abode, and that aspects of her new land, such as the honking of geese, have now become “familiar to her.” The story's narrator remarks, “...she realized that many of the things she had once regarded as peculiar had now become... almost familiar to her.” Initially, things in Saeng's new home seemed strange to her, yet she has healed and grown accustomed to them. Saeng has also recovered from leaving her native Vietnam. She was grief - stricken to depart from her home, as “A sorrow so profound and intense that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her,” but she has healed. Saeng remembers the flowers from Vietnam as “old friends,” indicating that recalling them no longer causes her pain. Once Saeng recovers from failing her driving test, just as she recovered from relocating from Vietnam to the United States, she can retake the test without distress.
744	9608	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it showcases that the character, Saeng, is destined to adapt to her new abode and remain resilient. I surmise that when Saeng's mother states, “Its flowers aren't as comely, but it's sturdy enough to withstand the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,” Saeng's mother is also, in a sense, reflecting on Saeng. It's as if she's suggesting that the move has left its mark on Saeng, yet she will be strong and weather the change. Similar to anyone who has failed a test, she will study more diligently and strive harder to pass it the next time. Saeng will not capitulate and will persevere to overcome the challenges. Saeng understands that adjusting to life's changes is arduous, but with a modicum of courage and hard work, it will be effortless. If she has faith in herself, she will be able to settle into this new place.
745	9609	4	1	When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in spring, when the snow thaws and the geese return and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake that test. This passage exists for numerous reasons. One reason is that winter, with its blanket of snow, decimates her garden. Hence, she yearns for spring to arrive so she can recommence cultivating plants in her garden. She must take a test on the plants she is growing to ensure they are suitable for human consumption. This is why I believe the paragraph “When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in spring, when the snow thaws and the geese return and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake that test” holds significance.
746	9610	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the tale with a captivating paragraph. It read, “When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow thaws and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake the test” (@NUM1). This indicates that the young girl is acclimating to her new nation and anticipates performing better in the spring. The rationale behind the author ending the story with this paragraph is that it demonstrates the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is resolved to grow stronger as time progresses. She is stating that when the hibiscus flourishes again, she will be prepared to retake the test and avoid failure.
747	9611	4	1	The budding of the hibiscus signifies that the flower is in a state of growth. It is a blossom resplendent with vivid hues, and no other flower can rival it. The reason another flower cannot surpass it is that this flower symbolizes a multitude of things and is one of the most naturally - occurring flowers in existence.
748	9612	4	1	The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph as it was the envisioned conclusion of the narrative. He intended to end the story with the character engaging in self - dialogue.
749	9613	4	1	Individuals are required to adapt to diverse cultures when they relocate. They can achieve this through a multitude of methods, such as forging new friendships and acclimating to the locale. Nevertheless, while adjusting to a new environment, one should also retain memories of their former home. This is precisely what Minfong Ho endeavors to convey in the concluding paragraph of the story, “Winter Hibiscus”. In the narrative, a teenage girl named Saeng emigrated from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2. She has numerous recollections of her past home while visiting a plant store. She purchases a plant that was prevalent in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The final paragraph of the story states, “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This showcases Saeng’s aspiration to assimilate into this culture by taking the driving test, as well as her desire to remember her past by nurturing the flower. This concluding paragraph encapsulates Saeng’s sentiment towards her native country and her determination to succeed in her new environment.
750	9614	4	1	As she was making a solemn vow to herself that upon the return of spring, she would retake the driver's test.
751	9615	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate her resolve. When she states, “...when the snows dissolve and the geese reappear and his hibiscus is in bud, then I will undertake that test once more.” Saeng is elucidating how the geese possess the determination to fly back and the hibiscus has the resolve to bud anew; thus, why shouldn't she have the determination and self - assurance to retake the test. Saeng declared, “I - I failed the test.” It appears as though failing the driving test made her feel as if she were destined to fail in the new country. Nevertheless, after witnessing the geese's and hibiscus's tenacity amidst harsh circumstances, she became determined to attempt the test again.
752	9616	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to expound on how she has already taken the test and it is currently winter. She will retake the test when all the flora rejuvenates and commences anew. Saeng desires to retake the test to prove to her mother that she can pass it. She purchased a plant named Dorl Faeng - noi for nineteen dollars to prevent her mother from being disappointed. However, her mother was disheartened that she spent such a substantial amount of money on a plant.
753	9617	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it illustrates that when she encounters elements from her homeland and way of life, they will soothe her in her undertakings. The author seems to require items from her native land that assist her in making the most of situations and evoke pleasant recollections of her earlier life. I opine that whenever I aspire to perform well, it is beneficial to contemplate the positive aspects that hold great significance for me, so that I will be content and motivated to do well. The author is astute to wish to see those things before retaking her test because if she observes her plant thriving and recalls the sight of the geese, it will bring her good fortune.
754	9618	4	1	The author opts to conclude the story with such a paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has acquired a fresh surge of hope from her recollections and the newly familiar elements in her new abode. The confluence of the failed driver's test and her separation from her original home instilled in Saeng a profound sense of loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, “aware of loss so profound and intense that it pricked Saeng's eyes now enveloped her.” Throughout the remainder of the story, Saeng is depicted as still being despondent, leaving the reader uncertain whether she will recover. Then, her recuperation commences with the presence of familiar things. “The pungent aroma of bitter melon drifted out, and Saeng's mouth watered,” “The winter hibiscus was now planted in the ground,” and “overhead, a flock of Canada geese soared by, their faint honks distinct and – yes – familiar to Saeng now.” This realization that the geese are familiar to her paves the way for a new understanding and a fresh wave of hope. She acknowledges the fact that she is gradually becoming accustomed to many aspects of her new home that she initially regarded as peculiar. This is what the final paragraph conveys to the reader. It summarizes Saeng's newly discovered hope that she will learn not only to subsist in her new home but to flourish in it.
755	9619	4	1	The author concludes the story with this statement as it reveals that, to her, the hibiscus symbolizes surmounting obstacles. It symbolizes this because she states, “...and the geese return and this is budding, I will take that test again” (Ho @NUM1). This indicates that despite failing the test this time, when the hibiscus grows larger, she will retake the test, signifying perseverance or the act of overcoming obstacles. Additionally, I believe that this symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it “imparts strength from her old country.” This demonstrates that it symbolizes overcoming obstacles as it will aid her in conquering this test. It will achieve this by bestowing strength upon her or offering her solace. From this, one can discern that the author concludes the story with this statement to emphasize the significance of the hibiscus as a symbol of hope and the ability to overcome challenges.
756	9620	4	1	I am convinced that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it indicates that Saeng is self - assured and prepared to return and undertake the test. Saeng holds a positive self - perception and desires to pursue this course of action.
757	9621	4	1	The author brings the story to a close with this paragraph due to Saeng's engagement in a test. Within the story, there are certain quotations that substantiate my response, such as “I - I failed the test,” Saeng stated. This demonstrates that she was taking a test related to gardening. Another rationale for the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph is that the narrative revolved around spring, gardening, and the associated way of life for the characters. The paragraph discusses spring and flowers. The daughter and mother sustain themselves through the cultivation of vegetables and fruits.
758	9622	4	1	The final paragraph of the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho holds significance for the narrative. This concluding paragraph provides a definitive ending, enabling the reader to precisely anticipate future events. This passage serves as a highly meaningful conclusion to the story as it embodies symbols within the narrative. The author implies that the hibiscus is of great importance to the protagonist. Alongside the hibiscus, the geese and the melting snow also symbolize a fresh start and a new beginning. These symbols are crucial to her as they offer her an opportunity to start anew, and she perceives this in the winter hibiscus.
759	9623	4	1	Saeng was deeply perturbed upon learning that she had not passed the test, and to her, it felt like a letdown or a disappointment. This sentence showcases the ambition and tenacity that Saeng possesses, which will enable her to eventually pass this test.
760	9624	4	1	The author concludes the story with the moment “when they come back...” to illustrate how Saeng has undergone a transformation throughout the plot. At the beginning, she describes her new home as “walking into another world.” As a teenager, she had to relocate from Vietnam, where traditions diverge significantly from those in the United States. Nevertheless, there is one plant, the winter Hibiscus, that bears similarity. This plant bridges her former life and home with the present one. Adapting to the situation of moving was arduous, but the plant evoked familiar scents, and the “familiar fragrance” filled her lungs. It was even challenging for Saeng to utter the words “at home” without breaking into tears. Once the winter Hibiscus was planted, it brought about a change in Saeng, and she realized that she needed to appreciate what she had. In summary, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it revealed how closely the plant mirrored Saeng and how her outlook on life had been modified.
761	9625	4	1	I perceive that the author concludes the narrative with this phrase as a means of demonstrating how Saeng is adapting to her new abode while still cherishing her former one. The essence of the sentence is that Saeng will retake her test in the spring, illustrating her tenacity. Nevertheless, the sentence also reveals how Saeng is acquainting herself with her new land. She states, “when the snows melt and the geese return,” which is significant because the geese and the snow are characteristic of her current home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also remarks, “when this hibiscus is budding,” and this indicates that Saeng is still reminiscing about her old home, as the plant is her link to the memories of Vietnam. Therefore, I believe that the author is depicting how Saeng is maturing and coping with the changes in her life by concluding the story with this statement.
762	9626	4	1	I surmise that what the author intends to convey is that during winter, the hibiscus endeavors to withstand the cold. While most plants simply perish, the hibiscus confronts it directly.
763	9627	4	1	I posit that the author includes this passage to preclude leaving the audience in speculation regarding what would transpire next. The quote “I will take the test again” implies that although Saeng may have failed the test related to the plant, she will never abandon her efforts and that when spring arrives, she will make another attempt. I sense that the author incorporated this to offer a more profound comprehension of the experience of leaving one's homeland to relocate to an unfamiliar and incomprehensible place, akin to the flower - related circumstances in the story. When she reflected on the plants and their fragrance, it rekindled the nostalgic sentiments she harbored about her homeland and the close bond she shared with her grandmother. She was accustomed to plants growing freely rather than being confined in pots with limited space for growth. Witnessing this sight caused Saeng to break down and weep. In conclusion, I believe that the author appended the paragraph at the end to facilitate understanding and to convey that although Saeng may be in a new environment with a distinct culture, she will persevere in taking the test until she deems herself to have passed it.
764	9628	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” deliberately included that final paragraph. In fact, the story is enhanced by its presence. In the last paragraph, the statement “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” holds significance. When the author enumerates those natural phenomena that will occur, it symbolizes rebirth, a fresh start, and a new opportunity, which is precisely what Saeng requires for her driver's license test. The author effectively employed these symbols to instill hope for the girl to endure her difficult period. Ultimately, the story attains a sense of completeness and closure with that last paragraph, rendering it a well - rounded narrative.
765	9629	4	1	I opine that the reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is that it is an edifying tale from which one can glean knowledge. The author did so to enable readers to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the story. It states that “Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam.” By reading this, it informs us about the events that transpired immediately prior to the commencement of the story, thereby facilitating a better comprehension. To me, it serves to encapsulate the entire narrative. Hence, I believe that is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
766	9630	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story in the manner she does due to Saeng's agreement to retake the test. She desires to take the test when the snow thaws, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud. In essence, when spring arrives, she will be prepared for the test. Saeng asserts in the story, “It’s the flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to endure the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” I surmise that Saeng is utilizing this as a guiding beacon since she has recently relocated from Vietnam. She intends to persevere and employ the plant as a symbol. She will make another attempt for her driver's license at the onset of spring.
767	9631	4	1	The author employed the statement “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it symbolizes that her mother is rejuvenating, awakening, and restoring herself. And Saeng declared that she would retake the driving test when that occurs. She was profoundly sorrowful about failing. “I – I failed the test.” She appeared to be both embarrassed and sad. Thus, that final paragraph effectively depicts what Saeng intends to do. She is going to adopt an optimistic outlook and restore herself to return and pass the test.
768	9632	4	1	As the narrator, I appreciate this paragraph in the story because the hibiscus is a valuable plant, and having a garden is a personal choice, much like her mother's decision to cultivate hot peppers. A garden serves as a means to embrace diversity, such as the various types of foods one can plant and the different plants in the world, for example, roses, lilies, and other such flora.
769	9633	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as she is attempting to surmount an obstacle. Failing the driver's test was a setback for Saeng, so she plans to retake it. She intends to use the hibiscus as motivation since the winter for the hibiscus is akin to overcoming an obstacle.
770	9634	4	1	I believe the reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that it demonstrates the profound significance it holds for her and indicates that she truly cares. By showing her concern, she will retake the test.
771	9635	4	1	She concludes the narrative with that paragraph as she intends to inform everyone that she experiences the utmost comfort during spring. It further indicates that she is eager for the geese and the hibiscus to commence budding since it is her favored time of the year.
772	9636	4	1	Saeng is ill - at - ease in her surroundings and has not acclimated to the changes from her place of origin. She spots the hibiscus and decides to purchase it as it evokes memories of her home in @LOCATION2. When she brings it home, her mother initially appears astounded by the price Saeng paid, but then becomes more empathetic upon realizing that she misses @LOCATION2. Saeng states that she will retake her test in the spring, also implying that she will alter her attitude towards residing in @LOCATION1.
773	9637	4	1	I surmise that the author reaches that conclusion in the story as he alludes to the return of the geese.
774	9638	4	1	The author arrives at such a conclusion as she aims to demonstrate that Saeng was not surrendering. I assert this because she relocated to a place she disliked and knew no one. The author endeavors to convey that regardless of the circumstances, one should not give up and maintain faith. By the end, Saeng has confidence in herself that she can pass the test next time. By @MONTH1, she has likely understood that being in an undesired place does not mean one cannot persevere.
775	9639	4	1	The author concludes the story in that manner to convey to the reader the notion that one should not quit upon failure. When Saeng declared that she would return and take the test again when spring arrives, it exemplifies her resolve not to quit and the idea that life will continue. This is the reason I believe the author chose to conclude the story in this way.
776	9640	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that she is disinclined to abandon the battle against her homesickness. When she first acquired that plant, it evoked recollections of her former residence, manifesting the depth of her longing for that place. By declaring that she will undertake the test anew, it demonstrates her refusal to let this setback vanquish her in her new abode and novel existence.
777	9641	4	1	The author concludes the narrative by having Saeng vow to illustrate that Saeng possesses the capacity and indeed has the ability to surmount obstacles. Saeng perceives herself as a failure. Her hibiscus symbolizes the courage required to overcome the obstacle, which is the driving test she failed. The geese represent survival and the tenacity to never yield, to exert one's utmost effort to achieve success.
778	9642	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because the girl within the narrative bears a resemblance to the flower itself. Just as the flower will bloom, Saeng will retake the test; both are afforded a fresh beginning. Concluding the story in this fashion leaves the reader with a positive sentiment. It is a concise ending yet one imbued with profound meaning. “...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I believe the final sentence is nearly inspirational, inspiring one to commence afresh, just as Saeng does.
779	9643	4	1	The author concludes the story with “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” for numerous valid reasons. Among these reasons is that she will persevere and adapt to her new life in Canada. She intends to transform her lifestyle and endeavor to assimilate into her new culture. She will also have to revisit the memory of her grandmother and desires to handle it more adeptly. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her.” She aspires to cope with the loss more effectively. The author aims to emphasize that the story is not yet at its conclusion.
780	9644	4	1	There exist numerous reasons why the narrator might have chosen to conclude with this paragraph. Firstly, as it marks the onset of winter, the hibiscus will not reappear until spring. Moreover, since it is the denouement of the story, it serves as an apt way to end, as it parallels the conclusion of the hibiscus's cycle and the story itself. The final paragraph also succinctly summarizes the narrative, being brief yet charming. This renders it an excellent ending for the story. It diverges from most story endings, thus making it distinctive, as most stories do not revolve around nature. In conclusion, there are multiple justifications for the narrator's choice to end the story with this paragraph.
781	9645	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate how individuals can reclaim their resolve. At the onset of the story, Saeng is disheartened subsequent to failing her driving examination. Upon sighting the Hibiscus, she is inundated with recollections of the past and weeps. Her mother's benevolence prompts Saeng to draw fortitude from the flower, which, as her mother asserts, is ""robust enough to endure the frigid months here."" Anticipating that the Hibiscus will blossom in the spring, Saeng renews her determination to pass the test."
782	9646	4	1	The author concludes with this response as he endeavors to convey that Saeng will replicate her actions but this time be more beneficial in the garden for her mother. She will exert greater effort in her schoolwork and focus less on gardening.
783	9647	4	1	Saeng's personality in this narrative exhibits determination and self - assurance. I surmise that she believes she can engage in more sophisticated endeavors with diverse plants. I also opine that this is an ideal hobby experience for an individual who has an affinity for plants. I perceive that by @MONTH1, Saeng has achieved her goals of planting. I think that by @MONTH1, she desires to pursue her career in gardening. When she declared that when the plants revive, she would retake the test, I believe she implies that she is willing to explore more plant species. I think that by @MONTH1, she has acquired this planting experience from her mother. To me, this has been a family tradition. Saeng will likely have children and instruct them about various types of flowers.
784	9648	4	1	"The author concluded the story with the paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng is anticipating her life with an optimistic perspective. It indicates that she will no longer be despondent due to the changes in her life. The hibiscus serves as a literary device for the story's plot. When alterations occur to the hibiscus, corresponding changes transpire in the story. Initially, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels despairing. When she beholds it, she reminisces about her past and is sorrowful. Once she plants it, circumstances start to improve. She begins to embrace the change when the last paragraph states, ""when they return... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" which shows that Saeng is viewing her future positively, and with this positive transformation, the hibiscus is now commencing to bloom. The author concludes the story symbolically, which aids in expressing the story's themes."
785	9649	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" because Saeng wishes to act in due time and season. During the ""winter season,"" the land or soil was so frigid that plants were unable to grow appropriately. ""Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars,"" and Saeng failed the test. ""There was a frail, wiry beauty to Saeng's mother that touched Saeng deeply""; her mother radiates when she tends to the plants. All these are descriptions that hark back to the past, where Saeng wants to make amends, shine like her mother, and also pass the test."
786	9650	4	1	At the conclusion of the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng states, “When they return, in the spring, when the snow dissipates and the geese migrate back and the hibiscus begins to bud, then I shall retake that test.” When she utters this, she is alluding to her driver's test. She declares she will retake the test as she is reminded that her family did not surrender; they relocated to @LOCATION1 for a new beginning. “A plant she had forgotten lured her back to her childhood realm.” After failing, she spots these flowers, which reminds her that she has never quit before. Thus, she will not do so now either.
787	9651	4	1	The author endeavors to convey a sense of optimism for Saeng in her new nation. After noting her failure in the test, presumably a citizenship examination, the author aims to conclude the narrative with something that reassures the reader. Evidently, this test held significance as Saeng could not even meet her mother's gaze. This was likely the reason she purchased the flower for her mother. The ending reassures the reader so that one does not wonder how things will transpire for Saeng.
788	9652	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to inform us that she will attempt to locate that flower to evoke memories of her former homeland. To demonstrate that they will return and it will endure, even though it is not from the place she desired. In the story, it states, “I failed the test,” indicating that Saeng had bought the hibiscus, which was not genuine or what she had envisioned. In the final paragraph, she asserts she will retake that test. Stating she will seek the winter hibiscus as it used to be in her homeland. She hopes they will survive and that she will discover a flower similar to it, as in the last paragraph it reads, “Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will retake that test,” signifying she hopes and prays she will find one akin to that of her old homeland.
789	9653	4	1	The author sought to conclude the story expeditiously, which is why he ended it with this particular passage.
790	9654	4	1	When spring arrives and all the snow thaws, she intends to sow new seeds. The author concludes thus because she did not perform well on the test initially. However, in the subsequent year, she will tend to her plants and then retake the test to secure a passing grade. The author included this in the conclusion to prevent readers from assuming that she solely frets about the plants.
791	9655	4	1	"The narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" revolves around a young girl named Saeng, along with her mother and grandmother. Flowers hold great aesthetic appeal for them, and they dedicate the entire day to cultivating, selecting, and @CAPS1 them. Saeng lacked the courage to meet her mother's gaze."
792	9656	4	1	The author concludes the story with the given saying as it demonstrates that she has self - confidence. Despite failing the test, she realizes she can retake it and is certain of passing. Initially, she was disheartened by the result. However, when her mother spoke with her, it instilled a sense of confidence, enabling her to face the retest with the belief that she could succeed. This is the reason I believe the author chose to end the story with that particular saying.
793	9657	4	1	This paragraph implies that upon the conclusion of winter, when the geese return from the southern regions and her favored plant, which was native to her former homeland, reappears, she will recommence an endeavor she previously attempted. This time, she will approach it with heightened confidence. This is my interpretation of its meaning.
794	9658	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it effectively summarizes the entire narrative and resolves the conflict of Saeng failing her driver's test. When Saeng declared, ""… I will take that test again,"" it exemplified her determination to pass the examination and her willingness to make another attempt. Since the conflict has been resolved, introducing a new conflict would be necessary to sustain the story's momentum. Thus, the author opts to conclude it. This excerpt from the last paragraph also draws a parallel between Saeng's struggles and those of the geese. Just as geese encounter hardships, Saeng faced difficulties in obtaining her driver's license. Similar to the geese, she will confront challenges again."
795	9659	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative in a well - crafted and harmonious manner. The author chose to end with that specific paragraph to illustrate that Saeng would not be dissuaded, despite being far from home. At the onset of the story, she was in a downward spiral; she had failed a test, and the hibiscus made her feel nostalgic. When she arrived home, her mother greeted her with kind words, acting as a source of solace, preparing food without peppers and bitter melons. This gesture allowed Saeng to perceive the positive aspects of life, preventing her from giving up and instilling confidence that she would pass the test."
796	9660	4	1	In the narrative, Saeng fails her driving examination. As she traverses back home, she spots a familiar plant. Subsequently, she proceeds to a florist and discovers that the plant is a hibiscus. She then purchases the plant with her meager funds as it evokes memories of her homeland and childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother, whom she left behind, thus forging a connection with the plant. Moreover, she observes geese flying overhead, migrating south for the winter. She remarks, “When they return,” signifying when the geese fly north for @DATE1. And “when the snow thaws,” indicating when it becomes warmer and spring commences. “When this hibiscus begins to bud,” meaning when spring arrives and the plant starts to blossom, she will “retake that test.” In other words, she states that she will retake the driving test she failed when spring comes. She allocates the winter for practice and preparation for the test. She vows to herself that by spring, she will be ready to take the test and this time, she will succeed.
797	9661	4	1	She expressed this to demonstrate the tenacity required to achieve success, regardless of the number of failures. One must rise and persevere. She also showcases her bravery in this manner, as it demands considerable fortitude for someone to confront failure and then attempt again. She refuses to accept defeat and endeavors to redeem her setback, hence declaring her intention to try once more. This is the rationale behind her concluding the story in such a way.
798	9662	4	1	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph. It is speculated that the author does so to inform readers of what the protagonist will undertake in the upcoming spring. This may also inspire them to envision an additional narrative, as they will know that she will take the test in the spring.
799	9663	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the tale with that paragraph because when winter arrives, the plant she adores will vanish. The flower had brought her good fortune, leading her to say, “When the snow melts in spring, the geese return, and this hibiscus starts to bud, then I will retake that test.” The flower held great significance for her. She mentioned, “That rich, sweet fragrance was also familiar.” She was comparing the flower's scent to that of her grandmother's shell; they were identical.
800	9664	4	1	The author concludes the story in this fashion because she intends to return and repeat the same actions in the subsequent year.
801	9665	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this because she desires to retake the examination. This is due to her aspiration to pass the test for her mother. Consequently, she brought home the flower to offer an apology to her mother.
802	9666	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as everything within the narrative will recur, such as the seasonal transitions, and one cannot plant or cultivate during winter. For instance, she discussed how the plants bear no resemblance to her homeland, yet she must adapt to the reality that she is not at home and acclimate to her surroundings. I posit this because if she fails to do so, she will merely be a discontented individual fretting about her place of origin.
803	9667	4	1	The author concludes the response by stating that when spring arrives and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. This is because I believe she experiences hope and faith. I assert this as the girl has recently relocated from her home and feels profoundly lonely and depressed as she yearns to return home. She is nostalgic for her past, and when she beholds the plant, it imparts a sense of comfort as if she were at home. When she utters, “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” I think she says this because she is distressed about failing the test, and the plant offers her comfort, which instills in her the faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.
804	9668	4	1	When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in spring, when the snow melts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus starts to bud, she will take that test once more.
805	9669	4	1	In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author selects the last paragraph as it aligns with the tone, the hope, and the symbolism of the essay. The tone of the story leans towards a despondent mood since she failed the driver's test, leaving her extremely distraught. Her recollections of her former country start to affect her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam deeply, and seeing this plant in the store evokes flash - backs. The onset of winter makes her feel as though all hope is lost. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had regarded as strange before had, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become almost familiar to her now.” To her, the unfamiliar things are starting to seem the same year after year, with no new hope, no new experiences, just the same old routine day by day. This plant truly tears her apart, solely due to its symbolism. “She found that she was still too shaky to utter the word 'home,' lest she burst into tears again.” She cannot say “home” because home, for her, is not in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus triggers an outburst of intense emotions related to her past. Thus, the last paragraph more aptly conveys how, when her hope is restored in spring, she will simply try again. The tone, hope, and symbolism all support the last paragraph, which is why it fits where it does.
806	9670	4	1	This was an exceptionally captivating story that delineated all the adversities this young girl had endured. The author concluded it in a highly engaging manner. Upon the story's end, I mused on how delightfully it concluded. I believe the author executed a commendable task. She managed to depict all the tribulations that Saeng had undergone, as if they were the severe winter. Then, as the author stated, “as the snow melts away;…”, I surmise this demonstrates that even though Saeng's problems appear interminable and harsh, one day they will dissipate, and things will regain their beauty, akin to the budding flower in the springtime. Moreover, she accomplished a fine job as throughout the story, I could sense her anguish. I felt as though I was beside her due to her utilization of descriptive words such as “exploding, shock, intense” and others to portray the suddenness of everything. When she concluded it, it was as if she was revealing Saeng's hope for a better future, despite things not being as they were back home!
807	9671	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph stating - “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” because she perceives that when the hibiscus blossoms, she too can flourish by passing the test. Additionally, Saeng is likening herself to the hibiscus. “Its flower isn't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through here, this winter hibiscus.” Her mother is endeavoring to convey that she can also be resilient. She too can persevere through the frigid months. “like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.” Just as the geese, Saeng is realizing to be proud of herself and that there will be other opportunities. One should not constantly doubt oneself as there will be other chances. One should not be afraid to attempt again.
808	9672	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it implies that she will return after winter to tend to it. The author places this in the concluding paragraph as it conveys the depth of her affection for this plant, as she cares for it because it evokes memories of her hometown. Thus, this is the rationale behind her meticulous care for it, so she will possess something to remind her of her home.
809	9674	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph regarding the geese as it illustrates how Saeng, similar to the geese, will adapt to her new environment. It indicates that she will undertake what is necessary to survive, just as the geese must do. She will retake the test and will not abandon her efforts. The paragraph showcases her aspiration to adapt to the new country. For instance, the narration states, “… she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes”. This example reveals that Saeng is unaccustomed to being in the new country and dislikes it. Nevertheless, she will acclimate to it and strive her best to do so, as evidenced in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, “…she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac”. This validates that even though she may not always favor things, Saeng is willing to attempt them to adapt to the new country. The narration states, “…she realized that many of the things that she had regarded as strange before had become familiar to her now”. Saeng is becoming increasingly accustomed to her surroundings and is adapting to them, just as the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese.
810	9675	4	1	The reason the author penned the conclusion paragraph was to illustrate that Saeng is anticipating a more promising future. Saeng yearns to see the geese once more, which remind her of her homeland, and she desires to pass the driving test. In this story, I perceive Saeng as a highly sentimental individual, and hence, I believe this is the motivation behind the author's writing of the conclusion paragraph.
811	9676	4	1	The author concludes this paragraph within the story as it possesses an appealing cadence and serves to convey to the intended audience that regardless of the adversities encountered in life, one should steadfastly pursue what one deems most advantageous. Analogous to the flower, which perseveres and returns after enduring arduous circumstances.
812	9677	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that particular paragraph for a specific rationale. The hibiscus evokes memories of Vietnam for her, while the geese symbolize her current abode. These two elements endow her with strength. Consequently, she will undertake the test upon their return. She believes that with the presence of the flower and the geese in her life, she can successfully pass the test.
813	9678	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng is commencing to assume responsibility for her academic pursuits. For instance, within the story, it was evident that she prioritized the garden over her schoolwork.
814	9679	4	1	Saeng was discussing the evaluation of the plants, ascertaining whether the geese favored the locations where she had planted them. I am cognizant of this because she mentioned the geese in the preceding paragraph, and the geese signified approval when she planted the hibiscus.
815	9680	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph since the narrative predominantly revolved around the hibiscus. Saeng stated that when spring arrives and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. The hibiscus serves as a poignant reminder of her homeland in bygone days.
816	9681	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it pertains to a new commencement. Moreover, regarding what lies ahead at this new juncture, she expresses her intention to retake the test.
817	9682	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as she attains a more sanguine state of mind upon discovering a flower that evokes her homeland. Fearing her parents' ire for failing the test, she purchases a flower that reminds her of home. When she arrives home and informs her mother of the flower's cost and her test failure, her mother is briefly perturbed but then comprehends what her daughter is enduring. By the story's end, she harbors greater confidence that she will succeed in the subsequent attempt.
818	9683	4	1	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with a phrase - dialogue as it pertains to the central theme of the narrative. Saeng was tasked with buying a plant and bringing it home; however, upon her return, her mother disapproved. The text states, ""You what?"" Her mother stared at her incredulously"" (Ho). This response from her mother indicates her displeasure. The narrative also states, ""I - I failed the test"" (Ho). Saeng was loath to disappoint her parents in any manner. By stating, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho), the author showcases Saeng's affection and aspiration for self - growth for her parents, demonstrating her maturity."
819	9684	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey to the reader that Saeng intends to retake the test. The author wishes to inform the reader that since Saeng failed the test, she is aware of her mistakes and intends to rectify them. For instance, when Saeng declared, ""then I will take that test again,"" it reveals that she is remorseful about failing a straightforward test and thus desires to retake it when the snow melts."
820	9685	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant has yet to bud, the geese are departing, and she failed the test, all of which have plunged her into a state of melancholy. Nevertheless, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the plant begins to bud, she will regain her happiness. At that time, she will retake the test and is likely to pass as her positive state of mind will bolster her performance.
821	9686	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner due to numerous reasons. One rationale is to demonstrate that Saeng is not inclined to abandon her efforts and will persist in attempting to pass her examination. Another purpose is to illustrate that even when one's life undergoes changes, it does not necessitate surrender. These are some of the motives behind the author's choice to conclude the story as such.
822	9687	4	1	I surmise that the author concluded the story with this paragraph as they intended to showcase her dedication to her essence, particularly regarding the hibiscus. She regarded the hibiscus as extraordinary because of her interactions with it. For instance, when it was stated, “she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the centre”. This is precisely why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
823	9688	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng perceives that the opportune moment to retake her driving test coincides with the budding of the hibiscus. Additionally, another reason could be that the author wishes to highlight her tenacity.
824	9689	4	1	She pledged this paragraph as she desired to make her mother proud by passing the test subsequent to her previous failure. However, she awaits the plant to progress and commence budding. The budding of the hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning; if it can endure the winter, it will overcome the metaphorical test, and Saeng will also be able to succeed. Since she is aware that a tropical plant can survive a harsh winter, she believes she can persevere and pass the test the following spring.
825	9690	4	1	I conjecture that the author concludes the final paragraph of the story because it serves as a moral compass for the narrative. She is attempting to convey that when the time is propitious, she will persist in her endeavors until she achieves success. Without this concluding paragraph, one would be unable to grasp the underlying message of the story.
826	9691	4	1	Saeng is an exceedingly helpful young woman to her mother. The author crafted the ending sentence to render the story more captivating for the reader and to retain their engagement until the conclusion.
827	9692	4	1	The author concludes the story with that sentence because she intended to convey to the reader that she will undertake this again when the hibiscus returns to season.
828	9693	4	1	I surmise that she utters this because she desires to take the test solely when she is at ease amidst the flowers, plants, and verdure.
829	9694	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it states that when the snows dissipate, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, then she will retake the test. This implies that as she matures and gains more confidence, she will flourish and be able to take the test when she is prepared, much like the hibiscus will be ready to commence budding anew.
830	9695	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because when interacting with flowers and nature, there are seasons when the flowers do not bloom, such as winter. The paragraph indicates that in spring, when winter has passed, she tells herself that she will anticipate witnessing all the plants that nature has to offer.
831	9696	4	1	I am convinced that he employed this as the conclusion to guarantee that she was resilient and would undertake whatever necessary to persevere.
832	9697	4	1	The author incorporates this sentence within the paragraph since it marks the commencement of a novel beginning.
833	9698	4	1	In the narrative, the author concludes with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself” in the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bloom, then I will retake that examination. I surmise she did so to convey that one ought not to abandon hope. In the story, Saeng visits the store and “caressed a petal.” She purchases the plant in an endeavor to obtain a memento of her former residence. In this manner, it appears Saeng is prepared to relinquish her recollections of the past. When she brings the plant home and her mother and she plant it in the garden. I believe Saeng is endeavoring to render her new abode reminiscent of her old one.
834	9699	4	1	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the narrative with Saeng pledging to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow thaws, and the hibiscus is in bud. This is executed to symbolize the numerous lessons Saeng has assimilated. For example, she has learned that she must adapt to alterations in her life and become acquainted with novel circumstances. The geese and snow, she concedes, are elements that were “peculiar before [and] have now become familiar to her.” The hibiscus also embodies something and has a rationale for being included in the final paragraph. It represents the capacity to surmount obstacles, the connection to the past, and solace when required. The final paragraph symbolizes numerous aspects, and if one delves deeply into it, one will discern what Saeng has learned.
835	9700	4	1	The author concludes the story with Saeng privately vowing about the relationship between passing the driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is associated with the way things were for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower acclimates to its environment when transplanted from a different country, in parallel with Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she stated that when spring arrives she will retake the test symbolizes the connection of the flower to her present way of life. For instance, her ability and resolve that when the flower buds, she will overcome hurdles. Another aspect is the connection to her past experiences. And it offered a sense of comfort to her after she failed her driving test. The author links the flower's significance to the story's ending, demonstrating the hope and dedication of Saeng and the obstacles she has surmounted to reach her current state.
836	9701	4	1	I believe the rationale behind the author concluding the story in such a manner is that the protagonist is perpetually inclined to embark anew. For instance, within the narrative, she mentioned failing the test. Based on this knowledge, she contemplated giving up. Hence, this is the reason I surmise the author ended the story with that particular line.
837	9702	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph as it conveys that Saeng is set to commence afresh, much like the hibiscus would. Even when one encounters adversities in life, one should persevere and start anew until the situation improves. Additionally, the author chose that paragraph to conclude the story because it essentially restarts the narrative, mirroring what Saeng intended to do.
838	9703	4	1	She implies that upon her return, she will replicate the same action and assess whether she can achieve better results.
839	9704	4	1	"Saeng silently vowed to herself, ""In the spring, when the snows thaw, the geese return, and this hibiscus begins to bud, I will retake that test."" Her thoughts were diverted from the test when they wandered to the flower. She noted, ""One of the blossoms had fallen off,"" then gently picked it up and inhaled its fragrance. This incident distracted her. Her reaction to the setback was one of quiet resignation for an extended moment, and she remained silent. She did not become angry. Instead, she merely brushed the fragments of green from Saeng's hands. Her mother was primarily preoccupied with the plants as the day progressed. Saeng dug a hole and carefully placed the 'winter hibiscus' into it. Observing her mother sparked a train of thought, leading her to try to envision an image of geese. She resolved to retake the driving test as she was acclimating to her new circumstances. The introduction states that ""Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have relocated to the United States from Vietnam,"" yet it makes no mention of her family."
840	9705	4	1	"The author incorporated this paragraph to illustrate the profound longing the girl felt for Vietnam. When the girl beheld the hibiscus, it evoked vivid memories of her homeland. The sight of the hibiscus offered her solace. Thus, the paragraph serves to highlight the disparities between the United States and Vietnam. Given the United States' changing seasons, it enables the girl to adapt to her new environment. The plant will endure, but she must seek out the positive aspects that the United States has to offer. The author asserts, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had once regarded as peculiar had, through the unobtrusive recurrence of season after season, become nearly familiar to her."" This quotation demonstrates the girl's growing acclimation to the United States. It also shows that while she will always cherish memories of Vietnam, she can find elements in the United States that remind her of home. In conclusion, the paragraph serves to depict the girl's intense nostalgia for Vietnam while also highlighting her ability to find comfort within the United States."
841	9706	4	1	These statements essentially convey that he will reappear, much like the geese that invariably return.
842	9707	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, she remains uncomfortable discussing her former residence; as indicated by “She was still too shy to say the words ‘at home’” [HO]. The melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus serve as reminders of her home. We can infer this from Saeng's statement, “Just as she had known it would feel … Back home, it just grew wild, right from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs” [HO]. These reminders of her home provide her with both comfort and confidence. Therefore, the author concludes with this paragraph because the geese, hibiscus, and melting snow evoke memories of her home, and it is then that she will retake the test, when she is confident and resilient.
843	9708	4	1	By appending this paragraph to the story's conclusion, it demonstrates that a resolution has been reached and that the theme of surmounting obstacles is evident in the narrative. When Saeng failed the test, she was despondent and heart - broken. However, after purchasing the hibiscus, she discovered hope and motivation. Eventually, she decides to retake the test “in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding”. This glimmer of hope at the story's end alleviates the reader's curiosity about what might follow. It aids in bringing the story to a close. This is why most endings are as meaningful as this one. Readers can glean the message from paragraphs like this. In this instance, the author's message is to never abandon hope and that people can find motivation in simple things. It is crucial for both readers, seeking to understand a story's purpose, and writers, aiming to convey their ideas clearly to an audience, to comprehend what an author is trying to convey through such paragraphs.
844	9709	4	1	I believe that the author employs this quote, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” (@CAPS1) as it symbolizes that spring ushers in new life and hope. “But where did the thought of home come from? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother …?” “BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.” (@CAPS2) from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. One night, she was brimming with hope, an abundance of it, yet the next, she found herself in a foreign land utterly unlike her former home. The flowers bloom in spring, signifying new life. There is an opportunity to move forward (@CAPS1) and there is hope. There is hope that spring will arrive, flowers will blossom, and birds will return. It is a chance to let go. The concluding quote is intended to instill hope in her, and she somewhat promises herself that things will improve. Hope makes overcoming every obstacle more manageable and every hardship more bearable.
845	9710	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that the hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng. During the spring, the hibiscus thrives, much like Saeng. When Saeng arrived at the new location, she was diminutive and frail, similar to the plant. “Its leaves quavering in the wind” (@NUM1). This quote indicates that the plant was weak and puny. Had the plant been robust, it would not have been quivering. The fact that Saeng broke down and bought the plant suggests that she was not strong. At the end, the author uses this paragraph to inform the reader that just as the hibiscus has become strong, so has Saeng, and they can overcome any challenge.
846	9711	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate that Saeng does not capitulate and is resolute in passing the examination. The narration states, “Not like the kind we had [@NUM1].” Saeng harbors intense sentiment towards her former abode and desires hibiscus akin to what she and her grandmother once possessed. Since Saeng was unable to procure the same type of hibiscus, she is despondent yet determined to obtain another. The text further asserts, “... and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test [@NUM2].” This also demonstrates her determination as, despite failing the test once, she is willing to attempt it again. She yearns for her homeland and wishes to have hibiscus similar to that in her old home.
847	9712	4	1	In this narrative, the author concludes the events in this fashion to establish a tone conducive to retaking the test. The individual who intends to retake the test may have selected this tone in relation to her past, as she takes the time to prepare herself, perhaps a practice instilled by her parents or grandparents.
848	9713	4	1	The author reached this conclusion because she deems this the opportune moment to retake the test. She includes this detail as the melting of the snow, the budding of the hibiscus, and the return of the geese signify a perfect juncture, for everything has returned and the warmth has arrived. When she says, “when they come back...then I will take the test again,” it implies that she will possess complete confidence to undertake the test. Saeng has vowed to retake it, and she will, believing that this time she will succeed. This is what the author concludes for the story.
849	9714	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the hope and the significance of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story in such a way because spring represents a time of new beginnings, a period when all things revive and commence to regenerate. To state that when the snow melts and the geese return is to suggest that it is the appropriate time for a second chance. As Saeng said after failing the test, “She tore off a leaf, shredded it to pests,” which symbolizes the withering of the hope she once held, or what the hibiscus represented. Hence, this is why the author ended the story thus, as it portrays new opportunities.
850	9715	4	1	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with a powerful one - sentence paragraph stating that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This sentence leaves the reader in a state of suspense while integrating the central theme of the story and combining elements to convey an idea about what might transpire in a potential continuation of [@CAPS1] and this narrative. After all, Saeng had purchased the hibiscus to console her mother and herself. While she stood observing the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng's resolve to remain steadfast and take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a compelling sentence that not only summarized the tale but also left a cliffhanger.
851	9716	4	1	When they return, Saeng privately vowed to herself that in the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus begins to sprout, then she would retake the test. The author concludes the narrative with this passage as it compels the reader to reflect on the story even after finishing reading.
852	9717	4	1	In numerous stories, the narrator employs a dramatic yet conclusive assertion to conclude the tale. An instance of such an occurrence is found in the short story “Winter Hibiscus.” In the narrative, the young girl concludes by informing us when she will retake her test, though not directly, as it states “Saeng vowed silently to herself,” yet it still conveys this information to the reader. The rationale behind the author including this final “vow” is not only to apprise the reader of future events but also to demonstrate the girl's determination and spiritual bond with the plant. For example, when it mentions “and this hibiscus is budding,” it showcases the girl's connection with the plant due to the solace and confidence it bestows upon her, especially since she must take the test. In conclusion, the narrator ended the story with this paragraph to foreshadow future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl had with the flower and her homeland.
853	9718	4	1	In the story, at the conclusion of the last paragraph, the author penned that “When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test” (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph as he intends to indicate that Saeng is a student who failed a test. Even though Saeng has a profound interest in flowers, she also shows concern for her studies. When the snows melt, Saeng will take the test, much like the hibiscus begins to bloom and flourish.
854	9719	4	1	After their arrival, Saeng privately mused to herself. In the spring, when the snows liquefy and the geese return and the hibiscus is in its budding phase, then she would retake that test. She utters this sentence as she feels herself transported back home. She perceives it as reminiscent of her past self. She reflects on how tranquilly she has vowed to herself with each passing season. Her life is serene and uneventful. She senses a sense of belonging. Owing to failing her driving test, she realizes that life in the United States is vastly different from that in Vietnam, and she expresses her emotions when discussing this particular flower.
855	9720	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author aims to remind the reader and encapsulate the narrative. The manner in which she wishes to summarize is from how the story commenced with Saeng failing the test to how it concluded with Saeng planting the hibiscus in winter. The author intends to prompt the reader to recall the entire story.
856	9721	4	1	He concludes the story in such a manner so that you do not perceive her as defeated. She is now more cognizant or holds the belief that she can accomplish the task. Moreover, she has greater self - awareness due to the flower, and now it serves as a reminder of her home.
857	9722	4	1	The author concluded the story thus because, much like the flower that rejuvenates anew, so shall she. The flower symbolizes determination, employed to illustrate her own resolve. Despite failing her driver's test, she retains the determination to retake it and strive for success. Even in the face of failure, she is resolute in overcoming it. Just as the flower loses its buds in winter only to regrow them, Saeng is putting aside her failure and emerging anew.
858	9723	4	1	"The author utilizes this paragraph as a symbol of realization and a new beginning for Saeng. She had devoted so much time yearning for the past that she was oblivious to how to relish the present. Thematically, the author conveys the message of ""living in the moment"". The hibiscus epitomizes strength, as her mother stated, ""It's strong enough to endure the winter months,... that's what matters."" Ultimately, the author posits that difficult times are inevitable, so one should cherish the moments that bring a smile, for they will aid in persevering through hardships."
859	9724	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the character Saeng encountered numerous obstacles to surmount. At the conclusion of the story, Saeng vows to herself that when winter ends, she will retake the test. It appears that the author ends the story in this way to foreshadow Saeng's future. It seems as though the author implies that Saeng will take time to acclimate to her new lifestyle and focus on other aspects before retaking the test. It also demonstrates that Saeng possesses considerable courage to complete what she once failed. Her perseverance is evident and will assist her in overcoming many challenges in her new country. In the text, when Saeng's mother begins to dig a hole, she says, ""Let me help, mother."" This showcases her affection for her mother and her concern for the plant that represents her pastime. Thus, adding the vow at the end of the story was an effective means to illustrate Saeng's commitment."
860	9725	4	1	The author incorporates that excerpt into the text to demonstrate to the reader that she has made an error and will rectify it in the future. I surmise that the author included it for this reason because in the text, Saeng began to weep when she confessed to her mother that she failed the test. This indicates that she was deeply distressed by her failure and hopes to make improvements in the near future. Another reason I believe the author concludes the story in this manner is to lead the reader to believe that Saeng will overcome her homesickness.
861	9726	4	1	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the passage “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This passage indicates that she intends to retake the test due to her initial failure. It is likely that the hibiscus she purchased provided solace and evoked memories of her homeland. Consequently, she associated the budding of the hibiscus with the opportunity to retake the test. The plant instilled in her a positive mindset, enabling her to shift from anticipating failure to envisioning success in the subsequent attempt. Moreover, it seems that the hibiscus comforted her during her distress, contributing significantly to her improved state of mind.
862	9727	4	1	The author concludes the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph as a gesture of reassurance. Saeng had endured a challenging period adapting to the United States from Vietnam. This paragraph leaves readers with the hope that she will surmount this obstacle, akin to overcoming a minor setback on a journey. After failing her driver's test, Saeng had a difficult day and decided to purchase the plant she spotted on her way home. While in the greenhouse, she lamented, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine - toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng deeply missed these aspects of Vietnam, especially during this arduous time. The final paragraph offers the hope that she will retake the test and that all will be well. The winter symbolizes the hardships she has faced and will continue to encounter. It states, “...in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Just as the geese must migrate and the hibiscus must withstand the cold winter, Saeng is separated from Vietnam during this challenging period. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome these hardships, so too will she. This concluding paragraph serves as an excellent, positive, and hopeful ending to this poignant story, inspiring readers to maintain hope in life.
863	9728	4	1	There is a reason why the author concluded the story with this paragraph. It implies that upon her return after winter, she will reiterate her tasks. For instance, she will engage in activities such as digging and sending flowers to their customers. Subsequently, when winter arrives again, she will repeat the entire cycle. Essentially, the author employs different phrasing to convey that upon the conclusion of winter, she will recommence her actions. This is precisely why the author chose to end the story with that paragraph, as it encapsulates the cyclical nature of her experiences.
864	9729	4	1	The author incorporated the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to delineate the theme of the story. Saeng regarded the hibiscus as a source of hope in her life. Additionally, the author utilizes carefully chosen words, or diction, to elucidate the manner in which Saeng structured her life around this flower. This paragraph also illuminates how her cultural background is intertwined with the overarching theme of the story, thus providing a deeper understanding of both Saeng's character and the narrative's central message.
865	9730	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant evokes nostalgic memories for Saeng, and she shares similarities with it. Saeng can be likened to the plant in that both are initiating a new phase in an unfamiliar environment. The plant has been planted in the soil outside her house and must grow and adapt. Similarly, Saeng must learn to grow, improve, and prepare to retake the test. Saeng believes that when the plant has grown and adapted to its new surroundings, she too will have achieved personal growth and adaptation. In conclusion, this paragraph serves as an ideal ending for the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, effectively tying together the symbolism of the plant and Saeng's journey of self - discovery and resilience.
866	9731	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes this narrative with that paragraph to encapsulate the essence of the story and to convey that Saeng would attempt the test once more. In the story, it states, “She realized that many of the things she had previously regarded as peculiar had, through the quiet recurrence of season upon season, become nearly familiar to her.” This final paragraph aids in synthesizing all these elements.
867	9732	4	1	A solemn vow serves as an apt conclusion. She pledged to retake the test as she had failed it. It conveys her innermost sentiments and demonstrates her commitment to achieving success. The author intended to convey a profound depth of emotion and her desperation. Hence, she perceived an abundance of beauty to sustain her resolve.
868	9733	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph, “When they come back,” Saeng silently vowed to herself, “in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test.” She purchases the flower as she failed the driver's test. She had encountered the familiar plant on her way home as she visited a florist's shop to acquire one. The flower elicits a sense of happiness and evokes memories of her homeland. The author concludes the story in this manner as it instills hope, preventing the narrative from ending on a somber note. She still harbors hope of passing the driver's test.
869	9734	4	1	She failed the test on the same day she obtained the plant and witnessed the geese soaring overhead. The plant and the geese hold symbolic significance for her. The plant symbolizes her former abode, while the geese may represent the journey of life, surmounting the challenges of frigid weather and snow to progress towards a more favorable environment, presumably a warmer climate. All of this serves as a symbol of a new beginning for her. Thus, she desires to retake the test around the time of this new beginning, when the geese return and the plant flourishes. She believes that since she failed, she should embark on a fresh start.
870	9735	4	1	The author incorporated the story within this paragraph for multiple reasons, including extending the narrative's length and illustrating that even if one falters initially, they can persevere and make another attempt.
871	9736	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” the author incorporates this paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This is to emphasize that Saeng is willing to attempt planting anew in spring. Saeng desires to try planting once more in the spring season to demonstrate that she is endeavoring to adapt to the new surroundings and to show that she is concerned about the planting.
872	9737	4	1	Saeng declared that she would undertake that test the subsequent spring and achieve success with the hope inspired by her winter flower and the sight of her flock of geese. She harbors high expectations that she will pass her test. When she perceives buds on her hibiscus, then she will retake the test. Saeng was extremely disheartened when she failed it the first time and she is hopeful that she will pass the following spring.
873	9738	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph elucidating when the character, Saeng, will retake her driving test. She states that she will do so “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” It is posited that the author concludes with this paragraph as it illustrates that Saeng has discovered newfound hope. For instance, since her relocation from Vietnam, she has been deeply homesick. “She found that she was still too tremulous to utter the words ‘at home,’ lest she dissolve into tears again.” However, when she encounters a hibiscus plant, it evokes memories of her homeland. “Back home it simply grew untamed, protruding from the crevices in brick walls or between tiled roofs.” Saeng even purchases the hibiscus to cultivate in her garden at her new residence. Having the hibiscus plant by her side bestows upon her recollections of her former life and the fortitude to persevere with her new one. The plant imparts the strength for her to attempt her driving test once more. By concluding with that paragraph, it showcases Saeng's transformation in emotions from despondency to hopefulness and also reveals the strength that the hibiscus plant endows her with.
874	9739	4	1	The author concludes the final paragraph of the story as she is cognizant that one ought not to be fearful of embracing a new life or a novel environment. For example, in the story, the mother remarks, “Its flowers aren't resplendent, but it's robust enough to endure the frigid months... this winter hibiscus.” This indicates that the mother wishes for Saeng to learn that she should be steadfast even in times of adversity. Another instance is when the narrator asserts, “She realized that numerous things that she had previously regarded as peculiar became familiar through the tranquil recurrence of season after season...” This demonstrates that Saeng recognized that the new place where she currently resides is nearly akin to their former home. In conclusion, the last paragraph conveys that Saeng should confront the new reality of the world. She should be resilient and go with the flow of life.
875	9740	4	1	“In the spring, when the snows dissipate and the geese return and the hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test,” Saeng muses to herself. Saeng finds herself in an unfamiliar locale where she has no companions. One day, she discovers solace in a plant shop when she chances upon a Hibiscus flower. The flower soothes her spirit and aids her in commencing to acclimate to the alterations in her life at this juncture.
876	9741	4	1	"The author concluded the narrative with a paragraph detailing that when winter transitions to spring, she would retake her driving test, driven by a primary motivation. The young girl expresses this sentiment as, akin to a plant rejuvenating and commencing anew, she too intends to embark on a fresh start. In the essay ""Saeng"", the young girl asserts, ""When they return in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese migrate back and the hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake the test."" Saeng had failed the test on her initial attempt. She opts to await spring to initiate afresh. In the essay, the ""winter hibiscus"" evokes memories of her grandmother and her homeland in @LOCATION1. Initially, this induces sadness, yet she subsequently recognizes the beauty of these memories, which aids her in surmounting this arduous period. These memories will endow her with the fortitude to persevere in life and attempt the driver's test once more in spring."
877	9742	4	1	The author concludes the text with that paragraph as the girl is discussing her intention to retry when @DATE1 or spring arrives. The author employs this ending to elucidate the girl's emotions towards spring and the animals. Throughout the story, the girl makes numerous references to the geese, indicating her fondness for animals. This choice of ending effectively captures the essence of the girl's connection to nature and her anticipation for a new beginning in the season of renewal.
878	9743	4	1	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it encapsulates the impact of memories and the plant on the protagonist. Similar to the plant, Saeng thrives more in her native country and holds a deeper affinity for it. Nevertheless, she can still endure in a new environment if properly cared for and strives to maintain her allure. The ending reveals that Saeng realizes that with greater effort, she can persevere like the plant, prompting her to retake the test. Her mother remarks, ""I've witnessed this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers may not be as resplendent, yet it is robust enough to withstand the frigid months here."" Her mother aims to console her daughter, assuring her that she can overcome difficult times. Ultimately, Saeng is confident in her ability to do so."
879	9744	4	1	"In ""The Winter Hibiscus"", the author elects to conclude the story with an optimistic paragraph proclaiming, ""When they return, in the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese migrate back and the hibiscus begins to blossom, then I will retake that test."" The rationale for this upbeat conclusion is multifaceted. For instance, the hibiscus symbolizes resilience in the face of adversity and the resolve to adapt and thrive. Saeng's circumstances mirror those of the flower, which has been uprooted from its original habitat, replanted, and compelled to endure the harsh winter. Saeng has left her beloved homeland, must initiate a new life in a foreign country, and has encountered the setback of failing an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she realizes that, like the cherished hibiscus, she must exhibit resilience and determination to succeed in her new abode. This conclusion underscores the theme of hope and the power of perseverance in the face of change."
880	9745	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph—“When they come back,” Saeng vowed silently to herself, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”—as it clarifies her course of action once winter concludes. Moreover, it piques the readers' curiosity regarding the fates of Saeng and her mother. Another purpose is to set the stage for a new narrative arc once winter has passed. This ending not only provides a sense of closure to the current story but also hints at the potential for future developments, leaving the readers eager to discover what lies ahead for the characters.
881	9746	4	1	"I comprehend the rationale behind the author's conclusion of the story in the manner he does, and it is a valid rationale. It posits that since she failed this year, in the subsequent year when it is time to prepare the garden, she will attempt again. That constitutes a sound moral principle because one must persistently strive to achieve success, for even if one fails, no progress is lost. It is akin to what transpired with @PERSON1; despite it taking him @DATE1 attempts to successfully create the light bulb, he simply stated, ""I merely discovered @NUM1 methods not to create a light bulb."" Thus, I concur with this author and his conclusion of the story."
882	9747	4	1	She undertakes this action to illustrate her struggle with her gardening endeavors. This is the case because each year, she must tend to her garden as the winter decimates it, signifying that it destroys the garden.
883	9748	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it demonstrates Saeng's unwavering determination not to surrender. Saeng desires to elicit pride from her mother, so she is resolved to do whatever is necessary. All Saeng endeavors to achieve is to bring happiness to her mother. When she failed, her mother was initially disappointed yet surprisingly understanding. When Saeng informed her mother of her failure, she began to weep, but then her mother wiped away her tears.
884	9749	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it implies that when the shovel plant regrows in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is in bud, she will retake the test. Hence, she will await the next spring to take the test.
885	9750	4	1	In the narrative, the test entailed whether she could surmount her homesickness. When she visited the greenhouse, all the plants and flowers evoked memories of her homeland. When she beheld the flower, it reminded her of the instances when she would fetch water from the well, and a flower would be floating within it. So, after the winter, she would revisit the location to ascertain if she still experienced homesickness. I believe she concluded it in such a manner as it showcases her perseverance, refusal to quit, and willingness to try again.
886	9751	4	1	"I surmise that the author included the last paragraph as the narrative could benefit from a segment regarding Saeng and her future plans. Moreover, the author @MONTH1 might have added that paragraph because she perhaps contemplated penning a second installment of ""Winter Hibiscus"" and sought to write a portion relevant to the next story. This would prompt one to ponder whether, if she retakes the test after the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will pass it this time. I believe this @MONTH1 is the rationale behind the author's inclusion of this paragraph in the story."
887	9752	4	1	I opine that the author concluded the story with these lines to illustrate Saeng's heightened confidence. Initially, when Saeng first beheld the hibiscus, she was despondent, yet upon seeing the flower, her mood brightened. Subsequently, her mother assisted her in planting it, and Saeng is certain it will endure until spring. Ultimately, Saeng feels improved as she has reflected upon her past. This is why the author chose to conclude the story in this manner, highlighting Saeng's emotional growth and new - found assurance.
888	9753	4	1	"I posit that Minfong Ho concluded her story ""Winter Hibiscus"" in this fashion to showcase the unwavering determination of Saeng, the protagonist. Despite failing the test, Saeng obtained the hibiscus, which rejuvenated her resolve to pass the test. The recollection of her homeland and family spurred her on, as she surmised they would have desired her success. Thus, she vows to retake the test when the hibiscus plant commences budding. This, in my view, elucidates the rationale behind the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus""."
889	9754	4	1	"At the conclusion of the essay ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, it concludes on an optimistic note. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I believe the author included this passage to convey Saeng's sentiments towards her country. When the country where she resides experiences spring, it evokes memories of her native land, making her feel at home and giving her the courage to take the test. This is the reason the author placed this sentence at the end of the essay, emphasizing Saeng's emotional connection to her homeland and new - found resolve."
890	9755	4	1	"Saeng pledges to herself, ""In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is in bloom, then I will retake that test."" The hibiscus serves as a metaphor for Saeng's childhood. Having grown up in Vietnam and relocated to the @LOCATION2, she yearns for her homeland, and the flowers trigger a flood of nostalgic memories, causing her to break down in tears. Adapting to change, particularly moving to a foreign country, is arduous. However, planting the winter hibiscus is her coping mechanism. She realizes that she will gradually adjust, as ""many of the things she had once regarded as strange had become... almost familiar."" She vows to retake the driver's test when the hibiscus blossoms because, like a flower, she too undergoes transformation. When the hibiscus overcomes the frigid, dismal winter and flourishes, Saeng will know she is prepared to retake the test, as the flower symbolizes her journey through change. The geese in the story also represent change; they migrate south in winter to evade the cold and return home when it warms up. Similarly, Saeng will defer the test in winter but face it in spring when she feels at ease. This shows how nature's cycles mirror Saeng's personal growth and her ability to face challenges."
891	9756	4	1	Thus, she states that she will undertake the test in the subsequent year.
892	9757	4	1	The author brings the story to a close as, in my opinion, the author concludes it because he intends to convey that he will be prepared in the following year to rejuvenate. He will be ready to confront the test, refrain from weeping and succumbing to despair upon seeing the plant, and instead recall childhood memories. He will be fully prepared.
893	9758	4	1	Saeng procures a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden, serving as a poignant reminder of her homeland. She has failed a certain test and is deeply disheartened by the outcome. Her mother, empathizing with her distress, does not express annoyance regarding the cost of the hibiscus, which amounts to @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus, Saeng murmurs to herself, “In the spring, when the snows dissipate, the geese return, and this hibiscus begins to bud, I shall retake that test.” The author employs this paragraph to prompt readers to contemplate whether Saeng will succeed or fail the test once more. It also piques curiosity about the nature of the test, as the author mentions “hibiscus is budding” and “the geese return,” suggesting that it is likely a test that can only be taken annually, as Saeng indicates that she will retake it “In the spring.”
894	9759	4	1	The author concluded this paragraph within the story as, in my view, he aims to convey a message to the reader. The author intends to assert that if a plant can endure the frigid winter, then she can pass her driver's test. This is the rationale behind my belief that the author included that particular paragraph.
895	9760	4	1	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the statement, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends the story with this vow or commitment as it exemplifies hope and determination. Saeng's silent vow, “I will take that test again,” showcases her resolve and refusal to accept failure. This is sufficient to instill hope in someone who has experienced failure and desires a second chance. This paragraph also encapsulates and reveals Saeng's admirable character. It demonstrates her fortitude, as despite failing the first time, she is willing to endure the pain of trying again to achieve success. The act of failing and persevering exhibits remarkable inner strength. Additionally, the author concludes with this paragraph because the imagery of “when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding” creates a sense of cyclicality. It holds the promise of spring and the arrival of better times. There are numerous reasons why the author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
896	9761	4	1	"The author appended this at the conclusion not merely to bestow a felicitous and sanguine ending upon the narrative but also to demonstrate to the reader that Saeng gradually acclimated to the vicissitudes of life. The preceding paragraph elucidates that Saeng recognized ""the numerous things that once appeared peculiar had now become... nearly familiar to her."" Consequently, the author ultimately concludes that although she failed the test on this occasion, just as the geese will reappear in spring, she can retake the test. The author effectively conveys the essence of the story and concludes it in a ""buoyant"" manner."
897	9762	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with the statement, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" to illustrate that the hibiscus plant has instilled hope in Saeng. It has assisted her in surmounting arduous and challenging periods. In the story, Saeng has just failed her @CAPS1 test and was compelled to walk home. She was extremely despondent. On her way home, Saeng encountered a familiar flower. She entered a flower shop to inquire if they sold the hibiscus she had seen. The employee directed her towards the flower. The hibiscus evoked numerous recollections of her hometown in Vietnam. Saeng planted her flowers in the vegetable garden. That flower has granted her hope. She is now prepared to attempt the @CAPS1 test once more."
898	9763	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the season has concluded. For instance, commencing in winter, the hibiscuses are withering. Moreover, she is departing and will not return until she can plant flowers again in spring, and she will revisit when she retakes the test. In conclusion, this is the rationale behind the author ending the story with this paragraph.
899	9764	4	1	"The reason the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the final paragraph is to infuse hope into the conclusion. It imparts a certain sense of elation at the end of a moderately disheartening narrative. It serves to illustrate that if one cares sufficiently, they can persevere forward. And that the end of one's world is self - determined. This is why I believe the author employed such a potent statement at the conclusion."
900	9765	4	1	The character appears to have newly discovered confidence and a renewed delight in the plant that reminds her of her homeland, which comforts and motivates her. She declares that when those elements return, she will exert great effort to complete the test. She is establishing a timeframe to drive herself forward, a common endeavor among most individuals.
901	9766	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it demonstrates that, at times, one must await the opportune moment to attempt again. For instance, the book states, “Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, ‘How strange to see it in a pot.’ Back home, it simply grew wild, protruding from the crevices in brick walls or between roofs.” This illustrates that any feat can be accomplished when the time is right.
902	9767	4	1	Emotions, symbolism, and the realization thereof are all factors contributing to the author's decision to conclude the story in such a manner. One reason the author ended the narrative thusly is to evoke a medley of emotions within the reader, such as sorrow, hope, and wonder. The author elicits a sense of sadness by depicting the girl's failure on the test and her longing for home. Simultaneously, the author instills a glimmer of hope that they will one day return. Moreover, the conclusion leaves much to be pondered, as it raises numerous unanswered questions. The author employs symbolism in the concluding sentences by endowing the plant and the geese with significance in the story, and the plant is associated with the home she yearns for. In the final part of the story, the author leaves the reader with multiple interpretations, such as the importance of the plant and the reason for their departure from a place they cherished so deeply. This is why I believe the author ended the story in this way.
903	9768	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng has an affinity for the resplendent flowers that once flourished in her homeland. Her preferred flower was the winter hibiscus, adorned with exquisite red petals resembling velvet. Additionally, she failed a test she had taken. Thus, the story conveys the message that nothing can rival the allure of home, yet sometimes, one merely requires another opportunity to succeed.
904	9769	4	1	I surmise that he did so because he aimed to showcase his profound affection for all aspects of life.
905	9770	4	1	The rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story in such a fashion is that, despite the arduous trials the plant endured, it will still struggle at the end of winter. The author posits that the plant will face the test once more, which entails surviving the frigid winter and blooming at its conclusion.
906	9771	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph for numerous reasons. One reason is that the author endeavors to convey that she will surmount the impediment (the test) regardless of circumstances. In the text, it states “it can make it through the frigid months.” This statement, @CAPS1 consumer her, also supports the final paragraph. Moreover, she is in a novel country and embarking on a fresh start. The text mentions “Not like the same kind we had before,” which implies that it is distinct in this country and she will soon acclimate. Finally, it declares, “this hibiscus is budding,” signifying that she will flourish.
907	9772	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph since Saeng is alone and is reassuring herself that she will retake the test she failed. This is because she is gradually adapting to her new abode now that she has discovered something that evokes memories of her life prior to her departure.
908	9773	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner so that readers can comprehend the theme, which is that one can always commence anew after committing an error. For instance, Saeng failed her driving test, which took a toll on her, yet she will attempt it again in the spring. Presumably, she believes that once she has rejuvenated herself, she will perform better.
909	9774	4	1	Explains the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph. It makes sense to conclude the narrative with this paragraph. Here is the reason for this belief. The paragraph is one of the pivotal elements of the story. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return,” all she asserts is that when the snow dissipates and the grass regrows, she will resume planting, and she will be content with this. “This hibiscus is budding; then I will attempt that again.” She intends to replant her flora and assess their progress so that she can improve upon them. Saeng adores this plant so fervently that she can scarcely contain her anticipation. When the time arrives, she will plant abundantly. This is precisely what the paragraph conveys: Saeng will await the opportune moment to plant a hibiscus. However, since her arrival in the United States, she has developed a profound affection for this flower.
910	9775	4	1	For her, it is the optimal time to engage in activities as all the joyous recollections resurface alongside the geese and the hibiscus.
911	9776	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as the hibiscus serves as an impetus for her to take the driver's examination. Come spring, when the snow thaws, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will attempt the test once more.
912	9777	4	1	Several factors contribute to this. Firstly, by spring, she will have had ample time to acclimate to her new existence. Additionally, when the hibiscus commences budding, she will experience a sense of comfort, as if it instinctively evokes her childhood recollections. It also serves as a connection to her former home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adapts to its new environment in the ground soil, she too will adjust and be prepared to retake the test. It is as though when the plant is primed to start budding, she will be ready as well.
913	9778	4	1	The author concludes the story with that sentence, a vow made to the flower. It simply asserts that Saeng will return and make another attempt the following year to see if things will turn out favorably with the hibiscus.
914	9779	4	1	The author includes the paragraph to demonstrate his/her concern for the flowers. Flowers only emerge during spring and @DATE2, and that is when one can observe all that flourishes in a garden. Thus, she can pass the test and find contentment with the garden.
915	9780	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" for several reasons. Predominantly, the blooming of the hibiscus symbolizes hope - the plant will endure the winter months, regrow, and regain its strength. Similarly, Saeng will persevere. Despite being in an unfamiliar and unwelcome place, Saeng can surmount adversity and hardship. In like manner, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is the rationale behind the author's choice to end the story in this manner, to convey the impression that Saeng still harbors hope."
916	9781	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng makes a solemn vow to herself. “In the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese return and the hibiscus commences budding, then I shall retake that test,” this vow signifies that she will initiate anew, institute changes, and acclimate to her novel life. She desires not to disappoint her mother and will not be vanquished by her memories. She concluded the story in this manner to illustrate how her life will transform in the future and how she will learn to embrace her current circumstances.
917	9782	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph stating, “When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow dissipates and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test,” as the author intends to convey that Saeng is not going to abandon her efforts. She is resolute in taking and passing the test. It also implies that Saeng will await the opportune moment to undertake the test. She will bide her time until the situation improves. The text indicates that “The snow dissipates, the geese return, and the hibiscus is in bud,” suggesting an amelioration of her circumstances.
918	9783	4	1	The author concludes the story with this final paragraph as it demonstrates that by spring, she will be prepared to retake her examination. It reveals that akin to the geese, which exhibit care and return, she will have sufficient time to study and succeed in her test. In the narrative, the author incorporates this last paragraph to genuinely showcase her commitment to eventually become at ease in her new abode and to pass her driver's test in due course. Saeng aspires to be comfortable with her new life but has not yet achieved this due to feelings of nostalgia. However, she understands that after this period, she can persevere and attempt again, much like the geese that often migrate during winter. This was an extremely effective means of concluding the story as it truly conveyed Saeng's message of dedication and yearning to surmount her obstacles, including adapting to her new home and mastering driving.
919	9784	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story in this fashion because it resembles a nascent beginning. The denouement of the story prompts one to contemplate that Saeng is poised to progress with her life. It makes me envision that she plans to commence her life afresh, drawing a parallel with the hibiscus. Once the plant “restarts” (rebuds), she will embark on a new chapter. It also evinces that she is determined to persevere with her life in the new location. She will not allow her life to be disrupted by her relocation from Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to initiate her life anew. The ending serves as a “cliffhanger” to indicate that her story has not yet reached its conclusion. It reveals that there remains a possibility for her to advance with her life. It also shows that she does not permit her failures to govern her. She is a resilient young woman and is resolved to overcome this challenge.
920	9785	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it constitutes an exceptionally compelling concluding paragraph that captivates one's attention to a certain extent. Moreover, it reveals that the girl is steadfast in passing her test, which leads one to perceive this as a story of determination. This is the rationale behind the author's choice to conclude the story with this paragraph.
921	9786	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this fashion to demonstrate that Saeng intends to make another attempt. An instance of her renewed endeavor is when she perceives the plant and discerns its symbolic significance to her. Another example is her assertion that she desires to plant the hibiscus independently so as to preserve the memories eternally. This is the rationale behind the author's choice to conclude the story in this manner.
922	9787	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as she endeavors to convey that since the hibiscus has been planted, they will observe its resilience during the winter. And when spring arrives and it remains standing, she can undertake the test. I surmise that the author was drawing a parallel between the hibiscus and their life, along with the obstacles they will encounter. Thus, if the hibiscus endures, it signifies that everything will be well, enabling her to return and take the test.
923	9788	4	1	"The final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" depicts determination and the personal growth of an individual. Saeng states that ""when this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the hibiscus blossoms, Saeng will flourish and persevere through the winter in an attempt to successfully pass her test. Saeng concludes by expressing this as an epiphany that she cannot remain despondent indefinitely. She must be resolute to pass the test. The subsequent season will represent a form of renewal, commencing anew and emerging as beautifully as a blooming hibiscus."
924	9789	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho, concluded her story with the paragraph regarding how when the geese are present and the hibiscus is in bloom, Saeng will retake her driver's test because she aimed to conclude on an optimistic note. At the onset of the story, Saeng, who had recently relocated from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2, failed her driver's test. She discovered a plant that was native to Vietnam, yet it evoked feelings of sadness. ""I mean it's not like the kind we had at – at -"" she realized that she was still too tremulous to utter the words associated with home, lest she dissolve into tears once more. (Ho, @NUM1) Hence, by concluding with a description of positive future prospects, Saeng can focus on that and divert her attention from other matters."
925	9790	4	1	"The author concludes the story with these paragraphs for a compelling reason. In a sense, she is relinquishing the past and will await an opportunity to retake it. I believe it is fortuitous that she discovered the flower. This is because it enabled her and her mother, in a way, to find solace and improve her state of mind. For instance, when it states, ""the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This indicates her new - found hope and the willingness to face the challenge anew."
926	9791	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate the transformation of the protagonist, Saeng, from the story's inception to its conclusion. It demonstrates a modicum of newly - acquired confidence that Saeng now possesses. This denouement also reveals the profound impact the “Winter hibiscus” had on her by evoking recollections of her native country. Had Saeng not discovered the hibiscus, she would never have begun to reminisce about her former home. This reminiscing not only rekindled memories of her past but also enabled her to contrast her new abode with her old one. Through this process, she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so onerous and that she still carries a fragment of her old home with her daily. This realization bestowed upon her sufficient hope and confidence to attempt the driving test anew. This ending showcases Saeng's change of heart towards @LOCATION1 and her modest gain of hope and confidence.
927	9792	4	1	The author opts to conclude the story thus because she intends for the moral of the tale to be indelibly imprinted in the reader's mind. She posits that one will always have an opportunity to make a fresh attempt, much like the flower recommencing its cycle and gaining another chance to blossom. This symbolizes the possibility of starting afresh and trying again, just as the girl is about to do in the test. She will retake the test when the cycle restarts, enabling her to do so in tandem with the flower. The budding of the flower will offer her support and instill hope in her.
928	9793	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story as she does because it encompasses both subjects. The author endeavors to convey that when the protagonist takes her driving test next spring, the hibiscus will endow her with the confidence to pass it. This is the author's underlying message.
929	9794	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the narrative in a manner that indicates the protagonist's desire for a new beginning. I surmise this because, during her conversation with her mother at the story's conclusion, she states, “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.” This statement implies her aspiration to start anew and assimilate into her new country. Additionally, I hold this view because she wishes to await the seasonal change before retaking the test, as she mentions, “when the snow melts and the geese return.” She makes this assertion because she yearns for a completely unblemished slate when she retakes the test. This is the reason I believe she chose to conclude her story in this way.
930	9795	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story in such a fashion because it depicts the passage of time. As time elapses, the protagonist has matured further, and perhaps she will be prepared to take the test, having now experienced it. Moreover, the budding of the hibiscus will render her more at ease and composed, as it will evoke a sense of security and homeliness. The phrase “hibiscus is budding” suggests that just as the flower is embarking on a new phase, so too will she.
931	9796	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that she must acclimate to the new country. She desires to await the moment when the hibiscus commences budding. The plant's budding indicates that it is adapting to a new environment, just as Saeng is. The story reveals that Saeng is unaccustomed to the new country; she weeps upon seeing the plants as it evokes memories of her former home. The plant also offers her solace. Once she adapts to the new country, she will retake the test.
932	9797	4	1	"The author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with Saeng silently vowing to herself, as it demonstrates the profound significance of the flower to her. For instance, the hibiscus flower instills in her determination, as it serves as a poignant reminder of her homeland. Saeng declares, ""…and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The hibiscus flower endows her with confidence and reminds her of her home in Vietnam prior to their relocation to @LOCATION2. Consequently, the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph as it symbolizes the flower's importance."
933	9798	4	1	The author of the story concludes with the statement “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because Saeng failed her test and knew her mother would be angry, which is why she obtained the flower. Had she not failed the test, she likely would not have acquired the flower in the first place.
934	9799	4	1	She experiences a profound connection to this hibiscus plant as it evokes memories of her homeland. I surmise that she intends to convey that when the hibiscus plant reveals its inner budding, she too will do the same. The plant must exert considerable effort to yield flowers, and the sun must emerge to melt the snow. This implies that when the time arrives, she needs to emerge and shed all her detrimental habits and accomplish what is necessary to pass the test. Nevertheless, she must not forget her origins and all the memories left behind. “...vowed silently to herself...then I will take that test again.”
935	9800	4	1	"In the story ""Winter @CAPS1,"" the author concludes the tale with the final paragraph in such a manner because when the season returns for budding, she will eagerly resume exploring. She will yearn to delve deeper into the hibiscus and understand its characteristics. Moreover, she eagerly anticipates commencing the care of the hibiscus as they begin to bud. This is the rationale behind ending the story with that paragraph."
936	9801	4	1	There exist numerous reasons for the inclusion of this paragraph. It demonstrates that the flower will offer emotional encouragement to her during its budding phase, as it will evoke memories of her home. This is evident when she states, “a blossom of two would have blown into the well,” which serves to remind her of her homeland. Additionally, it aims to illustrate her adaptation to her new abode. When the geese flew by, she remarked that she realized many things she once perceived as strange had now become nearly familiar to her. This showcases her process of adaptation and her current enjoyment of her new life. This final paragraph holds significance as it reveals the transformation of her life.
937	9802	4	1	The author posits that she will attain readiness in due course. Specifically, when the flowers commence their growth and the geese begin their return home, she will be fully prepared.
938	9803	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph due to the protagonist's failure in the driver's test. She suggests that when the outdoor temperature rises slightly and the plants commence their growth, she will attempt the test once more, with the hope of achieving success. The indication of her test failure is found in the statement, “As Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test.” Presumably, the presence of snow on the ground contributed to her errors during the test. In conclusion, this is the rationale behind the author's choice to conclude the story with this paragraph.
939	9804	4	1	In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus,” the author concludes the tale with the statement “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to convey a particular message. She requires all these events to transpire for her to be sufficiently composed to retake the test.
940	9805	4	1	The author concluded the story in this manner because the plant symbolizes new beginnings, which Saeng desperately requires. Saeng failed her test and sought solace. She visited the greenhouse and spent @MONEY1 on a hibiscus plant that reminded her of her homeland. Simultaneously, the hibiscus plant also reminded her that her new home represents another fresh start. The hibiscus plant instills in Saeng a more optimistic outlook, suggesting that starting anew can be a positive experience and that she will pass the test on her next attempt.
941	9806	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph. The rationale behind this is that the author wishes to conclude by penning about geese. Secondly, the author has an affinity for plants and the seasons in which they bud. The author vowed that they would undertake that test in the spring. The author can scarcely await the snow to melt so as to take the test.
942	9807	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph due to her desire for the same environment and all that she wished for prior to taking the test.
943	9808	4	1	I believe the author's choice of words in the story's conclusion conveys to the reader that the story persists. Nevertheless, I opine that the test serves to remind her of home.
944	9809	4	1	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author concludes it thus because the story commences with Saeng failing her driver's license test. Additionally, she considered the winter hibiscus to be good luck after it vanished, and her familiarity with [CAPS3], which are the geese. She combined these elements, which is why she said when the geese return and the snow melts... That is the reason she said it.
945	9810	4	1	I surmise that Saeng concluded the story in this manner because there is always an opportunity to atone for the past, provided the past permits it, signifying that [CAPS1] did not pass the test. I feel that “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” implies that even though it is snowing outside, there is always the next spring to revive the vegetable garden. This also pertains to Saeng; even though she failed the test, there is always another chance to compensate for that setback, retry, and strive for success in this attempt.
946	9811	4	1	The author concludes the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” with this sentence: “When they returned, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake that test.” The Winter Hibiscus represents her affection for the place where she once resided. It isn't a tangible one; I mean not the kind we had “at - at...” She was still too tremulous to utter the words “at home.” When the hibiscus buds, she will still cherish her home, yet she will have better acclimated to her present environment. The return of the geese to their habitat implies that she will one day discover a place to call home in this location. When she finds that place, she will realize she is prepared to “take the test” or conduct normal activities. The author concluded the story with that sentence to illustrate that Saeng will ultimately integrate into her new life.
947	9812	4	1	The author concluded the story in such a manner because she maintained an optimistic outlook. Similar to the geese's return, she is confident that she can retake the test. She is certain that she will pass the test. In the story, she stated, “Many things that she had previously regarded as peculiar had, through the tranquil recurrence of season after season, become nearly familiar to her now.” This indicates that upon her arrival, she perceived everything as strange since she had never encountered such things before. Now, as she resides here, she will grow accustomed to it because she anticipates what will transpire, and nothing will seem strange to her anymore as this is now her home.
948	9813	4	1	The reader surmises that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl expresses her intention to attempt again and retake the test. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng, the girl, took a test and failed it. She received a flower that evoked memories from the past and decided to retake the test as she believed circumstances would improve. Additionally, when the girl witnessed the geese flying overhead, she knew they would return after winter in spring. When they do, her flower will bloom, the one that brings back pleasant memories from the past, and she will retake the test and succeed. These instances exemplify the reasons why the reader believes the author concluded the story with that paragraph.
949	9814	4	1	The author concludes the story in that manner because she holds deep affection for her homeland, nature, and her mother. She adores the verdure and eagerly anticipates the arrival of spring. Thus, she subjects herself to the trial of overcoming the feeling of being out of place, which is the rationale behind her concluding the story in this way.
950	9815	4	1	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes her narrative in this fashion to showcase the girl's resolve and to leave the reader in a state of eager anticipation. This assertion is based on the evident determination of Saeng to achieve success. By ending the story on a cliff - hanger, the author heightens the excitement and creates a longing for further action.
951	9816	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng is acclimating to residing in a novel location. Toward the text's conclusion, Saeng remarks that numerous things she once regarded as peculiar had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was soothing and evoked memories of Saeng's homeland. She utters, “In the spring when the snows melt,” as she is commencing to adapt to “the quiet repetition of season upon season.” The geese, which form a distinct V, are becoming recognizable to her. The final paragraph is an efficacious means of concluding the story as it reveals that Saeng is growing accustomed to her new environment and is optimistic about the future.
952	9817	4	1	Upon their return, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in spring, when the snows dissolve, the geese reappear, and this hibiscus begins to bloom, she will retake that test. The author's primary intent with these lines was to captivate the readers' attention by crafting a continuous passage that implies Saeng is adapting to her circumstances. Saeng appreciates the distinctiveness of plants and finds solace in recollections of her native land.
953	9818	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to convey that she will wait for a brief period until the plants flourish. Thus, if she fails once more, she will have something to cling to. For instance, when Saeng “failed the @NUM1,” she endeavored to surmount the feeling of failure by purchasing something that reminded her of her country and rekindled past memories during this time. Another example is when Saeng “felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral (@NUM2),” she forgot about all the events in her life, from relocating to @LOCATION1 to failing her test. This sensation focused her on feeling at home again. In conclusion, the author's conclusion fosters the belief that Saeng overcomes her problems by recalling memories like those associated with the plant that reminded her of her home country.
954	9819	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate that Saeng will persevere into the next year. She stated that initially, all the novel @CAPS1 aspects seemed strange to her upon arrival, but now they have become second nature. I believe that the hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope and inspiration for her. I surmise that she finally realizes that she is in @LOCATION1 to stay and cannot return to Vietnam. Hence, she must accept that this is her home, and I believe she is on the path to achieving this acceptance.
955	9820	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she harbors faith in a new beginning. Saeng likens herself to the hibiscus. When the “hibiscus is @NUM1,” she will retake the test. This indicates that when the hibiscus rejuvenates its life, so will she. Saeng perceives that when the hibiscus is “strong enough to endure the frigid @NUM2,” she is also robust enough to pass her driver's test and reside in a new country. Winter and cold symbolize death, while spring represents a new life or commencement. Saeng muses to herself, “In the spring… I will take the test @NUM3.” This marks a new start for Saeng, a fresh hope.
956	9821	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, the author chose to conclude it with the statement “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows dissipate and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will attempt that test once more.” This demonstrates that despite the protagonist Saeng having faced failure previously, she will persevere and try again. The geese will return to embrace a new spring, and the hibiscus will sprout new blossoms, symbolizing a fresh start. Saeng asserts that if both can overcome challenges through perseverance, so can she, and this time, she will achieve success. Moreover, it showcases the determination inherent in all living beings to fulfill their primary objectives. The flower is driven to re - bud, the geese are impelled to return in spring, and the main character is motivated to pass the test. Minfong Ho, the author of “Winter Hibiscus,” included that quote as the final line of the story to inspire. To encourage individuals to persevere on the journey of life and, in the event of task failure, to make another attempt. Thus, the author offers inspiration to aid in the continuation of one's life.
957	9822	4	1	In the concluding paragraph of the story, Saeng makes a silent vow to herself that she will retake the driving test come spring. The author brings the story to a close with this paragraph to illustrate the hope that nature instills in her. She depicts serene elements of nature, such as the geese and hibiscus, from which she derives strength as they evoke memories of her homeland. In this manner, she will always carry a fragment of her past with her. Throughout the narrative, Saeng forms a connection with nature and draws sustenance from it. Her mother maintains a garden, and Saeng relates to it as she has a distinct past, favoring natural fare like bitter melons over @LOCATION1. This final paragraph exemplifies the hope that the idyllic nature of her homeland has bestowed upon Saeng, facilitating her adaptation to life in a new locale. In essence, nature serves as a bridge between her past and present, enabling her to find comfort and strength in a foreign environment.
958	9823	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the anticipation that the protagonist will attain greater fortitude. Specifically, it implies that she will feel at ease in her new surroundings and will yearn less for her homeland. Additionally, she made an attempt throughout the year but fell short of the mark as she failed to procure what her grandmother had requested and instead spent the resources on something else. This is the rationale behind the author's decision to incorporate this paragraph into the story. By doing so, the author aims to show the character's growth and the potential for a more settled future, despite past setbacks.
959	9824	4	1	The author brings the story to a close with the paragraph as it portrays the protagonist, Saeng, adapting and exerting her utmost effort in her new lifestyle. For instance, when she privately vowed in the last paragraph, “in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will retake that test.” This suggests that she is investing more energy into her endeavors within her new environment and circumstances. In summary, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate how an individual can adapt to change, highlighting Saeng's resilience and determination in the face of a new life.
960	9825	4	1	The author incorporates this passage as he employs metaphors to elucidate the author's perception of Saeng's personal life. Through these metaphorical devices, the author aims to offer a deeper and more nuanced understanding of Saeng's experiences and emotions. By using such literary techniques, the author can convey complex feelings and situations in a more vivid and relatable manner, allowing the readers to gain a better insight into Saeng's inner world. In conclusion, the use of metaphors enriches the narrative and provides a more profound exploration of Saeng's personal life.
961	9826	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it demonstrates Saeng's empathy. She desires to assist her mother with the garden due to having disappointed her. For example, she feels remorseful about upsetting her mother, and while her mother is gardening, she utters, “Here, let me help, mother,” as her mother's delicate beauty has touched her. When Saeng informed her mother that she failed the driving test, she was even aware not to meet her gaze because she was distressed; it states, “Saeng didn't dare look her mother in the eye,” which reveals Saeng's concern regarding her mother's reaction. However, in the end, her mother was pleased that she obtained it, stating, “It's a beautiful plant, I'm glad you got it,” which indicates that the mother and daughter share a close bond. This is why Saeng's empathy to improve herself is manifested in the story's conclusion.
962	9827	4	1	The short story “Winter Hibiscus” revolves around a young girl who prioritizes gardening over academic pursuits. The provided conclusion posits that when spring arrives and the winter hibiscus fades away, she will pass the school test that she previously failed. Presently, Saeng is solely preoccupied with the winter hibiscus; for instance, the line “I paid over nineteen dollars for it” elucidates that she expended all her funds on this plant rather than on any other provisions. Additionally, the quote “I failed the test” accompanied by Saeng's tears demonstrates that she failed it solely because she was fretting about the hibiscus. In summary, during the spring, when the winter hibiscus has withered, Saeng will direct more of her attention towards school rather than gardening. Perhaps then she will pass her test and resume her pastime of gardening.
963	9828	4	1	The author has a valid rationale for concluding the story in this manner. The protagonist of the story, Saeng, relocates to the United States from Vietnam and fails her driver's test. Saeng has yet to acclimate to life in the United States, and upon encountering a familiar hibiscus plant, she purchases it as a memento of Vietnam. The author endeavors to convey that since Saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blossoms in spring, she will be prepared to attempt to pass her driver's test as she will have adapted to life in the United States. The overarching theme of the story is that if one is departing from the place where they grew up, they should bring items that evoke memories of that location so that they can retain a semblance of that culture. Hence, the author commences and concludes with the same subject matter.
964	9829	4	1	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a statement about retaking the driver's test in the spring to convey the themes of adapting to circumstances and the determination to achieve success. The central character in the story, Saeng, is an immigrant. As the United States is not her native land, there are numerous aspects of life here to which she has not yet become accustomed, and the story portrays her struggle to adapt. For example, when she sees the flower “Madagascar penwinhle,” she muses, “how strange to see it in a pot” because “Back home it just grows wild.” The final sentence of the story is symbolic when it mentions “and the geese return,” as the geese adapt to their circumstances by migrating south for the winter, much like Saeng is attempting to do, and Saeng realizes that their patterns are becoming familiar. The very last line proclaims, “I will take that test again.” This encapsulates the determination that Saeng exhibits throughout the entire narrative. Not only is she resolute in succeeding in her driver's test, but also in other endeavors. For instance, when attempting to plant the hibiscus, Saeng notices that “the soil was cold and hard, and she had difficulty thrusting her shovel into it.” Despite the challenges, however, she “Dug out a hole” and is aware that it is robust enough to endure the cold months, just as Saeng will be strong enough to surmount obstacles if she perseveres. The last sentence in the story is significant as it conveys important themes and offers valuable insights into Saeng's character.
965	9830	4	1	The author concluded the story with the paragraph to establish the central theme. In the narrative, the [CAPS1] represents something of great significance to Saeng—confidence, beauty, adaptation... certain qualities that she can attribute to herself, as well as her recollections of her former homeland. She had failed the driving test. Subsequently, she bought the [CAPS1] to alleviate her homesickness. I perceive the [CAPS1] as a metaphor for Saeng; it is the same [CAPS1], yet it grows differently in a distinct region, just as she remains the same person but is now in a new abode. The significance of the last paragraph primarily pertains to the [CAPS1] budding. It symbolizes Saeng's homeland; as the [CAPS1] blossoms, it can represent her affection for her homeland. When the author wrote “then I will take that test again,” it alludes to the newfound confidence she will possess later when the [CAPS1] blooms (another [CAPS1]/person metaphor).
966	9831	4	1	"The author, @PERSON1, concludes the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng commencing anew. ""In the spring, when the snows dissipate and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bud..."" signifies her fresh start in life. Although she, in @MONTH1, yearns for her former life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine - toothed comb, she is exerting an effort and ""taking that test again."" By referencing the test, she demonstrates her refusal to succumb to the ""anguish of loss"" and her grief."
967	9832	4	1	The author concludes the story with the statement “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is because the author deduces that the hibiscus offers solace to Saeng. Once the plant is vibrant and thriving, she will feel at ease to undertake the test. In actuality, seeking comfort from a plant may seem naive, yet it is not the plant itself that provides comfort but rather the fact that the hibiscus evokes memories of her dearly - missed home. Once the plant flourishes, akin to her tropical abode, she believes it will console her sufficiently to pass the test. In conclusion, this is the rationale behind the author ending the story with this paragraph.
968	9833	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that as the plant burgeons, so too will Saeng. After failing the driver's test, Saeng visits the greenhouse and discovers the Hibiscus plant, which conjures memories of her true home in Vietnam, where similar plants thrived. The plant then prompts her to reminisce about all the recollections, and despite her sorrow, she finds solace in them. She employs this plant as a source of comfort to remind her of her origins and all the pleasant memories, thereby elevating her spirits. To bolster her confidence, she decides to plant it. “The ‘winter hibiscus’ was now in the ground, and Saeng tamped down the soil around.” Then, she observes geese soaring in the sky, which serves as a sort of symbol for that day, a memento for the next year. “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” she will retake the test. These elements evoke positive memories that fortify her resolve.
969	9834	4	1	I surmise that Saeng must retake the test to improve her grade. Saeng is apprehensive about the snow in the spring as she contemplates the flower being covered by it. Saeng's mother permits her to assist with the peppers and melons and allows her to stay for dinner. In essence, these circumstances contribute to her situation and the need to retake the test.
970	9835	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as she intends to convey that Saeng is not relinquishing her pursuit of success in the test. The author aims to inform the readers that Saeng is persevering, as indicated by the statement “...then I will take that test again,” which unequivocally demonstrates her lingering hope. The author wishes for Saeng to continue her endeavor in the test to discover the appropriate flower. Consequently, this is the reason why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.
971	9836	4	1	The author concludes this narrative with that particular paragraph as, during winter, all life recedes until spring, when vitality returns. Saeng, in such a context, would be more inclined to perform well on the test. Saeng can be likened to a plant, struggling and fretting in winter only to blossom resplendently in spring. Moreover, I surmise that the memories evoked by the winter hibiscus plant inspired her to cease dwelling in the past and progress towards the future.
972	9837	4	1	He penned this piece as he is expounding upon meteorological transformations.
973	9838	4	1	The author presumably concludes the story with that paragraph as she is essentially drawing a parallel between the plants and herself. That is, just as the plant blossoms, she too will thrive by taking the test. Her rationale might be that, albeit reluctantly, she has come to realize that numerous things she once regarded as peculiar have, through the unobtrusive recurrence of seasons, become nearly familiar to her. Essentially, she emulated the geese by raising her head to watch as their distinctive V - formation was imprinted against the evening sky, gradually facing into the distance. This is why I believe the author included this to conclude the story, as she was comparing herself to the geese and acting in a similar manner.
974	9839	4	1	The author delineates the last quote as he desires for her dreams to be actualized. He elaborates that she has realized that many of the things she once considered odd have, through the serene repetition of seasons, become almost commonplace to her. Saeng hails from Vietnam, and her family harbors a particular aspiration. Thus, the author hopes that her family can acclimate to their new life in the given location.
975	9840	4	1	She utters this because currently it is winter, and flowers cannot grow in winter due to the frigid temperatures. Hence, she implies that when spring returns, she will attempt the task of growing flowers anew. In summary, this is the reason why the author presents that conclusion at the end of the paragraph.
976	9841	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to instill within the reader a sense of hope and determination for the future that resides within Saeng at that moment. Throughout the story, it appeared as though Saeng was succumbing to despair upon recollecting her homeland. She was not faring well in her new country, and this realization was most profound when she ""failed her driving test"". However, when she walked past the flower shop and witnessed all the plants that once bloomed so freely and beautifully in her homeland confined in those tiny pots and struggling to survive, it reminded her of herself in @LOCATION1. As she commenced planting her hibiscus, she once again compared herself to it, and that is why when her plant flourishes splendidly in the spring, she will pass that test."
977	9842	4	1	The author concludes the story by stating this because he believes it would be fitting, as at Valkay, there is discussion about how the hibiscus is yet to bud in the winter and how all the geese will return to their home and remain there since they loathe the winter. This conclusion ties together the themes presented in the story, emphasizing the cyclical nature of life and the longing for a familiar and comfortable environment during harsh times.
978	9843	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One reason is the transformation in Saeng's attitude. At the onset of the story, Saeng is despondent and has no optimism about adapting to her new home. However, by including this paragraph at the story's conclusion, it demonstrates that she has regained hope and is resolute not to surrender. Another reason this paragraph serves as the story's conclusion is to illustrate that life persists even in the most arduous circumstances. The fact that a new season will commence symbolically indicates that Saeng will not perpetually feel this way and that she, too, will undergo a change. In essence, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for several valid reasons that enhance the story's overall message.
979	9844	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, after the girl failed her test, the bud evokes memories of her grandmother's long grey hair, which, I presume, brings her good fortune. As winter wanes and spring arrives, the buds begin to reappear, and that is when she will retake her test. This is precisely why the author chose this statement as the story's final sentence, as it ties together the themes of hope, renewal, and the passage of time, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism for the girl's future.
980	9845	4	1	I shall explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason the author does so is that it conveys that Saeng is self - assured. It also indicates that she will not abandon her efforts. Moreover, it showcases her willingness to elevate her capabilities to a higher level. By concluding the story with this paragraph, the author effectively encapsulates Saeng's growth and determination, leaving the reader with a positive impression of her character and her potential for future success.
981	9846	4	1	"The author most likely intended to depict the promising enlightenment regarding Saeng's intricate dilemma. In the phrase, ""When they come back"", the author most likely refers to the hibiscus flowers that symbolize the cherished recollections of her homeland. The author portrays Saeng's struggle to acclimate to her new life through a ""test"" of planting the buds, just as she had done back home with her grandmother. This test represents the attainment of adaptation to her new life. For this reason, the author concluded her story with the paragraph indicating that Saeng will indeed undertake that test once again."
982	9847	4	1	"The author opted to conclude the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's resolve to adapt to her new life. In the third paragraph on the second page, the author writes, ""Saeng regarded the white bud in her hand at present, diminutive and delicate… That, at the very least, she could cling to."" After failing her driver's test, Saeng felt alienated and solitary. She earnestly turned to the flower as a memento of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower evoked comforting reminiscences for her, so she purchased one of the plants and returned. Following a discussion with her mother, Saeng comprehends that she must come to terms with her new abode, much as the flower must adjust to its novel surroundings. By concluding the story with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must ""bloom"" in her new home to thrive. She still requires time for this, just as the flowers need time to establish their roots in the ground."
983	9848	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph, perhaps to convey confidence that she would repeat every action if necessary. For instance, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will take that test again."" Essentially, she is expressing her willingness to take that step, that risk. The author ended the story imbued with this confidence and courage."
984	9849	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" She does so to conclude on a note of hope for retaking the test and achieving success. Additionally, the author ends it in this manner because Saeng has faith in herself, and thus she made a vow to undertake an action. Hopefully, this will further encourage her and also serve as a motivation."
985	9850	4	1	The author of this story concludes the tale with a paragraph essentially stating that as winter approaches, things will wither away and then resurface the following spring. She is referring to the plant. It seems that she is essentially keeping a record of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to her mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is eager to witness how the flower buds the next spring and what other novel experiences she will encounter.
986	9851	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative in such a manner as it effectively showcases her evolving attitude. Presently, she is undergoing a transformation, and she will wholeheartedly commit herself to whatever tasks lie ahead. With a sense of pride, she intends to retake the test in the spring when the snow dissipates.
987	9852	4	1	The author opts to conclude the story with the given paragraph to convey multiple aspects. Primarily, the author employs the concluding paragraph to illustrate optimism. Throughout the story, a somber tone pervaded, yet the ending offers a glimmer of hope. At the start, it states, “@CAPS1 of loss so deep…” (@NUM1), while at the conclusion, it reads, “I will take that test again.” (@NUM2), which demonstrates the shift in her attitude from cynicism to hopefulness. Another rationale for ending the story with this paragraph is to depict Saeng's acceptance. When the narrative mentions that the geese were “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM2), it indicates that despite Saeng's sorrow at leaving her home, she is adapting remarkably well. Hence, the author concludes the story with an inspiring paragraph to signify a positive change.
988	9853	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, indicating that when spring and @DATE2 arrive once more, she will retake the test. This implies that she will plant the flowers and strive to make them grow anew, hoping not to fail in the endeavor. For instance, “Mrs. Lambert, liked it. this sharp bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.”
989	9854	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as he aims to end it on an auspicious note and convey a positive message. They will not abandon their efforts merely because they failed the first time.
990	9855	4	1	I contend that the sole reason the author incorporated the last paragraph was to demonstrate that she would not yield easily. She remains determined to retake the test, perhaps in the hope of attaining good fortune from the hibiscus. One day, after failing her driver's test, Saeng was walking home when she recognized a flower. She then visited a florist to inquire about purchasing it. Upon acquiring the flower, she returned home and presented it to her mother, and they planted it. I surmise that it might evoke pleasant memories of her hometown or simply bring good luck.
991	9856	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this passage due to its symbolic nature. When the geese return in spring, it will signify a new commencement. When the hibiscus begins to bud, it embodies a new lease on life. When all these events transpire, Saeng will also embark on a fresh start. Leaving the story to conclude in this manner serves as a cliff - hanger for some. It instills a craving for more; knowing she failed her test, one yearns to discover if Saeng will succeed in the spring, a time of a brand - new start. Everything and everyone will experience new beginnings when the new season commences. When the hibiscus blossoms, it will be as if she acquires the new capacity to surmount obstacles, forms new connections with her past, and finds solace during arduous times. The hibiscus symbolizes all of this.
992	9857	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it encapsulates the essence of the entire narrative. Saeng witnessed the events of winter and upon its recurrence, she endeavors to commit them to memory so that she can anticipate what will unfold.
993	9858	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because by the time winter draws to a close, she will have acclimated to her new social environment, much like the hibiscus.
994	9859	4	1	"The young protagonist, Saeng, from the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, has relocated from her native Vietnam to the United States. The young girl had aspirations of obtaining her driver's license but was unsuccessful. The hibiscus she encounters provides her with comfort, evoking memories of Vietnam. When she purchases it, her mother expresses concern regarding the price but, upon perceiving her daughter's profound homesickness, becomes empathetic. After planting the hibiscus, she observes the geese and realizes that they alter their habitats annually. The geese, along with the hibiscus, inspire Saeng, and she vows to herself that ""in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, I will retake the test."
995	9860	4	1	The author employs this paragraph as it serves as an impeccable conclusion. Through this, Saeng conveys to [LOCATION1] that once all the snow has vanished, she will retake the test. A discerning reader can glean more than what is explicitly stated. She has a deep affection for the hibiscus, and when it revives in spring, she will be imbued with new vigor to retake the test. From her interaction with the hibiscus, it is evident that this plant exerts a significant influence on her, as it powerfully reminds her of her former home. Moreover, it becomes apparent that everyone and everything deserves a second chance. In her case, it is the test she wishes to retake. Additionally, in spring, after spending a few months in [LOCATION1], she will adapt to this novel situation. Presently, she is merely homesick, despite [LOCATION1] now being her home. Thus, the hibiscus is beneficial to her; it is something she can cling to from her former abode.
996	9861	4	1	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story in this manner to illustrate the surmounting of obstacles. The narrative depicts the numerous hardships Saeng encounters when departing from her former residence and arriving at her new abode. On the day described, she fails a driver's examination, refrains from having lunch with her friend, and expends all her funds on a plant from her old home. Moreover, this paragraph demonstrates how the Hibiscus serves as a symbol of her. The plant is not in its natural habitat, facing multiple challenges; the cold, its diminutive pot, and even its overall surroundings. In every aspect, the plant is in the same situation as the main character, and the last paragraph is employed to establish a connection between them.
997	9862	4	1	The rationale behind the author's utilization of this paragraph is that he implies that the snow dissipates during the spring season. This conveys the idea that with the arrival of spring, a new beginning emerges, and the harshness of winter, symbolized by the snow, gives way to renewal and hope.
998	9863	4	1	The final paragraph conveys a singular message. That message is to emulate the resilience of a Hibiscus, to persevere and retake the trials of life. Just as the Hibiscus will reappear in the spring, so too will one find the strength to overcome adversity. Evidently, the last paragraph holds profound significance, inspiring readers to face life's challenges with unwavering determination.
999	9864	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with this paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng is receptive to transformation and intends to achieve this by the onset of spring. Through this change, Saeng aspires to feel at ease in @LOCATION1, retain memories of her former dwelling, and refrain from succumbing to emotional distress. Additionally, the author employs the geese as a metaphor because they migrate annually, adapting to the necessity of leaving their home, suggesting that Saeng too can confront and adapt to her circumstances.
1000	9865	4	1	"The reason the author concludes the story with that statement is that when one experiences failure, it is essential to take time to recover and make another attempt. When Saeng fails her driving test, she is disheartened. After the setback, she visits a greenery where she encounters flowers reminiscent of her homeland, and there she purchases the hibiscus. This purchase reminds her of the disparities between her old and new environments and how circumstances change when one relocates. Initially, these changes may be unpleasant, but over time, one can acclimate. For instance, when she first witnessed the geese flying in a ""V"" formation, she found it peculiar, yet now it has become familiar. After failing her driving test, Saeng realizes that despite the changes, she must possess the courage to try again."
1001	9866	4	1	She concluded the paragraph with that specific passage to demonstrate her earnestness regarding her gardening endeavors and her resolve not to resume gardening until the geese return.
1002	9867	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the particular paragraph employed because Saeng is an ardent nature enthusiast. Given her profound affinity for nature, she would never, under any circumstances, cause harm to it throughout her life. Presumably, the author intended to conclude with a fitting paragraph. Consequently, she is required to retake the test.
1003	9868	4	1	The author concludes this narrative as it showcases her tenacity. It indicates that she will persist in endeavoring to adapt to her life until she fully embraces her new abode. Moreover, it suggests that just as the buds burgeon, so too will she, primarily on a mental rather than physical level. Her decision to retake the test implies that she has confidence in herself, believing that she will mature and evolve into an individual who may yearn for their homeland yet accepts the new dwelling they inhabit. This is the rationale behind the author's chosen ending.
1004	9869	4	1	She is conveying here that she will embark on a new chapter when spring arrives. She intends to make a fresh start and perform better on her driving examination. It is surmised that she concluded with this paragraph as it illustrates that Saeng is not one to give up easily and will exert greater effort.
1005	9870	4	1	Reserved elements necessitate meticulous scrutiny.
1006	9871	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as the cold was extremely harsh, or perhaps the author never desired to be present while the cold persisted. At that time, it was truly frigid.
1007	9872	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. One is that she wishes to convey empathy for the hibiscus. Another reason is to demonstrate that Saeng aspires to make her mother exceedingly proud of her, signifying that she does not want her mother to think she will abandon her efforts. This also contributes to the fact that Saeng has self - belief and genuinely thinks she can pass the test. Lastly, I surmise that this final paragraph reveals how Saeng wants people to recognize that even something as diminutive and seemingly insignificant as a plant can assist her in surmounting obstacles and leading her towards her dreams. The author selected this paragraph to conclude the story mainly because we know that Saeng will not cease believing in herself.
1008	9873	4	1	The author of the story opts to conclude the narrative with that sentence as the story predominantly revolves around how Saeng failed her driver's test. However, upon seeing the hibiscus, it evoked memories of her home and alleviated her distress. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng states, “And that rich, sweet scent – that was familiar too,” which elaborates on the allure of the flowers and their familiarity as she recognized the fragrance. Saeng was already despondent about leaving her home in @LOCATION1. Subsequently, moving to @LOCATION2 and then failing her driver's test exacerbated her situation. Nevertheless, when she saw the flower, it reminded her of home, and she felt somewhat better. Thus, when the author employs that quote to end the story, it is to illustrate that she will possess sufficient fortitude to attempt the test again when the flower blossoms.
1009	9874	4	1	The author concludes the story in such a manner to emphasize a point. Saeng vowed that it would teach her that all living things exist with hope and adaptability. She implies that when everything rebounds and demonstrates its survival, she will also persevere. She will then undertake the driver's test. The author also intends to prove that individuals need to have confidence in themselves. One merely needs to acclimate to their surroundings. This is the rationale behind the author's choice of conclusion.
1010	9875	4	1	In literary works, authors conclude their stories in diverse ways, each with distinct impacts. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it has a “poignant” effect on the reader and essentially summarizes all the points discussed in the story. For instance, at the beginning of the conclusion, it states, “Saeng vowed silently to herself.” In this distinctive quote, the author employs imagery, presenting a mental image of a solitary girl kneeling in the cold garden, whispering to herself. This quote and this part of it have a poignant effect on the reader. Another reason the author concludes the story thus is that it encapsulates all the elements covered in the story. “When the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” This quote references the hibiscus, which is frequently mentioned throughout, the geese at the end, and the test failure at the start. In conclusion, this is why the author utilized that paragraph as the conclusion for such a poignant story.
1011	9876	4	1	The author posits in the narrative that Saeng failed a winter examination, and owing to her affection for the hibiscus plant, spring will enable her to undertake the test.
1012	9877	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as she intended the reader to understand that merely because she encountered failure, it does not signify the end of her life. She will recuperate and attempt the same endeavor in the subsequent year.
1013	9878	4	1	The author employs this paragraph to conclude, demonstrating that she is going to attempt the test once more, along with adapting to her new environment. For instance, the story states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had regarded as peculiar before had, through the tranquil recurrence of seasons, become nearly familiar to her now.” This indicates that she is acclimating to her current location and is willing to give it an opportunity. It is as if she no longer perceives it as being as adverse as she initially thought, considering it was different from her home and the place where she was accustomed to being.
1014	9879	4	1	Perhaps the author penned that as the final sentence or paragraph because, within the story, the protagonist engaged in an activity and failed at it, thus prompting her desire to attempt it anew.
1015	9880	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with that closing paragraph as it encapsulates all the themes. It showcases that Saeng possesses the determination to surmount obstacles, and it utilizes the plant as a metaphor, just as throughout the rest of the story, where the Hibiscus symbolizes Saeng or the process of adapting to change. The plant “withers” in the winter, which is analogous to Saeng not obtaining her driver's license. However, the plant will rejuvenate, symbolizing determination or adjustment. This is the reason why Saeng asserts that she will return and pass the test, as she has adapted and is now resolute in overcoming this obstacle.
1016	9881	4	1	After perusing the quote “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test” from the story “Winter's Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I surmise that the author intends to convey that after the winter and fall subside, she will be prepared to confront the challenge of planting anew and regain self - assurance. She raised her head and observed as their distinctive “V” was inscribed against the evening sky, gradually fading from sight. Upon reflection, I believe Saeng perceived that the geese were subtly affirming the rightness of her actions.
1017	9882	4	1	He concludes the story in this manner to illustrate that she desires and is resolute in surmounting the ordeal of leaving her homeland. In the narrative, she visits a greenhouse. She is in the greenhouse to assess her capabilities. She discovers a plant native to her homeland, which evokes memories of her grandmother. She encounters other plants that remind her of her homeland, and she weeps. I opine that she shared a profound bond with her grandmother. When they departed their home country, she likely mourned for days, as if a part of her soul had been lost.
1018	9883	4	1	The author incorporates this paragraph into the story because the girl began to despair of herself and was despondent due to relocating to the United States, failing her driver's test, and the disappointment of purchasing a fake plant. Moreover, the author aims to demonstrate that her self - esteem has improved, that she has become more confident, and that she is no longer inclined to abandon herself.
1019	9884	4	1	The author concludes the story with those words as it presents the reader with a significant metaphor in the narrative. Although incomplete, it is self - evident that the “metaphor” likens Saeng and her test to the perennial essence of the winter hibiscus. They share a common trait: both return. Saeng returns to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus returns, buds, and thrives anew. I can empathize with this, as I recall participating in a triathlon with the goal of securing first place. I placed @NUM1 overall. When the next year arrived, I trained until the triathlon returned, and I placed @NUM2. Thus, like the winter hibiscus, I returned and achieved my objective.
1020	9885	4	1	The author includes that segment in his story as it pertains to nature and the exquisite elements within it. There are the @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, lofty green grass, and the white @CAPS3 fence. In the story, there are similar manifestations of the natural world. This inclusion serves to immerse the reader in the beauty and tranquility of nature, enhancing the overall aesthetic and thematic depth of the story.
1021	9886	4	1	The author perceives the hibiscus plant as a fresh commencement. For instance, when she states, “In the spring, when the snows dissipate and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test.” Evidently, she failed the initial attempt and acquired the plant; subsequently, she will succeed in it.
1022	9887	4	1	The author incorporates these paragraphs into the story as it is spring, a time when the snows thaw and the geese migrate back. It is surmised that the author is referring to winter, a period when snowfall persists until spring arrives, and then the snow begins to melt away as the sun emerges. One reason is that the author is discussing how the weather undergoes transformation as the seasons change.
1023	9888	4	1	She was disconsolate with herself as she purchased the hibiscus rather than the plant seeds. Consequently, she commenced weeping as she recalled how resplendent their former one used to be. When the snow melts and the flowers commence to blossom, that is when she intends to retake the test. The author concluded the paragraph in such a manner to signify a new beginning in the upcoming year.
1024	9889	4	1	I opine that she included this to demonstrate its significance to her. For example, when she mentions that in the spring she will retake the test. I believe this implies that she will exert greater effort to ensure she executes everything correctly. Thus, she can affirm that she follows through on matters of importance to her. These are my insights regarding why she included this paragraph in the story.
1025	9890	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test. Additionally, it requires time for a hibiscus to develop buds. Moreover, it seems like an appropriate ending, and she would not desire to take the test amidst the snow.
1026	9891	4	1	The rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the narrative with this paragraph is to convey to the readers Saeng's sentiments regarding the hibiscus. I surmise that the author does so because he is informing the reader that the hibiscus bestows good fortune upon Saeng, and with this auspicious luck, she will succeed in the test. The story elaborates on Saeng's profound admiration for the plant. For instance, upon approaching the hibiscus, she extended her hand and tenderly touched a petal. It felt sleek and refreshing. This is precisely why the author employs that paragraph at the end to signify Saeng's feelings and how it instills confidence in her.
1027	9892	4	1	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph to engender a sense of intrigue and speculation among readers, leaving them pondering what lies ahead. One can discern this from the tone of the final paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author appears to leave an air of suspense lingering.
1028	9893	4	1	By concluding the story in the manner presented in the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author offers readers an empathetic comprehension of Saeng's struggles in adapting to life in a foreign country and her longing to return home. I believe the author aimed to end the story with a poignant portrayal of Saeng's character to re - engage readers with the narrative. For example, by reiterating the statement “I will take that test again,” the author conveys that Saeng has not surrendered and assures the reader that she will persevere and thrive.
1029	9894	4	1	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that now Saeng has a tangible goal to strive for. The author might also have chosen this conclusion because Saeng must endure a significant waiting period before she can attempt it again. Additionally, Saeng anticipates witnessing the plant's growth, as it becomes larger and more robust. These are the reasons I believe the author included this conclusion in the paragraph.
1030	9895	4	1	The author concludes the story at this juncture to demonstrate that Saeng is resolute and will not succumb to defeat. She merely determines a specific time to make another attempt. Saeng aspires to establish herself in the world and lead a fulfilling life; hence, she courageously ventures into novel experiences.
1031	9896	4	1	The narrative “Winter Hibiscus” is a heart - warming tale about a foreign maiden endeavoring to acclimate to @LOCATION1. She has an affinity for tropical blossoms. The rationale behind the author's decision to pen the last paragraph in such a manner is that it aptly concludes the story. In that denouement, as the man departs and the flowers commence to grow, she will endeavor to integrate during the spring.
1032	9897	4	1	I surmise that the author employed this paragraph for the conclusion because its significance authentically portrays Saeng, who truly adores gardens and perceives them as something extraordinary. Moreover, when all the snow thaws, she will undertake the examination and hopefully obtain her driver's license.
1033	9898	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph due to its representation of new beginnings. By this, I imply that the hibiscus symbolizes fresh starts. She asserts, “When the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This will mark a new commencement for her. The blossoming of the plant elates her and evokes memories of her grandmother. She is indicating that by the time spring arrives, she will be prepared to confront a new challenge, just as the hibiscus plant is set for a new phase.
1034	9899	4	1	I am of the view that the author elects to conclude the story with this paragraph as it symbolizes finality. The plant personifies her homeland. However, upon seeing the geese flying south, she realizes that everyone must leave their home at some juncture. She has now reconciled with the current situation and will soon make another attempt for her driver's license. When the hibiscus buds anew, it will hold symbolic value for her, and that is when she will be ready to try once more.
1035	9900	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph as it showcases her protagonist's determination for another opportunity. She has recognized her errors and is prepared to embark afresh. Even though she failed in her attempt to cultivate the hibiscus in winter, she intends to start anew when @DATE1 arrives. For instance, in the story, it is stated that the “winter hibiscus” was now in the ground, and as Saeng tamped down the soil around it, a flock of Canada geese flew overhead, their faint honks clear and familiar to Saeng in the snow. This is the reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
1036	9901	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she believes it will bestow good fortune upon her in the examination. When she returns to undertake the test, she will possess the solace of her native land, symbolized by the hibiscus plant, to inspire her to succeed in the driving assessment. When she retakes the test, she will surely pass owing to the comfort of home, and she will have acclimated to the area's divergence from her homeland. To perform well in the test, she requires something to augment her self - confidence slightly. Having elements that evoke memories of home and the dwelling she currently inhabits can significantly bolster her self - assurance.
1037	9902	4	1	She declared that she would retake the examination to demonstrate to her mother that she is capable of passing it this time. Instead of fretting about her former residence, she is focusing on this new attempt.
1038	9903	4	1	I opine that this exemplifies hope as she had deeply yearned for her homeland and somewhat discovered tranquility and calmness by being in the presence of these elements. She states, “That at least she could hold on to,” referring to the bud. I surmise that she was extremely distressed due to homesickness; she missed the experience of her grandmother washing her hair and inserting a dok mallk into it. Since she had little else apart from the flowers that recalled her homeland, the text mentions, “Where was the fine - toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, her gentle grandmother?” She was longing for all these aspects. Thus, placing her in this situation has led her to a state where she not only misses the individuals from her homeland but also the beautiful things. Moreover, she always retains a part of home with her because of the flower.
1039	9904	4	1	In the final paragraph, the author employs the statement “when they come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test.” The author does so because Saeng finally found comfort. After relocating from her native Vietnam to the United States, she suffered from homesickness. For instance, she encountered a flower that reminded her of the time she spent in her homeland. The plant triggered memories of her grandmother's scent. When she finally reached home to her mother, she presented the flower to her. They both planted the flower, and Saeng felt a sense of relief. This is why she vowed that when winter ended and spring arrived, she would take the test, as she had a feeling of home within her, which provided her with encouragement and strength. It also illustrates that even when one is in a foreign area and experiencing change, there is always something that can make one recall the unalterable time spent in one's place of origin.
1040	9905	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner as it showcases her resolve to pass the test. It is akin to the idea that if birds can migrate south, she can overcome the challenge of passing that test. This comparison emphasizes her determination and the belief that she has the ability to achieve her goal.
1041	9906	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author does so for multiple reasons. The author intends to demonstrate that Saeng still harbors hope and believes she can rectify the situation. Additionally, it shows that Saeng will continue to attempt to adapt to her surroundings and forge friendships. Moreover, Saeng is resolute that she will pass the test the next time she takes it. Finally, it emphasizes the conflict and how Saeng overcame it.
1042	9907	4	1	I opine that the author concluded this story with this paragraph as life persists. The statement “When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” substantiates that she is progressing with life, and so will all the creatures in the world. Furthermore, even though she relocated to a new country, it does not imply that she cannot still relish the things from her homeland. “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.” This is precisely why the author included that last paragraph to illustrate that life endures.
1043	9908	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is not genuinely concerned about when they retake the test; she is solely preoccupied with the plants she selected. Moreover, she is aware that it will be a considerable period before she takes the test again, which affords her more time to study, become better prepared, and maintain focus. The author also concludes this article with this paragraph as she desires to inform the readers that since she failed the first time, she will return to retake it, and nothing will impede her from succeeding.
1044	9909	4	1	It illustrates the importance of not surrendering. The narrative concludes in a manner nearly identical to its commencement. It indicates that individuals should not become overly attached to the past. These are the reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It shows that people should not give up because despite failing her test, she will endeavor to pass it later. Additionally, the story ends similarly to how it began, with her taking the test or preparing to do so, which is an effective writing technique. Lastly, it demonstrates that people should not become overly fixated on the past because if they encounter something that reminds them of it, they may break down. This is why she takes the test, to ascertain whether she can view the familiar flowers without succumbing to emotion.
1045	9910	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to conclude on a felicitous yet inspiring note. In the story, Saeng reveals that she failed the test and was extremely disheartened with herself. The test must have been of great significance to her for her to be so disappointed. The author likely also ended with this paragraph to showcase that Saeng is dedicated to passing this test. Saeng appears to be a sentimental yet dependable individual. I surmise that the test involves spending a minimal amount of money, and she wishes to earn her mother's respect. This is why taking and passing the test seems so crucial to Saeng. This is why the author ended with that paragraph.
1046	9911	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the tale with the passage “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The rationale behind the author's use of these lines is that she is re - establishing the symbolism of the plant. In the text, it is stated that the plant buds in the spring after having sufficient time to grow and acclimate to the new environment. Just as the plant required that period, so did the protagonist Saeng. She had recently relocated from Vietnam and failed her driver's test. Saeng is highly uncertain about her new cultural surroundings. For instance, it is mentioned that she likes bitter melon, as it states, “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac.” She seems to believe that she is misunderstood and that no one likes her, yet just as the plant will adapt to its new existence, so will she.
1047	9912	4	1	The author concludes the story by declaring that she will retake the test in the spring and vow silently until then because the spring evokes memories of home for Saeng. In Vietnam, there were numerous beautiful wildflowers. Saeng visits the flower shop to obtain a piece of her homeland. The text describes the flower's “leaves quivering in the wind,” which indicates that the plant is not in its natural state as there are no buds. Prior to this, she had failed her driving test and was in need of hope. Thus, waiting until spring when the hibiscus will bloom again will provide Saeng with a sense of home, which will in turn offer her the hope to perform well on the driving test.
1048	9913	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng's entire world revolves around the plants. Since they are no longer present, there is a lack of motivation.
1049	9914	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the narrative with the statement, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author's reasoning for this conclusion is that the recollection of memories from Saeng's homeland provides her with comfort. This comfort is so profound that she will be able to pass her test effortlessly as she will not be nervous. Saeng remarked, “it was like walking into another world,” when she entered the florist shop after failing her driver's test. It was as if she completely forgot about her failure and was solely focused on the plants and flowers. The flowers transport her to a state of happiness and tranquility, making her feel at home, as if everything will turn out fine. This is the reason why the author concludes with such a sentence, as readers should recognize that memories of her farmland will assist her in passing her driver's test.
1050	9915	4	1	The author may have concluded the story in such a manner due to the title and the beginning of the story. Alternatively, he may have concluded it thus because he desires to. He may have concluded the story like that to illustrate what transpired. Nevertheless, a good conclusion remains a good conclusion.
1051	9916	4	1	I truly have no idea as to why the author concludes the story with this particular paragraph. It is plausible that it is because she commenced to converse...
1052	9917	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve. Saeng has endured numerous hardships and yearns for the familiarity of home. She experiences a sense of otherness and displacement, yet she remains steadfast. Life progresses, and this paragraph demonstrates that Saeng will adapt accordingly. The paragraph states, “In the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test.” Spring will arrive, as nothing can impede the passage of time. The snow will melt due to the changing weather. The geese will migrate home, and the hibiscus will blossom in spring. Saeng adopts an optimistic outlook and decides to embrace the changes. Although she faced failure once, she is robust and eager to attempt again. If at first one does not succeed, one should persevere. Saeng will always cherish her memories of home, yet she is willing to acclimate to her new surroundings. The concluding paragraph showcases Saeng's determination to thrive and endure in the new world.
1053	9918	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because she intends to convey to us that Saeng is self - assured and will not falter in retaking the test. She proceeded to the corner of the vegetable plot and began to excavate a hole in the ground.
1054	9919	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to impart a sense of hope and development. The flower symbolizes Saeng's homeland and provides her with solace. It links her to her emotions and reminds her of her true self. The growth and blossoming of the hibiscus mirror Saeng's own progress. When it flowers, she will possess a genuine piece of home with her and will be capable of retaking the test. The story revolves around surmounting obstacles and adapting to change. The vivid, almost poetic description of the blooming hibiscus renders the reward and outcome of one's struggles appear far more exquisite.
1055	9920	4	1	The author concludes this story with an infusion of hope in this sentence. The beginning was highly pessimistic, with Saeng failing her driver's test and her mother scolding her. However, when this sentence appears, the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to demonstrate that Saeng will adapt and persevere, despite being extremely distraught earlier, as evidenced when she uttered, “I - I failed the test.” Then, for Saeng to recover from this setback instills hope in the reader, which is precisely why the author crafted the story in this way.
1056	9921	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it pertains to the advent of a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the examination, and just as the plant withers in winter yet buds anew in spring, she will retake the test. It represents a novel opportunity to commence afresh.
1057	9922	4	1	Saeng privately vowed to herself that in spring, as she was not overly fond of engaging in conversation and occasionally preferred solitude. However, when spring arrived, it was a different scenario. Saeng adored spring and @DATE2, spending the entire day outdoors daily. Saeng was truly an amiable young girl.
1058	9923	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it demonstrates that the character will attempt again what she previously failed. In the narrative, the character has a passion for gardening, so when her beloved plant resurfaces, she will endeavor to pass her test once more.
1059	9924	4	1	The author concludes the story with that passage because as winter approaches, everything fades away. For instance, trees shed their leaves, geese migrate south, and flowers wither. Thus, this passage implies that in spring, when everything rejuvenates, she will recommence the test. It is akin to embarking on a new life.
1060	9925	4	1	"In the story titled ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the paragraph, ""When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snows thaw, the geese come back, and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will take that test again."" The author included this at the story's end because when things seem to decline, everyone yearns to wait until they resurge. When one fails, everything appears to fall, but with patience, everything will rise again, much like flowers and other things one can envision. Hence, the author placed this at the end to convey that it is acceptable to fail, as long as one perseveres until achieving their goal. This is what the author intended, and that is why Minfong Ho included it so that readers could glean wisdom from its message."
1061	9926	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the final paragraph to establish the ultimate mood. The author aimed to demonstrate that Saeng will not capitulate and will persist in adapting to her novel surroundings. This rendered the conclusion of the story feel comforting and also served as an inspiration. The story's end encourages the reader not to abandon hope as well. The last paragraph provides an exemplar of how the reader can resolve to improve. The author was aware that the last paragraph would stand as an inspiration and perhaps assist a reader experiencing something analogous to the story.
1062	9927	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as, to her, the plant appears to evoke memories of her homeland, which soothes her, and when it is in bud, she feels more resilient. In the story, Saeng is somewhat of an outsider, and when she beholds the plant, she glimpses a part of her past in her native land. The story mentions that she becomes tremulous when she attempts to utter “at home.” When she says, “and this hibiscus is budding,” it can be inferred that it truly signifies her readiness to embrace this country as her home since the flower serves as a reminder of her homeland. At the story's conclusion, it describes how she is growing accustomed to the geese flying in a “V,” indicating that she is becoming more acclimated to this country, and when she is prepared, she will retake her test.
1063	9928	4	1	The author incorporates the paragraph, “when they come back...then I will take that test again,” to illustrate that the hibiscus serves as a symbol of time. Saeng utilizes the hibiscus to gauge the duration until she retakes her test. The hibiscus also symbolizes the fortitude to endure hardships (remain steadfast). Saeng encountered difficulties with her test, yet the hibiscus is there to bolster her and prepare her for the subsequent test. The hibiscus also aids Saeng's mother in persevering through the arduous period of witnessing her daughter's distress from failing the test. The plant helps the mother strive to maintain a positive outlook and also assists her in making the appropriate decisions for her daughter. In the story, the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to delight her daughter. The hibiscus exhibits profound symbolism and aids Saeng and her mother in remaining resolute throughout their trials.
1064	9929	4	1	This concluding paragraph aligns with one of the central tenets of the story: to persevere and not yield in order to comprehend and find contentment in this world. Saeng is undertaking this “test” to ascertain whether she is prepared to transform and adapt to her new milieu. She fell short this time. However, when circumstances are propitious and the hibiscus is in bloom, she will endeavor again to determine if she is ready to relinquish the past and embrace the new with happiness.
1065	9930	4	1	She uttered those words because she had not fulfilled what was expected of her, so she declared that she had failed. Her mother was momentarily irate but then composed herself. She said, “I love it” and inquired if she desired something to eat. Subsequently, they went indoors. However, she regarded the task as a test and thus asserted that next time, she would execute it correctly.
1066	9931	4	1	I am convinced that the author concluded the story with the “test” because it constitutes a significant aspect of Saeng’s life or is an integral part of her tradition.
1067	9932	4	1	There exist numerous reasons as to why the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph. Firstly, such an ending evokes a profound emotional response, preventing readers from perceiving the story as uninteresting. Additionally, it showcases strength, not of the physical kind but rather mental fortitude. Saeng asserts that despite failing the test on her initial attempt, she will persevere and retake it. Another rationale for the author's choice to conclude the story with this paragraph is to inspire readers to never abandon their pursuits. It depicts how she faced failure and her mother's disappointment, yet she remains resolute in her decision to retake the driver's test. Overall, the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it projects a powerful image of perseverance and the importance of never giving up.
1068	9933	4	1	The author likely concludes the story with this sentence as it demonstrates the unwavering dedication of both the author and her child to gardening. It is reasonable to surmise that the young child's favored plant is the hibiscus. I opine that the most cherished activity shared between the mother and her child is gardening. This serves as an appealing way to conclude a story, as it instills a sense of curiosity in the readers, leaving them intrigued as to the author's motives. In my estimation, it adds an element of enigma to the narrative.
1069	9934	4	1	"The concluding lines of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" are intended to offer a glimpse into the imminent future and illustrate a transformation in Saeng's disposition. Prior to this juncture, Saeng had been mourning her homeland and struggling to acclimate to her new environment. The hibiscus serves as a source of inspiration, revealing to her that the new country shares many similarities with her old one. In the final line, she reconciles with her current circumstances. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" symbolizes her willingness to allow time to pass and, by retaking her driver's test, embark on a new chapter in her life."
1070	9935	4	1	The author concluded the story by stating that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to convey a message. While walking home from her test, Saeng encountered a familiar flower and decided to visit a flower shop. There, she was confronted with an array of flowers that rekindled memories of her homeland. She purchased a hibiscus and returned home. After realizing that the flower could withstand the winter, she and her mother planted it. Looking up, she witnessed numerous birds soaring overhead and recognized that she had successfully adapted to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has endowed her with the will to endure, and she is confident in her ability to adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The message the author sought to convey was that the hibiscus bestowed upon her the courage and hope to retake her driver's test and continue thriving in @LOCATION1.
1071	9936	4	1	The rationale behind my belief that the author concludes the narrative with this final paragraph is that this represents @CAPS1's passion. Moreover, Saeng is deeply committed and will undertake this annual ritual. She genuinely adores plants and eagerly anticipates repeating the activity. The concluding paragraph vividly showcases a high degree of dedication. Additionally, she truly cherishes the spring season and the Hibiscus.
1072	9937	4	1	The author concludes the story with this line to illustrate that, much like the hibiscus adapting and persevering to survive and assimilate in a non - native land, Saeng will also endure. She will not abandon her struggle to pass the test and integrate into her new country. This is substantiated throughout the story when her mother comments on the hibiscus by the lake. She states, “It’s robust enough to endure the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters” (Ho @NUM1). Here, the author draws a parallel between the hibiscus' arduous journey through difficult times in a foreign land and the challenges Saeng faces in her life. Both must exhibit strength and fight through hardships when no one, “not even her classmates, friends, or Mrs. Lambert” (Ho @NUM1), comprehends the sense of isolation and displacement she experiences. Thus, just as she vows to retake the test, she pledges to herself that she will overcome the tough times and grow stronger, much like her winter hibiscus.
1073	9938	4	1	Primarily, the reason she made that statement was to convey that time brings about causation. Essentially, she was suggesting that as circumstances change over time, she believes her performance will also transform. This is evident from the indication that she is gradually coming to terms with missing her homeland in Vietnam, and as time progresses, memories evolve. This is a fundamental principle of logic: time ushers in change. Although I believe I have accurately interpreted the overall meaning of this concept, ultimately, I am convinced that Saeng made this statement because time is the harbinger of change.
1074	9939	4	1	The significance of the author's choice to conclude the story in this manner is to emphasize for readers the importance of the plant. It appears that since the author is away from her native country, there are few elements in this new environment that can offer her solace. The author's discovery of a hibiscus in a place where she least expected it endows her with the fortitude to tackle any challenge. It is plausible that regardless of the difficulty @MONTH1 may present, the fact that she has the support of the plant instills in her the sense of accomplishment and self - confidence necessary to complete her task.
1075	9940	4	1	The author concludes the story in this way because there are remarkable similarities between the hibiscus and Saeng. Additionally, the narrator likens her to the returning geese. The return of the geese symbolizes her restarting at driver's school and making another attempt. The hibiscus represents her resilience during the winter, and come spring, she regains her strength and takes the test once more. This is the reason the narrator opted to end the story in this manner.
1076	9941	4	1	The rationale behind the author concluding the story in such a manner is to pave the way for a spin - off. In my perspective, this implies that when spring arrives, she will make another attempt so that both she and her plant can embark on a fresh start, and I deem this an excellent way to conclude the narrative.
1077	9942	4	1	The author concludes the story with the statement, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” for multiple reasons. One reason the author ends the story with this passage is that the hibiscus flower will acclimate to spring, just as Saeng should adapt to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is that, similar to the hibiscus budding, Saeng has matured and gained greater wisdom, enabling her to retake the driving test in spring with the hope of passing. Lastly, the text states, “she realized that many of the things that she had regarded as strange before had, through the consistent recurrence of season upon season, become nearly familiar to her now.” This indicates that Saeng is becoming accustomed and comfortable in her living place, much like the hibiscus flower easily adapts to its location and gets used to the seasons.
1078	9943	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng asserts that when she returns, she will retake the test. This implies that her time there was a test of survival. At the story's onset, it marked the beginning of the test, and at the end, the test concludes as they leave. She desires to return to witness the growth. The author also conveys that one may not recognize the quality of one's circumstances.
1079	9944	4	1	Since the “Winter hibiscus” was planted in the ground, Saeng compacted the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks now distinct and, indeed, perceptible to Saeng.
1080	9945	4	1	The author incorporates this paragraph into the story as it demonstrates that forming an impression of work ethic and adapting to a new environment can be arduous. The statement “not even @PERSON1, looked it” makes a negative aspect evident to a new student. This can instill poor work ethic in them and also pose mental challenges. Consequently, the girl is neither comfortable nor enthusiastic about working on something that no one would appreciate.
1081	9946	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this passage as she is resolute in passing the driving test that she had previously failed. For instance, she writes, “she vowed silently to herself.” When one vows to undertake something, it typically implies that they are highly determined to do so. Every subsequent statement she makes is genuinely meant. Thus, this is the reason the author concludes with this sentence, to demonstrate her dedication to her objective.
1082	9947	4	1	The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the narrative with that paragraph to illustrate that Saeng is finally on the verge of acclimating to her new abode. She will not squander excessive time yearning for her past. “And in the warm, moist sanctuary of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” I opine that this is precisely what she required to progress in her life.
1083	9948	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to inform us of when she will retake it. It is when the seasons transition that she will attempt it once more. Saeng is likely embarrassed, which is why she desires to wait for an extended period. Saeng embarked on a lengthy stroll home and halted at the flower shop. She endeavored to divert her mind from failing the test. Saeng purchased a lovely flower or plant for @MONEY1. Initially, her mother was perturbed, but then she realized that her daughter was unhappy and altered her demeanor.
1084	9949	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this passage because he is suggesting that she will persist in her efforts and will not capitulate but will continue to strive. I posit this because she has recently relocated to America from Vietnam and is encountering difficulties adapting to life in America. I believe that the geese symbolize something that is constantly altering its surroundings, and when they arrive, she will endeavor once more to obtain her license.
1085	9950	4	1	The rationale behind the author concluding the story with this paragraph is that now she has a goal to pursue. The author might have also chosen to conclude the story with this paragraph because she must await a considerable duration before she can retake it. Additionally, Saeng might wish to wait to witness the plant grow, thrive, and become more robust. These are the reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph.
1086	9951	4	1	Saeng would silently vow that in spring, when the snow melts and nature rejuvenates, she will retake the test. The story reaches a felicitous conclusion as it aligns with the cycle of the hibiscus. The plant endures the harsh winter and blossoms anew in spring, symbolizing resilience. Saeng draws inspiration from this, believing that if the hibiscus can thrive after adversity, so can she. As spring approaches, with the hibiscus budding, it evokes a sense of hope and reminds her of her homeland. Even if she fails the test, the sight of the blooming hibiscus brings her comfort. Both the plant and Saeng face challenges; the plant must survive the winter, and Saeng must pass her driver's test. The author concludes the story this way because the hibiscus represents Saeng's strength and the promise of a new beginning. It signifies that life persists despite obstacles, and with determination, one can overcome difficulties.
1087	9952	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner due to the profound symbolism the hibiscus holds for Saeng. For her, it serves as an emblem of fortitude and solace. She is cognizant that if the hibiscus can withstand the frigid snow and inclement winter weather, she too will not falter. To Saeng, the hibiscus is a mirror of herself; if it endures, she is certain that she can persevere as well. Moreover, she intends to retake the test when the hibiscus is in bud, as it evokes memories of her homeland and soothes her soul. Even in the event of failure, she will remain content because her cherished plant is budding. It is also evident that the author ends the story thus because both the plant and Saeng must surmount challenges. The plant must weather the winter and reemerge in spring, while Saeng must succeed in her driver's test. Ultimately, the author's choice of ending is rooted in what the plant represents to Saeng. If the hibiscus survives, she knows that she will too, and life continues its course.
1088	9953	4	1	I opine that the author concluded the story with the statement “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” as it encapsulates the overarching theme of the narrative. The theme of this story revolves around adapting to life's vicissitudes. The conclusion manifests this when Saeng declares her intention to retake the test. The hibiscus enables her to transcend the changes in her life. For instance, “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair.” The hibiscus, a relic of her homeland, evokes pleasant memories. It spurs her to embrace her new life and persist in her efforts to improve it. In essence, the hibiscus serves as a catalyst for Saeng's growth and resilience, and the author's conclusion effectively conveys this message.
1089	9954	4	1	The author most plausibly concludes the story in such a fashion because it is during this period that Saeng experiences the greatest sense of comfort. Saeng and her mother emigrated from Vietnam, where the winter hibiscus is prevalent and familiar to Saeng. The author concludes the text in this manner as it evokes nostalgic memories of Vietnam for Saeng and enhances her well - being during this time of the year. When Saeng remarks, “And beside it was yet another old friend,” she perceives the plant as a companion, which alleviates her discomfort. This emotional connection between Saeng and the hibiscus is the underlying reason why the author chose to end the story in this particular way. It emphasizes the significance of familiarity and comfort in Saeng's new life and how the hibiscus serves as a link to her past.
1090	9955	4	1	The author concludes the story with this statement because it portends a fresh start, coinciding with the arrival of spring, a season of beauty and renewal. The phrase “Plant it right now” implies that she desires another opportunity. She yearns for a clean slate, and as spring arrives, when all the exquisite flowers are in bloom, seizing their moment, she wishes to seize her own chance to achieve the best outcome. The author's choice of ending reflects the hope and optimism associated with a new beginning, suggesting that Saeng is ready to face her challenges with renewed vigor and determination. Just as the flowers bloom in spring, Saeng aims to blossom and succeed in her endeavors.
1091	9956	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph due to her remorse for her actions. The scenario she was recounting involved how she was expected to utilize the twenty dollars they possessed and make a purchase. Significantly, she expended the majority of the money to buy a plant that reminded her of home. This concluding paragraph indicates that when she has the opportunity to undertake the “test” once more, she will fulfill what is expected of her.
1092	9957	4	1	After perusing “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I am of the opinion that Ho concluded the story with that paragraph to reinforce her concept of surmounting obstacles. Initially, subsequent to failing her driving test, Saeng was profoundly disheartened and uncertain if she would ever succeed. However, upon sighting a hibiscus plant, it evoked memories of her homeland in Vietnam, which served as an inspiration. Secondly, when she acquired the plant, her mother was somewhat irate as it was costly. Nevertheless, after witnessing how the plant brought delight to Saeng, her mother absolved her. Finally, when Saeng was excavating a hole to facilitate the growth of the hibiscus, it spurred her to retake the test as she had overcome the challenges of bringing the plant home and enabling it to thrive. Consequently, I believe Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” to align with her notion of overcoming obstacles.
1093	9958	4	1	The concluding paragraph of the story exemplifies the theme of tenacity. The hibiscus served as a reminder that her “home” was her former life, yet she yearned for something in her new existence. Through this reminder, she acquired determination. She soon came to the realization that she was home, as certain aspects had become familiar to her, such as the V - formation of the geese. She cherished her former home, but she recognized that it was time to progress. The concluding paragraph does not merely signify retaking a driving test; it symbolizes the resolve to embrace her new home and life.
1094	9959	4	1	I shall retake that test. She derives confidence from the hibiscus and the snow. When the snow dissipates and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will venture forth anew, akin to the growth of the hibiscus. In essence, she is poised to amass sufficient confidence for the test.
1095	9960	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to apprise readers of the events that transpired within the narrative. Additionally, it is to convey the potential implications or messages related to the story. The sentence implies that when spring arrives and the snow melts, the plants will emerge and begin to bud. By the subsequent class or the next school year, he will muster the courage to retake the test. This is the meaning of the sentence within the story and how it can be analogously related to various elements in distinct manners.
1096	9961	4	1	The concluding paragraph in “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho states, “When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow thaws and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus is in bloom, then I will attempt that test once more.” This passage draws a parallel between her and the flowers, suggesting that just as the flower is tenacious, she is resilient. She is resolute in retaking the test the following year and achieving success. Moreover, she will take the test as it offers her solace and evokes memories of her homeland.
1097	9962	4	1	He concluded the paragraph in such a manner because he @MONTH1 intends for you to continue reading, or perhaps he is highlighting the comparison between the flower and Saeng. “When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese come back and this hibiscus is sprouting, then I will retake that test,” the quote demonstrates that the flower can endure the winter and make a comeback. Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to attempt it again, which indicates that both possess the motivation and the integrity to persevere.
1098	9963	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph: “When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I surmise that the author ended the story in this way as it illustrates that the hibiscus symbolized a fresh start for Saeng and an opportunity to restart what she had failed. When Saeng beheld the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it provided her with comfort during a time of disappointment, a connection to her past experiences, and the confidence that she could surmount her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it implies a new beginning, suggesting that the hibiscus represents Saeng. This is why I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
1099	9964	4	1	The final line is incorporated into the story “Winter Hibiscus” as it reveals the connection between Saeng and the flower. Despite failing the driving test on her initial attempt, Saeng decides to retake it in the spring. Similar to Saeng, the hibiscus flower is out of place and must endure the winter to bloom again in the spring. This exemplifies how, like the flower, Saeng will rejuvenate in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that both Saeng and the flower are unaccustomed to the conditions in @LOCATION1. Thus, they must both weather the winter months to which they are not accustomed. This further demonstrates how the last line links the girl and the flower. In conclusion, the last line is employed in the text to conclude the story by establishing a connection between the flower and Saeng.
1100	9965	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to acclimate to the new country and its surroundings. In the story, the author exhibits signs of homesickness. The author encounters a plant native to where she hails from and purchases it for over @NUM1; her mother is astounded. She is reluctant to disclose to her mother precisely why she bought it as she is too tremulous to utter the word “home” or risk breaking down in tears again. The final sentence indicates that the author is endeavoring to adapt.
1101	9966	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she/he intends to conclude the story with a summary that encapsulates its essence. The author referred to the hibiscus in the story as “a comfort in time of distress,” a pastime or activity she enjoys engaging in during her leisure. In summary, the author concludes with that paragraph for the reasons outlined in the @ORGANIZATION1.
1102	9967	4	1	The author concludes the story with the provided paragraph to convey a message. It emphasizes the significant and familiar elements to Saeng that offered her solace and utilizes them to essentially convey that she will retake the test once she recovers. The winter hibiscus was a plant that Saeng associated with her life back home throughout the story. Thus, when she saw the plant, “a wave of loss so profound and intense that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her.” Saeng was unable to soothe her emotions upon first sight of the plant as she realized how much she missed her former life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blossoms in spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void and assist Saeng in attempting the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason but in a different manner. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took some time for the geese to become, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Saeng mentions this to acclimate to the strange and unfamiliar aspects of her life and to come to terms with her failed test. Therefore, by mentioning the things she does in the last paragraph, Saeng employs familiar objects, both foreign and domestic, to illustrate her acceptance of her failure.
1103	9968	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it conveys the underlying meaning of the narrative. Life persists regardless of circumstances; the hibiscus will reappear in spring. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of Saeng's life. Typically, this plant does not survive the winter months, yet this particular one did. The mother remarks, “Its flowers aren't as beautiful, but it's robust enough to endure the winter months here...” Saeng and her mother are akin to the plant. They are resilient, and their lives will continue despite being in a new environment. The author chose to end the story with that paragraph because although she mentions the hibiscus will return each spring, the deeper significance is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will persevere in living their lives.
1104	9969	4	1	The author opts to conclude the story in a profound and interconnected manner. It concludes on a note of rebirth and second - chances. When Saeng vows, “When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, when the Hibiscus is in bloom, I will take the test again,” the author is establishing a connection between a new country, second - chances, and rebirth. Spring and the melting snow can be linked to rebirth, while the return of the geese can symbolize a second chance. This is associated with Saeng's second chance. The author also demonstrates that Saeng is adapting to the new country, which evokes a sense of hope. It indicates that there is some optimism for her test.
1105	9970	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph as he aims for us to grasp the moral of the tale. I posit this notion because in the story, he describes orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounding her. It elaborates on how these flowers surrounded her to test her of her @CAPS1.
1106	9971	4	1	I surmise that the author reaches this conclusion in the narrative as it constitutes crucial information for the story. This is because it pertains to her mother. She has a penchant for tending to the garden, aspiring to become a gardener and secure a legitimate occupation, much like her mother.
1107	9972	4	1	"Saeng believes she has fallen short due to her longing for her grandmother. The hibiscus plant she purchases evokes the fragrance of her grandmother. Saeng expended over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant, which she required to experience a greater sense of home. Saeng feels she had scant time to depart from her country, ""in a blink."" Her grandmother would desire her to be resilient and refrain from weeping at the thought of being apart from her. Saeng must focus on the positive and smile when reminded of her past. Saeng aims to pass the test. The next time the hibiscus are in bud, she must not shed tears."
1108	9973	4	1	I opine that the author's intention in doing so was to convey to the reader the time at which the event occurred and the prevailing weather conditions. Additionally, it indicates the duration of her wait, such as until the snow melts, which will take a while, and when the geese depart and return home. This is the rationale behind my belief that she provides these details.
1109	9974	4	1	I believe this passage pertains to winter. The hibiscus and hedges stand tall and verdant, enveloping the garden. Their luxuriant green leaves are adorned with vermilion blossoms. She recounted that upon reaching the hibiscus, she extended her hand and tenderly touched a petal.
1110	9975	4	1	"The rationale behind the author concluding the story in such a manner was to leave the reader with a lingering thought. Moreover, it symbolizes rejuvenation. When Saeng states, ""… this hibiscus is budding …"" (Ho @NUM1), she is also suggesting that they will commence anew when spring arrives. This leaves the reader with a final impression of Saeng and how she has surmounted the challenges of living in a new place. Lastly, it encapsulates @CAPS1's emotions and experiences throughout her relocation, as evidenced by the statement, ""… I will take the test again"" (Ho @NUM1), which implies that she will persevere in making her new home a success. In conclusion, the purpose of this quote serving as the final paragraph is to demonstrate that Saeng will continue to strive to overcome the obstacles she faces."
1111	9976	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as she desires to instill hope for the future. Observing the hibiscus budding in spring is what Saeng anticipates. It offers her the assurance that she will be capable of retaking that test successfully. This is evident when she utters, “... and if this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” During the winter, Saeng harbors the hope that she will make improvements, and when the hibiscus buds, she will recognize that it is time to attempt once more. Saeng perceives spring as a fresh start. Thus, it signifies a period to surmount her obstacle. I surmise that this obstacle or test might be refraining from weeping when she reminisces about her former life in Vietnam. When she achieves this, she is maturing, much like the hibiscus.
1112	9977	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph for a primary reason.
1113	9978	4	1	The author demonstrates that Saeng aspires to continue her mother's gardening endeavors. She aims to inherit the elder's traditions and carry forward what her mother initiated.
1114	9979	4	1	I opine that the author concluded the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the tenacity of the protagonist. I hold this view because at the commencement of the story, as she is walking home, she reveals that she failed the driver's test. In the final paragraph, she declares that after winter concludes, she will retake the test when her hibiscus blossoms. Her tenacity enables her to persevere through life, akin to a plant striving to endure the winter.
1115	9980	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because she intends to perform better the next time. What it implies is that she can make annual attempts to achieve perfection and impress her mother. In summary, this encapsulates my thoughts regarding the paragraph.
1116	9981	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” the author, @CAPS1, most likely concludes the story with this quotation to illustrate that Saeng perceives the hibiscus as more than mere flora; to her, it is also a recollection. For Saeng, the winter hibiscus is akin to storybooks, awaiting perusal. Simply by inhaling the flower's fragrance, it unlocks splendid memories of cherished moments spent with her “gentle grandmother” in her native abode. @CAPS1 endeavors to utilize the flower to demonstrate to the reader how a simple object can evoke a memory, a thought, and so forth. The final sentence clearly posits, with evidence from the story, that Saeng deeply cherishes her past. Thus, to assimilate into contemporary life, she must not forget her former self. By maintaining the hibiscus in her garden, she can possess a beautiful reminder of her origins. Therefore, one is inclined to believe that this rationale is the supposition regarding why @CAPS1 ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the selected paragraph.
1117	9982	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph for multiple reasons. For instance, it conveys a sense of optimism when the protagonist states, “this hibiscus is budding.” This implies a new commencement or a fresh start. It is evident that the author intends to convey this concept. Undoubtedly, it was arduous for the author to acclimate to her new nation. For example, she was disheartened that the hibiscus differed from the one in her homeland. Even though she experiences nostalgia, this paragraph reassures the reader that the author is willing to afford her new country another chance, thereby demonstrating her resilience and adaptability.
1118	9983	4	1	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a variety of reasons. The final paragraph declares, “when they come back... I will take the test again” (Ho @NUM1). Already distraught over failing her driving test, the protagonist is also aggrieved about missing her homeland. The flower buds instill hope in her and, in essence, endow her with the fortitude to retake the test. Moreover, when she was initially in the flower shop, after inhaling the fragrance and beholding the flowers, “A wave of loss so profound and intense that it pricked Saeng's eyes now swept over her... And in the warm, humid sanctuary of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept” (Ho @NUM2). Evidently, these flowers hold great significance for the protagonist; they transport her back to her native country, from which she was suddenly uprooted and which she yearns for. They offer hope and remind her of the things she adores, such as her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it represents what matters most to the protagonist.
1119	9984	4	1	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to demonstrate her profound affection for those flowers. They hold immense significance for her. When she failed her driving test, she was despondent. However, the flowers alleviated her distress. Now that the snow is falling, she awaits spring, when the flowers will bloom. At that time, she will regain her confidence and retake the test, as the flowers symbolize hope and resilience in the face of adversity.
1120	9985	4	1	The author concluded this passage to convey to the audience that Saeng would revisit the hibiscus and continue to tend to it, signifying that she has not relegated it to the recesses of her memory. By ending the story in this manner, the author emphasizes the enduring connection between Saeng and the hibiscus, highlighting the flower's symbolic importance in her life and the indelible mark it has left on her psyche.
1121	9986	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" penned by Minfong Ho, a adolescent named Saeng relocates from Vietnam to the United States. Subsequently, she undertakes a driver's examination, yet fails to achieve a passing score. Nevertheless, she finds solace in the recollections of her native land. The concluding paragraph reads, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows dissipate and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the tale with this paragraph for multiple reasons. Namely, Saeng was deeply distressed about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland as well as the adaptations she had to make during this relocation. The hibiscus plant instills in Saeng the hope to persevere in her journey even when circumstances become arduous. Winter represents a period of tribulation and sorrow for this plant, just as failing the test and being away from her true home are Saeng's times of distress. The conclusion of winter offers both the plant and Saeng an opportunity for a fresh start and a renewed sense of hope. Saeng will find it feasible to surmount hardships if she continues to draw comfort from her past."
1122	9987	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to pique the readers' curiosity. It serves to demonstrate that she will not abandon her aspirations.
1123	9988	4	1	The author Minfong Ho concludes the story by discussing the test that Saeng failed and her vow to retake it. In the story, the test symbolizes a gradual transition, a tentative step towards her new life and away from the old. However, Saeng was unable to achieve this. She spent all her money on the flower as it held precious memories for her. As the story progresses, it seems that she realizes she can embrace both her past and present lives. The author ends the story in this manner because Saeng genuinely desires to make another attempt. She wishes to satisfy her mother and herself, and she yearns to move forward and commence her new life.
1124	9989	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng realizes she requires more time. If she takes a respite and addresses her needs, she will be capable of passing the test.
1125	9990	4	1	The author concludes the story in this fashion as it allows for the expansion of the narrative into a sequel chronicling Saeng's triumph. Moreover, by ending the story thus, the author showcases Saeng's boundless determination, indicating that she will spare no effort until she completes her test. Saeng encounters challenges in adapting to her new lifestyle as the plants and familiar surroundings from her past are no longer present. In the story, Saeng's resolve is evident when her mother discovers that she spent @NUM1 dollars on a similar plant. The mother remarks that their entire garden is worth less than @NUM1 dollars.
1126	9991	4	1	This sentence serves as the conclusion of the passage, demonstrating that when the hibiscus begins to bud and a new season commences, Saeng will undergo a transformation into a new individual and will be equipped to undertake the test. In this sentence, the frigid snow, departing geese, and potted hibiscus can all symbolize Saeng and her current circumstances. They are either cold, on the verge of departure, or constrained, mirroring Saeng's feelings. However, when a new season dawns, the geese return, and the hibiscus is no longer confined to a pot, Saeng will also mature and be capable of taking the test. This sentence is placed at the end to illustrate the extent to which Saeng can now grow, given that she has the hibiscus, which is growing alongside her.
1127	9992	4	1	The author concludes the story with the provided sentence, as she implies that when winter has passed, there will once again be an opportune moment to resume gardening and retake the test associated with the plant she had planted.
1128	9993	4	1	The author has concluded the story with a paragraph regarding Saeng's intention to retake the test at another time. The author chose this paragraph to conclude the story because Saeng desires to retake the test when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud. She feels prepared when that moment arrives. Saeng is essentially telling herself that she requires more time to be adequately prepared for this test. Once she has sufficient time to prepare, she will retake the test. It is likely that this is the reason the author included this paragraph as the conclusion.
1129	9994	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the hibiscus starts to bud, it will inspire her to attempt and pass the test once more. To pass the test, she wishes to feel a sense of home and draw upon memories of her homeland to encourage her to persevere. Therefore, this is the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with the last paragraph.
1130	9995	4	1	The author concludes the story with a paragraph about retaking the test to illustrate that although the narrator may initially be disheartened about being in a new place, she will persevere. The narrator becomes distressed upon realizing that the hibiscus is not the same as those from her former home. This distress likely stems from her longing for the familiar aspects of her previous life. The author employs this paragraph to showcase the narrator's resilience and determination not to abandon her efforts to recreate a sense of normalcy. Additionally, it demonstrates her willingness to adapt to her new home. The author does this to convey the message that one should persist in pursuing what they love. The narrator will continue to strive when the geese return and the hibiscus buds. Thus, the author is advocating for perseverance in the face of failure and the setting of goals to never give up.
1131	9996	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph due to numerous reasons.
1132	9997	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as he is cognizant that he performed poorly on the test. He asserts that when spring returns, he will be fully prepared to retake the test. I discern that it is spring because he mentioned that when the snow melts...
1133	9998	4	1	Upon relocating to America, she beheld all the resplendent flowers in bloom during spring. A particular blossom, a hibiscus, captivated her attention. Intrigued, she visited a florist to inquire if they had it. Back in her native land, these blossoms grew untamed, sprouting from the crevices in the walls. The blossom evoked memories of her grandmother with her long, freshly - washed gray hair.
1134	9999	4	1	In the passage “Winter Hibiscus” by Monfong Ho, the quote “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again” symbolizes a novel journey in the new country where she resides. During the test, Saeng grapples with a personal conflict, yearning for her homeland as she states, “I – failed the test.” This test holds greater significance than mere failure; it assesses her ability to adapt and function in her new country, and she fell short. The aforementioned “When they came back…” quote can be profoundly analyzed, with the snow representing her obstacles and the hibiscus symbolizing herself. Once the obstacles dissipate and she blossoms into a stronger individual, she will be ready to retake the test.
1135	10000	4	1	She shall return to the place where her journey commenced. It is a cyclical path, and she will find herself back at the starting point the following year.
1136	10001	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author brings the story to a close with this paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This is because the budding of that flower would instill in her a sense of confidence regarding everything. The rationale behind my thinking is that the flower evokes memories of her homeland from the past. It is essentially as if she possesses a small piece of home within her new abode. An instance that exemplifies this is, “Not like the kind we had before.” This is elucidating that the new hibiscus is similar yet not identical to the one from her homeland, thus reminding her of home. This is the reason I am convinced that the author concludes the story in this manner.
1137	10002	4	1	The author brings the story to a close with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng is not merely going to capitulate. She is going to surmount the problem. This constitutes an excellent approach to ending the story because the entire narrative revolves around overcoming difficulties, and if Saeng were to simply give up, it would mar the story. Just as she was capable of relocating from her native land, she will ultimately pass the test. The mother, too, was able to overcome certain obstacles, such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant entirely new flora. Evidently, she misses the former plants, which can be discerned from the way she recognized her gift. Nevertheless, she is able to cope with this, just as Saeng will handle her test the next time.
1138	10003	4	1	All aspects within the story are on the verge of transformation. The winter will transition into spring, the snow will melt and dissipate, the geese will return, the hibiscus will commence budding, and Saeng will also undergo change and maturation. Saeng bears a resemblance to the hibiscus plant; just as the plant is out of place along the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country, and she must adapt in the same way as the hibiscus plant. The plant appears different in the United States compared to Vietnam as it has matured and grown. This is precisely what Saeng must do; she must mature and develop in this new country. For example, Saeng noted how distinct the plant looked in the shop window compared to how it appeared in her home country. She was, in fact, observing herself and how different she seemed as well. The purpose of placing the paragraph at the very end was to illustrate that she had already matured, and positioning it at the end serves to show that she has grown. Placing it at the beginning would not yield the same impact. The hibiscus plant was able to endure the harsh winter's transformation. Saeng is also capable of doing so, and she made a silent vow to take that test again once she has matured, just as the surrounding elements have.
1139	10004	4	1	The author concludes the story with the presented paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, the author must conclude the story without leaving any queries in the readers' minds regarding what transpires. This is accomplished by integrating the geese, hibiscus, and her driver's test into the final paragraph. Secondly, this last paragraph imparts a theme of perseverance to the story. The protagonist is motivated to retake the driver's test through recollections of Vietnam. Lastly, it enriches the character by stating that she will “take that test again,” portraying her as being realistic and not overly inconsistent. These are some of the ways in which the last paragraph enhances the story.
1140	10005	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorperating the geese, hibiscus and her drivers test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the drivers test again through memories of Vietnam lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not overconsistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story."
1141	10006	4	1	The author opted to conclude the narrative with this paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng is commencing to acclimate to her new abode and that she will not capitulate. One can discern that she still yearns for her homeland from her reaction upon sighting the hibiscus plant; concurrently, she is growing accustomed to her new dwelling as evidenced by her recognition of the geese and her intention to decide when to retake the driving test based on their migratory patterns.
1142	10007	4	1	The author terminated the story with the paragraph since it reveals that Saeng was ill - prepared for this test as she was unaccustomed to the locale. However, after encountering the plants that evoked memories of her homeland and being aware that spring is the season when more will bloom, she will be primed to retake the test.
1143	10008	4	1	The rationale for concluding the story in this manner is to signify that the season of the flowers has concluded and should be deferred until spring. This provides the author with a juncture to conclude the current story and initiate a new one when the flowers reappear in spring. In conclusion, this is the reason the author ends the story with the chosen paragraph.
1144	10009	4	1	The author concludes the story with the statement “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to illustrate that Saeng intends to retake the test and will not abandon her efforts. This determination is evident from the phrase “then I will take that test again,” which indicates that she has not relinquished her resolve and desires to attempt it once more.
1145	10010	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph due to its connection with Saeng's failure in her driving test. Nevertheless, she is resolute to retake it when she deems herself ready. The paragraph states, “in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.”
1146	10011	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, I surmise that she included certain elements as they perpetually prompt the reader to pose inquiries. I conjecture that due to her mother's profound disappointment in her, perhaps she can effect changes and ameliorate the situation.
1147	10012	4	1	The author concludes the story by stating, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She opts to end the story in this manner to illustrate the transformation of the mood throughout the narrative. When she arrives home, her mother “noticed the tear stain on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.” At the onset of the story, Saeng felt sorrowful and out of place, yet by the conclusion, she felt joyous and sanguine. This shift in her emotions showcases the overall development in the story.
1148	10013	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, it demonstrates the girl's indomitable spirit and refusal to succumb. Initially, she was in tears at the store and deeply dejected. Nevertheless, she is cognizant that she must persevere, which evinces a remarkable sense of determination. Secondly, I believe the author chose this as the final paragraph because it depicts the girl's acclimatization to her new environment. The author artfully combines the girl's recollections of her homeland with her present knowledge of the new country, thereby enabling her to glean hope from both. For instance, the article states, “many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become… almost familiar to her now,” which indicates that she is gradually adapting to her current circumstances and deriving hope from this realization. Additionally, I believe the author's intention was to infuse a positive undertone into the story. In conclusion, these are the reasons why I think the author crafted this as the last paragraph.
1149	10014	4	1	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to convey to the audience that the narrative or the characters within it possess an affinity for nature or an inclination towards writing about nature, including its elements, transformations, or perhaps this story epitomizes nature at its finest. This choice of conclusion allows the reader to appreciate the significance of nature in the story and its impact on the overall theme.
1150	10015	4	1	The author composed that final paragraph to instill hope in both Saeng and the reader. Upon beholding the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her native country, and a profound sense of loss engulfs her, as the author writes, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.” Saeng purchases the flower and engages in a conversation with her mother about it at home. The flower not only evokes memories of her homeland but also serves as a wellspring of inspiration. Consequently, she declares that she will succeed in the test when the hibiscus buds blossom, signifying her newfound hope and determination.
1151	10016	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it harmonizes with a substantial portion of the story and effectively encapsulates its essence. In the tale, the hibiscus holds profound significance for Saeng. Throughout the story, she associates numerous recollections with the hibiscus. It evokes memories of her homeland and past, thus playing a pivotal role. When she plants it, it is winter, and the hibiscus has yet to blossom. So, stating that she will retake the test when it is budding is akin to saying she will do so when it begins to bud anew. She behaves in a manner remarkably similar to the flower, once again highlighting its importance. And that is why I believe the author concluded with that paragraph.
1152	10017	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it conveys that she cannot tend to the garden during winter, yet phrases like “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding” are all indicators of spring. In spring, she will retake the test, which implies that she will engage in gardening activities. This conclusion effectively ties together the seasonal symbolism with the character's future actions, providing a sense of hope and renewal.
1153	10018	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner as the author (Minfong Ho) is informing the reader about what will transpire during springtime. I infer this because the text states that Saeng silently vowed to herself that in spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test. This suggests that in spring, the hibiscus will reach a state of growth and development, symbolizing new beginnings and opportunities for Saeng.
1154	10019	4	1	She believes she will perform better in spring; however, the exact reason remains unclear. It is possible that she will be in a more favorable emotional state, and the environment will more closely resemble her homeland, which could positively impact her performance. Ultimately, her anticipation of improved results in spring reflects her hope and optimism for the future.
1155	10020	4	1	The author opted to conclude the story with that paragraph because it symbolizes Saeng's determination to persevere and attempt again. Natural phenomena are cyclical; seasons change, yet they inevitably recur, and geese migrate but eventually return. The author employed this as an analogy for Saeng's decision to pursue her license once more. Similar to Saeng, the winter hibiscus was in an unfamiliar environment but was learning to adapt. This inspired Saeng to persist despite setbacks, as the hibiscus was striving to survive the winter despite being out of its natural habitat. This conclusion effectively underscores the theme of resilience and the power of nature to inspire hope and determination.
1156	10021	4	1	I believe that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because regardless of what she said or did, she had to obtain the flower as it reminds her of the place where she used to reside and what it was like there. Consequently, she began to weep. The test was not to purchase the flower and not to shed tears. Moreover, in the spring, she intends to cultivate her own flower. That, in my opinion, is what the test pertains to.
1157	10022	4	1	She ascertains whether her plant will endure the winter, just as the ones back at her native place did. And she anticipates that the circumstances will remain unchanged.
1158	10023	4	1	It marks the commencement of a new life. She has a new educational institution and a new plant. It seems as though she has a bond with the plant; as it grows, she becomes more robust and self - assured. That is when she declared that when they return, at the time when the hibiscus is in bud, she will be prepared for that test.
1159	10024	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that passage because it demonstrates that she will not abandon her efforts and that she will afford her new country an opportunity. She ends it with that statement to convey that she will be resilient like the flower and that she will remain regardless of the circumstances. That she will be present in that very spot to witness its regrowth. That is the reason why I believe she concluded the story in such a manner.
1160	10025	4	1	Throughout this narrative, we are provided with background details about a girl who desperately yearns for her true homeland. When we are initially introduced to young Saeng, she is in a florist's establishment merely observing flowers. Soon, we discover that she is not merely looking at flowers but rather at fragments of her home and past. Subsequently, she acquires a hibiscus, a flower indigenous to Vietnam. After learning that she has just failed a test, it becomes more evident that buying the flower is a means of coping with her new situation in @LOCATION1 and finding solace in her past. The author is able to conclude the story with that statement because it alludes to moving forward without being attached to the past. In the spring, Saeng will have a new abode and draw strength from her past. That is what I perceive the final paragraph to imply.
1161	10026	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as Saeng is resolute in passing the test. She is aware that when spring arrives and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the assessment. It is posited that she desires to retake the test because the hibiscus evokes memories of her homeland. This evocation instills in her a greater sense of confidence. She believes she can succeed on the next attempt. The hibiscus fills her with joy and a profound sense of emotion. Hence, she wishes to retake the test, certain that she will perform better the next time.
1162	10027	4	1	It is hypothesized that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that if such a flower can blossom in diverse locations and undergo natural transformations, so too can she. For the author, the flower serves as a symbol that encourages perseverance. Regardless of the necessity to restart the process, this time, one will possess the knowledge gleaned from past errors. Just as a flower blooms in spring, withers in winter, and resurges in spring, Saeng, having failed the test that year, can retake it the following time. This cycle of hope and renewal is what the author aims to convey through this symbolic representation.
1163	10028	4	1	"It is speculated that she implies she will be prepared for the winter test once winter has passed. This conjecture is based on the fact that they were ill - prepared for the onset of winter while engaged in planting. As indicated in the reading, ""As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel."" This serves as evidence that they were not adequately prepared for the winter, and by extension, it can be inferred that she will take this experience into account to be ready for the test."
1164	10029	4	1	The author concluded the story in this fashion to elicit sympathy and comprehension from the audience regarding the hardships endured by Saeng and her family during this difficult period. It prompts the reader to feel empathy for Saeng, as the only solace she can find is in thoughts of her hometown and the circumstances of her displacement. This emotional resonance crafted by the author effectively engages the reader and deepens their understanding of Saeng's plight.
1165	10030	4	1	He concludes the story because he seeks another opportunity to undertake the test. This decision to conclude the narrative in relation to this pursuit of a second chance at the test implies that there is significance attached to this retake. Perhaps the outcome of the test holds great importance for him, and the conclusion of the story serves to highlight his determination to achieve a better result on this subsequent attempt.
1166	10031	4	1	"The author concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to accentuate a new life and fresh opportunities for the protagonist. The future setting of the paragraph, spring, symbolizes rejuvenation and a new commencement from the frigid, harsh winter. The author internalizes this, incorporating additional events that augment this symbolized significance. The author employs structured choices to convey her thoughts. When recreating to convey the theme of rebirth, the author utilizes words such as ""the geese return"" and ""take the test again"" which contribute to the significance at home. Also, the literal action of the ""hibiscus is budding"" represents rebirth. In winter, the plant is dormant and less vibrant, but in spring, the plant demonstrates rebirth through the color in its buds. The author ultimately conveys the theme of rebirth by concluding with this paragraph."
1167	10032	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, it depicts a girl who has recently relocated to a new country and is encountering difficulties acclimating to the new land and its inhabitants. However, I opine that the author placed that quote at the end to induce the belief that one should never abandon hope, that there is a new beginning and one will persevere. I hold this view because Saeng muses to herself, ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she once regarded as strange had, through the quiet recurrence of season upon season, become nearly familiar to her."" This indicates that she has finally found solace and is confident, akin to geese adapting to a new area and then returning, and that the winter hibiscus never surrenders and will continue to thrive in the new weather conditions each season."
1168	10033	4	1	At the conclusion of her paragraph, she summarizes her points. She states a comprehensive idea, signifying that she will reflect on it once winter has concluded. She will have the opportunity to retake the test in spring. This is the subject matter of her writing.
1169	10034	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it illustrates her attempt to adapt to her new environment. The hibiscus evokes memories of her former life and provides her with comfort. Thus, when she takes her test in spring, she will feel more at ease and comfortable while recollecting her past life in a new location. In the story, it is mentioned that she failed her test and subsequently purchased a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant revived memories of her former existence, which aided in comforting her. Spring reminds her of her old life as the flowers in the garden are in bloom, the geese have returned, and the snow has melted. Saeng believes that she can adapt to her new surroundings with the consolation of her memories of her past life.
1170	10035	4	1	"The author selected this paragraph as it serves as an apt conclusion. For instance, the word ""again"" implies that one has already completed something and it has ended, yet one misses it and thus attempts it once more. In the paragraph, it pertains to nature and how it is being tested again. This choice effectively encapsulates the essence of the narrative, highlighting the cyclical nature of experiences and the potential for renewal."
1171	10036	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it continues to demonstrate Saeng's unwavering resolve to retake the test and succeed this time. By concluding the story with this paragraph, the author creates suspense, presumably for a sequel or another installment of the story.
1172	10037	4	1	"In the short - story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young Vietnamese girl relocates to @LOCATION1 and fails the driver's examination. After deciding to expend money on a winter hibiscus to evoke memories of her homeland, the ending paragraph, ""When Troy returns, in the spring when the snow thaws and the geese come back and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will take the test again,"" reveals a profound affinity towards nature. She perceives that just as the geese are ready to return home and the hibiscus is poised to bud, so will she be ready to retake the driver's test."
1173	10038	4	1	"She is conversing about the flowers, and when she mentions ""test,"" I surmise she refers to how she observes and scrutinizes the flowers and witnesses the snowfall anew. It appears that the author is someone who greatly admires flowers, perhaps specifically this one hibiscus and its budding process. Perhaps she is simply an individual who appreciates observing transformations."
1174	10039	4	1	I posit that the author incorporates this passage into the story to symbolize determination and @LOCATION1. Although Saeng is not originally from @LOCATION2, she is resolute and eager to attempt to acclimate to our @CAPS1. While the winter was frigid and arduous for her in numerous respects, the spring will bring absolution and respite from her @CAPS2. She will endeavor to pass the driving test once more to further integrate into American @CAPS1, while the blooming of the hibiscus will evoke a sense of @CAPS4 of home.
1175	10040	4	1	"The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has recognized the necessity of self - confidence and to end the story on an optimistic note. Additionally, the author weaves elements familiar to Saeng and elements indigenous to her new home into the final paragraph. At the story's onset, the girl seemed extremely distraught and adrift in this country, yearning deeply for her homeland. ""A wave of loss so profound and intense that it pricked Saeng's eyes now washed over her."" However, once she arrives home and informs her mother of her failure in the driving test, she appears to feel better. Towards the conclusion, after planting the hibiscus, she spots geese and senses that they are ""nearly familiar."" The paragraph that concludes the selection effectively intertwines her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese and the snow), and the story's drama (failing the test) into a cohesive whole."
1176	10041	4	1	Driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire for greater experiences, she was eager to learn and engage in diverse activities. Enchanted by the aesthetic appeal of the plants at the store, she was captivated by their allure. Her mother procured the plant, and upon returning home, they commenced the process of planting it. The daughter developed an intense affection for the plant. With enthusiasm, she declared that in the upcoming year, she would cultivate a plant as remarkable as the one her mother was nurturing.
1177	10042	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes this particular paragraph within the story to depict the maturation of Saeng. Evidently, it appears that she no longer resides with her mother. Presumably, the author intends to accentuate for the reader the transformation of Saeng. Given that she no longer lives with her mother, it is likely that she has embarked on a new phase. What transpired in the past remains a significant and memorable part of Saeng's life, shaping her present circumstances.
1178	10043	4	1	The author employs that passage to conclude the story in order to illustrate that Saeng will endeavor to assimilate. When Saeng inhales the fragrance of the Hibiscus, “The familiar aroma permeated her lungs, and Saeng could almost sense the gentle caress of her grandmother’s long gray hair.” This indicates that Saeng was in search of elements that were reminiscent of her homeland. The fact that Saeng spent over nineteen dollars on a plant further demonstrates her profound longing for her native land. “d - d failed the test that Saeng paid.” This reveals to the reader that she attempted to adapt to her new abode but encountered difficulties. This realization saddens her and triggers a yearning for the way things were. At the conclusion of the story, she stated, “I will take the test again.” The sight of the familiar hibiscus and the geese departing, knowing they will return, instills hope in Saeng. The final instance in the story suggests that she will always cherish the memory of her homeland.
1179	10044	4	1	The author brings the story to a close with this paragraph to convey that Saeng is resolute and will not abandon her efforts. Despite the challenges she may face, she remains steadfast in her determination, indicating that she is prepared to persevere and overcome obstacles on her journey.
1180	10045	4	1	In the presence of the hibiscus, Saeng will be endowed with greater fortitude and will have had additional time to acclimate to her new dwelling. For Saeng, the hibiscus serves as a wellspring of motivation and evokes memories of her ancestral homeland. I believe the author chose to conclude the story with this specific comment to demonstrate that, ultimately, Saeng has discovered the courage within herself and is prepared to embrace the responsibilities and challenges in this unfamiliar territory, marking a significant step in her journey of adaptation.
1181	10046	4	1	The narrative concludes with that paragraph as it conveys that just as there are alterations in the weather and seasons, so too are there in one's life. One must, at times, confront the changes in one's life. The test might serve as a means to determine if she can gain self - understanding. Changes in the weather occur constantly; there are changes in spring and fall. One simply has to overcome them.
1182	10047	4	1	In the story “The Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative with a paragraph that brings the story to a close. One of the reasons she ended with the last paragraph as she did is that it informs the reader that Saeng has not relinquished her pursuit of the driver's test. “... Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This elaborates further on when she will retake the test. Another reason is that it prompts the reader to contemplate how the remainder of the story will unfold.
1183	10048	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author's choice to conclude the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” was an exemplary way to end it. I believe that she perceives how resilient the hibiscus is and realizes that she can endure just about anything, particularly the test. Additionally, when her mother said “You what?” and “Her mother stared at her incredulously,” she might have also grasped that if her mother could overcome her anger, then she could overcome her distress about the test.
1184	10049	4	1	The author writes this conclusion at the end of the story because he intends for readers to recognize that the seasons are changing and the flowers are on the verge of withering. He also wishes for you to understand that when the season reverts, the flower will attempt to integrate once more with the other flowers. This is what the author implies when discussing taking the test again.
1185	10050	4	1	The hibiscus flower is regarded as a symbol of hope and a memento of their homeland. When Saeng first lays eyes on it in the florist shop, she is inundated with memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I surmise that the author intends for the new flower to signify an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in [LOCATION1]. Planting the flower represents adaptation, given that they have relocated to a new land. Saeng appears to be using it as motivation when she states “when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.” The paragraph offers closure and a sense of hope, which is an ideal note on which to conclude the story.
1186	10051	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it conveys that if one fails initially, there is invariably a subsequent opportunity, much like the @CAPS1 that perishes in winter yet revives in spring.
1187	10052	4	1	The author concludes the story by stating, “When the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, I will retake the test.” The author makes this statement because the girl Saeng failed the test but discovered something that reminded her of her homeland. Although she was content, the plants were not precisely the same as those from her home. Nevertheless, she adapted to them. The flower @MONTH1 may not be identical, but it is an @CAPS1 flower, and she is gradually acclimating to being in @LOCATION1. When she returns to take the test, she will be prepared, as will her plant, which will be brimming with vitality.
1188	10053	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story in this manner due to Saeng's reverence for the plant. She not only perceives the plant as a representation of her homeland but also as an emblem of good fortune. In the text, she values the plant highly, having paid @NUM1 coins for it. Hence, I believe the story ends thus to symbolize that Saeng believes the optimal time to take the test is when the hibiscus is flourishing.
1189	10054	4	1	The author incorporates that paragraph at the story's conclusion because it employs symbolism to link Saeng with the geese and the plant. For Saeng, the snow symbolizes her difficulties in adjusting to @LOCATION1, while the geese indicate that she is, even at present, adapting to her new country as the geese seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was lovely, yet the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which represents her since her arrival in @LOCATION1, is more resilient and can endure the snow, symbolizing her challenges in adapting to @LOCATION1. For Saeng, the reblooming of the hibiscus signifies her growing stronger and surmounting her difficulties. She desires to retake the test when she has grown stronger. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to associate the budding of the hibiscus with Saeng overcoming her obstacles.
1190	10055	4	1	The author opted to conclude the story in such a way as she implies that the situation is not over and that Saeng will retake the test. In the story, Saeng states, “I – I failed the test,” indicating her determination to return when the flower blossoms to rectify the outcome.
1191	10056	4	1	I surmise that what the author endeavors to convey is that she will undertake her driving test anew in the spring when the blossoms are in bloom, as it will induce a more relaxed state of mind. The flowers instill in the author a tranquil mental state, enabling her to concentrate.
1192	10057	4	1	As she asserts, upon the regrowth of the @CAPS1, she will be @CAPS2 to retake the test.
1193	10058	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with the final sentence to illustrate that the season for plant growth has concluded. However, when the time arrives for the flowers to commence blooming again, she will return to tend to the plants, as they are her favorites and the essence of her existence now that she is responsible for them. Moreover, the author likely structured the story's conclusion in this manner to pique readers' interest in delving further into the tale later on, leaving them in a state of suspense, as one remains uncertain whether she will truly return to the plants or merely reminisce about them. Another rationale, I believe, for the author's ending is that since it is still snowing, although she cares deeply for the plants, she will refrain from fretting about them until the opportune moment. For instance, she states, “When they come back, then I will take the test again,” which demonstrates her unwavering determination not to abandon anything she holds dear and her resolve to persevere until she achieves success.
1194	10059	4	1	In the story “The Winter Hibiscus,” I opine that the author employs the final paragraph to convey that despite the indelible memories of her native country lingering with her, she will gradually acclimate to her new homeland. Additionally, she will intermittently revisit her old country. For example, the phrase “when the snow melts and the geese return” and the concluding sentence “then I will take the test again” imply that once she has adapted to her new country and returns to her old one, she will find joy in both places regardless.
1195	10060	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng will retake the test when all these events transpire. Saeng exhibits her steadfast resolve not to surrender and her determination to persevere. The hibiscus serves as a talisman for her during the test, motivating her to achieve success. Furthermore, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to reveal Saeng's personal musings and her sentiments regarding the test. In the spring, when the snow thaws, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, it signifies that it is time to attempt the test once more. In summary, this paragraph indicates that Saeng will never forget.
1196	10061	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the final paragraph of the story. When they return, Saeng privately vowed to herself that in spring, when the snows dissolve, the geese reappear, and this hibiscus begins to sprout, she will undertake that test once more.
1197	10062	4	1	I surmise that she perceived it as an effective means to unite everything.
1198	10063	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with Saeng proclaiming, “I will take that test again.” This implies that Saeng will be prepared as soon as spring arrives and her hibiscus is in full blossom. When Saeng acquired the hibiscus, she was confident that upon the winter's departure and spring's arrival, retaking the driver's test would be easier, enabling her to surmount the fear and sorrowful times in a new locale. This indicates that Saeng can overcome her fear of a new place. Additionally, Saeng is certain that the memories of her homeland will also aid her. Ultimately, it is revealed that Saeng has grown resilient and harbors high hopes for the fulfillment of her success in her new homeland.
1199	10064	4	1	The author concludes the tale with that paragraph as it demonstrates her determination. In spring, it will be arduous for the hibiscus to endure since it is a winter hibiscus, yet it too exhibits determination.
1200	10065	4	1	I opine that the author employed that statement to conclude the story as, by the end, Saeng was prepared to confront her obstacles anew. Moreover, it showcases her appreciation for her new surroundings. The plant that Saeng bought; her mother stated, “It’s robust enough to endure the cold months here.” This is suggesting to Saeng that if the plant can withstand the harsh conditions, perhaps she can also persevere while living in a new country. When Saeng realized that things had a recurring cycle season after season, she must have recognized that she could also do it and face the driving test again.
1201	10066	4	1	The author incorporates the final paragraph in the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” to illustrate that the protagonist still harbors hopes and has not relinquished her pursuit of a new lifestyle. Throughout the story, the main character, Saeng, reflects on her relatively recent recollections of her native homeland in Vietnam upon recognizing a particular plant from her country. This is significant in the tale as Saeng remains discontented about relocating to @LOCATION2, and she begins to weep as she makes her way home, having purchased the plant, to her mother. “A surge of loss so profound and intense that it pricked Saeng’s eyes now engulfed her.” Saeng’s mother comprehended her emotional state and was not disappointed in her for failing her driving test. Her mother alleviated Saeng’s distress by promptly planting the familiar hibiscus in the garden. The last paragraph of the story instills hope in the reader that Saeng will not abandon her resolve to lead a different life in @LOCATION2, despite its unfamiliarity. “When the snows thaw, and the geese return, and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test.” It is as though Saeng is pledging that, in due course, she will find contentment in her new life, not merely by passing a driving test. The winter hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng to remain resilient in the new country while still cherishing her past life in Vietnam.
1202	10067	4	1	The author, MiNfoNg Ho, concluded the story with the statement “When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow thaws and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This is because when the plant commences to bloom, she will @MONTH1 feel more self - assured and at ease. At times, one can observe her endeavors to acclimate to new surroundings. It is believed that the hibiscus symbolizes solace during moments of disappointment and a connection to her past experiences. Since the hibiscus represents comfort in times of letdown, this is the reason she went out and procured the plant. So, when spring arrives again and the hibiscus is in full bloom, that is why she will take the test again, as she will feel more comfortable within and with her environment. This is precisely why the author, MiNfoNg Ho, concluded the story in this manner.
1203	10068	4	1	The past experiences of our lives frequently exert an influence on various aspects of our existence, whether we are consciously aware of it or not. In this narrative, Saeng endeavors to visit the flower shop and overcome the temptation of not purchasing the specific flower that evokes memories of her home, yet she fails. She is attempting to come to terms with the fact that she is no longer “at home,” that the things and people that once provided a sense of stability are no longer present. However, there are new elements to which she is gradually becoming accustomed. It is posited that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to demonstrate that change is always feasible. She is striving to relegate the elements that trigger nostalgia further into the recesses of her mind, and with the passage of time, she may achieve this, perhaps even by the following year. This is because it is always possible to accomplish something if one truly desires to do so, and the author is highlighting that Saeng genuinely wishes to pass her internal test, enabling her to better adapt to change, and her mother will be proud of her achievements.
1204	10069	4	1	I surmise that she intended to convey that she had not surmounted a challenge and would return the following year to retake the test, much like the hibiscus that blossoms when the snow melts and the geese return @CAPS1 year. This shows her determination and the cyclical nature of hope and renewal, as she looks forward to a time when she will be better prepared to face the test again, just as the natural world renews itself with the changing of the seasons.
1205	10070	4	1	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph to convey to the readers that Saeng is determined to retake the test. By including this, the author emphasizes Saeng's resilience and her refusal to be defeated by her initial failure. It also gives the readers a sense of hope and closure, as they can anticipate that Saeng will strive to overcome the obstacle and move forward in her new life.
1206	10071	4	1	"When Saeng declared that she would go and retake the test the following year, she implied an attempt to replant the flora anew. When Saeng utters, ""Here, allow me to assist, mother,"" at that very moment, one discerns that Saeng indeed desires to aid with the plants."
1207	10072	4	1	"The author's selection of the last paragraph in the short story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" manifests the hope for the future that Saeng experiences. The winter and cold signify her sense of being out of place and disheartened due to not obtaining her driver's license. In spring, a part of her homeland will be in bloom, and she will regain a sense of warmth. She will feel prepared to retake her test ""when they came back."" This demonstrates her adaptation to and acceptance of her new life away from her home and memories. The last paragraph affirms that she was resilient enough to overcome her hardships and move forward."
1208	10073	4	1	The speaker at @MONTH1 concludes the narrative with that paragraph because the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus at @MONTH1 bolster her confidence. She aspires to feel capable of undertaking this test.
1209	10074	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" She realizes she has another opportunity to pass the test. When spring blossoms anew, she commences gardening upon the return of spring."
1210	10075	4	1	"Saeng derives solace from recollections of her homeland. When she took the test, everything was alien to her, thus she failed. However, on her return journey, something familiar encountered her: native plants of her home. ""There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood - red blossom,"" ""floating in the bucket."" Saeng requires familiar elements to soothe herself. Hence, when she beholds the geese, it symbolizes change. ""Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched."" Spring is a period for fresh starts, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" When the familiar object reaches its prime, she will be at her best and capable of confronting anything. Winter is the ""preparation"" phase."
1211	10076	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concluded the narrative with the paragraph, “When they returned, Saeng made a silent vow to herself: in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese migrate back, and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I shall retake that test.” She did so because she had purchased the flower upon failing the test; thus, when the flower blossoms, she will attempt the test once more.
1212	10077	4	1	I surmise that the author intended to convey that when the snow starts to melt, around @MONTH1, she will make a comeback. The author will do so as she plans to pen a new book sometime in the spring.
1213	10078	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” employs this paragraph to bring her story to a close as it serves as a symbol of Saeng's future. “Winter Hibiscus” symbolizes Saeng for multiple reasons. Firstly, both Saeng and the plant hail from Vietnam and both strive to survive and prosper in the new realm of the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng pledges to herself that when the plant flourishes in the spring, she too will thrive by retaking her driver's test. This symbol of the future is of utmost significance to the story's essence, which is why Ming Fon Ho, the author of “Winter Hibiscus,” opted to conclude with this crucial symbol.
1214	10079	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the tale with the paragraph, “When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese come back, and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test.” The author most probably selected this as the final paragraph to assist the reader in comprehending the message. The underlying message of this story is that regardless of what transpires or what challenges one encounters, never abandon hope and always persevere. The author makes this the last paragraph to prompt the reader to contemplate and reflect on its meaning.
1215	10080	4	1	The author concluded the story with this paragraph for a single reason. That reason is that Saeng believes she failed because she acquired a fake plant rather than a genuine one. She felt disheartened when she brought it home. For instance, she remarked, “I failed,” referring to the plant. She also contrasts her current situation with where she used to reside. For example, she stated, “It's not like the one at home.” This is why the author concludes with this paragraph.
1216	10081	4	1	"When they return, Saeng promised herself, in the spring when the snows recede and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus begins to blossom, then I will retake that test."" The significance of this statement within the story lies in her fondness for the garden, where entry is prohibited during snowfall. Moreover, she has a deep affection for plants and botanical entities, which is why the author concluded the paragraph in relation to the story; as spring arrives, Saeng intends to acquire plants and flowers. Finally, Saeng spots a familiar plant. Subsequently, she visits a florist shop to check if it can be bought, and becomes extremely distressed when something goes awry with them."
1217	10082	4	1	"In the text, when the mother stated, ""It's flowers aren't as resplendent, yet it's robust enough to endure the frigid months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters."" This sentence indicates that Saeng is akin to the flowers. They are resilient enough to survive the winter, demonstrating their beauty and strength in spring. This emphasizes that Saeng will be more steadfast and self - assured in spring. This is the reason the author included it at the end. It also mirrors the flower, highlighting how they are both beautiful and strong in spring."
1218	10083	4	1	"In the short story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" penned by Minfong Ho, the author incorporates a paragraph at the conclusion, proclaiming that the protagonist, Saeng, will retake her driving test. Ho includes this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's resolve to adapt. Saeng is newly arrived in the United States; she and her mother relocated here from Vietnam. Throughout the narrative, she reminisces about her life in Vietnam, her grandmother, and the flowers there. ""Where was my...hibiscus hedge?... Her gentle grandmother?"" While at the flower shop, Saeng discovers a hibiscus, a flower also found in Vietnam. She observes how it has adapted to survive the winter here. As she plants the flower in her backyard, she makes a solemn vow to herself to pass the driving test the following spring. She, too, desires to acclimate to the new environment and be able to reside here without excessively longing for home. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to illustrate that Saeng, too, wishes to adapt to her surroundings and pass the driving test."
1219	10084	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to elucidate the true essence of the hibiscus. The hibiscus holds symbolic significance for Saeng in multiple ways, but most crucially, it represents transformation, growth, and the capacity to surmount obstacles. Upon beholding it, she is inundated with childhood recollections and nostalgia. Nevertheless, if she wishes to evolve as an individual, she must adjust to her new abode. She will persevere here, just as the hibiscus will endure through the winter. Additionally, Saeng vows that ""in the spring"" when ""this hibiscus is in bud, then I will take that test again."" She is resolute in achieving success, and the hibiscus itself epitomizes victory over obstacles. It symbolizes survival and perseverance through life's disappointments and challenges, from failing a driver's test to commencing a new life in an unfamiliar and foreign land. The author's decision to end the story with this paragraph showcases Saeng's ultimate comprehension of her strength through the symbol of the hibiscus."
1220	10085	4	1	"I surmise that the author concludes the paragraph in such a manner because he/she aimed to convey a crucial message to the audience. The message the author sought to impart was that despite failing the test, she would endeavor again the following year. An instance of this is the exact quote, ""In the spring when the snow thaws and the geese return and the hibiscus is in bloom, then I will take the test again."" This is the rationale behind my belief that the author concludes the story in this way."
1221	10086	4	1	The author incorporates the story within this paragraph as, given that Saeng failed her driver's test for the first time when the hibiscus begins to bud, it symbolizes a transformation in her life. Moreover, Saeng used to have hibiscus flowers at her former residence in Vietnam; thus, when the flower buds, it can signify that she has a new home.
1222	10087	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the statement, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The rationale behind this conclusion is that it is crucial for Saeng to feel a sense of belonging. When the hibiscus buds, it will evoke memories of her home, offering her solace. When she experiences tranquility and a feeling of home, she will perform better on the test.
1223	10088	4	1	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to demonstrate that she is neither relinquishing her new home nor forgetting her old one. Her determination not to give up is evident when she brings the flower home to plant, which also indicates that she will not forget her former abode. Additionally, when she states, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” it shows that she is giving her new home another opportunity and not surrendering. Another instance is when it is mentioned, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had regarded as peculiar before had, through the quiet recurrence of season after season, become nearly familiar to her now.” Here, she is embracing the changes and giving her new home a fresh chance, refusing to abandon it.
1224	10089	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is prepared to repeat the same activities the following year. She relishes spending time with her mother, has an affinity for plants, and enjoys having a good time with her mother. These are some of the reasons why she concludes the story with that paragraph.
1225	10090	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph since the hibiscus offers solace. After Saeng failed her driving test and was new to the place, she was exasperated and yearning for her actual home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes, “She closed her eyes and inhaled deeply as the fragrance permeated her lungs.” After Saeng smelled the flower, it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed,” bringing her comfort during a period of disappointment. Even though she did not have her grandmother present, the flower provided her with consolation. Despite her disappointment, the hibiscus was “exquisite,” and as she uttered the [CAPS1] word “dokor malik,” meaning hibiscus, she “relished the sensation of the word on her tongue.” The joy and comfort that the flower brings to Saeng are what make her decide to take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding,” thereby infusing joy, love, and comfort into the reader as they empathize with Saeng's emotions.
1226	10091	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it correlates the concept of the hibiscus with Saeng and her circumstances in a foreign country. It demonstrates that Saeng is leveraging the hibiscus and its capacity to adapt as a source of inspiration. Throughout the story, Saeng recounts how she had consistently encountered the hibiscus in her native land. Her mother explains to her that the hibiscus she purchased differs slightly from the one back home. However, she attributes this to its resilience and its ability to acclimate to the frigid winter environment of the United States. This is precisely what Saeng utilizes as inspiration. Although she may have failed her license test, she emulates the hibiscus's actions to set a personal goal. The plant endures a cold and snowy winter but flourishes and blossoms in the spring. Saeng intends to utilize this time to study and prepare, and she will approach the test with confidence. The paragraph with which the author concludes illustrates the connection Saeng established between her situation and that of the plant.
1227	10092	4	1	The adage “If at first you don't succeed, try, try again” is frequently employed by parents to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their teams. This quote is also applicable to Saeng's predicament in the short story “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her driver's test and, while walking home afterward, notices a hibiscus flower that evokes memories of her homeland. Sorrow engulfs her, and she purchases the plant to soothe her grief. She brings it home and is initially rebuked by her mother but later thanked for the purchase. As Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honking of Canada geese, which had by then become familiar to her. The text states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had once regarded as strange had, through the quiet recurrence of season after season, become familiar to her.” This quote exemplifies the adaptation she had to undergo upon arriving in @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that, like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the challenges and hardships of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to persevere and attempt the license test again, just as the plant persevered through the winter.
1228	10093	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because Saeng experiences a sense of solace with the hibiscus flower. The flower evokes memories of her homeland and her grandmother. As the story states, “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair.” It is evident that she misses her homeland but always keeps it close to her heart, regardless of her location. The text describes it as “yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and delicate flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” She appears to have a profound connection with nature and all its appealing attributes. After failing the test, she purchased her “@CAPS1 Malik” flower as a source of comfort. She and her mother decided to plant it in their garden, and during this process, Saeng received a significant boost of confidence to retake the test. This connection between Saeng and the hibiscus flower underscores the emotional support and inspiration it provides her, ultimately influencing her decision to face her challenges anew.
1229	10094	4	1	She draws a parallel between the paragraph and the story to relate it to the school environment. In this context, the test symbolizes the process of making new friends and achieving success in academic endeavors. The paragraph states, “Then I will take that test again.” This statement serves as the rationale for her comparison of the paragraph to school, highlighting the determination to persevere and overcome challenges, whether in the context of a test or the broader school experience.
1230	10095	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to accentuate Saeng's resolve to surmount the hurdles of her past experiences. For instance, the story commences with Saeng taking a “test.” As she revisits her memories in the greenhouse, she begins to succumb to her emotions. “A wave of loss so profound and intense that it stung Saeng's eyes now washed over her.” Subsequently, she purchases the plant and takes it home to her mother, informing her that she “failed.” Her mother then exhibits understanding and supports Saeng's vow to retake the “test.” The narrator emphasizes Saeng's determination to overcome the difficulties of her past and forge ahead into the future, highlighting her resilience and the transformative power of her experiences.
1231	10096	4	1	Owing to her academic pursuits, she was engaged in the study of flowers within a verdant garden. Evidently, she failed the examination. Thus, when spring commences its arrival, she will retake the test as the flowers will blossom, enabling her to conduct more in - depth research to pass the test and avoid future retakes. It seems, however, that she is also eagerly anticipating the return of spring so that she can relish the flowers and the process of growth and study.
1232	10097	4	1	It is my contention that the author concluded the narrative with that specific paragraph to convey that Saeng was not relinquishing her efforts. Originally hailing from Vietnam, Saeng relocated to the United States. She yearned deeply for her homeland as everything seemed different. “It’s not a real one,” Saeng murmured. “I mean, not like the kind we had back home.” She found herself too tremulous to utter the words “at home.” Once Saeng finally recognized that she was beginning to acclimate to life in the United States, she resolved to attempt the driver's test once more. “When they return in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese come back and this hibiscus starts to bud, then I will take that test again.” In essence, the author's choice of conclusion effectively portrays Saeng's resilience and hope.
1233	10098	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the protagonist appears to attain a sense of comfort upon sighting the geese and cultivating the hibiscus during winter, ensuring its survival. As stated in the story, “... their faint banks clear and - yes - familiar to Saeng now.” This passage elucidates her emotional state after witnessing the geese flying overhead, a sight she was accustomed to in Vietnam. Additionally, the statement “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” indicates that she gains greater confidence as she feels as though she has returned to Vietnam. All things considered, this is the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with that paragraph, effectively capturing the character's emotional journey.
1234	10099	4	1	I opine that the reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to enable the reader to envision the subsequent events once spring arrives for Saeng. This encourages the reader to employ their imagination to forge a connection with the narrative. Another motivation for the author's choice to conclude the story in this manner is to instill hope in the reader that Saeng may pass the test on her next attempt. It also serves as a positive way to bring the story to a close, leaving the reader with an optimistic outlook.
1235	10100	4	1	The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because, like the geese, the character will return to make another attempt. In case she was unable to complete all that she desired to do, the author intended for the reader to recognize the determination and ambition of the character in the story. Moreover, it demonstrates to the readers that the character's spirit cannot be vanquished by a single winter and that she will persevere until she accomplishes her goals. This conclusion effectively highlights the character's indomitable will.
1236	10101	4	1	The author of the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” most plausibly concludes it with the paragraph where Saeng pledges to retake the test to illustrate that even amidst arduous circumstances and novel situations, an individual must never succumb to despair and surrender. There are always elements that can offer solace. In the story, snippets of Saeng's home are presented through her recollections, from which the reader can discern the challenging day she is enduring. The author depicts these warm, comforting reminiscences to create a stark contrast with the frigid, bitter day the girl is experiencing. “She closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. The familiar aroma filled her lungs.” Here, Saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother, and the thought of her home and loss saddens her. The author gradually intensifies Saeng's despair and distress leading up to the final paragraph. The author includes this as the final paragraph because it embodies hope. As Saeng states, “then I will take that test again,” one can sense her optimism. Additionally, the author aims to convey that there is still order and stability in a changing world, and one can find solace in the simple things. Saeng remarks, “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” which demonstrates that there are reliable elements that can provide security when one feels none. The author employs this last paragraph to counterbalance the sense of despair in the story, emphasize the necessity of hope, and illustrate that there are always things that can instill hope and security.
1237	10102	4	1	The author concludes the story with the given paragraph as the author desires to bring the narrative to a close. Moreover, at the end of the paragraph, the protagonist is visualizing and exerting her efforts towards the hibiscus. Consequently, her thoughts are directed towards the plant. The author sought additional evidence to enrich the story. For instance, when it is stated, “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it encompasses the winter period for the plant. Also, during the transition from winter to spring, the plant rejuvenates, and the character Saeng will revisit it, symbolizing a return to a familiar and comforting aspect of her life.
1238	10103	4	1	The author crafted the text in a manner that initially gave the impression of disliking the subject, yet in reality, he harbored a profound affection for flowers and relished working in the garden with the people. His mother, an amiable presence, encouraged his engagement. He derived joy from witnessing the revival of life in the place, as the individuals and the environment thrived, indicating that they held a deep fondness for the location. This portrayal by the author underscores the positive impact of the setting and the relationships within it, highlighting the theme of renewal and connection.
1239	10104	4	1	The author incorporates this passage at the end to demonstrate the protagonist's profound affection for the plant and how it evokes memories of her childhood. An instance of her adoration for the plant is described as “that rich scent” (Paragraph Minfong Ho). Another example, “It felt smooth and cool” (paragraph Minfong Ho), further emphasizes her tactile connection to the plant. Regarding the link to her childhood, she realizes that certain memories, which she had unconsciously forgotten, resurface upon her encounter with the plant. As she revisits these memories, it becomes evident that the plant serves as a powerful trigger for her past experiences. For these reasons, it is apparent why the author includes this passage at the end, as it ties together the themes of nostalgia, affection, and the significance of the plant in the protagonist's life.
1240	10105	4	1	I surmise that the author left this as the last passage for the reader to encounter, intending it to serve as a poignant message. In the story, the young girl has relocated to an entirely novel environment and culture. The sole familiar element in this new landscape is a wild - growing flower from her former home. Her silent vow to herself serves as a powerful exhortation to persevere and not yield to adversity. By remaining open - minded to new experiences, one may discover unforeseen opportunities for growth and learning. This girl refused to succumb to despair. Her plant symbolizes a fresh start. Just as the plant undergoes a cycle of renewal, she resolves to embark on a new chapter in her life. It can also be seen as a microcosm of her entire life journey. In the text, it alludes to this new beginning, suggesting that just as nature renews itself, so too can she embrace change and forge ahead with hope and determination.
1241	10106	4	1	I surmise that the author penned that passage because perhaps that is how she perceives herself. In winter, she can truly reveal her authentic self to others. However, when spring arrives, she resembles a flower that has withered throughout the winter.
1242	10107	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as in the preceding paragraph, they were discussing the “winter hibiscus” and the geese. Thus, the author simply composes another concluding paragraph that neatly wraps up the story, leaving the reader with a sense of contentment.
1243	10108	4	1	In the story “The Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, it delineates the challenges Saeng encountered upon migrating to a foreign country. In this tale, Saeng failed her driving test as she was reminded of her homeland by some tropical flowers. Moreover, at the story's conclusion, the author writes, referring to the geese, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it's the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This segment of the story is highly significant as it scrutinizes her growth and hope for transformation, just as the geese will return and the hibiscus will metamorphose into a beautiful blossomed flower. Furthermore, it elucidates that she will not capitulate and that she will adapt to the environment, much like the plant has and the geese return to the altered surroundings. That part of the story is crucial for the reader as it encapsulates Saeng's thoughts and hopes for the future while acclimating to her new environment.
1244	10109	4	1	The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for numerous reasons. I believe the author intended to offer an intriguing fact regarding what befalls hibiscus when it snows. For instance, the author elaborates on how the hibiscus grows and the elements requisite for its growth, such as sunlight, water, soil, and waste management. Perhaps the author deemed that explaining how the process recommences when it snows would be fitting.
1245	10110	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph since Saeng declared that she failed the test and vowed to retake it when spring returns. The last paragraph states, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” Nevertheless, she does not specify which test she is supposed to take.
1246	10111	4	1	The rationale behind her assertion that she will defer retaking the test until spring is to ascertain whether her preference for bitter melon over the Big - Mac persists.
1247	10112	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it pertains to the idea of retaking the test. What she implies is that she will be compelled to repeat the same actions in the subsequent year. She must adapt to life, much like the hibiscus did. She also advocates for giving her best, as living to one's fullest potential is the essence of everything in the world. Hence, it serves as an excellent conclusion for the story.
1248	10113	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story in such a manner because it presents an open - ended conclusion. Moreover, it indicates that there is potential for further development of the story.
1249	10114	4	1	The author concludes that during spring, when the snow melts and the flowers bloom, it evokes the essence of springtime at home. This induces a sense of relaxation in her. Additionally, spring is a more enchanting time as all the flowers are in bloom, and a particular flower reminds her of the blessings of home.
1250	10115	4	1	Saeng made a silent vow to herself that in spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. Saeng intends to postpone taking the test until she is confident of passing it to obtain her license. Saeng desires her license so that she can drive to any destination of her choosing. Thus, she will no longer have to rely on her mother to take her everywhere; she can transport herself independently. However, she must wait until the snow has melted before retaking the test.
1251	10116	4	1	The excerpt demonstrates that Saeng harbors profound sentiments towards her plants. She delights in plants and relishes devoting time to their company. In the final paragraph, she conveys her eagerness for winter's departure so that her plants will begin to bud, allowing her to savor their presence.
1252	10117	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it effectively integrates all elements. It is posited that the author also employs it to imply that in spring, she will succeed in the test. The passage where she states ""In the spring, when the snows melt"" is particularly appealing. This is because it elucidates her desires and her determination to achieve them."
1253	10118	4	1	"The author most probably utilizes this paragraph to illustrate her establishment of a goal for the cycle to recommence. She employs geese as a symbol of spring, the time when she would initiate preparations for this ""test"" anew. The budding hibiscus in this paragraph symbolizes hope, as it represents not only the onset of a new cycle but also an object evoking memories within the story. In summary, this concluding paragraph deploys several symbols and literary devices to convey hope, pleasant recollections, and a fresh beginning."
1254	10119	4	1	She would cultivate some flowers and await the return of the geese to her pond.
1255	10120	4	1	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for multiple reasons. One reason is that the author intended to truly elucidate the significance of the flower. Another reason is to convey the theme. For instance, at the end of that paragraph, it states ""Then I will take that test again,"" which links the minor topic of the driving test to the broader topic of the flower. This, in turn, relates it to the theme of adapting and persevering until one adjusts. That final paragraph was quite essential to the theme and meaning of the story."
1256	10121	4	1	"I am convinced that the author concludes the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" penned by Minfong Ho, with the line ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because she endeavors to illustrate how past recollections can be transmuted into hope and resolve. After failing her driving examination, Saeng discovers the hibiscus, and the memories of her homeland and her grandmother engulf her. She purchases the plant and places it in the vegetable garden. Once she finishes planting, Saeng observes a flock of Canada geese soaring overhead. By applying her remembrance of her former home and her family to her new environment, Saeng pledges to retake the test, to make another attempt. The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng will not abandon her efforts."
1257	10122	4	1	"The author concludes the story to illustrate how Saeng is prepared to embrace her new life. Once the geese and the hibiscus reappear, she senses a feeling of being at home. It is when she experiences a greater sense of home that she will be ready to retake the test. The text states ""when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Evidently, the geese and the hibiscus evoke memories of her home. Once she feels at home, she will feel at peace. This is the reason why the author concluded the story with this passage."
1258	10123	4	1	The reason the author concluded the story with this paragraph is that it restates the central theme of the narrative, enabling readers to comprehend the essence of the story. This is precisely why the author chose to conclude the story with that particular paragraph, effectively wrapping up the narrative and leaving the readers with a clear understanding of its core message.
1259	10124	4	1	The author elucidates that she has failed the test. During the winter season, when the hibiscus is still striving to regrow its exquisite petals, she informs her mother that she will not retake the test until the hibiscus begins to bud and spring returns. This decision reflects her association of the hibiscus's growth with a new beginning and a sign of readiness to face the test once more.
1260	10125	4	1	Indeed, I firmly believe that this effectively concludes the story. After all the events in the narrative and the knowledge she has acquired about gardening from her mother, she recalls what her mother had said regarding the hibiscus and its budding. The significance of the ending sentence is that when spring arrives, she intends to retake the test. This test will ascertain whether she has gleaned sufficient knowledge about gardening from her mother over the past period, thus bringing a fitting close to the story's arc.
1261	10126	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph, presumably because her grandmother passed away during the geese's flight. Alternatively, it was the time when the flowers began to blossom.
1262	10127	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” incorporated the final paragraph to convey to readers that she would be progressing forward while still cherishing memories of her native country. Prior to discovering the flower, the author deeply yearned for her homeland. “It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng murmured. “I mean not like the kind we had at—at…” She found herself too tremulous to utter the words “at home,” and eventually broke into sobs again. She longed for her home in the other country and struggled to overcome this sentiment. The author was yet unable to accept her new country as her home. For Saeng, the hibiscus flower rekindled memories of her old country, rendering it even more arduous to move on. “One of the blossoms had fallen off, and Saeng delicately picked it up and inhaled its fragrance. Saeng could almost sense the fine strands of her grandmother’s freshly washed long gray hair as she combed it with the fine - toothed buffalo - horn comb.” The flower was an overwhelming reminder of the past. She finally possessed something from home that she could hold. “Gently, she closed her palm around it and clasped it tightly. That, at least, she could cling to.” The author now had a tangible object to remind her of home. This was the initial step towards finally moving on. Now Saeng required some time to acclimate to her new country. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things she had previously regarded as peculiar had now become nearly familiar to her.” Saeng needed just a bit more time, akin to a period of hibernation. She determined that once the hibiscus emerged from hibernation and was ready to bloom, she would be prepared to accept her new country and move forward. Saeng decided that the interval between fall and spring would be sufficient to adjust to her new life. By taking this step, Saeng would be moving on. The author included this final paragraph so that readers could infer that Saeng would take the last steps towards accepting her new country and moving on by taking this step, although she would reflect on her old country through the winter hibiscus.
1263	10128	4	1	The story incorporates this paragraph because at the very commencement of the narrative, the girl failed the test. Consequently, when she informed her mother, she noticed her mother's disappointment. After they planted the plant, she resolved to retake the test, aware that her mother would have high expectations. Additionally, it is included because the story commenced with her telling her mother about her test failure. If this part were omitted, readers might wonder why her mother allowed her to fail without taking any action. Moreover, when readers learn that the girl failed the test, they will be eager to know if she retakes it and the reasons behind her decision if she does.
1264	10129	4	1	The author concluded the story with an open - ended finale. By this, it is meant that the author crafted the narrative in such a way as to maintain readers' intrigue, enticing them to explore his other literary works. Furthermore, an ending of this nature provides scope for potential improvement and paves the way for a sequel.
1265	10130	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng will persevere until she successfully accomplishes the task assigned by her mother. Saeng fails the test because, although she purchases a beautiful plant, it is exorbitantly priced. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much!” Saeng becomes extremely distraught and realizes that she has let her mother down. Nevertheless, Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. “Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug a hole and carefully lowered the ‘winter hibiscus’ into it.” This indicates that despite her failure, she is not going to abandon the hibiscus as it symbolizes her home and holds great significance for her.
1266	10131	4	1	The author concludes the paragraph as she wishes to...
1267	10132	4	1	I surmise that the author concluded the narrative with this paragraph as it demonstrates that the character within the story is commencing to acclimate to her new nation. At the onset of the story, the character, “Saeng,” is experiencing nostalgia and has yet to adapt to her new country. She is en route home from her driver's examination, which she has just failed, and during the journey, she spots a hibiscus in a floral shop. The hibiscus holds significance for her as it evokes memories of her native country, Vietnam. For Saeng, the hibiscus symbolizes solace in times of disappointment, a connection to her past experiences, and the capacity to surmount obstacles. Saeng has not adjusted to this alteration in her life, and it has had a detrimental impact on her. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he intended to convey to the reader that there will always be changes and impediments in one's life, but there will always be something or someone to assist in overcoming them. The author illustrates this by concluding the story with this paragraph and revealing to the reader that Saeng regarded the hibiscus as her means of overcoming adversity, and when she is prepared and has adapted, she will retake her driving test.
1268	10133	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as he posits that once winter and spring have elapsed and the hibiscus is in bud, then one will commence anew and attempt again. The author implies that Saeng is eager for spring so that she can cultivate her own petite garden. This is the rationale behind my belief that the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
1269	10134	4	1	"This paragraph depicts an action that Saeng is slated to undertake over the course of a year. She is going to develop and transform in anticipation of retaking the test; it is, in a sense, a rebirth. The girl desires to become an entirely new individual by the time the test recurs. Her mother appears to be perturbed by every action or decision of her daughter's. The daughter suddenly comprehends the significance of the hibiscus and the reason for its demise. ""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season."" She associates the flower and the geese with herself. Throughout the year, the flower undergoes stages of withering and then rebirth. Saeng aspires to improve after undergoing a phase similar to that of the flower. It blossoms anew to reveal its beauty."
1270	10135	4	1	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that when she returned from taking the driver's test on her way home, she beheld a winter hibiscus of extraordinary beauty. Subsequently, she went to the store and purchased the flower, which incurred a substantial expense. When she arrived home, her mother was planting vegetables and inquired about the flower. She told the truth, and upon learning of the high cost, her mother became irate at her extravagance. How could she do such a thing? Saeng made a momentous decision to acquire the flower despite her mother's anger. I presume she loves the flower because it reminds her of Vietnam. I believe the author included this paragraph because when the geese return and the flower flourishes, she will retake the test. When she bought the flower, it had not yet bloomed, so when it does, she will attempt the test again. In my opinion, this is an excellent conclusion and also poses a thought - provoking question.
1271	10136	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the statement “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,” as it provides the reader with a conclusive ending. This passage implies that Saeng will attempt her driver's test once more after she has acclimated to her new life in a foreign country. Once she can establish a sense of familiarity in her surroundings, she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her estrangement from Vietnam renders her feeling isolated. The hibiscus plant initially offers her a sense of solace, as described by “It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel.” The concluding paragraph indicates that Saeng will discover greater comfort in @LOCATION2 than merely a plant and a few geese.
1272	10137	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when “the snow does melt and the geese return,” it will be the opportune time to engage more extensively in gardening. As long as the ground is covered with snow, planting is not feasible. However, the return of the geese signals the appropriate season to sow seeds and cultivate a more bountiful harvest. The test serves to determine whether she can achieve a superior grade compared to previous years, including the year before that.
1273	10138	4	1	The author concluded his story with that paragraph because that is the appropriate way to bring it to a close, which is precisely why he chose to end it in such a manner.
1274	10139	4	1	The author concludes the story with “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is done to illustrate that Saeng is adapting to her new country and making decisions, much like she did in her homeland. In Vietnam, Saeng used to groom her grandmother's hair, fashion it into a bun, and adorn it with a hibiscus. This was one of her cherished traditions. Additionally, when she fetched water from the well, a hibiscus would occasionally surface with the bucket. Consequently, the hibiscus was regarded as a source of comfort. Now, in the United States, she endeavors to make good use of it while also considering the seasonal patterns in this new land. She observes that the geese return in the spring and depart in the winter, and plants commence growing in the spring. By retaking the test in the spring, it symbolizes her readiness to embark on new challenges, similar to the hibiscus on the verge of blooming. The potted plant in her garden and Saeng's relocation both signify change, yet they also serve as a reminder of old traditions and create space for new ones.
1275	10140	4	1	The author incorporated that sentence into the story because she believes it will afford her sufficient time to successfully pass the test, and she has an affinity for geese.
1276	10141	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate the ultimate determination and fortitude bestowed upon Saeng. It is as if this plant has served as the catalyst for her to rise again and surmount the test. The plant transforms into a comforting memento that evokes memories of her homeland. She returned with the plant to present it to her mother yet found herself too tremulous to utter the words “at home”. This poignantly illustrates her profound longing for home. Nevertheless, she is capable of recognizing that this is her new abode and that everything is gradually becoming more familiar to her.
1277	10142	4	1	She concludes it with this sentence as it serves as an emblem of new life. Just as the winter, which decimated the plants and terminated life, gives way to spring, which heralds a fresh beginning. This mirrors Saeng's sentiment as she left her country, leaving all her memories behind, and feels adrift, akin to the winter hibiscus. However, as spring arrives, she will emerge as a rejuvenated individual, prepared and equipped to confront challenges, as she stated here, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now”. She portrays that with a new season comes novel changes, and in the wake of those changes, she will proceed to retake the driver's test.
1278	10143	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, it serves to illustrate that although she has encountered failure this time, numerous opportunities await her in the future. Additionally, it demonstrates that despite the adversity she currently faces, auspicious times are yet to come. For these reasons, it was a potent and effective means of concluding the narrative.
1279	10144	4	1	The author employs symbolism to convey a distinct message. Saeng declared that in the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake that test. The author utilizes the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng's maturation, much like the hibiscus, indicating that she will then be prepared to retake the test. The author's use of symbolism enriches the narrative and conveys a deeper meaning.
1280	10146	4	1	She penned that response to inform everyone that she will be prepared by the time spring arrives. Subsequently, she will undertake the test and achieve success.
1281	10147	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as Saeng desires to recommence planting. I am aware of this because Saeng's life revolves around planting and @CAPS1. Saeng and her mother procure their sustenance from their crops. Thus, throughout @DATE1, they predominantly spend their time in the garden, cultivating crops for sale and preservation. They save provisions for winter and sell produce to acquire the equipment necessary to continue their endeavors. The part in the paragraph where she mentions “when they come back” pertains to the geese. She adores the sight of geese soaring overhead and alighting in the yard on a splendid day @CAPS1. When the snow thaws, she yearns to immerse herself in the soil, hands and knees on the ground, to initiate planting anew. Once the hibiscus begins to bud, all other flora commence their growth. Saeng's life is centered around @DATE1 planting. The author included this paragraph in the story as this is what Saeng wishes to pursue above all else.
1282	10148	4	1	In the denouement of “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng remarks that she will retake her driving examination in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return. Spring is the season when these occurrences coincide with the annual budding of the winter hibiscus. Her family relocated from Vietnam to @LOCATION2, and she purchased a winter hibiscus plant to evoke memories of her childhood. When it blossoms, she will retake her driving test because it will instill in her the hope of a fresh start in her life as a citizen of @LOCATION2.
1283	10149	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” a young girl named Saeng departs from her home. This short narrative portrays the girl's struggle to acclimate to a new lifestyle and the associated changes.
1284	10150	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to enable the reader to recognize that Saeng will not desist until she passes her driver's test, much like the geese will not halt their migration until they reach the south for winter. The author endeavors to illustrate the allure of perseverance and the process of surmounting obstacles to attain one's objective.
1285	10151	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the tale with a potent ending. The ending reads, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will try the test again.” Essentially, the author concluded the story with this because it demonstrates her strength, her willingness to persevere and fortify herself, her determination to try again, and her aspiration to aid herself. Textual evidence to support this includes “then I will take the hibiscus test again,” “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become...,” and “There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply.” All these statements substantiate why the author might conclude with such a powerful paragraph.
1286	10152	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with the paragraph to illustrate the frequency with which Saeng is assailed by her memories. Earlier in the tale, when Saeng was in a florist's shop, she was ""tested."" Memories inundated her like a deluge, and she attempted to recapture the feelings she had long ago when her grandmother was present. However, she realized that the elements of her memories had long since vanished, prompting her to weep. Saeng informed her mother that she had failed the test and purchased the plant in an effort to console herself. Her mother demonstrated great understanding and accepted the situation. Saeng planted the hibiscus and at the end states, ""In the spring when the snow melts, if this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Saeng is aware that seeing the flower once more will evoke tears, resurface her memories, and subject her to another test."
1287	10154	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" penned by @CAPS1 Ho, a young girl named Saeng failed her driver's test on that particular day. Subsequently, she vowed that she would retake the test come spring. She concludes with this statement to signify that it is a novel season and a fresh start for her as she embarks on her new life. The archetype of the transition from the harsh, frigid winter to the pleasant, balmy springtime suggests that the difficulties faced by Saeng and her mother will ameliorate. Just as the arduous winter gives way, so does a tranquil and warm new beginning in spring. Saeng comprehends this and is confident that she will pass the test."
1288	10155	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a multitude of reasons. For instance, the entire passage expounds on how the hibiscus flower endows Saeng with the capacity to surmount obstacles and offers solace during a period of disappointment. This concluding paragraph indicates that ""in the spring, when the hibiscus is in bud,"" and everything is resplendent once again, Saeng will undertake her test anew. She is cognizant that with the assistance of the hibiscus plant, she will succeed in the test. It demonstrates that her hope and faith in passing the test stem from the hibiscus flower. The plant, characterized by ""waxy leaves and delicate flowers with purplish petals and white centers,"" will furnish her with the fortitude, resolve, courage, and willpower to succeed in the test come spring."
1289	10156	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the statement, ""...then I'll take the test again."" This reveals that Saeng is prepared to endeavor to acclimate to the new locale in which she resides. This is what she alludes to when she utters the word ""test."" For example, in the story, when her mother inquired about what was amiss, she said, ""I - I failed the test."" She expended a substantial amount of money on that plant in the hope of retreating into her own world. She simply could not cope with the situation. She concludes with an optimistic statement as it conveys the message that she anticipates a promising future in her new abode."
1290	10157	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative with that paragraph for numerous reasons. She incorporates examples from the story to facilitate the discovery of these reasons. One reason is that it is evident that she will not abandon her efforts. In the story, she declares, ""Then I will take the test again."" This conveys that she will persevere and is resolute in her determination. Another reason is that she endeavors to convey that there is a future for the hibiscus. This is evident when she states, ""...and this hibiscus is budding,"" suggesting that the hibiscus has the opportunity to adapt and become accustomed to its surroundings, much like the girl in the story. The final reason is that it indicates that she is and will continue to do her utmost. When she says, ""she realized that many of the things that she had thought were strange... almost familiar to her now,"" she is attempting to adapt to her surroundings and now realizes that she can. In the story, there are numerous reasons to speculate as to why she ended the story with that paragraph. She provides examples within the story that enable many readers to glean multiple insights."
1291	10158	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative resolutely determined to surmount the test subsequent to the winter's end and the flower's budding. This demonstrates the correlation between the plant and the narrator, as well as the adversities each endures. The winter symbolizes an impediment for the flower, yet it will persevere to flourish in the spring. This instills in the author the confidence that she, too, can overcome her hardships to thrive. Another challenge that she and the hibiscus both encounter is being ""root - bound."" The author deeply yearns for her homeland of Vietnam. Nevertheless, both of them must and will acclimate to their new surroundings."
1292	10159	4	1	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph as it reveals her longing for her homeland, which had an impact on her driving test. In her native country, the climate was warm, and it was replete with cherished family memories. In the new country, it is cold and snowy, an environment to which she is unaccustomed. The text indicates that she will retake the test when all those circumstances transpire because it will evoke the feeling of her home country, enabling her to be more focused on the test rather than on her nostalgic yearnings.
1293	10160	4	1	"Author Minfong Ho concluded the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that specific paragraph to illustrate that Saeng would not capitulate, that she was resolute in passing the driving test and, in a sense, acclimating to her new abode. It serves as a form of inspiration, as evidenced by the quote, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The flower acts as the source of motivation, evoking pleasant recollections of people that brought her joy and instilled self - belief. Minfong also concluded the story in this manner to convey that by the following year, Saeng will embark on a fresh start. She will find contentment in her new life and refrain from dwelling on her past. Saeng states, ""... in the spring..."", signifying the commencement of a new year, a time for renewal and celebration. This was an exemplary way to conclude the story as it imparts a positive aura. It informs the readers that Saeng is a resilient individual who can recall the past while progressing towards a new day and life. The author aims to emphasize that everyone should possess the fortitude to do the same."
1294	10161	4	1	"She concluded the story with that paragraph to demonstrate that despite her profound nostalgia for the ""old century,"" she will adapt and persevere. This shows her inner strength and determination to overcome the emotional challenges of leaving behind her past and embracing the new. By ending the story in this way, she sends a powerful message of hope and resilience, suggesting that no matter how difficult the transition, one can find a way to thrive in a new environment."
1295	10162	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it exudes an air of hopefulness. She was struggling to adapt to her new home, which left her feeling despondent. Saeng's failure in the driving test only exacerbated her distress. To alleviate her situation, she purchased a hibiscus that invoked memories of her former home. She found the plant to be a great source of solace, aiding her in weathering the arduous times. In the final paragraph, Saeng anticipates the arrival of spring so that she can retake the test and, hopefully, achieve success this time. I believe that the paragraph imparts a sense of optimism, which is precisely why the author chose to conclude the story in this manner.
1296	10163	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will not capitulate and that hope still persists. It also serves to instruct the reader to possess hope and patience, along with the understanding that the fruition of things requires time. Saeng faltered in the test of resisting the sorrow and misery of yearning for her homeland. She remarks, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had once regarded as peculiar had, through the unobtrusive recurrence of season after season, become nearly familiar to her now.” This indicates that she is adapting. Thus, by concluding the story with this and drawing a comparison to the geese, it demonstrates that she is growing stronger. She will retake the test because she will not yield.
1297	10164	4	1	Evidently, from perusing the story “Winter @CAPS1,” the author incorporates this phrase “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” in the narrative as the passage is relevant to the title of the story “Winter @CAPS1.”
1298	10165	4	1	The rationale behind the author concluding the story with that paragraph is that, despite Saeng's subpar performance on her previous test, she will return to take it once more to achieve a passing grade. The author is highlighting Saeng's resolve to pass the test and perform better in the subsequent attempt.
1299	10166	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with that paragraph as it links the plant, which symbolizes numerous positive attributes, to the character who failed the test that she ardently desired to pass. Both the character and the plant exemplify perseverance, and I believe the author intends to convey a message to the reader to never abandon one's pursuit of a goal. The plant serves as an emblem of perseverance as it endures the harsh winter. The protagonist is not relinquishing her aspiration to pass the test. The author is imparting a message of unwavering determination.
1300	10167	4	1	At the conclusion of the story, the author states, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again.” The author reaches this conclusion at the end because she felt that she did not exert her utmost effort as she failed. Hence, when spring arrives anew, she will make another attempt, and hopefully, this time, she will succeed.
1301	10168	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she intends to return and conduct a smell test once more when the snow thaws and the geese reappear.
1302	10169	4	1	The @ORGANIZATION1 revolves around a young girl named Saeng, a teenager whose family has recently relocated to the United States from Vietnam. Saeng failed her driving examination and, during her walk home, chanced upon a magnificent plant called Hibiscus, with which she instantly fell smitten. Saeng's mother maintains a garden, constantly engaged in planting and utilizing the plants and vegetables from it for dinner. The author concludes a paragraph stating that when the Hibiscus plants begin to bud in spring, Saeng will retake the test. It is surmised that Saeng makes this declaration as she desires to behold the exquisite plants upon passing the test and believes that the sight of the Hibiscus will aid her in succeeding in the driving test.
1303	10170	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph as she is instilling hope within herself regarding passing the test. The hibiscus will have commenced sprouting, and it will endow her with the fortitude to retake the test and, hopefully, emerge victorious, all because the winter hibiscus evoked memories of her homeland.
1304	10171	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph stating, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This is because this paragraph can illustrate that the hibiscus serves as the impetus for Saeng to attempt the test anew. If the hibiscus is in bloom after the snow melts and the geese return, then she can emulate the hibiscus's resilience and persevere in her test."
1305	10172	4	1	"The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate that Saeng will not capitulate. It is feasible to adapt and endeavor to cherish one's surroundings. Saeng struggled to utter, ""I - I failed the test"" and was unable to say ""at home,"" which reveals her insecurity and solitude in the new world around her. By proclaiming that she will try again in the spring, it offers the reader hope that she will adapt and grow fond of her environment. She has experienced a juxtaposition of her former life with the one she currently leads, and since she will make another attempt in the spring, it indicates that she has resolved to give this new place an opportunity."
1306	10173	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she utters, “Then I will take that test again.” She has faith in the Flowers. Both she and the Flowers adapt to their circumstances. They are both resolute to succeed in challenging places. They both surmount obstacles. Perhaps she wishes to discover what lies ahead. She hopes she is correct about the Flowers; maybe, she has an affinity for spring.
1307	10174	4	1	In actuality, I appreciate the manner in which the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It essentially encapsulates the story, condensing it into a few words that pique one's curiosity about what transpired next and whether a sequel exists. This is an excellent story to which I can personally relate in numerous ways.
1308	10175	4	1	The rationale behind the author concluding this type of scenario is that the author has a hardship to overcome or a situation to navigate. In this particular instance, you understand the author's son. However, if you discern the truth, you will open your eyes and realize that it is your time to excel. You might as well seize the opportunity before you forfeit it, as you only have one day to prove your worth to others.
1309	10176	4	1	The author concludes with this sentence as he is demonstrating the girl's self - confidence. It also allows her sufficient time to prepare for the subsequent test. Moreover, she is aware that she will be ready when her flower begins to bud.
1310	10177	4	1	Why did the author conclude the story with this paragraph? It is so that he can write another story. He has vowed silently and will pen the story in the spring when they return.
1311	10178	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she posits that if it is feasible for these events to occur, then she ought to be capable of taking the test and achieving a passing grade. She was juxtaposing elements that she was aware do not align. For instance, she stated that in spring, when the snow dissipates and the geese return, and this hibiscus commences budding, then she would retake the test. Her implication was that if the thing she holds dearest surmounts its impediment, then she would undertake what pained her most all over again. She is uncertain whether, if she retakes the test, she will persevere until she passes. In the story, she struggles to assimilate. All she is acquainted with is what she learned in her native country. All she needs to do is exert greater effort, and perhaps she will be able to pass this test.
1312	10179	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when she informed her mother of her test failure, she was in tears. However, I believe the underlying cause ran deeper. I opine that her profound longing for home rendered her unable to focus. She needed to cry about something to conceal from her mother her intense homesickness. This emotional turmoil was the driving force behind the author's choice of conclusion, highlighting the character's internal struggle and the impact of homesickness on her well - being.
1313	10180	4	1	Upon their return, Saeng made a silent vow to herself. In the spring, when the snowbanks recede and the geese make their return migration, and this hibiscus begins to sprout buds, then she resolved to retake that test. The author concludes the story at this juncture as, seemingly impervious to the cold, her mother remained in the vegetable garden, using a rusty trowel to unearth the last of the onions. This scene not only sets a poignant backdrop but also reflects the characters' perseverance and the passage of time, with hope for a new beginning symbolized by Saeng's vow.
1314	10181	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it demonstrates that the hibiscus serves as a source of inspiration and solace that no human could replicate. For example, after Saeng failed her driver's test, she was disheartened. On her way home, she spotted a hibiscus and visited a florist shop in an attempt to purchase it. Saeng plucked a petal from the plant and clutched it firmly as she closed her eyes. The plant evoked memories of her true home in Vietnam, which she held dear. The hibiscus transformed into a form of comfort for Saeng, especially after her driver's test setback, despite it not being identical to the ones at home. By ending the story with Saeng declaring that she will await the hibiscus to start budding before retaking the test, it illustrates that the hibiscus empowers her to overcome life's obstacles and endures through the hardships she encounters.
1315	10182	4	1	What Saeng intends at the end of the paragraph is that when it is the appropriate season for those plants, she will retake the test. This test is designed to assess her affinity for the plot, including its features, characters, and the historical background of these plants. This connection between the seasonal cycle of the plants and her readiness to face the test shows a symbolic relationship between nature and her personal growth, suggesting that she is waiting for the right time to engage and potentially develop a deeper appreciation for the subject matter.
1316	10183	4	1	She is insisting on not retaking the test if the winter hibiscus fails to reappear. She was distraught over her test failure. She spent the majority of her day observing the hibiscus, yet she remained disheartened as they were not the genuine ones from her home. Her mother asserted that they were robust enough to endure the winter. When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese return and this hibiscus begins to bud, then she will retake that test.
1317	10184	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it symbolizes the optimism that circumstances will improve. The author ends on a hopeful note because the flower represents the girl, and the girl's statement that if the flower can survive the year, so can she. This symbolizes hope as the girl realizes that it will take time for her to acclimate to her new country, but ultimately, she will. This is significant as the girl deems the day she had as dreadful, and this statement concludes the day positively. The girl spends the entire day yearning to be back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends. However, this paragraph is the girl making a silent vow to herself that she will persevere through the winter until spring, and things will get better when she can retake the test. The entire story culminates in this turning point when Saeng realizes that she will overcome this struggle, just as the flower will endure the winter. Saeng understands that it will take time for her to adapt to this novel and unfamiliar country and the new lifestyle she must embrace.
1318	10185	4	1	The author concludes this narrative with this sentence as it conveys hope for the future. This sentence informs readers that although the present is arduous, over time, circumstances will improve. Saeng may have failed this test, yet she does not relinquish hope of passing it. She believes she will pass that test in spring, when the opportune moment arrives. Saeng may miss her homeland, but she will not allow that to impede her future. This is why the author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
1319	10186	4	1	What the author alludes to is that the snow is thawing, and spring is approaching. Presumably, what is meant is that flowers, trees, and grass are regaining their splendor. Additionally, the author is indicating that spring has arrived, and winter has ended. This is why she commences planting in winter so that in spring, the plants can grow into something lovely and attractive. This is what I surmise the author intended. Moreover, this is the rationale for including it in the paragraph. The author should have augmented the paragraph by describing how beautifully the plants and such were growing. He should have added more details to clarify what was being discussed in this paragraph.
1320	10187	4	1	The author opted to conclude the story in this manner as it effectively integrates diverse elements and tenets of the narrative. For instance, this sentence incorporates both the geese and the hibiscus, symbolizing her new and old homes in harmonious coexistence. It also states that “... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,” which parallels the tenacity of the hibiscus flower, which persistently endures the winter. A wealth of wisdom can be gleaned from the symbolic messages concealed within that final sentence. It implies that although the past may be behind you, it remains in your heart as you confront new challenges, and if you are resolute, those challenges can be surmounted.
1321	10188	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it showcases Saeng's steadfast determination and her ability to surmount the challenges of being new in a country. Despite all the doubts Saeng harbored immediately after her test, it is truly commendable of her to reach the conclusion of retaking the test. ""Here, let me help you, mother,"" she offered (HO). With her mother comforting her and assuring her that it is fine, Saeng receives the impetus she requires to assist her mother and realizes that she cannot allow a single setback to impede her progress in life. Given the support Saeng has, she will undoubtedly pass the test the next time."
1322	10189	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author Minfong Ho concludes with the statement, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She ends the story in this manner to demonstrate her resolve to excel in her new country and to illustrate that the memories of her grandmother inspire her to strive for the best in her new home. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is at a flower shop and observes all the flowers of her homeland growing in pots. The sight of these flowers triggers a flood of memories within her, memories that evoke both joy and sorrow. Subsequently, when she returns home, she informs her mother that she failed the test. One can discern from her actions that she is disheartened. ""I - I failed the test,"" Saeng did not dare to meet her mother's gaze and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to pieces. After some time, she planted the flower in the vegetable garden. The act of purchasing and planting the flower indicates that Saeng wishes to preserve the memory of her grandmother and her homeland. Reflecting on her grandmother aids her in adapting to a better life and fuels her desire to succeed in her new abode. The memories of her grandmother bring both sadness and a sense of happiness."
1323	10190	4	1	The author concludes the story by employing a quote suggesting that the protagonist will have another attempt at something. Numerous authors opt to end their stories in an unconventional manner as it piques the reader's interest, enticing them to explore a sequel or the subsequent installment, thereby adding an element of surprise to the conclusion. Another rationale for such an ending is that the author intends to stimulate the reader's imagination, prompting them to envision the subsequent events. This approach is effective as it provides the reader with a clear understanding of what has transpired while leaving them speculating about whether the character will fail or succeed in the next instance.
1324	10191	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng is resolute in making another attempt. Although it may not occur immediately, Saeng desires to revisit the flowers that remind her of home without succumbing to emotional distress. She can sense that despite her mother's understanding nature, she has somewhat disappointed her. ""But how could you? You know how much we—what happened?"" When her mother utters these words, Saeng feels that she has let her down. However, Mrs. Panouvong later expresses her relief that Saeng has experienced this setback. Sensing her mother's subtle disappointment, Saeng is motivated to try again."
1325	10192	4	1	Presumably, the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to portray Saeng as an extremely determined individual. The author aims to convey to the readers that Saeng is a resilient character, as throughout the story, she exhibits unwavering determination to pass the test on her first attempt. However, when she fails, the author intends to demonstrate that Saeng will not abandon hope and is committed to retaking the test.
1326	10193	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to offer readers a perspective on her statements and enable them to comprehend her circumstances during her upbringing. For instance, she mentioned that.
1327	10194	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" as the author is making a point regarding immigration. The point the author is conveying is that when immigrants arrived in @CAPS1, they were instructed to forget their origins. In the story, the word ""test"" signifies adapting to @LOCATION1 and forsaking her homeland. Saeng utters those words because she failed the test and purchased something that reminded her of her native land. In conclusion, the author is depicting how immigrants were treated and compelled to forget their identities as they are now in @LOCATION1."
1328	10195	4	1	"In the story ""Winter @CAPS1,"" the author endeavors to convey that Saeng hails from a place other than where she currently resides. The text states, ""It was like walking into another world,"" suggesting that she is there, feeling as though no one knows her except herself."
1329	10196	4	1	The author concludes this story with that paragraph as it exhibits signs of hope and the assurance that spring will return. For the family, it implies that everything will be well. Additionally, the girl will forge friendships when spring arrives.
1330	10197	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng attempted her driver's test but was unsuccessful. She intends to retake it in the spring. I surmise she concludes the story by stating this because in the spring, the hibiscus plant she and her mother planted will be flourishing and in bloom, and the geese will have returned, which will make her feel more at home. In this way, she will experience comfort and be capable of taking and passing the test, as it will evoke memories of her homeland."
1331	10198	4	1	At the conclusion of the story, it is stated that she will retake the test in spring, when the geese return from their winter migration. What this implies is that she will commence anew in spring, when the geese come back. Thus, she will embark on a completely fresh start to a new year, with a new opportunity to prepare for the significant test and to regroup from the previous test that she failed. Her mother was incredulous upon learning that she had failed the test. Her mother consoled her, stating that it would be all right and that she could retake it in a new season.
1332	10199	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she contemplates what the situation will be like when all these events transpire. Saeng declared, “When they return, she silently vowed to herself, in spring, when the snow melts, the geese come back, and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake the test.” This shows that the author uses this moment to convey Saeng's hope and determination for a new attempt in a more favorable time.
1333	10200	4	1	The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to conclude on an optimistic note and to illustrate hope for the future. Initially, throughout the story, Saeng experienced solitude and despondency as she yearned for her homeland in Vietnam. Amidst this melancholy, Saeng noticed the winter hibiscus, which evoked memories of her childhood. This instilled in her a glimmer of hope for adapting to the new environment and life. The flower symbolized the light and hope for the future. Subsequently, it demonstrates the element of perseverance in the story. Saeng failed her driver's test and returned home feeling unfulfilled. When she asserts that she will retake the test in spring when the hibiscus blossoms, it showcases her perseverance and refusal to give up. Ultimately, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to conclude on a positive note and to present an optimistic outlook on life. Regardless of one's origin, with love and perseverance, any obstacle can be surmounted. Whether it pertains to school, tests, or home, with a bit of hard work and faith, success can be achieved.
1334	10201	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in spring when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will retake that test” to indicate that she will undertake this once she has acclimated to the changes in her new country. When she says, “When the geese return,” their faint honks and the sight of them flying overhead have become familiar to her with each passing season. Additionally, when the hibiscus is budding, as it will remind her of her home in Vietnam, seeing the flower and hearing the geese will endow her with the confidence and motivation to retake the driver's test. This shows that the author uses these natural signs to represent Saeng's readiness and hope for a better outcome.
1335	10202	4	1	Saeng silently vowed to herself due to her difficulty in making new friends. She has a penchant for planting things around her as she perceives plants as her companions. Saeng took the shovel and completed the planting task for her mother, which made her feel a profound sense of self - worth. This act of helping her mother and engaging with the plants not only gave her a sense of purpose but also comforted her in her otherwise lonely situation.
1336	10203	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” opted to conclude the narrative with this paragraph as it symbolizes a new dawn for Saeng. After Saeng relocates and fails the examination, the winter hibiscus soothes her from the recollections of her former abode. It offers her hope, yet in winter, it lacks the allure it possesses in spring. Spring is a season of rejuvenation, for in winter, all life seems to wane and then resurges in spring. Saeng perceives taking the test as a fresh start. Drawing from personal experience, I customarily conduct spring cleaning to initiate anew. Spring is replete with invigorating air and ignites my inspiration to perform well. This might elucidate why Saeng desires to take the test during spring. Hence, the author of “Winter Hibiscus” chose to end the story with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng's yearning for a new beginning.
1337	10204	4	1	Authors occasionally conclude a narrative with a specific paragraph depicting a future action. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage by stating, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” One rationale for the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph is to demonstrate that change will occur come spring. For instance, in the story, the girl utters, “I - I failed the test.” By admitting this and discussing her driving test failure, come spring, she can transform. She can improve and pass the test this time. Additionally, “The ‘winter hibiscus’ was in the ground now, and @CAPS1 tamped down the soil around it.” This quotation indicates that the hibiscus is being planted currently, but come spring, it will change color and blossom. In conclusion, authors conclude stories with such paragraphs to showcase potential future changes.
1338	10205	4	1	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. The “budding hibiscus” serves as a symbol of solace for her. When relocating to @LOCATION1, she could not bring all her friends and possessions, yet she could carry memories. The flower evokes recollections of her homeland, offering comfort after her failure in the driver's test. Moreover, the “geese returning” symbolizes a fresh start. After a long absence, the return of the geese ushers in spring, a time to commence anew after a dismal winter. Finally, “...then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 conveys that one should never abandon hope. Despite the challenges of adapting to a new country, she made friends and sampled @CAPS2 cuisines, such as a Big @CAPS3. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to convey comfort, new beginnings, and the spirit of perseverance.
1339	10206	4	1	The author chose to include the final paragraph to maintain the reader's engagement with the story. Another reason for its inclusion is to convey to the reader that the plant represents unwavering perseverance. By incorporating this paragraph, the author ensures that the story remains captivating and imparts a message of resilience to the audience.
1340	10207	4	1	The author concludes the story with the quote, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to convey that Saeng is inspired by the memories of her native land. For example, the story reveals that she noticed numerous resemblances between her new surroundings and her homeland as the seasons progressed. The arrival of spring evokes nostalgic memories of her home for Saeng, motivating her to retake the test. In conclusion, the author included this quote to illustrate how Saeng draws encouragement from the memories of her homeland, emphasizing the profound impact of one's roots on their motivation and determination.
1341	10208	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the protagonist pledging to retake the drivers' test, a symbolic gesture representing progress. “Saeng experienced a profound jolt of recognition, so intense that it was nearly corporeal.” While ambling towards a florist's shop, the protagonist spots a flower evoking memories of her homeland, Vietnam. “Here, allow me, mother,” she offers. By relieving her mother of the task of sowing the purchased seeds, she initiates her journey towards maturity. After ruminating on past recollections and achieving reconciliation with them, nothing impedes her forward movement. “When they return, I shall retake that test,” she resolves. As she observes geese migrating south for winter in a V - formation, she sets a personal goal, utilizing it as a catalyst for growth and advancement in her new country. The protagonist's vow in “Winter Hibiscus” symbolizes her progression forward.
1342	10209	4	1	It is evident that during this period of uncertainty, she will surmount the challenges. In the story, the plant served as a harbinger of hope, and by doing so, it instilled hope within her. Initially, all the recollected memories saddened her, yet ultimately, they bestowed upon her a glimmer of hope, reaffirming her ability to face the future with optimism.
1343	10210	4	1	I posit that the author concludes the narrative with that statement, perhaps in an attempt to convey a profound message to the readership and captivate their attention. Alternatively, the author might have ended the story with that declaration simply because they felt an inherent compulsion to do so, possibly without a specific rationale guiding their decision.
1344	10211	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with the passage “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again” as it emblematizes Saeng's capacity to surmount her grief and attempt the test anew. This is exemplified when she utters “when the geese return and the hibiscus.” Following her test failure, she was not merely contemplating a retake; instead, she yearned to return to her former home and avoid dwelling on the matter. However, much like the geese that return in spring, she asserts her intention to retake the test. She parallels the geese, as they overcome the harsh cold by migrating and return when conditions are favorable. Similarly, she must await a time when she is more prepared and confident to attempt the test again. The budding hibiscus symbolizes her fortitude and resolve to succeed on her second attempt, for just as the hibiscus endures the frigid months and blossoms in spring, she too must persevere through adversity to achieve success. Hence, the author concludes the story with this passage to illustrate that she has not relinquished hope and will retake the test, assured of passing.
1345	10212	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it demonstrates that the narrator intends to retake the test and is biding her time for a more opportune moment. It showcases her tenacity and unwavering determination not to abandon her quest to pass the test. She comes to the realization that life unfolds at a rapid pace, and thus, she recognizes the necessity to cherish every moment, using this new - found wisdom to fuel her pursuit of success in the test.
1346	10213	4	1	"The author concluded the final paragraph of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" to assert that the narrator, ""Saeng,"" has not relinquished her pursuit of passing the driving test."
1347	10214	4	1	"At the conclusion of the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's summarizing concluding paragraph encapsulates numerous aspects of the narrative. Saeng is resolute in retaking the driver's test and receptive to a fresh start. The author employed these concluding words in the paragraph to convey the hope within Saeng for a more promising beginning and to demonstrate her determination to succeed in the driver's test. The author links the objects in the story to symbolize this determination and new beginning. For instance, the hibiscus serves as a reminder of her glorious homeland, spring is the season she selects as it signifies a new start, and the returning geese illustrate her resolve to transform and improve."
1348	10215	4	1	"The author, Minfong (assuming @CAPS1 is Minfong), concludes the story with this paragraph to evoke hope among readers regarding the characters in the narrative. One of the most crucial lessons one can glean in life is to never forfeit hope, as circumstances will improve as long as one perseveres. Although Saeng was despondent over failing her driving test and yearned deeply for her homeland, by concluding the story with this paragraph, the principle that ""never giving up is essential"" is presented and optimistically embodied through the character's vow. This principle conveys the notion that individuals can surmount difficult periods in their lives regardless of the circumstances they encounter. In conclusion, hope is evoked within the reader due to the ending paragraph, which contributes to the overarching theme of the entire story; it is vital to never abandon hope, especially when life becomes arduous."
1349	10216	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it enhances the narrative's aesthetic and renders it more engaging compared to if the paragraph were placed at the start. Had the author not included this ending at the conclusion of the story, it likely would have lacked intrigue and failed to be as compelling. Additionally, the author aims to enable the reader to comprehend the story's conclusion and inception simultaneously. For example, without a satisfactory ending, no one would be inclined to read the story at all. Thus, it was prudent of the author to incorporate a well - structured and stable ending paragraph. I believe it was an exemplary paragraph for the story's conclusion. It seamlessly complemented the narrative, and I could better understand the story because of this ending paragraph. It was the ideal denouement for this tale.
1350	10217	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as he endeavors to convey to us that this plant will bring good fortune. The snow will thaw, the geese will return, and the hibiscus plant will commence budding. It represents a fresh start, a new beginning. Since she failed her driving test, she will initiate anew in the spring. In conclusion, this is the rationale behind my belief that the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
1351	10218	4	1	The rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph is essentially to convey that in spring, when the plant rejuvenates, Saeng too will embark on a new beginning. The story clearly demonstrates this significance as Saeng endured a particularly arduous winter and struggled to adapt to all the novel circumstances. However, come spring, she can initiate a fresh start, much like the hibiscus will.
1352	10219	4	1	The author incorporates this paragraph into the story for multiple reasons. One such reason is that the story commences by detailing Saeng's failure in her driver's test and her subsequent state of despondency. Subsequently, it delves into the hibiscus and how it evokes memories of her homeland and all the pleasant experiences she has had. This entire narrative is connected to this paragraph because Saeng will not return for the test until the hibiscus, the source of her happiness and confidence, begins to bud. This paragraph is intricately linked to every aspect of the story, from its inception to its conclusion.
1353	10220	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes this within the story because it is upon their return that the character believes she will be adequately prepared to retake that test.
1354	10221	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to accentuate the theme that adapting to life's changes is arduous. Saeng has relocated to @LOCATION1 and yearns for her homeland. The flowers in the greenhouse evoke memories of her place of upbringing and her grandmother. ""A wave of loss so profound and intense that it pricked Saeng's eyes now washed over her."" Saeng cannot behold the flowers without shedding tears. She informs her mother that she failed the test, yet in the final paragraph, she vows to herself that by spring, she will succeed. The author offers us an understanding of Saeng's character. We now recognize that despite the difficulty for Saeng to relinquish what she knows and loves, she will possess the fortitude to thrive in a new world."
1355	10222	4	1	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate that her time spent in communion with nature is not yet at an end. For when the cycle resumes, she will persist in her endeavors, namely cultivating her plants, caring for them, preparing them for a sumptuous dinner, and continuing this routine until she is no longer physically capable.
1356	10223	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it demonstrates her heightened comfort with her former residence. The winter hibiscus is associated with her new abode, yet as winter wanes and new hibiscus blossoms emerge, they become linked to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home imparts a sense of solace. Thus, when she experiences that comfort once more, she will summon the courage to take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph as it reveals that Saeng still dislikes the change and yearns to return to her old home.
1357	10224	4	1	"The author incorporates this paragraph since Saeng is embarking on a new chapter in a foreign country. In this land, she longs for her native land, and the hibiscus serves as a poignant reminder of it. Saeng took an examination and failed, akin to how flowers wither in winter yet bloom anew in spring. When the hibiscus blossoms, Saeng will also ""flourish"" and attempt the test again. Relocating can be arduous, particularly when it is to an utterly unfamiliar place. People devise means to make commitments to themselves and to recall their former homes."
1358	10225	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because during this spring, she made an error, such as purchasing plants that cost over @MONEY1 (dollars), which disappointed her mother. Hence, she reasons that when spring arrives again, she will have another opportunity to exert her best efforts and rectify the situation this time. Additionally, she aims to avoid disappointing her mother.
1359	10226	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph as she stated that the flower aids her in coping with the relocation and evokes memories of her hometown. Moreover, when the geese return and the flower begins to bloom, she will know that she can pass the test. She is disheartened by her test failure, but it matters not how many times one fails; eventually, success will be achieved. She is likely to feel at ease retaking the test when spring arrives.
1360	10227	4	1	"I opine that the author concluded the story ""Winter @CAPS1"" with the specific paragraph to imply that Saeng will persevere. By informing the audience that Saeng was deeply saddened by her test failure yet will retake the test, it suggests that Saeng is a resolute individual. In my view, the concluding paragraph was included to convey the sentiment that Saeng remains determined despite the hardships she encounters."
1361	10228	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" penned by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the tale with the statement, ""When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows dissipate, the geese reappear, and this hibiscus commences budding, then I shall undertake that test once more."" This is because the hibiscus symbolizes hope and the ability to adapt to circumstances. Saeng endeavors to adapt to the novel changes in her life, yet nothing seems to be working in her favor. ""She discovered that she remained too tremulous to utter the words at home, lest she dissolve into tears anew."" @CAPS2, the Hibiscus simplifies her life as it evokes memories of her homeland. @CAPS3, it instills hope in her. ""Behold how root - bound it is, poor thing."" The root - bound state represents Saeng in her new country. Reluctant to attempt anything and prone to fear, but as soon as Saeng and her mother plant the hibiscus, Saeng realizes that by doing so, she will strive to embrace her new life in @LOCATION1. Come spring, when both the hibiscus and Saeng are primed to flourish, she will begin to accept life."
1362	10229	4	1	"Mingfong Ho concludes the narrative with that particular paragraph as it demonstrates the progress Saeng has made and her resolve to persevere. The narrator remarks, ""She raised her head and observed as their characteristic V was imprinted against the evening sky, gradually facing towards the distance"" (Ho @NUM1). This occurs when Saeng is emerging from her bout of crying. Despite her longing for her homeland, she desires to adapt and achieve success in her current location. The narrator also states, ""She found that she was still too unsteady to articulate the words at home, for fear that she would break into tears once again"" (Ho @NUM1). Being separated from her homeland renders Saeng extremely... (not legible)."
1363	10230	4	1	The author brings the story to a close with this paragraph because they perceive that the plant will bestow upon them fortune or some such benefit. Saeng senses that the plant offers her a certain form of solace.
1364	10231	4	1	"I surmise that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because within the narrative, the author posits, ""through the tranquil recurrence of season after season."" This implies that seasons will come and go, yet she will perpetually be present, prepared to ""undertake the test."
1365	10232	4	1	The author likely intends to convey that in the spring, when the seasons transition, the geese make their return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, he will retake the test.
1366	10233	4	1	The author posits that failing the test is not the most adverse outcome. She discerns that circumstances evolve and one can invariably obtain another opportunity, as elucidated in the last paragraph, which states that once the hibiscus blossoms, she will retake the test.
1367	10234	4	1	The author concludes the narrative by stating that in the spring, when the snow thaws, the geese migrate back, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. This assertion implies her resolve not to succumb to defeat.
1368	10235	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, which encapsulates numerous aspects of her character within a single concise sentence. For instance, the phrase ""take that test again"" indicates her willingness to persevere and her passion for the endeavor. Moreover, when she mentions ""in spring; when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding,"" she urges the reader to recall the significance of these elements. This is precisely why the author concludes the story with this paragraph."
1369	10236	4	1	This narrative underscores the importance of self - belief and unwavering perseverance. Saeng firmly believed she could pass her driver's test. Despite being disheartened by the outcome, she discovered a means to cope with the setback. The blooming hibiscus holds profound significance for her as it evokes memories of her homeland and represents a thing of beauty, which she desperately needed during this challenging period. Adapting to a new country within a brief span is invariably arduous. I empathize with the feeling of a minor misstep triggering an overwhelming sense of despair. One can feel helpless and isolated, much like the hibiscus growing beside the highway in the photograph. Saeng vowed to retake her driver's test when the hibiscus blooms in the spring. I believe the hibiscus truly symbolizes Saeng's resilience and spirit.
1370	10237	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. Saeng was disheartened by her failure in the driving test. After purchasing a plant, she found solace in nature. Saeng seems to believe that when the geese depart and the hibiscus has not yet begun to bud, it is not the right time to take the driver's test. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus bring her a sense of comfort, suggesting that nature serves as a balm for her distress. The author ended the story in this manner to illustrate that Saeng has overcome her disappointment. She is aware that she will have another opportunity the following year when the geese return and the hibiscus starts to bloom. With the comfort derived from nature, she is confident of passing the test next year.
1371	10238	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph or quotation to provoke contemplation among readers at the culmination of their reading experience. For instance, it informs the reader that the individual will persist in cultivating plants once winter has concluded.
1372	10239	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, it is posited that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it illustrates the protagonist's resolve. Saeng encounters difficulties in both acclimating and adapting to the alterations in her new life. An example of this is evident when Saeng returns home with her flower; “she found that she was still too tremulous to utter the words at home, lest she dissolve into tears again.” It is apparent that Saeng purchased the flower as it instilled a sense of security within her. It was a familiar element from her homeland, and it is surmised that this is the reason the author included this story segment, as in the subsequent year, Saeng will possess a sense of security and familiarity when undertaking the test, as she will relive the prior experience.
1373	10240	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng will not capitulate. Additionally, the author concludes in this manner to convey to the audience that they should never abandon their efforts and should persevere. Even if they must take a hiatus to study or reevaluate their strategy.
1374	10241	4	1	Upon their return, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in the spring, when the snow thaws, the geese migrate back, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. In the story, the author incorporated this paragraph to depict the measures the girl was taking to enhance her academic performance.
1375	10242	4	1	He concludes the paragraph with this statement as he intends to convey that he would prefer to retake the test when the outdoor environment is idyllic. In conclusion, this is the rationale behind the belief that the author ends the text with this particular sentence.
1376	10243	4	1	"At the conclusion of the short story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author Minfong Ho incorporates a somewhat motivational concluding sentence: ""When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" It is believed that this sentence was included to evoke a sense of hope for the future, which starkly contrasts with the melancholic nature of the story, thus crafting a felicitous ending. Throughout the narrative, Saeng is despondent as she had to depart from her homeland so precipitously, forfeiting her childhood and her cherished grandmother. As Saeng narrates in greater detail, ""A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone."" Additionally contributing to the sorrowful sentiments in the story is the frequency with which Saeng weeps while recollecting her tragic past. Both in the greenhouse, as she reminisces about her grandmother, such as when she says, ""Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's grey hair. Saeng would help knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it,"" and in the garden, when she converses with her mother and plants the flower. After all this sorrow, by inserting a hopeful ending, the writer has successfully instilled a sense of hope for the future."
1377	10244	4	1	She asserts that come spring, she will retake the test because she is cognizant that if she fails the test once more, her mother will be disappointed in her, either because she has not exerted sufficient effort or perhaps because they will never regain the closeness they once shared. The mother believes that merely because she keeps failing the test, it is due to her connection to her past experiences, her affection for her new country, and her ability to surmount obstacles. Ultimately, it is thought that she finds solace in the memories of her homeland.
1378	10245	4	1	The author concludes the story with that particular quote for a primary reason. This reason is that it demonstrates the girl's possession of hope. In a narrative, one of the most admirable qualities a character can exhibit is hope, as it captivates the reader's interest and contributes to the impartation of a positive moral to the story. This is precisely why the author chooses to conclude the story with that quote.
1379	10246	4	1	"The author of this story crafted the final paragraph to conclude the tale with an outstanding ending, emphasizing the principle of never surrendering and persevering through repeated attempts. The author stated, ""I will take the test again."" In the story, Saeng admitted, ""I failed the test,"" yet now she refuses to give up. This final paragraph is highly logical and is essential for the story's completeness. Just as others in @LOCATION1 do not abandon their efforts, Saeng is following suit and retaking the test."
1380	10247	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the statement, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" as he intends to convey to the readers that she is resolutely determined to undertake what is necessary to achieve success in what she previously failed. Having failed the test on the first attempt, she desires to overcome her setback and attain success. Hence, the author wishes for her to appear steadfast at the end."
1381	10248	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it extends the story's length and imparts a satisfactory denouement. However, I am entirely uncertain as to its meaning. Hence, it is the author's responsibility to elucidate its significance, not mine.
1382	10249	4	1	The plant held great significance for Saeng as it originated from her homeland. Saeng declared that she would retake her driver's examination when the plant blossomed. The plant served as a poignant reminder of her native land and her roots. For Saeng, the plant was a source of confidence. Saeng endured difficult times, and the plant was dear to her because it hailed from her homeland.
1383	10250	4	1	I posit that the author concluded the story with that paragraph to evoke a sense of intrigue. I hold this view because when one considers the context of the word “test,” it can encompass a multitude of interpretations. For instance, it could signify the trial to surmount the sorrow stemming from her circumstances. Additionally, it might represent the challenge of acclimating to her new abode when spring arrives. This is why I believe the author endeavored to cultivate a sense of wonder with the concluding paragraph.
1384	10251	4	1	The narrative “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho revolves around the theme of surmounting adversity. She concludes the story by penning “when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test” (NUM1). The protagonist, Saeng, had been encountering difficulties at school, and on her way home, she encountered a variety of flora native to her homeland. “Saeng felt a jolt of recognition so intense it was almost” (NUM2). The sight of those flowers, particularly the hibiscus, reminded her of what she had lost and provided solace in the face of those memories. The winter hibiscus could persevere despite being outside its natural habitat. Her mother remarks, “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough. That’s what” (NUM3). After hearing this, Saeng resolves that she too can be resilient and will strive to excel at school. She will adapt, much like the winter hibiscus.
1385	10252	4	1	She made that statement because her interest in flowers superseded her concern for a test.
1386	10253	4	1	I am convinced that the author concludes the text with this paragraph as it symbolizes the termination of one phase and the inception of another. After experiencing distress and reflecting on her homeland, she comes to the realization that novel circumstances are unfolding, and she must embrace them. Consequently, in the spring, she will embark on a new journey, much like the blossoming of a flower.
1387	10254	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as he intends to convey that the character refrains from hastening into matters. Instead, she desires to act appropriately and eschew taking the facile route.
1388	10255	4	1	It underscores the significance of the Hibiscus to Saeng and her commitment to the flower. Moreover, it indicates that she will await the subsequent spring to once again admire the flower.
1389	10256	4	1	The author concludes this story with this paragraph as she is elucidating her thoughts and the rationale behind taking that test. She is clarifying that in the following year, she will ascertain whether it feels like home to her.
1390	10257	4	1	"When the author concluded the narrative with ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" it demonstrates the capacity to surmount obstacles, find solace in a period of disappointment, and her link to past experiences. Firstly, it showcases the ability to overcome obstacles because obstacles are ubiquitous in everyone's lives, and one has no option but to conquer them as they are boundless. Thus, the hibiscus flower symbolizes the obstacles, and the weather represents time, as the weather impedes the flower from blooming. Secondly, it also represents the discovery of comfort in a time of disappointment because when one is traversing an obstacle, disappointment often lingers. However, she is aware that the hibiscus will return, along with the awareness of the impending obstacles. Finally, it affirms her connection to her past experiences because she is ensnared in a world with which she is unfamiliar, rendering her an outsider. She captures the sense of being out of place, as one can draw a parallel between herself and the hibiscus flower, as she is unconventional and distinct from the others in her environment. She is endeavoring to adapt her way of life and survive in the world, much like she did in her native country."
1391	10258	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it represents Saeng's determination and her current circumstances. Having recently arrived in the new country, she has yet to acclimate herself to this unfamiliar environment. She was disheartened, likened to ""a shaft of the war - afternoon starlight."" The mention of ""war"" indicated Saeng's extreme distress. Upon encountering the flower, she reminisced about her native land, her homeland, which she deeply missed. She then felt that life was once again replete with hope. Although she knew she ought to adapt to the new situation, she was still too unsteady to express her thoughts at home. Eventually, she broke down in tears once more. Her profound longing for her homeland was symbolized by ""snows,"" which represented the arduous situation she was in. Nevertheless, she believed she could surmount this situation, as life was full of hope. ""Spring"" symbolized the promise of a new life; Saeng was convinced that things would improve in the spring and that she would achieve success. Her unwavering determination to succeed is why the author employed that paragraph as a conclusion, as it symbolizes hope."
1392	10259	4	1	"The author incorporated this passage because she opined that since Saeng had failed the test, perhaps she deserved a second opportunity, considering her previous strenuous efforts. When Saeng uttered, ""Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it,"" it perturbed her mother, as she had expended a substantial amount of money on a single plant merely to recapture a sense of home, as she had owned a similar one in her former residence. Eventually, her mother remarked, ""It's a beautiful plant,"" to console her, as she felt remorseful about her prior behavior towards her daughter. The series of challenges Saeng endured is the rationale behind the author's inclusion of the final passage in the story."
1393	10260	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, suggesting that Saeng will persevere until she passes that test. She will continue to strive relentlessly, even unto death. The author is alluding to the story once again, emphasizing Saeng's indomitable spirit.
1394	10261	4	1	The author's intent in this conclusion is that annually, when the snow thaws and the geese return, she will once again be tasked with caring for the plant. This is evident because taking a test is a significant responsibility, and thus, tending to that plant is also a substantial undertaking, analogous to retaking the test. This is precisely what the purpose of the concluding sentence implies.
1395	10262	4	1	Since cultivating flowers and tending to the garden is @CAPS1's pastime, without it, she is unable to think clearly or be creative. Therefore, awaiting their return will enhance her well - being and enable her to engage in her work more effectively.
1396	10263	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for numerous reasons. Firstly, she indicates that once everything reverts to normalcy, that is when she will retake the test. Secondly, there would be little else to convey if the situation fails to return to her desired state. For example, if one were constructing a house and a blizzard ensued, one would halt the work and state that one would not resume until favorable weather conditions returned. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for numerous reasons.
1397	10264	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho concludes the story in this manner to convey the theme of renewal. Her mother contributes to this theme of renewal by stating, ""Its flowers aren't as beautiful, but it's resilient enough to endure the winter. That's what counts."" Her words serve as a metaphor for the family commencing a new life in @LOCATION1, suggesting that @LOCATION1 may not be as idyllic, yet it will persevere, which is of utmost importance. Her words alleviate her daughter's concerns about starting anew. Additionally, the budding hibiscus can be regarded as a symbol of rebirth, as it withers and flourishes with the changing seasons. The family is transitioning from a @CAPS1 family to a @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 family. However, even though they have ""ceased"" to be a @CAPS1 family, it does not imply that they have lost their heritage, which is why the author concludes by discussing a flower that embodies both @CAPS1 and @CAPS3, just like Saeng."
1398	10265	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will persevere through the hardships of winter and endeavor to adapt to her new lifestyle. Relocating to a new country and culture is an arduous task, and Saeng has faced difficulties, yet she does not abandon her pursuit of creating a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, ""In the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is in bloom, then I will take that test,"" exudes determination and hope. Throughout the story, Saeng struggled to adapt, and her memories of her homeland provided a sense of security. This sentence encapsulates her emotions and showcases her resilience. While many @CAPS1 individuals might easily relinquish their driving test aspirations, she remains steadfast. It is a heartening conclusion to a somewhat melancholic tale. Moreover, the sentence reflects Saeng's connection to her plant. Just as the hibiscus will survive, so will Saeng. When the hibiscus blossoms in the spring, Saeng too will thrive. She will exert every effort to integrate and relish her new life. The plant will aid her in this journey, reminding her of Vietnam and serving as a companion during the winter. The author could not have selected a more fitting conclusion for this story. The conclusion instills a newfound hope for perseverance and success. Consequently, the reader is left with a sense of satisfaction and a positive sentiment towards the story. This conclusion demonstrates how Saeng is adapting to change and embracing the prospect of enjoying her new life in @LOCATION1."
1399	10266	4	1	"The narrative revolves around a girl who, after failing her driving test, returns home and breaks down over the loss of her ""home"" in a place she no longer inhabits. After her emotional outburst, she purchases a plant and gradually comes to terms with the fact that she no longer resides in Vietnam and that she failed her driving test. She realizes that she must learn to accept and appreciate her new circumstances. She also understands that her opportunity will arrive, and she will eventually master driving. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it represents the culmination of the narrative, where the protagonist gains insight into the significant aspects of life."
1400	10267	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the narrative with a statement of Saeng's silent vow. Saeng declares that she will retake the driver's test. Observing the geese flying in a ""V"" formation and the hibiscus evokes a sense of nostalgia for her homeland in Saeng. She yearns for her native land. The author intends for the @CAPS1 to perceive that Saeng is beginning to feel at home once more. The hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng, assuring her that everything will be @CAPS2.K, that it is natural to miss Vietnam, and that it is also acceptable to embrace a new life. Thus, in the spring, Saeng will approach her driver's test with a renewed mindset and is likely to pass it."
1401	10268	4	1	The author employed that paragraph to construct imagery, aiming to evoke a vivid mental picture of the story in the reader's mind. Additionally, the author utilized this paragraph to convey her emotions.
1402	10269	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph to inform the reader of Saeng's intention to retake the test and to reunite with the plant once more. This concluding paragraph offers insights into future events, which is the reason the author included it.
1403	10270	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho concludes the story in a manner that symbolizes hope. Saeng intends to embark on a new start when nature rejuvenates. Spring is the season when animals emerge from hibernation, trees burst into bloom, and snow melts, signifying renewal. Saeng silently vows to attempt the test again in spring. She purchases the hibiscus not only as a memento of her homeland but also as a signal to re - enter the fray when it blossoms. The hibiscus indicates this through its budding and blooming. Ho ends the story in anticipation of a fresh beginning. Saeng's vow, ""Then I will take that test again,"" reflects her newfound determination. The phrase ""That test again"" showcases her positive attitude and her eagerness to retry the test."
1404	10271	4	1	"The text aims to illustrate the profound sense of desolation she experiences in their absence. This is evident when the @ORGANIZATION1 states, ""when they come back,"" and also when she mentions, ""the geese return & this hibiscus is budding."" These statements reveal her current state of longing and how she anticipates a change in her emotional state upon their return. Moreover, her declaration, ""Then I will take that test again,"" demonstrates her resolve to resume her journey from where she left off previously."
1405	10272	4	1	to show how absent she feels without them by her. You see this when the @ORGANIZATION1 says ìwhen they come backî. also when she says ìthe geese return & this hibiscus is buddingî. Shows how she feel without them and how she will feel when they return and how she will carry on where they left off last time as shown when she says ì, Then I will take that test againî.
1406	10273	4	1	I believe “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho is a remarkable work. Throughout the narrative, one experiences a blend of elation and melancholy, all while maintaining a sense of tranquility. Elation washes over when descriptions of the plants emerge and when her mother accepts the plants she purchased. Initially, when one anticipates the mother scolding her for the purchase after her test failure, sympathy arises. Yet, a calm demeanor prevails, suggesting the girl's reluctance to surrender but rather her inclination to proceed at her own pace.
1407	10274	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a paragraph stating that she will retake the test, indicating her determination to succeed this time and avoid the same disappointment as before. The text mentions “spring when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding,” which signifies the time when she will attempt the test again. This conclusion conveys the character's resilience and hope for a better outcome.
1408	10275	4	1	Saeng made a silent vow to herself and her mother. She resolved to disclose her test failure to her mother, aware that her mother might be displeased. However, she intended to have a conversation with her. Her mother inquired about the plant she had. Saeng explained that she had purchased it for a certain amount. She was disheartened by her test failure, and buying the plant likely provided some solace. The author probably concluded the story with this paragraph as it instills a glimmer of hope, suggesting that she will pass the test in the future. When she declared, “then I will take that test again,” it could be the plant that motivated her decision.
1409	10276	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate to readers that Saeng is determined to pass her driver's license test. This showcases Saeng's tenacity after the winter. For instance, in the story, Saeng failed her driver's license test and was despondent. Another example is when she discovered the flower, which gave her the confidence to try again. This indicates that the flower uplifted her spirits and inspired her to persevere. The first example illustrates her disappointment at failing the test. In conclusion, the author included this statement to convey to readers that Saeng will eventually pass the driver's license test.
1410	10277	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with Saeng proclaiming, “when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author chose this ending to impart a positive tone. The remainder of the story is tinged with sadness as Saeng yearns for her home in Vietnam. “It’s—not a real one. I mean, it’s not like the kind we had at—at—” she found herself too emotional to utter the words about home, fearing a fresh bout of tears. “Not like the ones we had before.” This conclusion conveys that despite the changes, Saeng will not abandon her pursuit of a fulfilling life in the United States and will not let these alterations dampen her spirit.
1411	10278	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that she will regain her self - assurance when “the hibiscus is budding” and attempt the driving test once more. He refrains from leaving the reader in suspense with the image of the girl watching the geese recede into the distance. The girl's profound disappointment over failing the test evokes a sense of sadness in the reader. To uplift the reader's spirits, he concludes the story in this manner. Saeng is reminded of her homeland when “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. Thus, the author ends the story with Saeng experiencing a renewed sense of confidence and the reader feeling elated.
1412	10279	4	1	The author concludes the story with that statement as she is resolute in achieving success at @LOCATION1. She yearns for her native land and all its elements: gardens, grandparents, and so forth. For instance, upon entering the flower - shop, she inhales the fragrance of the flowers, reminiscent of her homeland. Subsequently, she catches a whiff of a flower that brings to mind her grandmother's “long gray hair, freshly washed …”. By uttering that final sentence, she implies that when the hibiscus blossoms next winter, she will retake the test she previously failed.
1413	10280	4	1	The author concludes the story with “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” as the girl is steadfast in her resolve to persevere and not yield regardless of the circumstances. The girl is disheartened because she lacks the genuine flower her mother once had. “It’s - it's not a real one,” Saeng murmured. “I mean, not like the kind we had at - at.” Her distress and fear of incurring her mother's wrath cause her to tremble. “I know,” her mother said softly. “I've seen this kind blooming along the lake.” The author is merely demonstrating that the girl will make another attempt next time.
1414	10281	4	1	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to convey to the reader that Saeng will not capitulate. Saeng and her family emigrated from Vietnam, and she has struggled to adapt to the changes. Saeng deeply misses her homeland and the flowers that are an integral part of her life. She elaborates on how the winter hibiscus differs from the one in Vietnam, so she plants this particular type of flower and decides to defer taking the driving test until spring. This indicates that Saeng wishes to set aside her difficulties in @LOCATION2 and revisit them in the spring when the weather and ambiance are more favorable. She is not giving up; rather, she prefers to address the challenges at a later time. This is the reason the author concludes with this paragraph.
1415	10282	4	1	I surmise that he employs it because she desires to acquire another one next year to experience the profound affection for something and the responsibility of caring for it over an extended period. This is why I believe the narrator selects that phrase as the concluding one of the story.
1416	10283	4	1	The author concludes this narrative with the provided paragraph as it demonstrates how Saeng is adapting to the changes she is experiencing in @LOCATION1. The winter hibiscus assisted her in @CAPS1 after failing her driving test, leading Saeng to believe it will bring her good fortune when she retakes the test. Moreover, the hibiscus will endure, and as she progresses towards her objective, it will further develop. Once the flower blossoms, it will symbolize resilience, aiding Saeng in surmounting this challenge. Her mother mentioned that the flower was not as attractive but would survive. This implies that @LOCATION1 in @MONTH1 may not be as idyllic as Vietnam, yet Saeng will remain steadfast.
1417	10284	4	1	The purpose of the ending the author @CAPS1 is to illustrate how the hibiscus imparts a profound sense of solace to Saeng, in contrast to her state at the commencement of the story. Initially, she seemed to possess minimal self - assurance. Now, she is compelled to regard this unfamiliar place as home, which has depleted her @CAPS2 to persevere until she encounters a highly familiar visage that evokes memories of her happiest moments. Having something of significance to her constantly in her vicinity can make @CAPS3 feel at home, reminiscent of the past. She discovered comfort in the hibiscus. As it now resides in her garden, continuously flourishing through all the seasons, she will also thrive, with the reminder of her former home and the contentment it brought, along with new memories.
1418	10285	4	1	@PERSON1 ascends to the summit and then traverses over the hill.
1419	10286	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several distinct reasons. The author intends to convey symbolically that the budding of the hibiscus plant holds profound meaning. Ho states, “Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.” This instance is significant as it occurs at a juncture when Saeng must overcome adverse circumstances, and the withered state of the plant symbolically represents its deeper meaning. At another point in the narrative, Saeng realizes that the seasons carry far greater significance. Ho states, “Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She comes to understand that when spring arrives and the plant becomes healthy and begins to bud, she will be able to achieve success and transform into a renewed individual.
1420	10287	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he or she believes that the audience should comprehend Saeng's emotional state. This paragraph ending indicates that Saeng will persist in her efforts each spring to revive her flowers, which showcases Saeng's substantial potential to fulfill her vow and attain personal success.
1421	10288	4	1	"This narrative revolves around surmounting adversities and setbacks, along with embracing and acclimatizing to the vicissitudes of life that individuals encounter. Hence, it is fitting that the story concludes with a clear objective and a resolute demeanor. Throughout the entire reading, Saeng found solace in the elements most familiar to her, such as flowers and the flavor of bitter melon. She was in pain and disheartened, and these were the sole things that bestowed tranquility upon her. It was these very things that instilled in her the courage requisite to retake her driver's test in the spring. Thus, it seems apt that she concludes the story with a mention of the hibiscus. The concluding paragraph also indicates that Saeng is adapting proficiently to her new country. She states, ""when they come back... in the spring, when the snow thaws and the geese return..."" Initially, the sounds of geese were foreign to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal auditory occurrence. This implies that she is learning to embrace her new country, which is the ideal way to end the story."
1422	10289	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because during the winter season, she will not be able to behold the hibiscus to which she is accustomed. She is habituated to venturing outdoors into the garden and observing her exquisite plant. In summary, the author concludes the story thus because in winter, she will not see her plant.
1423	10290	4	1	In the narrative, Saeng endeavors to come to terms with her new abode. I opine that the author incorporated this element into the story to demonstrate that she has not relinquished hope. She will persist in her efforts to adapt to her new dwelling. Saeng desires to adjust, yet she yearns excessively for her former home. This is the reason why she is awaiting spring to make another attempt.
1424	10291	4	1	The author concludes the story with that line to leave the reader in a state of speculation. It implies that she is resolute in living up to her past and surmounting it. The paragraph prompts the reader to ponder whether she managed to overcome it in the subsequent year. The author depicts the snow melting and the geese returning as symbols of change, which precisely aligns with what she aspires to achieve. The author aimed to illustrate how she can transform and develop, much like her plant.
1425	10292	4	1	"The author concludes with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She writes this because when her flower begins to bud, she will be capable of taking the test as she is likened to a flower. The author employs this conclusion because when the flower is about to bud and the geese return, she will feel as though she is back in her homeland. That is why I believe the author used the conclusion ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."
1426	10293	4	1	"In the frigid season of winter, the adolescent girl Saeng fails her driver's examination. Subsequently, she encounters a winter hibiscus, which rekindles her recollections. The author concludes the narrative by depicting Saeng's intention to retake the test when the geese migrate back and the hibiscus begins to bud, evoking a sense of solace and familiarity. When the narrator states, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had regarded as peculiar before had become,"" this instance illustrates that she had become disconnected from the authenticity of nature, and it is precisely this reconnection that will enable her to pass the test. The author instills an impatient atmosphere for the reader as it took until winter for her to make this discovery, and winter is a time when it is too late—the geese have departed and the flower has wilted. However, when spring arrives, both nature and she will be receptive to new prospects, embraced by the comforting familiarity around her."
1427	10294	4	1	I surmise that she concluded with this statement because she remains uncertain about her success in the test, yet she refuses to abandon her efforts. She intends to attempt the test once more when her flower rejuvenates. Presently, she is in a despondent state, and the plant has served to uplift her spirits. Hence, when she beholds the plant in the coming year, she aspires to take the test. The plant symbolizes a harbinger of good fortune. I believe she concluded with this paragraph as it conveys the message of perseverance, encouraging the reader not to surrender in the face of adversity but to persist in their endeavors.
1428	10295	4	1	"The author brings the story to a close with this paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, it allows the reader to envision the potential continuation of the narrative. For instance, when the author states, ""Then I will take that test again."" Secondly, it presents the reader with a final evocative image, capable of altering their perception of the story. As an example, when the author mentions, ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" These are the justifications for the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph."
1429	10296	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because when the snow begins to thaw, the plant commences budding, and the geese make their return, she will retake the test. This serves as a means for her to deliberate carefully on the opportune moment to undertake the test once more. When these natural phenomena occur, she will also reappear, ready to attempt the test anew.
1430	10297	4	1	"In the story, Saeng privately vowed to herself, ""When the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is in bloom, she will take the test again."" For some inexplicable reason, I consider this to be an excellent resolve on Saeng's part."
1431	10298	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” presumably opted to conclude the story in such a manner as it concludes with an air of hope. Moreover, it demonstrates how Saeng is acclimating to her environment, much akin to the winter hibiscus. In the penultimate paragraph, Saeng hears the honks of the geese, and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her over time. Saeng likely vowed to retake the test when the geese returned, as that period would enable her to grow and adapt further. The hibiscus will be in bud then, a sign that it surmounted its obstacles and successfully adapted. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could as well. She could draw inspiration from the plant. This sense of hope for Saeng and her future is left in the final paragraph, which is the reason the story concludes there.
1432	10299	4	1	The author concludes this paragraph of the story because seasons undergo change, and plants typically do not thrive during winter. Therefore, one should learn a lesson, accept it as it is, and await the opportune moment to potentially learn a similar lesson again when the appropriate time arrives.
1433	10300	4	1	I opine that “Winter Hibiscus” is a commendable story, and the author appended the paragraph at the end because the central theme is about perseverance. This is why it states at the very end, “I will take the test again.” One should not succumb to failure but instead exert effort, rise again, and make another attempt.
1434	10301	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the overarching meaning of the narrative. Additionally, the author includes this paragraph as it likely imparts a moral to the story and reveals certain aspects or events in the story that the reader may not have been aware of.
1435	10302	4	1	The story is somewhat melancholic. The girl yearns for her homeland and is also despondent due to failing her driving test. The author, in my view, ends the story with the girl proclaiming that she will retake the test to illustrate that despite her sorrow over her country and the test failure, she will not abandon her efforts. Failing a test, particularly a driving test, is disheartening. One is brimming with excitement to obtain it but then falls short. Thus, the author aims to show that notwithstanding the girl's sadness, she will persevere. The girl will continue to strive until she eventually passes. Moreover, the author probably intended to end on a more optimistic note, as one generally does not wish to conclude a story on a sorrowful note without a glimmer of resolution. Hence, she declared that she would try the test again. There are numerous reasons why the author ended the story as she did, but the aforementioned are the more evident ones.
1436	10303	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” the story concludes with that particular phrase to illustrate that Saeng possesses well - defined goals. Firstly, she aspires to acclimate to this novel land. This is evident as she mentions that when they return in the spring, indicating her resolve not to abandon her efforts and her determination to adjust to her new life. This also reveals her tenacity; she will persist in attempting to obtain her license, as she states, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Her words signify her intention to make another attempt. Moreover, it demonstrates that she will summon the courage to persevere and not yield.
1437	10304	4	1	Saeng awaited the arrival of spring so that she could retake the test. It is plausible that she was anxious about it during spring, as she went to observe the geese flying in a V - formation and to witness the plants growing, yet the snow had not melted. She began to converse with herself about it, as she desired to take the test during spring. She hoped she could pass it this time, as she disliked taking the test repeatedly. Once everyone moves on to different matters after the test concludes, Saeng will continue her journey of adaptation.
1438	10305	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, the protagonist, Saeng, who relocated to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, had just returned home after failing her driver's test. For Saeng, this failure symbolized her inability to assimilate into her family's new lifestyle. Consequently, she felt that she had let down both her mother and herself. On her way home, she purchased a flower that her family also had in Vietnam in an attempt to console her mother. As her mother commenced planting the winter hibiscus, Saeng sensed that her mother had forgiven her for failing the driver's test. Subsequently, she realized that she had adapted to her surroundings, much like she believed her flower would, and this realization motivated her to vow to retake the driver's test in the spring. By concluding the story with Saeng's promise, Minfong, the author, ensured that the most crucial aspect for the reader to remember about the story was that Saeng did not give up. She pledged to herself that she would try again and adapt to her surroundings, unlike some others around her. Her promise exemplifies courage and perseverance.
1439	10306	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the protagonist, Saeng, is steadfast in her resolve not to give up. She will retake the test, and just as the hibiscus will bloom anew on @DATE1, Saeng will also have another chance at success. This ending emphasizes her resilience and the hope for a positive outcome, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism about her future.
1440	10307	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as Saeng expresses her journey of learning to adapt to this country. Earlier in the narrative, she disclosed her failure in the test, attributing it to her inability to impress her mother. Saeng and her mother, accustomed to life in Vietnam, are endeavoring to adjust. Saeng initially thought the hibiscus she obtained resembled the one they had back home. By the end, she realizes that with faith, everything will be @CAPS1, and it will feel like home. She mentions the spring because by then, her hibiscus will be fully grown, and she will retake the test to see if it is as her mother envisioned. Saeng's experiences throughout the story showcase her gradual process of adapting to her new home in the United States.
1441	10308	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it both expresses and sustains the theme of perseverance and adaptation to change. The conclusion revisits the “test” once more. From the reading, one can infer that the test to which the author alludes is Saeng's confrontation with memories of home without succumbing to the breakdown caused by loss. Saeng states earlier in the story that she “failed the test,” having broken down in tears upon seeing all the familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph indicating that she will take the test again, it demonstrates that Saeng will continue to endeavor to adapt to her new home and find peace therein, rather than being overwhelmed by the profound loss of her old home. It exemplifies the theme of perseverance as she is willing to take the test again and attempt to overcome the feeling of sorrow.
1442	10309	4	1	The young girl is resolute in her determination to achieve victory. She went and took an assessment regarding a flower, yet she did not succeed. Returning in a state of dejection and emotional distress, she confided in her grandmother that these flowers were not akin to those from her former abode. She was unable to utter “at home” as it invoked too much pain. Her grandmother concurred, stating that they were not like the genuine ones.
1443	10310	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative with the statement, “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” At the onset of the story, she exhibited less confidence and failed the test. However, this single flower instilled hope in her, and thus, the next time she undertakes the test, she will be better equipped.
1444	10311	4	1	The author chose to conclude the essay in such a manner because it effectively coalesced all the disparate ideas. For instance, one individual stated, “She silently vowed to herself that in the spring, after the snow melts, she would retake that test.” This conclusion serves to bring a sense of unity and closure to the essay, tying together the various threads of thought presented throughout.
1445	10312	4	1	I surmise that the author concluded the story with that particular sentence because during every winter, all or most plants wither away. Come spring, they must commence the growth process anew. This cycle of death and rebirth mirrors the character's journey of resilience and the opportunity for a fresh start, thereby providing a fitting conclusion to the narrative.
1446	10313	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner as they aim to demonstrate that Saeng will be committed to hibiscus gardening. Once she validates herself, she will have successfully passed the test. Additionally, it indicates that she desires her heritage to be a significant aspect of her life by cultivating the flower of their nation.
1447	10314	4	1	The author concludes the story with this quotation as it illustrates Saeng's resoluteness in passing her driving test. For instance, in the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” after Saeng fails her driving test, she remarks about disregarding defeat and states, “Let’s plant, right now.” She utters this because she endeavors to forget her failure and focus on something positive. In conclusion, this is the reason the author concludes with this quotation, serving as an example of Saeng's determination and focus in passing her driving test.
1448	10315	4	1	The author concluded the story in such a way as it instilled hope. Saeng had endured pain and disappointment, yet ultimately, she exhibited hope. In the story, Saeng failed her driving test and was extremely disheartened. In the end, it demonstrated that she would not give up in this new country. She was going to move forward and make the most of her circumstances.
1449	10316	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is determined to complete and pass the test. The primary reason is that she failed this year and aspires to succeed next year. Moreover, she is likening the hibiscus to her performance and perseverance on the test. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
1450	10317	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph since Saeng intends to attempt to preserve her next plant. The rationale behind her assertion that she will retake the test is that she sold the plant to someone. Saeng had witnessed the plant during her childhood, which is why she was so emotionally attached to it. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will strive to keep her next plant.
1451	10318	4	1	The author concludes the final paragraph to illustrate that after a certain period, one can return and attempt something anew. Perhaps, when the weather undergoes a transformation, circumstances may differ for Saeng. It seems she is likening herself to the plant, as when spring arrives, the flower will be more robust. She believes that she will succeed on the test the second time around when the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud. This also demonstrates her appreciation for nature, as otherwise, why would she wait until spring, when the snow is melting? The conclusion of the story indicates that she indeed has an affinity for nature, as evidenced by her mention of the hibiscus.
1452	10319	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named Saeng endeavors to acclimate to @LOCATION1 after emigrating from Vietnam. She is despondent and yearns for her homeland, particularly after failing her driver's test. While passing by a store, she recognizes a plant native to her home. She purchases it and transports it home in a pot, stating that it evokes memories of home and the wonderful moments she shared with such plants. Subsequently, her mother joins her, sharing the moment. Saeng now feels better. In the concluding sentence, the author includes “Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” (Ho,??) The flower has instilled in her the confidence to succeed, and she desires to retake the test. This exemplifies the connection she has with her homeland and the flowers. She aims to surmount her sorrow and move forward, not forsaking her memories but leaving behind her pain.
1453	10320	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author opted to conclude the tale in this manner to demonstrate the solace the hibiscus offered, enabling Saeng to progress. The greenhouse provided a haven for her to express her feelings of homesickness, as evidenced by “and in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Upon returning home, she was confronted once more with the reality of her test failure. It is plausible that her test failure brought to the surface feelings of inadequacy in adjusting to her new home. However, when the geese fly by, the author brings the story to a close to showcase how this experience has facilitated Saeng's growth. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.” It appears that the author intended to convey that through the events in the story, Saeng was able to overcome her reservations about her new home.
1454	10321	4	1	I surmise that the author concluded the story with this statement because it appears to signify a new beginning for Saeng in the spring. She elaborates on how when the hibiscus starts to bloom, the snow has melted, and spring has arrived, she will retake the test. To me, it seems as though when the hibiscus “revives,” it represents a second chance, and she too deserves one. When the world brightens and circumstances improve, she will feel confident about retaking the test. The way the author ended the story strikes me as effective. One must delve deeper and attempt to comprehend the underlying message. Essentially, she is suggesting that once everything “comes back to life,” she will feel assured of passing the test the next time. Now, she can prepare accordingly.
1455	10322	4	1	There are multiple reasons why the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph. Firstly, she has an affinity for the hibiscus flower, as indicated by the instance when “When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently.” Secondly, the flowers are aesthetically pleasing, as evident from her statement “It was like walking into another world.” Lastly, she appreciates their presence, as shown by her description “Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of ferns, and fronds of various shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion.” As can be observed, these are the reasons why the author chose to end the story with that paragraph.
1456	10323	4	1	"The author of this narrative demonstrated acumen by concluding it with the statement that she would retake the test in the spring, when all nature blossoms. This young girl, having just failed her driving test, understandably has no inclination to take it immediately. The blooming of the hibiscus not only symbolizes her former life in her previous abode but also represents a fresh start upon its flowering. This will instill in her the confidence necessary to pass her driving test and evoke excitement for a new beginning in the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return."" This quotation from the paragraph indicates that just as the snow dissipates and the geese return home, she yearns to return to a place of comfort, for at home one feels at ease. The author concluded the story of this girl, Saeng, with hope and the motivation to pursue her desires. This is precisely why ending the story in such a manner was a wise choice."
1457	10324	4	1	The hibiscus, as the author has revealed to the audience, is a resplendent flower that, within the story, represents the memories of a young girl who has failed the test, well - aware that she was overly despondent due to her failure. The flower serves as a symbol of encouragement for the sorrowful girl during her most trying moment and showcases how a diminutive flower can offer solace. The girl, Saeng, vowed to show that once she overcomes the sorrowful memories, she will be able to prove her ability to pass. After she comes to terms with the situation she is experiencing in her disrupted life, having had to relocate to a different country where one must possess a certain level of adaptability, it is logical that her adjustment will not occur instantaneously. In other words, the author's message is to inspire those who face difficulties in their lives, emphasizing that life is not about giving up. Instead, one should persevere until achieving their goals. In conclusion, perseverance and the refusal to give up are integral parts of our lives, and it is up to us to surmount failure.
1458	10325	4	1	"In the story, the author concludes the narrative with the sentence ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" It is believed that the author ends the story in this manner because Saeng has acknowledged her failure but is resolute in attempting once more to attain her objective and ""take that test again."" Moreover, she is making a solemn pledge to herself, a vow not to abandon her goal."
1459	10326	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph as they are complementary, both revolving around the themes of things departing and returning, and the changing of seasons. It is as if they are reluctant to part ways yet are aware that they will soon reunite. This is the reason why the author combined the story with the paragraph, creating a harmonious and meaningful conclusion.
1460	10327	4	1	"The author conveys hope for the future in the concluding paragraph. Despite having recently failed her driver's test and being in the process of adapting to a new environment, Saeng finds solace in a hibiscus. ""It felt smooth and cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel."" This passage suggests that the recollection of ""an old friend"" was capable of elevating her spirits after a prior disappointment. It was evident that Saeng was ill - at ease in her surroundings, a fact noticed by her mother upon her arrival home. ""She paused as she noticed the tear stains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes."" Her daughter was struggling to adjust to the new environment, and despite the significant expense of a single flower, her mother understood. Amidst the prevailing negative sentiment throughout the story, once Saeng saw the geese and planted her ""winter"" hibiscus, she realized that what was once unfamiliar to her had now become familiar. Saeng finally comprehends that with the memory of home, she can achieve her goals and attain stability in a place other than her native land. She demonstrates that success can emerge from failure."
1461	10328	4	1	The author concluded the narrative within the paragraph. She does not desire for Saeng to claim the entire room for herself when it is quiet during her test - taking.
1462	10329	4	1	She asserts that currently, it is not the opportune moment to schedule the test. She states that she will defer the endeavor until spring, when the blossoms are in bloom, to undertake the test. @CAPS1 She is so enamored with the exotic flowers that she cannot bear to proceed now when the timing is not right. Thus, she declares that she will await the appropriate time to take the test.
1463	10330	4	1	Saeng will undertake the test in the spring when the climate is less frigid. She appreciates the period when the hibiscus is in bud as they emit a delightful fragrance. The pleasant scent evokes memories of her native country. Saeng has a preference for fried melon, as it leaves a golden - hued aftertaste on the tongue. She would choose it over a Big Mac.
1464	10331	4	1	There are numerous reasons why the author concludes the story with this particular paragraph.
1465	10332	4	1	"The author incorporated that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's ""comfort in her time of discomfort."" She is likely to feel more at ease when the hibiscus is budding, as she yearns for her homeland and the hibiscus serves as a reminder of it. She failed the test initially because she was not at ease in the new environment. However, when spring arrives, she will be more self - assured and comfortable as the hibiscus begins to bud."
1466	10333	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as earlier in the story, Saeng was discussing how she failed the test, which she desired to retake. Consequently, Saeng declared that in the next year, when the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will take the test once more.
1467	10334	4	1	The author concludes this paragraph to convey to Saeng that she will await their regrowth and attempt her test again. The hibiscus holds significant meaning for her, and she will persist because she does not wish to disappoint her mother anew. An instance where Saeng felt shame is when “her mother stared at her incredulously. But how could you?” Saeng aims to neither let herself nor her mother down. “Saeng vowed silently to herself,” promising that she will pass and respect both nature and elders.
1468	10335	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the story in this manner as it functions as a cliff - hanger. In the narrative, Saeng is distressed about failing her driving test. Having recently moved from Vietnam to the United States, she experiences a degree of homesickness. She encounters a familiar plant and purchases it for nineteen dollars as it uplifts her spirits, reminding her of the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story thus, it is evident that Saeng has not surrendered and intends to attempt to pass the driver's license test again. However, the outcome of whether she passes remains unknown, rendering it a cliff - hanger. This is the reason the author ended the story in this way.
1469	10336	4	1	Saeng has endured a tragic family loss and a relocation to an entirely unfamiliar world. The paragraph symbolizes a fresh start and a new beginning. “The snows melting” and “hibiscus budding” both signify new life. Saeng will adopt a positive outlook on life and accept her circumstances to make the most of them. Additionally, the author states, “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,” which parallels Saeng's newly - discovered perspective on life. Similar to the flower, a seed of hope has been planted in Saeng, and she is now prepared to flourish.
1470	10337	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by [ORGANIZATION1], the author is deeply sentimental about the Hibiscus plant as it evokes vivid memories of her homeland. The author concludes the story with that statement because it provides her with a goal. She once failed to secure a job, but in [MONTH1], believing the Hibiscus to be a symbol of good luck, she sets a target for when to retry for the job. When she saw the plant, it rekindled happy memories. In conclusion, certain objects can trigger memories, and it is the pleasant recollections that make life's experiences worth anticipating and hopeful for.
1471	10338	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner for several reasons. Firstly, it demonstrates that she is beginning to embrace this new life. Additionally, it presents an open - ended conclusion. It reveals her affinity for her new life for multiple reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had once regarded as peculiar had now become… almost commonplace,” which is when she starts to recognize that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not as unfavorable as she thought. This pertains to the geese and is referenced when she vows to take the test. Moreover, it shows how the hibiscus she recently planted has already become significant to her. Secondly, it evokes speculation about future outcomes. The reader is uncertain whether she will pass the test next time but presumes she will due to the determination in her vow. This is why the author concludes the story in this way: to illustrate her sentiments in her new life and leave room for readers to draw their own inferences.
1472	10339	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story where she fails the driving test, and thus includes her intention to retake it. Perhaps the plant serves or will serve as a symbol of good fortune for her. After the snow melts and the geese return, it will mark a fresh start. Moreover, it will be a pleasant development following her discovery of the plant.
1473	10340	4	1	The author concludes the paragraph with this passage as she desires to make another attempt. The author implies that the hibiscus she planted on @DATE1 did not thrive, and she is endeavoring once more this @DATE1 to cultivate a hibiscus plant. She will pass the test if she achieves success in the spring. This is the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude with this paragraph.
1474	10341	4	1	He deduces that when spring arrives, he will retake the test. This will afford her an additional opportunity to pass it. Consequently, this will provide her with another chance to act correctly.
1475	10342	4	1	She intends to retake the test @CAPS1 as she feels compelled to do so. She @CAPS2 that when the snow melts and the geese return, it signifies her aspiration to take the test in the spring.
1476	10343	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author @CAPS1 presents the sentence: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I opine that the recollection of home will aid her in taking the test. She employs the geese and the plant to evoke memories of home, and the presence of these surroundings renders her at ease.
1477	10344	4	1	Analogously to how the hibiscus flower endures during winter, Saeng aspires to exhibit the same tenacity. Saeng's failure in a test has instilled in her a sense of inadequacy. Saeng yearns to persevere; she wishes to endure, yet the arduous times she is experiencing pose significant challenges. When Saeng utters, “I – I failed the test,” it indicates her disappointment, as she, being a fighter, did not anticipate such an outcome. Hence, the author concludes the passage with Saeng stating, “When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This showcases Saeng's indomitable spirit, as she is resolute in striving amidst difficult circumstances.
1478	10345	4	1	The author positions this paragraph at the conclusion as it demonstrates that Saeng is seeking a fresh start in life. She now possesses something to sustain her throughout the upcoming year. She now awaits the return of winter to witness the hibiscus flower bloom once more, along with numerous subsequent blossoms. This shows that she has found a source of hope and purpose to carry her through difficult times.
1479	10346	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, I surmise that she concludes the story in this manner to illustrate that despite Saeng's test failure, she will endeavor again in the future, with the return of the geese symbolizing that time. Saeng is sorrowful as she longs for her homeland, and the sight of plants stirs nostalgic recollections. Consequently, she purchases a winter hibiscus to soothe and comfort herself and to remind her of home.
1480	10347	4	1	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she holds a deep affection for her garden. She reaches this conclusion as the story revolves around them and their garden, and eventually, the cold sets in, leaving them idle until spring. It implies that they harbor strong sentiments towards their endeavors, as evidenced by the statement “in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” Here, she desires to take the test to surmount difficulties and prove her ability to tend to her garden.
1481	10348	4	1	At this juncture, she resolved to retake an examination due to the transient nature of flowers, which come and go, while her academic grades are a once - in - a - time occurrence for her schoolwork. Instead, she prefers gardening over attending to her school assignments.
1482	10349	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as the winter hibiscus instilled a glimmer of hope in her. Additionally, her mother's understanding regarding her test failure played a role. This is precisely why the author brings the story to a close with this paragraph.
1483	10350	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with an air of optimism and anticipation for the future. She concludes her story with the statement, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will take the test again.” By ending the story in such a manner, it effectively showcases the hope that the hibiscus plant bestowed upon her after she failed her driver's test. The hibiscus brought Saeng one step closer to acclimating to her new abode. As stated in the story, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had once regarded as strange, through the quiet recurrence of season after season, were now almost familiar to her.” The way the author concludes the story serves to inspire a fresh start and a new chapter.
1484	10351	4	1	In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, penned by Minfong Ho, a young girl named Saeng endeavors to adapt to a new country, yet it proves to be an arduous, nearly insurmountable task. She is burdened by the stress of failing the driver's test and realizes that nothing is as it was back home. However, there is one thing she quickly identifies—a plant known as the “Winter Hibiscus.” This plant evokes memories of her former life in Vietnam. It aids her in persevering through difficult times, and she refuses to abandon her pursuits. This is precisely why Minfong Ho concludes the last paragraph by stating that Saeng will attempt the driving test once more when the hibiscus is in bloom. The flower conjures a sense of home in Vietnam, motivating her to persevere. Moreover, the author ends the story in this way to convey a theme. The theme is, “No matter how challenging a situation may be, one can overcome it. One simply has to discover the most advantageous approach.”
1485	10352	4	1	The author revisits that paragraph because in the story, Saeng is deeply remorseful for not having @CAPS1 the test. Now, Saeng is determined to make amends. She has sworn to herself that she will @CAPS1 the test. For instance, when one makes a personal commitment to accomplish a task, one does whatever it takes to achieve it and does not succumb to adversity. @CAPS3. This very essence encapsulates the main idea of the story: to retake the test and @CAPS1 it, to fulfill what needs to be done.
1486	10353	4	1	The rationale behind this author's inclusion of this story within this paragraph is that it continues to discuss Saeng. It portrays her as having a mind akin to a butterfly that was trapped and then burst forth, mirroring the relationship Saeng and her mother had. As a teenage girl, I can relate to Saeng on similar grounds.
1487	10354	4	1	In Minfong Ho's story “Winter Hibiscus,” it is evident that the concluding paragraph serves to illustrate that Saeng has not relinquished her efforts. When she states, “When they come back…then I will take that test again,” she is referring to the hibiscus and the geese, elements that evoke memories of her homeland. These reminders of home endow her with the strength and resolve to undertake the test once more. This exemplifies that despite her previous failure, Saeng remains steadfast and will persevere in her attempts. Undoubtedly, this is the intended purpose of the paragraph, to convey Saeng's unwavering determination.
1488	10355	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in such a manner to convey to the reader that following the departure of the snow, he intends to commence planting additional flora. The test serves to ensure the survival of his plants during the subsequent @DATE1. This approach by the author not only provides a sense of hope for the future growth but also emphasizes the importance of resilience in the face of environmental challenges.
1489	10356	4	1	In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus,” the author posits that Saeng experiences a profound sense of contentment when in the presence of the plant. She discovers tranquility within its presence as it evokes cherished childhood recollections. For instance, the description “And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton” underscores her affection for the plant's olfactory allure. When a leaf detached and she inhaled its fragrance, it instantly transported her back to memories of her grandmother. It is plausible that Minfong Ho has personally encountered similar experiences, which may have inspired the creation of this story. The narrative can resonate with individuals who have migrated from other countries and possess objects or experiences that trigger nostalgic memories. Just as the plant reminds Saeng of her past, a simple touch or whiff of a sweater can evoke vivid memories of my grandmother. Evidently, Ho's personal experiences have influenced the story, making it relatable to a broader audience.
1490	10357	4	1	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph to demonstrate how certain individuals silently vow due to their reluctance to express their innermost thoughts and emotions. Additionally, it could be because they harbor a lack of trust, not only in others but also in themselves. I recall a time when I adopted a similar demeanor. I withdrew from social interaction, preferring to seclude myself in my room and engage in introspection. My thoughts delved into existential questions, such as the destination of my soul after death and the possibility of reincarnation. I would sit in the darkness, lost in these ponderings. However, I eventually realized that as a young individual, I had a promising future ahead. I resolved to confront these profound questions when the appropriate time arrived. Consequently, I rekindled my social connections and resumed engaging with others. This personal experience aligns with the message the author conveys, highlighting the transient nature of such periods of self - isolation.
1491	10358	4	1	The author concludes this narrative by uttering this statement as the author intends for you to perceive that the character within the book is resolute. The author endeavors to convey a message advocating perseverance and renewed attempts. The character refuses to surrender and will surmount the test despite its arduousness.
1492	10359	4	1	The author is discussing horticulture and her aspiration to improve her skills in this domain during the spring. Presumably, she deems herself inadequate at gardening because her mother excels in it, and she desires to attain a comparable level of proficiency.
1493	10360	4	1	The purpose is to evoke the sentiment that Saeng harbors towards gardening. She is beseeching for the arrival of spring so that she can recommence the endeavor. She delights in observing the growth of plants until they yield edible produce. This is the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph.
1494	10361	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to illustrate determination and hope. The geese and the hibiscus serve as symbols of Saeng's determination, as they invariably return regardless of circumstances. Saeng will reappear to undertake the test, much like the geese will also return. The hibiscus also represents her as it has confronted adversity. It has been transported to new locations and endured new habitats, akin to Saeng, and will face a severe winter in the near future. Nevertheless, it always discovers a means to return and blossom in the spring, which is Saeng's aspiration by taking the driver's test. The author incorporated the final paragraph to demonstrate the symbolism among Saeng, the geese, and the hibiscus. This is the reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
1495	10362	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as he essentially aims to convey that every occurrence has a purpose, and that purpose may be intertwined with the seasons. She anticipates that she would perform better on her test in the spring solely because everything flourishes during that season.
1496	10363	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it demonstrates that despite relocating from her homeland, she can surmount these obstacles. Moreover, it indicates that she has greater confidence, which is why the author concluded her story with that paragraph.
1497	10364	4	1	“When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring. When the snows thaw and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I shall take that test once more.” I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it reflects that regardless of what transpires in his life, he will retake the test. In the story, it mentions that one of the blossoms had dropped, and Saeng carefully picked it up and inhaled its fragrance. Thus, I believe they tend to their garden and strive to keep it thriving during winter. This is my interpretation of the last paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
1498	10365	4	1	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph as it essentially encapsulates the entire narrative. The phrase “When the snow melts and the geese return” harks back to the onset of the story when Saeng commenced planting. This is the rationale behind the author's decision to end the story with this conclusive paragraph.
1499	10366	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. Firstly, the test holds significant importance for Saeng as it allows her to prove to herself that she is capable of passing it. Concluding with this paragraph also instills a sense of suspense in the reader regarding whether Saeng will pass or even attempt the test again. Lastly, this paragraph showcases Saeng's character traits, revealing her to be persistent, determined, and strong - willed.
1500	10367	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” at the story's conclusion, the author writes, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melts and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author makes this statement to convey to readers that if one stumbles, there is no shame in rising and trying again. When spring arrives and the birds cease their southward migration, she pledges to take the driver's test. After failing the driver's test, Saeng purchases a flower at a florist that reminds her of Vietnam. She brings it home and plants it in the garden. When she tells her mother of her failure, Saeng's mother is understanding and suggests she try again next time. In conclusion, the author writes the last paragraph as a moral lesson, emphasizing the importance of never giving up and persevering until one achieves their life goals.
1501	10368	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in such a manner to maintain an air of intrigue, leaving the audience in a state of speculation. It is posited that the author chose this ending to convey the protagonist's impending return, fully prepared to confront all challenges, including the test. By leaving the readers in suspense, the author aims to pique their curiosity, enticing them to discover the events upon the protagonist's return and her performance in the test. This vow was a personal commitment, as sharing it with others would risk disappointing them in the event of failure. Hence, this narrative conclusion serves a strategic purpose in engaging the reader.
1502	10369	4	1	The author concludes the story in this fashion as she implies her intention to return the following year to retake the test. Additionally, she expresses her desire to witness the growth of the plants, particularly the hibiscus. Owing to her profound appreciation and fondness for nature, she wishes to be present to observe their development. In essence, the author's conclusion reflects her connection to nature and her anticipation for future experiences.
1503	10370	4	1	The author concludes the story with this final paragraph to underscore the profound sentimental value and significance of the plant to Saeng. She intends to retake the test after winter, as the cold temperatures are inhospitable for the survival of delicate hibiscus, necessitating a winter - hardy variety. As stated, “Not like the kind we had before” (@NUM1), this emphasizes her quest to find a hibiscus akin to those from her home. Initially, Saeng exhibits self - disappointment, but in the last paragraph, she demonstrates courage and determination, highlighting her character growth.
1504	10371	4	1	Saeng silently vows to herself that upon their return, in spring when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. The author concludes the story in a way that prompts the reader to pose questions, much like in “@CAPS1’s @ORGANIZATION1,” where a modernist approach is employed. Instead of presenting a moral, the narrative encourages reader inquiry. For instance, in “@CAPS1’s @ORGANIZATION1,” the main character @PERSON1 runs away, leaving only the sound of a slamming door. Similarly, this story presents a twist as readers wonder about the nature of the test, whether the protagonist will seek new friendships, and if it is a personal resolution. This ambiguity leaves readers eager for more, potentially prompting them to revisit the story.
1505	10372	4	1	“Winter Hibiscus” is a relatively melancholic yet hopeful tale rich in symbolism. The author concludes the story with a confident ending that satisfies the reader. Two primary reasons underlie this conclusion: to infuse the ending with a hopeful tone and to associate the objects the protagonist encounters with spring. Thanks to Saeng's silent yet confident vow, the story ends on a hopeful note. After a difficult day, the author ensures Saeng has a goal to aspire to, also revealing her inner strength. The conclusion leaves the reader with a sense of hope and confidence. Moreover, the author uses this paragraph to link certain objects to spring; the geese symbolize her new residence, and the hibiscus represents her former home. By connecting these symbols, the author enables the reader to associate them with the renewal of spring. Overall, the author's conclusion is masterfully crafted, embodying hope, symbolizing spring, and leaving the reader content.
1506	10373	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she wishes to convey the message of perseverance. For instance, she intends to demonstrate that one should never abandon any endeavor, even in the face of failure. Hence, this is the reason why she ends the text in such a manner.
1507	10374	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she aims to convey her perspective effectively and foster an understanding of the passage's intricacies. The author aspires for the reader to internalize her message as if they had witnessed the events firsthand.
1508	10375	4	1	"The author concluded the story with the sentence to illustrate that since Saeng discovered the flower, she has acquired new hope and a rationale for passing the test. The flower served as a wellspring of inspiration, prompting her to reminisce about her homeland in Vietnam. ""I mean, not like the kind we had at - at,"" she mused. She found herself too tremulous to articulate the words at home. When Saeng transported the plant to her new abode and planted it in the garden, it was akin to bringing a fragment of Vietnam back, which alleviated her distress. The overall inspiration and the memories the flower evoked for Saeng enabled her to reconcile with her new home and provided her with a reason to embark afresh on her driving test."
1509	10376	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that when spring arrives, the flowers reappear, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud after the winter, she will resume her gardening activities.
1510	10377	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the statement, ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This conclusion is employed because it establishes a mood suggesting that Saeng is embracing the changes. Just as nature adapts to variations in climate and location, Saeng appears to appreciate her circumstances and has resolved to perceive them positively rather than negatively. The author uses the main character, Saeng, to convey the message that when encountering difficulties, one should persevere and attempt again."
1511	10378	4	1	I am convinced that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for numerous diverse reasons. One rationale for the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph is that she might attempt it once more. A second reason the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is that she presumably sought to endeavor to make her mother proud. A third reason the author may have concluded the story with this paragraph is that she likely genuinely felt that she had truly disappointed herself. In summary, if one makes an error in something, try again; perhaps one will perform significantly better.
1512	10379	4	1	Minfong Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with the lines “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to illustrate that there is perpetually hope for more favorable circumstances to transpire. Saeng had become despondent as she recollected her homeland in Vietnam. She yearned for her native abode and the sense of familiarity it entailed. The memories she missed tormented Saeng agonizingly as she was now far away and in an alien world. Nevertheless, the author began to disclose indications that @ORGANIZATION1 would embrace @LOCATION2 and discover some childhood recollections there as well. “Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and — yes — familiar to Saeng now.” Already, Saeng was growing accustomed to her surrounding area in @LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would preserve her @CAPS1 culture, traditions, and memories, just as the geese would assist her in feeling content and acclimated in @LOCATION2. As she maintained her @CAPS1 and “@CAPS3 culture through memories, she would continue to lead a prosperous life and pass her test. This is why Minfong Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with that particular paragraph.
1513	10380	4	1	The author concludes the story in “Winter Hibiscus” in a rather peculiar manner. The concluding sentence is “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It is notable that a part of the title appears in the concluding sentence, effectively concluding the entire narrative, including the characters within it.
1514	10381	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it demonstrates that the narrator is prepared. The narrator attempted the test once but was unsuccessful. She purchased a flower for herself to uplift her spirits. After her mother conversed with her, she felt improved. She became resolute to pass the driving test, much like the flower was determined to endure.
1515	10382	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it symbolizes the transformation in Saeng, among other aspects. The snow invariably melts when the seasons shift. The geese always return when the seasons change. The hibiscus will blossom when the seasons alter. Saeng will make another attempt when the seasons transition. However, she will also be a different individual. Recognizing that everything will change yet remain fundamentally the same, Saeng decides that she too will change. After observing the hibiscus and recalling her past, she has developed a greater appreciation for @CAPS1.
1516	10383	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the following paragraph: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This excerpt indicates that Saeng is resolved to retake the test, demonstrating her preparedness and confidence in passing it. Moreover, the author employs this paragraph to conclude the story as it implies an ending where Saeng is determined to retry the test. It showcases her faith in taking the test once more and her aspiration to make her mother proud by achieving a passing score. This is the rationale behind the author's choice to conclude the story with this paragraph."
1517	10384	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph due to the fact that spring brings warmer temperatures and a more pleasant atmosphere. Additionally, Saeng will have ample time during winter to thoroughly study for the upcoming spring. Moreover, as she mentions in the story, it aligns with the conclusion, signifying that she finally grasped the situation. She drew a parallel between her understanding and the behavior of the geese, which further emphasizes the significance of this conclusion in the story.
1518	10385	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it reflects what she solemnly vowed to herself. This vow serves as a pivotal element in the narrative, tying together the themes and character development. By including this paragraph at the end, the author effectively conveys the character's determination and the fulfillment of her self - made promise, thus providing a fitting conclusion to the story.
1519	10386	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author's intention in concluding the story with ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" was to illustrate how the hibiscus and other plants in the store symbolize Saeng. Upon entering the store, Saeng is inundated with memories of her life in Vietnam, as ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world."" At this moment, Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she spots another familiar plant in a pot, she muses, ""How strange to sit in a pot; back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs."" This symbolizes her state, as outside her home, she feels out of place and restricted, in contrast to her free - spirited nature in Vietnam. When Saeng takes the hibiscus plant home, her mother describes it as ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" Saeng identifies with this description and decides that once the hibiscus has overcome the hardships, she too will have grown and blossomed, and will then be ready to attain her goal."
1520	10387	4	1	"The author concluded the story with ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can endure difficult times, adapt to changes, and survive, she can as well. Saeng realizes that despite relocating to the United States and facing a different environment, she possesses the strength to persevere. Failing her driver's test does not imply her incapability; rather, it signifies an opportunity to try again with a fresh start, much like the hibiscus emerging anew after a challenging period. This conclusion showcases Saeng's resilience and her determination to overcome obstacles."
1521	10388	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this @CAPS1 to illustrate that Saeng has not relinquished her efforts. Early in the story, Saeng visits the greenhouse and begins to weep. Upon her return home, she tells her mother, “I—I failed the test.” Despite this setback, Saeng desires to return and make another attempt. This is the reason the author concluded with that particular paragraph.
1522	10389	4	1	The final paragraph was incorporated to portray the tenacity and adaptability to novel circumstances in Saeng and her family. Initially, Saeng harbored resentment over failing the test. However, after she recollects her homeland through the flower, she comes to terms with it. Just as the flower will blossom, she will transform into a new individual and consequently pass the test. An instance of her resolve to cope with the situation is that she does forge friendships, and although the food she offered was declined, she did not yield. The moment of emotional collapse occurred when she received the flower. Once she arrived home, it was over, and once again, she embraced the change.
1523	10390	4	1	The author includes the last paragraph as Saeng is not going to abandon her efforts and will endeavor again. It is speculated that Saeng purchased the flower because it was present in her homeland, and it would offer her solace. For instance, Saeng began to shed tears as she yearned for her native land.
1524	10391	4	1	It is posited that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he believes that when the flowers reappear, they will be in a more favorable state. It is hypothesized that he anticipates a more successful test the next time around.
1525	10392	4	1	The author concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with the paragraph as it perpetuates the theme of adapting to life's vicissitudes. In the story, Saeng has migrated from Vietnam to the United States, which represents a significant transformation. The plants have also undergone changes. The hibiscus evokes memories of Vietnam for Saeng, yet it is distinct. The mother in the story remarks, “Its flowers aren't as lovely, but it's robust enough to endure the frigid winter months here, this winter hibiscus.” The hibiscus is also relevant to the theme as it is capable of adjusting to alterations. The final paragraph discusses the melting of snow, the return of geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. These are all changes that the author employs to link to the theme. This enhances the comprehension of the story's message. Additionally, the tone of the last paragraph is optimistic, which imparts a positive sentiment to the reader. The tone contributes to the story's theme.
1526	10393	4	1	The narrative revolves around his failure in the test. She asserts that she will make an attempt the following year when the geese return.
1527	10394	4	1	I surmise that he implies the cyclical nature of seasons and the inevitable recurrence of winter. In my view, this represents the test.
1528	10395	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the narrative with the provided paragraph to illustrate that she bears resemblance to the hibiscus and geese. Initially, both the geese and the hibiscus possess a common objective: to endure the winters. Geese migrate south during winter to maintain warmth. This parallels Saeng's situation, as both have relocated to a novel environment where adaptation is requisite. Additionally, Saeng must experience winter alongside the hibiscus. The hibiscus must exhibit resilience to surmount winter, which indicates that Saeng resembles her hibiscus, as she too must be robust to overcome the test. If her hibiscus can conquer its trial, winter, then she can persevere and transform her own circumstances.
1529	10396	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” incorporates the statement “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because it demonstrates her capacity to adapt to change while still cherishing memories of her native country. An instance of how she preserves her cultural heritage is “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac.” This reveals that she can continue to savor the cuisine of her homeland while embracing new culinary experiences in her new abode. In conclusion, the excerpt showcases the author's ability to harmoniously blend both cultures and find contentment.
1530	10397	4	1	There exist numerous potential reasons for the author's decision to conclude the story with this particular paragraph. This paragraph may harbor multiple interpretations, each holding significance for the narrative. I believe that the author includes this passage to convey that with the arrival of spring, she will have a multitude of motives to retake the driving test. This paragraph can be dissected to yield diverse meanings. I construe it as suggesting that when spring returns, she will embark on a fresh start. The melting snow symbolizes all the hardships she endured in the past year. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus signify their renewal and readiness to commence the new year. They, too, are returning, preparing to initiate a new chapter in their lives. This passage is placed at the end to depict how Saeng endeavors to put behind her the memory of her driving test failure. She is utilizing this interlude to prepare for her subsequent attempt at the driving test. She believes that once she has overcome the adverse experiences of the previous year, she will be able to move forward and successfully pass the driving test on her next try. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's strategy for resolving her difficulties. The manner in which one interprets this paragraph offers distinct insights into its intended message. I perceive it as emblematic of a new beginning that she will encounter in the coming year.
1531	10398	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative with the passage “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. By doing so, the author implies that Saeng will be prepared for the challenges when they return.
1532	10399	4	1	The author concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus” by having Saeng pledge to retake the test. This ending was employed to illustrate the themes of the narrative. One theme of the story is perseverance; the winter hibiscus endures the long winter and survives, which inspires Saeng to persist in her efforts. Another theme is the conquest of obstacles. The flower confronts numerous perils yet still manages to bloom. Saeng desires to surmount her hurdles and pass the test. Thus, the story's ending effectively showcases these themes.
1533	10400	4	1	The author concludes this segment as it renders the story more distinctive. For instance, when Saeng stated that she meant when the plants returned. It also imparts a certain element of intrigue to the ending, rather than continuing to discourse about the V - formation of geese and diverting the reader's attention. Additionally, she also implied the return of the geese.
1534	10401	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with that passage where the girl perceives this plant as a symbol of fortitude and faith. Hence, she will undertake the test the following year when the plant reappears. She genuinely adores the plant and hopes it will bring her good fortune.
1535	10402	4	1	I opine that the author concluded the story with that particular phrase to convey that the protagonist will not capitulate; regardless of the difficulty, she persists in her endeavors. The girl declares in the story “I failed the test,” and subsequently, at the story's conclusion, asserts “I will take that test again,” indicating her refusal to accept perpetual failure. Moreover, I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to prompt the reader to ponder whether she will ever succeed in passing the test.
1536	10403	4	1	I surmise that the author penned this as, regardless of the test she must undertake, she was previously ill - prepared. However, now, whenever the geese migrate back and the hibiscus blossoms reappear, she will be equipped to take the test. Perhaps she lacked mental readiness. In conclusion, I opine that when she states that upon the return of the geese and the hibiscus, she will take the test, it implies that she was neither physically nor mentally prepared for it earlier.
1537	10404	4	1	Authors meticulously select their closing paragraphs. This author chose to conclude the narrative with this particular paragraph because all the elements the actor encounters in the last paragraph hold special significance in the characters' perspectives. There are reasons why the author decided to end the story with that paragraph. The author's choice of the concluding paragraph is of great importance. The character declares, “When this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake that test.” The hibiscus she mentions symbolizes the capacity to surmount obstacles. In the story, it depicts the girl overcoming a failed test and attempting it again. This is the rationale behind the author's conclusion. The author also writes, “When the snow melts and the geese return.” To the character, this represents new beginnings and opportunities. This gives the character the assurance that she will pass the test the next time. The author includes that paragraph at the end to symbolize new beginnings, opportunities, and the ability to overcome obstacles. Authors select their final paragraphs for specific motives, and this author is no exception, doing so to symbolize various concepts.
1538	10405	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph due to an adage suggesting that during cold and quiet periods, she is internally passionate, yet when the snow melts and spring arrives, she becomes more sociable and engages in numerous enjoyable activities. This contrast in her state of being throughout different seasons serves as a poignant reason for the author's choice of conclusion, encapsulating the character's transformation and the cyclical nature of life.
1539	10406	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese, which fly south in an exquisite @CAPS1 formation each season, serve as a seasonal marker. Thus, she resolves that @CAPS2, she will retake the test when the geese return and the hibiscus plant begins to bud. For instance, she ruminates, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she once deemed strange had, through the quiet recurrence of seasons, become nearly familiar to her.” @CAPS2, as she gazes at the geese, she is faintly reminded of a somewhat similar experience she endured. This connection between the natural phenomena and her personal journey is the likely reason for the author's concluding choice.
1540	10407	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to emphasize that one can overcome defeat or failure by awaiting the opportune “season” to persevere anew. Essentially, the hibiscus, a plant of great significance to the narrator and her mother, was on the verge of dying, and they dug a hole to aid its growth. When it thrives again, it signifies a better - lived existence. When Saeng associates this with the test, it represents her chance to succeed. The story, through this paragraph, symbolizes an impending new beginning. This truly implies that a situation will recur, enabling one to obtain what was previously missed. The story and the paragraph underscore that life is about the cyclical process of budding and renewal.
1541	10408	4	1	She eagerly anticipates the time when, upon the snow's melting and the abatement of the frigid outdoor conditions, the flowers will re - emerge and flourish. Moreover, she is set to retake the test she previously failed when the geese return alongside the blooming flowers.
1542	10409	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng, akin to the geese and the hibiscus, will make a comeback and retain hope. In the story, Saeng experiences a degree of despondency as she finds herself in a new country and has just failed her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop evokes painful emotional recollections for her, yet simultaneously offers a great deal of solace. Later in the tale, she plants the hibiscus outdoors in the garden with her mother. As her mother enters the house, Saeng observes the geese soaring overhead. “Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) recognized that numerous things she once regarded as peculiar had, through the quiet recurrence of seasons, become nearly familiar to her. Similar to the geese.” Saeng was aware that the geese would return in spring, just as she would attempt her driving test anew. The hibiscus would also be in full bloom, bestowing hope upon her. This is the significance of the final paragraph in the story “Winter Hibiscus”.
1543	10410	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to showcase Saeng's unwavering tenacity. This concept of her resolve to achieve success can be associated with the plant she brings home. The plant, which she knew grew freely in her former abode, was found potted in the United States, constraining its growth. Analogously, Saeng's new country appears unfamiliar, and she feels a sense of displacement.
1544	10411	4	1	The author concludes the story with Saeng resolving to retake the test, which effectively integrates the overarching theme and principal events of the narrative. The central theme of the story posits that one can acclimate to a new environment by discerning its beauty and identifying parallels with one's former home. Saeng remarks that “many of the things she once deemed strange had, through the serene succession of seasons, become almost familiar to her, much like the geese.” When in the greenhouse, the plants transport her back to memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng struggled to adapt to novel circumstances after relocating to @LOCATION2, yet she remained steadfast in surmounting these challenges, just as she had overcome the disparities between @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. The author's decision to conclude the story by referencing the geese, the hibiscus, and the retaking of the test serves to demonstrate all the ways in which Saeng is adapting to her new life. It shows both her and the reader that she can overcome novel obstacles. She vows to herself that she can succeed, foreshadowing her future achievements and her ability to adapt to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.
1545	10412	4	1	The author concludes the story with the particular paragraph because it marks the culmination of one phase and the inception of a new beginning. The author employs sensory elements within the narrative. Winter, the current season, is gradually giving way to spring. Despite Saeng failing her test during the winter, a time when most life wanes, she eagerly awaits spring to retake the test. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus signify the arrival of spring, bringing new life. Saeng, too, will experience a rebirth in her test - taking endeavor, aiming to pass and gain the ability to drive. As the spring season unfolds, it will bestow new life upon all.
1546	10413	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it encapsulates the essence of the entire story in a concise and condensed manner.
1547	10414	4	1	This paragraph serves as an excellent means to conclude the story due to its relevance to the test. The narrator declares her intention to attempt the test again in the spring.
1548	10415	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it epitomizes the core of the narrative, precisely delineating what transpired at the end, as if the events throughout the story were analogous to the growth and flourishing of a flower.
1549	10416	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the tale with what appears to be an incomplete paragraph. The girl Saeng pledges to retake her driver's test upon the arrival of spring. While holding the plant, Saeng experienced a sense of coldness and helplessness, mirroring the state of the plant. “Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind.” Saeng's mother's reassurance that she was content with Saeng's choice facilitated Saeng's personal growth. “I'm glad you got it,” her mother remarks. Her mother also comments, “look how root - bound it is, poor thing,” which, in a sense, depicts Saeng's tenacious attachment to her country. Saeng's mother further assures her that the plant will undoubtedly survive. When spring arrives, the plant will regain its strength, and so will Saeng. This is the rationale behind the author's decision to end the story at that juncture.
1550	10417	4	1	The author concludes the story by elucidating the girl's affinity with the plant and the symbolism of the geese. The “Winter hibiscus” represents her link to her homeland. She asserts that she will retake her driving test when her plant blossoms and demonstrates courage, indicating that she will follow suit. The geese flying south symbolize her personal journey, as she will take the test when the geese return from their migration, paralleling her return from her own odyssey.
1551	10418	4	1	The author crafted the concluding paragraph in the manner she did for multiple reasons. The primary rationale behind this is that she aimed to conclude the narrative on a more lighthearted note. Throughout the story, there was a melancholic, nostalgic tone that made the reader long for the past. The author intended to emphasize the importance of resilience, even if one does not relish their current circumstances. Additionally, the author sought to showcase the fortitude of the main character, Saeng. Despite having just failed a test in a novel, unfamiliar world, she still desires to persevere. This adds greater depth to the character, rendering her less static and more dynamic. This is an excellent story to peruse if you are homesick and require something to propel you forward.
1552	10420	4	1	The author concludes with that statement as it indicates her need for time. She requires time to acclimate to her new abode, much like a hibiscus needs to establish roots in the novel soil it occupies. When she is at the orchard, she beholds the hibiscus and is inundated with memories of her former home, which makes her weep yet also elicits a sense of contentment simultaneously.
1553	10421	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes that passage in the story to demonstrate patience. Saeng is expected to await the arrival of spring, perhaps in the hope that it will evoke the feeling of her hometown. She favors spring over winter. She delights in the return of the birds and geese in spring, as they depart during winter. This, I believe, is the reason the author concludes that passage.
1554	10422	4	1	“When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow dissipates and the geese reappear and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I shall retake that test.” The author has left her native land and relocated to another country. She now finds herself in an unfamiliar locale. Everything that surrounds her is novel and largely unknown. By concluding the story with this quotation, it implies that the author still harbors hope of adapting to her new dwelling. When she left her home, she did not merely abandon a building; she left behind her homeland, the people she cherished, and an innumerable array of memories. At times, she may have felt out of place as she was no longer within her comfort zone. She is now “outside the box,” in an entirely new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant transported her back to her memories and the affection she held for her former home. Then she was jolted back to reality and was overcome with sorrow, “failing her test.” The concluding sentence reveals that the author is willing to endeavor to thrive in this new environment and remains resolute in passing her personal test of adaptation.
1555	10423	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and this hibiscus is in bloom, then I will retake that test.” This implies that she will take the test, hoping to succeed so as to please her mother and gain her support. She selected spring because spring symbolizes the rebirth of nature, and Saeng wishes to retake the test with a clear and unburdened mind. I believe this is the reason the author chose to place this paragraph at the end of the story.
1556	10424	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph for several substantial reasons. Throughout the tale, Saeng grapples with her past and endeavors to surmount it. The paragraph serves to impart a sense of finality to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus, she informs her mother that she was powerless to help it and could not overcome her past. Saeng stated, “I - I failed the test.” When she utters “the test,” she refers to the capacity to deal with the loss of her grandmother and homeland and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph, Saeng declares that she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In summary, the author employs the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and address the emotional hurdles Saeng encounters.
1557	10425	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as she aims to end the narrative on a hopeful note. For instance, since relocating to the United States, she experiences profound homesickness. Moreover, she failed the driver's examination. “She found she was still too tremulous to utter the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” This quotation contributes to the portrayal of the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate that when spring arrives, she will commence anew and rejuvenate her life in @LOCATION2.
1558	10426	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because Saeng is elucidating to the readers that she will retake the test when the opportune moment arrives. When circumstances appear to be improving, she will attempt the test once more. This is the reason why the author utilized that paragraph to conclude her story.
1559	10427	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” penned by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator visits a greenhouse replete with numerous flowers, yet one in particular captivates her attention: a “winter” hibiscus plant. This plant evokes memories of her homeland and all that transpired there. It also reminds her of her grandmother's long, silky gray hair and how she used to watch her dry it in the sun and then assist her in knotting it into a bun with a bud of this plant nestled within. The author concludes the story in this manner as it contradicts her statement when she says, “I - I failed the test,” and the end of the passage states, “..., then I will take the test again.”
1560	10428	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the girl Saeng failed the driver's test. “I - I failed the test,” Saeng remarked. She purchased a hibiscus as the flower evoked memories of her home and the hibiscus she had at her residence. At the conclusion, she asserts that she will retake the test when the geese return, the snow has melted, and the hibiscus is in bloom. I believe she does this because she requires time to deliberate on matters, reminisce about her homeland, and establish a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is analogous to Saeng. Both have erred or failed at something; Saeng failed the test, and the hibiscus was confined to a pot. However, they are both poised to rectify the adverse situation.
1561	10429	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus” penned by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in such a manner to convey the resolve and newly - discovered impetus that Saeng attained through purchasing the familiar plant. Despite failing her test, encountering a plant that evoked memories of her homeland and grandmother infused her with the motivation to retake the test. She was determined to make her life in the new country progress favorably, regardless of the circumstances. “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky...” The author incorporated details about the geese to symbolize moving forward. Just as the geese depart and return, so will Saeng. She failed the test on her initial attempt, yet obtaining the plant and observing the birds spurred her to try again. “Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she once regarded as peculiar had become... familiar to her.” The geese were among the elements mentioned that had grown extremely familiar to her in her new abode. Concluding the account with a mention of the geese communicates to the reader that she is gradually but assuredly learning to adapt to her unfamiliar new home. Discovering the plant was beneficial as it was already a familiar presence. “Saeng felt a jolt of recognition so intense that it was nearly visceral. ‘@CAPS1,’ Saeng said.” After failing her driver’s test, entering the florist’s shop and finding that plant provided her with solace. It made this new place feel more like home than it initially did. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting. Concluding the story in this way demonstrated to the reader that she was adapting and learning to cope with a challenging situation in a soothing manner.
1562	10430	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The author concluded the story with that @CAPS1 because she is suggesting that when the year commences anew and restarts, she too will embark on a fresh start. She implies that when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus begins to bud, they all initiate a new beginning. Thus, when she goes to take the test, it will be a new year.
1563	10431	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concluded her story with statements related to the fact that @CAPS1 failed her driving test. Saeng shed tears upon recognizing her past through a flower. Moreover, her purchase of dok malik seeds indicates the reason the story ended as it did, for it foreshadows what will happen in the next season.
1564	10432	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination. By stating that she will take the test again, it becomes evident that she is resolute. Even though Saeng failed her driver's test, she is not going to abandon her efforts.
1565	10433	4	1	The author employed that sentence because the snow is thawing and the geese are returning. The flowers are in the process of budding, which is the rationale behind my belief that the author used that sentence. Scribed by @ORGANIZATION1.
1566	10434	4	1	I am convinced that this constituted an excellent denouement to the narrative. When Saeng utters, “When they come back,” she is alluding to the flowers. When they return in a state of vitality. “In the spring” indicates the time when the flowers will resurface. “When the snows melt and the geese return” implies that subsequent to winter (when the snows dissolve) and when the geese make their return (during spring). “And this Hibiscus is budding” conveys that when the flowers bloom anew in the spring. “Then I will take the test again,” she asserts that after all these events transpire, she will retake the examination (in the spring). This demonstrates that Saeng will be observing all these phenomena unfold and counting down until spring arrives once more, so that she can retake the test. She is prepared for spring to commence, enabling her to study, pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This shall be her objective throughout the winter, until spring makes its appearance!
1567	10435	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with that particular ending because during spring, when all things come into bloom. Moreover, she would not be able to concentrate while snow blankets the landscape. Thus, when the hibiscus begins to bud, that is precisely when she will be capable of retaking her test. I surmise that the author crafted this ending because it holds significance for her, and this conclusion effectively ties up the idea that the right season can bring the right state of mind for her to face the test.
1568	10436	4	1	This denouement of the story instills a sense of optimism for the future. The young girl is disheartened by her failure in the test yet retains hope for what lies ahead. In the narrative, the narrator remarks, “She lifted her head.” This quotation signifies that she is not going to abandon her efforts and surrender but will persevere until she achieves success. The conclusion of the story prompts readers to ponder whether she will exert greater effort and pass the test on her second attempt. When she states, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this reveals that she is akin to the geese as they are both embarking on a hard - fought journey. Additionally, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding,” she is suggesting that when everything comes to life and reaches its zenith, she will take the test because she will possess the utmost confidence. The author concludes the story to illustrate that there is hope for the future and that she will not relinquish her aspirations. Although she is distressed about failing the test, she will undoubtedly be primed to pass it in the spring, leaving a positive and inspiring note for the readers.
1569	10437	4	1	The author brings the story to a close with this paragraph for several reasons, which likely contribute to the overall theme and message the author wishes to convey, thus concluding the story in a meaningful way.
1570	10438	4	1	Saeng is cognizant that it will be a considerable period before she will concern herself with schoolwork again. That is the rationale behind the author concluding the story with that paragraph, as it effectively captures Saeng's current state of mind and the long - term perspective she has regarding her academic responsibilities.
1571	10439	4	1	The author terminates the story with that paragraph, as he intends to emphasize that the girl is not entirely discontented with leaving her abode. He concluded thus because he wished to demonstrate that there is hope for her to learn to cherish her new dwelling.
1572	10440	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this sentence as Saeng requires a respite before retaking the examination. Saeng is drawing a comparison between disparate elements; blossoms and taking a test. This comparison holds significance. Hence, the author concludes the story with this sentence.
1573	10441	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to illustrate that the girl will emulate the hibiscus. When the hibiscus next blossoms, the girl will be prepared for the test, will retake it, and will succeed. The author aims to convey that the girl will not capitulate and will make another attempt to ensure she passes. The author incorporates the hibiscus to demonstrate that the girl and the flower will reach their peak simultaneously, and she will pass the test.
1574	10442	4	1	In my estimation, the author concludes the story with that sentence as perhaps Saeng has an affinity for spring and can focus more effectively with her favored flower, which she believes is emblematic of her life.
1575	10443	4	1	The author concludes the story in such a manner to showcase the theme of perseverance. Additional instances of perseverance are exemplified by the “winter hibiscus.” Another example is her pledge to pass the test. Therefore, this is the reason the author concludes the story in this way.
1576	10444	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it pertains to the same theme that initiated the story. To introduce the tale, the author recounts Saeng's failure in her driver's test and her subsequent encounter with a familiar plant she desires to purchase. The middle part of the story delves into her struggle to adapt to her new abode. Thus, to conclude the narrative, the author posits that Saeng will retake her driver's test once the flowers commence budding and the geese emerge. The flower and the geese evoke memories of her homeland, indicating that reflecting on her home and the objects that instill a sense of belonging comfort her and aid her in surmounting obstacles.
1577	10445	4	1	Authors employ a plethora of techniques to enhance their stories. In the absence of these techniques, a story may appear insipid, mediocre, or unappealing. Author Minfong Ho conveys the notion that Saeng will endeavor to retake the test. Rather than simply stating this fact, he has her vow on the geese that she will do so. The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate the intensity of her sentiment towards the test.
1578	10446	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it links the hibiscus to Saeng's trials and triumphs. Just as Saeng cannot abandon her efforts and must retake the test, the winter hibiscus must endure the harsh, unforgiving winter and re - emerge robustly. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope, and Saeng regards them as her source of hope. Throughout the story, the hibiscus offers solace to Saeng as they remind her of home. The author incorporates this element as numerous individuals can relate to this experience and find hope in such things. For Saeng, the knowledge that the hibiscus will return annually under those circumstances reassures her that she will thrive in her new environment.
1579	10447	4	1	"I surmise that the author concludes the story with that paragraph to signify a new beginning. The geese are returning to resume their lives, the hibiscus will be in bloom, and she will retake the test. At the onset, Saeng was despondent about leaving her native country and grandmother. She experienced ""a wave of loss so profound and intense that it pricked Saeng's eyes and swept over her."" She recalled how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between sidewalk cracks. Saeng's statement in the last paragraph demonstrates that she has found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past have guided her, and now she is prepared to retake her driver's test."
1580	10448	4	1	I believe the author concludes this story with this concluding paragraph because the entire narrative revolves around how she finds solace in the plants. She wishes to await the change in weather and the return of the geese before taking her test. I opine that she wants to wait so that she can feel more at ease in her surroundings, clear her mind, and perform optimally on the test.
1581	10449	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it demonstrates that Saeng desires to retake the test, yet she wishes to do so when all other elements of positivity and felicity return, akin to the plant and the geese. This assertion holds true since Saeng states, ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This showcases her maturity and contentment. She is willing to undertake a challenging and perhaps unenjoyable task when everything else has returned and is in a state of happiness. Just as she arrived in a state of sorrow, when the geese and the plant return, she intends to assist them through this period and bring them happiness as well. In this manner, they can all experience happiness simultaneously."
1582	10450	4	1	The short story “Winter Hibiscus,” penned by author Minfong Ho, concludes with the protagonist, Saeng, vowing to herself that in the spring, when the geese reappear and the winter hibiscus commences to bud, she will retake the driver's test she previously failed. Minfong Ho crafts this story with rich imagery and symbolism. The hibiscus discovered in the floral shop symbolizes a connection for Saeng to her homeland, while the bitter melon, which Saeng adores but is intolerable to the people in @LOCATION1, represents Saeng's arduous struggle to connect with the inhabitants of @LOCATION1. For Saeng, the budding hibiscus and the returning geese signify a fresh opportunity to pass her driver's test and better assimilate into life in @LOCATION1.
1583	10451	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as she aims to illustrate that Saeng does not capitulate and that nature bestows @CAPS1 with strength. The conclusion demonstrates Saeng's perseverance by indicating that she intends to retake the test, despite having failed it earlier that day. Moreover, it reveals that nature endows Saeng with strength, as it is stated that she will retake the test when the geese return, the hibiscus buds, and the snow melts in spring. Nature imparts strength to her as it evokes memories of her former residence and her grandmother. In summary, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to convey that Saeng is not a quitter and that nature instills in her strength and confidence.
1584	10452	4	1	The character, Saeng, encounters both internal and external conflicts. Saeng failed her driver's test and continued to yearn for Vietnam. The denouement of the story was an exemplary choice for concluding the narrative. The flock of @CAPS1 geese symbolized her transformation. She once felt awkward and out of place. Many aspects were novel to her. Saeng came to realize that life was not so dire for her. The planting of the “winter hibiscus” also represented her metamorphosis. It indicated how she would embark on a new beginning and proceed joyfully. Saeng will “plant a new seed.” The ending was aptly selected for the story as it foreshadows Saeng's future. The story is inspiring, and the ending significantly contributes to this effect.
1585	10453	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate how Saeng correlates the hibiscus's triumph over difficulties with her own conquest of challenges. Saeng is drawing a parallel between the hibiscus and herself. If the hibiscus can acclimate to its environment, then she can as well. And if the hibiscus endures the winter, then she too can persevere, and she will retake the test she previously failed. Additionally, prior to this, she remarks that things that were once unfamiliar to her now seem familiar, such as the geese. Subsequently, she observes them flying overhead in a V - formation. They too are adapting to their surroundings by migrating to a warmer location, and Saeng can also adapt.
1586	10454	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that sentence as she anticipates the return of spring, envisioning the opportunity to cultivate additional flora and witness their blossoming and revitalization.
1587	10455	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it demonstrates Saeng's tenacity and refusal to surrender. After failing her driver's test, Saeng discovered a hibiscus on her way home, which evoked memories of her former residence. Subsequently, she visited the greenhouse or flower shop and procured one. Upon her return, she planted the hibiscus, which serves as a source of motivation, preventing her from giving up. When the hibiscus begins to bud, Saeng will retake the test.
1588	10456	4	1	"The author selected that paragraph to conclude the story because it represents the opportune moment for Saeng to rectify her past error. Saeng tearfully exclaimed, ""I - I failed the test!"" This admission signifies her setback in an area where she believed she excelled. Subsequently, she offered assistance, stating, ""Here, let me help, mother,"" as she took the shovel from her mother. Saeng is endeavoring to enhance her gardening skills so that when she attempts to correct her mistake, she will achieve a better outcome. As the reader can discern, Saeng aspires to pass the test to affirm her status as a proficient gardener, akin to her mother."
1589	10457	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as it piques readers' curiosity, compelling them to peruse the subsequent installment to ascertain her performance on the test. In the narrative, she initially failed the test; however, following a period of transformation, she is eager to retake it, confident in her improved capabilities compared to her previous attempt.
1590	10458	4	1	Since all the elements within this paragraph are present somewhere in the story, they are intricately intertwined. Just as the plant adapts to its new environment, she learns to acclimate to her new homeland.
1591	10459	4	1	I would assert that the author concluded this story with the given paragraph as they aimed to maintain a high degree of consistency. They intended to provide the reader with an exemplary illustration and a comprehensive understanding of the text. In summary...
1592	10460	4	1	The rationale for incorporating the story within the paragraph is that they pertain to the same subject matter. Presumably, the inclusion of the story alongside the paragraph was to demonstrate the harmonious relationship between the mother and daughter and how they can collaborate on various endeavors. Subsequently, the story details their plan to travel to Canada together.
1593	10461	4	1	The author opts to conclude the story with this paragraph to showcase the fortitude and self - assurance that Saeng possesses. Stating that she would endeavor to retake the test in the spring exemplifies her confidence and her anticipation of a new beginning. Moreover, the author concludes the story in this manner because following her test failure, Saeng suffered from a lack of self - confidence. After conversing with her mother and sensing her mother's understanding, Saeng resolved to persevere until she successfully passed the test.
1594	10462	4	1	I surmise that when she retakes the test, it will be in the spring, and she will endeavor to attain a passing grade. She refrained from shedding tears in her mother's presence. I believe she will redeem herself and ultimately pass the test.
1595	10463	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to convey to the readers that although she was defeated, she will rise again and retake the test. This is an astute way to end the narrative as it depicts her unwavering determination to pass the test. She will not yield and will exert every effort to achieve a passing score.
1596	10464	4	1	The rationale behind the author concluding the story with that particular paragraph is to illustrate that she remains steadfast and will undertake the task when she attains readiness. The basis for this assertion is that she engages in the test at a time when she desires and feels at ease. These are the reasons I am convinced that the author chose to end the story with that paragraph.
1597	10465	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story in this manner to exemplify perseverance. Saeng states, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This statement symbolizes acclimation to change. Eventually, she will fully adapt to her new abode; it merely requires time. Provided she persists, she will succeed. In the final paragraph, Saeng declares, “when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Just as the seasons rejuvenate, she will make a comeback. I believe this concluding paragraph was included to demonstrate that everyone should persevere as things simply demand time.
1598	10466	4	1	This statement reveals what the author infers about the story. In essence, it showcases the story's theme. The message is that if one encounters failure, they should persevere and try again. This is precisely what the statement conveys: she failed her tasks, so come spring when the hibiscus blossoms anew, she will endeavor to complete her task. Moreover, the statement implies that one should never abandon their efforts. Saeng had failed the test, uttering, “I - I failed the test.” This reflects her profound sadness and despondency, as the tone in which the statement was delivered was notably somber and dejected. Despite her distress, Saeng is aware that she will attempt to pass the test the following year. Overall, the sentence reveals what the author concludes and perceives about the story “Winter Hibiscus.”
1599	10467	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” for multiple reasons. Firstly, Saeng resolves to be as tenacious as the hibiscus in passing her driving test. Saeng's mother remarks that it is “strong enough to make it through,” and Saeng determines to emulate its strength and surmount the test. Secondly, the mention of the geese in the final paragraph serves to indicate that she is growing accustomed to her new environment as the geese “sound familiar.” Despite her longing for her former home, she is adapting. Ultimately, one can deduce that by referencing the plant, which symbolizes her homeland, and the geese, which symbolize her new home, she acknowledges that while she misses her old home, she is beginning to adjust to her new country and realizes her belonging. She understands that allowing her past to impede her progress will not aid her in passing the test, and like the plant and the geese, she will return and persevere.
1600	10468	4	1	The author concluded this paragraph within the story because I surmise that he intends to convey a message to the reader. The author is suggesting that if a plant can endure the frigid winter, then she can successfully pass her driver's test. This is the reason I believe the author incorporated that paragraph.
1601	10469	4	1	I surmise that the author concluded the story in such a manner as she delights in observing the geese, holds a profound affection for spring, and aspires to undertake the test and achieve success. Meanwhile, she is diligently preparing for it.
1602	10470	4	1	The rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph is that the author opines that Saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus by her side. This belief stems from the hibiscus possessing certain distinctive qualities. Moreover, it evokes memories of the place where she resided before relocating to @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng appeared out of place and seemed uncertain about her course of action.
1603	10471	4	1	The author exhibits remarkable creativity. He concludes the story by depicting how the hibiscus is growing and that she will retake the test. She is convinced that she will perform better once the snow has melted. The author ended the story in this way because Saeng was deeply disheartened by failing the test, but with the solace provided by the hibiscus, she will be capable of improving her performance. He also concludes the story with that paragraph as the climax occurred when she failed the test, and the author needed to resolve what would transpire with Saeng regarding the test.
1604	10472	4	1	He concludes the story in such a fashion because the test was the central topic he was addressing.
1605	10473	4	1	"In the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrator expresses her yearning to take and this time triumph in the driver's test she failed earlier that day. She ""silently vowed to herself"" that she would achieve success in something at which she had previously failed. This serves as a significant concluding message as it demonstrates that the author will surmount obstacles in her future. The majority of the story revolves around the sorrow the narrator experiences due to her longing for her homeland. Saeng misses her grandmother and the flora of Vietnam, and she even purchases a hibiscus plant to evoke memories of her native land. Additionally, she is not finding @LOCATION2 agreeable as she has already encountered failure in her new abode. Nevertheless, the end of the story presents a contrast to this, as Saeng vows to attain success in the future."
1606	10474	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the provided paragraph as it effectively showcases the substantial growth of the main character. She has come to realize that if a fragile blossom such as the hibiscus can endure challenging periods, she too is capable of persevering. The struggle for survival in nature parallels Saeng's hardships in a novel environment. She discerns that one will gradually acclimate to their surroundings, and after a certain duration, it will feel as familiar as home. The principle of adaptation is evident throughout this story, whether demonstrated by nature or a child's life; it is consistently present. Consequently, the author would concur that the story's conclusion exemplifies the biological and psychological development of Saeng.
1607	10475	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng is newly arrived in @LOCATION1. While yearning for her homeland, she encounters a hibiscus in a floral establishment. After transporting the flower home and planting it in her rear yard, she resolves that the subsequent attempt at the driver's test will coincide with the hibiscus budding in spring. The author concludes the story in this manner as it draws a parallel between Saeng and the flower. Saeng feels displaced in @LOCATION1, as the hibiscus serves as a link to her former residence in Vietnam. The ending symbolizes that if the flower can withstand the frigid winter, she too can persevere. She will undertake her driver's test as an indication of survival and triumph over obstacles. This story encompasses an overarching theme that circumstances will improve with the passage of time. Saeng will adapt to the disparities of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will blossom, and Saeng will successfully pass her driver's test.
1608	10476	4	1	They concluded it thus because the young lady refuses to capitulate. She will persist in her efforts regarding this examination and will not desist. Moreover, she will exhibit a greater degree of optimism. She will also achieve success in this test. In this way, she will avoid disappointing her mother. Additionally, she will be able to relieve herself of the burden of this test.
1609	10477	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph to facilitate the reader's visualization of a new commencement for the girl. It presents an opportunity to retake the test and behold the freshly blooming flowers. It allows one to observe the return of the geese. The geese hold symbolic significance for her and the journey she has embarked upon to her new abode. The amalgamation of the melting snow and the budding flowers conveys to the reader the prospect of a bright, uncharted future awaiting the girl. The author employs the paragraph at the conclusion to elucidate further what lies ahead, enhance the imagery, and captivate the engaged audience. It serves to illustrate the girl's indomitable spirit, enabling us to recognize that she resembles the flower. Although she struggles to establish roots in the new lifestyle, there will always be a fresh opportunity to persevere.
1610	10478	4	1	I surmise that the author incorporates that paragraph into the story perhaps due to its association with good fortune or as a cultural tradition, rendering it highly significant for its inclusion. Additionally, it might be attempting to convey a message, such as her preference to take tests in spring when the hibiscus begins to bud.
1611	10479	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative with that particular paragraph. This is done not only to conclude Saeng’s yearning to be home but also to illustrate her progress in learning to surmount obstacles. Saeng longs to be in her homeland and persistently refers to it as she desires its return. “I mean, it’s not like the one we had at - at -,” Saeng continues to falter as she is reluctant to mention home, as it brings her to tears. Additionally, when she mentions the “test,” it leads her to consider purchasing a fake test. “It’s - it’s not a real one.” She declines to buy a real one because it evokes memories of the driving test and her existing sorrow. The test alludes to both the plant and the driver’s test. Saeng also concludes with this vow because the flower symbolizes hope to her, “… and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test.” The emotional trials of both situations she is in will enable her to become stronger. This vow at the story’s end demonstrates her determination to be strong and persevere until the end.
1612	10480	4	1	In the story, the author reaches the conclusion that once she has completed her test and there is nothing left to observe, she will undergo further growth.
1613	10481	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl failed the driving test. Moreover, she incorporates all those details of nature as she takes the time to appreciate nature. This is the central theme of the story.
1614	10482	4	1	I hypothesize that the author includes this paragraph to convey to the reader that when all the beauty resurfaces, she will endeavor to acclimate to new circumstances once again.
1615	10483	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with that paragraph as it imparts a sense of renewal and a fresh start for Saeng. The hibiscus serves as a reminder of her home country, sustaining her resolve and fortitude. She likens herself to the geese, stating that what initially seemed strange became familiar through the quiet recurrence from season to season. In winter, the hibiscus fails to bloom, and Saeng fails her driver’s test. That paragraph suggests that in spring, when the hibiscus flourishes and the geese return, it will mark a new beginning for both the natural world and Saeng.
1616	10484	4	1	The author most plausibly concludes the narrative with Saeng pledging to retake the test, as he intends to demonstrate Saeng's tenacity. For instance, when she informs her mother that she failed the test, her mother was aware that it was arduous for Saeng. Given the silent moment, her mother recognized that scolding her about the plant was an unwise decision. Saeng is somewhat likening herself to the plant. She might have mused that if this plant can endure the winter and continue to grow, then she can surmount the test. Hence, that is most likely the reason the author concluded the story in such a manner.
1617	10485	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as the protagonist has acquired newfound hope and determination. The author holds affection and admiration for the hibiscus; for example, her mother remarks, “But it’s robust enough to endure winter.” Saeng aspires to confront hardships with the same fortitude as the hibiscus. She is imbued with new resolve when she tells herself, “Then I will retake the test.” This conclusion effectively showcases the character's growth and the inspiration drawn from the hibiscus.
1618	10486	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the entire narrative was building towards it, and the story would have been devoid of purpose without this conclusion. The progression of the plot led inexorably to this point, and this ending ties together the various threads and themes presented throughout the story, providing a sense of closure and meaning.
1619	10487	4	1	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will acclimate to the circumstances of her new life. The hibiscus is a plant that flourishes in warm, tropical climates. Nevertheless, it cannot withstand the cold; only the winter hibiscus, which can thrive in both climates (warm and cold), can. The hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng. She resided in Vietnam and cherished it with all its beautiful flowers and the time spent with her grandmother. However, now that she is living in the United States, she is finding it challenging to adjust. Now that she has this hibiscus flower, which adapts superbly to the cold weather, she can adapt to her new life in the United States. When she witnesses the geese return for another spring and summer, she will take the driving test because they are granting her area another opportunity to be their seasonal home. This is the rationale behind the author ending the story with this paragraph.
1620	10488	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph depicts how the snow melts and the verdure reappears, akin to a rebirth. This parallels his renewed motivation to retake the test. This truly demonstrates his close affinity with nature and the profound influence that his long - term exposure to it has had on him. The imagery of nature's renewal serves as a powerful symbol for the character's own internal revival, making this an apt and meaningful conclusion to the story.
1621	10489	4	1	I believe the author concluded the narrative with this paragraph as the entire story was enchanting, evoking vivid imagery with nearly every sentence. Thus, why not conclude it with a paragraph such as, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Now, one can hardly deny the beauty of that.
1622	10490	4	1	The author structured the last sentence in the manner they did. This implies that by the next spring, they aspire to observe how their reactions differ in the face of the same circumstances. They are acquainted with the situation but are also cognizant of how to respond to the season.
1623	10491	4	1	He employs this line at the conclusion of the story as it indicates that she has another opportunity to pass the test. They utilize the plant because a plant will always regenerate and bud anew. This was also an astute way to conclude the story as it demonstrates that in the present, plants can serve as a source of inspiration and teach one to look up to something. Perhaps this is how she communicates with her mother through the plants.
1624	10492	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” they conclude the narrative with that paragraph because it symbolizes that she is acclimating to the new country. She is also conveying that one must adapt to new circumstances. That is precisely why I believe they ended with that paragraph.
1625	10493	4	1	The blossoms on this shrub offer profound comfort to Saeng. In the story, she elaborates that they evoke memories of her homeland in Vietnam. The budding of the plant and the arrival of spring signify new life. Saeng perceives that spring could also herald a fresh start for her. She believes that in spring, she will perform better and pass the test. However, should she falter again, the blooming flowers will provide solace.
1626	10494	4	1	The author reaches this conclusion as she perceives a strong connection between herself and the flowers. She has adapted to her environment in a manner akin to a flower. Moreover, having failed her test, just as a flower withers and then rejuvenates, she is resolved to make a comeback and retake the test.
1627	10495	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the narrative with that paragraph because she failed the test. During winter, hibiscus is unavailable, yet come spring when hibiscus reappears, she will attempt the test once more to attain a passing grade.
1628	10496	4	1	The author selects this as the concluding paragraph due to two primary factors. Firstly, the flower mirrors her essence; initially, it had not blossomed. However, when the snow melts and the flower blooms, she identifies with it and is determined to strive anew to succeed in the test. Secondly, it evokes memories of her homeland, and her mother comprehends why she invested so much in it, prompting them to care for it diligently.
1629	10497	4	1	Minfong Ho, the author of “Winter Hibiscus,” concludes the story with Saeng pledging to herself that she will retake and pass her driver's test in spring when the geese return and plants regenerate. The author ends the tale with this paragraph to symbolize Saeng's eagerness to commence afresh. After failing a test, Saeng visits a greenhouse and yearns for her former home, Vietnam. She purchases a hibiscus and plants it upon returning home after observing the geese migrating south for winter. The plant represents her recollections. When she first encounters it, it is in bloom. In spring, it will sprout anew and form another blossom while growing larger. This parallels Saeng overcoming her sorrow and homesickness and constructing more pleasant memories while growing stronger. When the opportunity arises, the birds soaring overhead are heading south for winter to seek refuge from the cold. In spring, they will return to start afresh, rear goslings, rebuild their nests, and recommence from the previous spring. Saeng intends to start anew and pass the test so she can drive and feel more integrated in @LOCATION2. Minfong Ho chooses to conclude the story with this paragraph to signify the character's fresh start and the reconstruction of positive memories.
1630	10498	4	1	The final paragraph in “Winter Hibiscus” was included because the author aims to convey that she feels remorseful for failing the test. She is disappointed as her mother is disappointed in her, knowing she is capable of passing. As she gazes at the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead, she realizes she has a chance of passing the test. Now that she is resolute, she will take the test at the same time next year and is confident she will achieve a passing score.
1631	10499	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph. He does so because that is how the girl perceives the situation. She believes that in the spring, she can achieve more than what she accomplished previously.
1632	10500	4	1	It implies that she desires to repeat the entire process. It represents the girl's comfort zone; thus, that is what she does when she is distressed. That is the meaning conveyed by the story and the phase.
1633	10501	4	1	"The author concluded with the statement, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to convey to the reader the message of never surrendering and persevering. It also indicates that family is always present as one cannot achieve success independently. ""It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng - noi,"" she finally uttered."
1634	10502	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph as the author endeavors to demonstrate to the reader that the character has realized her affection for nature and holds it dear. Since she is awaiting the arrival of spring, and as soon as spring arrives, she will retake the test. Hence, in my view, the author intends to illustrate to the readers that the character in the story deeply appreciates the beauty of nature.
1635	10503	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the sentence, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" because the hibiscus serves not merely as a good - luck charm. When it is absent, things are amiss, but when it returns, circumstances improve. Additionally, the author concludes in this manner because the hibiscus, as a good - luck charm, instills greater confidence. When one speaks with genuine confidence, one is likely to succeed. Finally, this conclusion allows the reader to understand that she believes in something that offers her hope and will enable her to thrive."
1636	10504	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative in such a manner as one thematic element is to surmount obstacles. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's perseverance, and the concluding paragraph provides resolution to the conflict that was initially presented. The statement ""The hibiscus is 'strong enough to make it through the cold months here… that is what matters'"" establishes a correlation between the plant and the author's perseverance due to the symbolism. The last paragraph incorporates that symbolism along with closure as she states she will await spring to retake the test."
1637	10505	4	1	Saeng implies that when the appropriate time recurs, she will undertake the test. The author concludes the story thus as it leaves the reader speculating about the outcome when she next attempts the test. The author also does this to illustrate that one should never abandon one's efforts; just as the flower can endure winter, she will be capable of withstanding the test. Additionally, the author conveys that as the seasons transform, circumstances change. She was on the verge of giving up after failing the test, yet upon witnessing the plant surviving the harsh weather conditions, it instilled greater confidence in her. Moreover, she treasures the plant as she anticipates seeing it bloom because she and her mother dedicated quality time to this plant.
1638	10506	4	1	Saeng is discussing her academic pursuits and the garden. She consistently draws parallels between the two in a similar fashion. She is aware that she must engage in study while the garden flourishes, and she desires to water the flowers. She expresses that when spring arrives, she will not be present for the garden as she will have to take the test.
1639	10507	4	1	The author concluded the story in that manner to demonstrate that Saeng will not capitulate and is resolute in accomplishing her task. The author intends for the reader to comprehend that Saeng is deeply sorrowful and aspires to overcome her homesickness. Saeng bears a strong resemblance to the hibiscus plant; she is delicate and lovely. Saeng declares that she will retake the test when the hibiscus is in bloom, as if she is evolving alongside the plant.
1640	10508	4	1	"The author concluded the story with that paragraph as it illustrates that every entity and individual can endure a challenging period. This paragraph functions as a final optimistic message for readers. The text states, ""when they come back... I will take that test again."" This quotation indicates that Saeng can envision herself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She recognizes that her ""winter"" is the test and that when she is prepared, she will be able to retake the test and achieve success. The budding of the hibiscus represents the moment when she will be ready to take the test. Although she is currently facing a difficult time, she will be able to persevere and make another attempt. This paragraph is placed at the end as it integrates the purpose of the hibiscus. Had this not been stated, readers would never have grasped this message; instead, they would have assumed that the role of the hibiscus was merely to serve as a link to Saeng's past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph was included to show readers that everyone can recover from an adverse situation."
1641	10509	4	1	On one hand, it might imply that she is only permitted to take the test during the spring. Moreover, the serene environment during that period had a calming effect on her. When she was disheartened and @CAPS1 regarding her failed driving test grade...
1642	10510	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this @CAPS1 as she held a deep affection for the hibiscus. She made this statement as she was drawing a comparison between her test and the hibiscus. When the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. The hibiscus is of utmost significance to her; it is her good fortune. With the budding of the hibiscus, she can embark on a new chapter in her life. Without the hibiscus plant, she was fixated on thoughts like “I failed the test” and “I bought it,” Saeng replied when reading her mother's subsequent question. She was so despondent about her test failure that she purchased the hibiscus to positively impact her life. She resolved that when spring arrives and the hibiscus starts to bud, she will initiate a new phase by retaking the test and demonstrating to herself the importance of the hibiscus.
1643	10511	4	1	The author posits that the story holds the potential for any outcome. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus, which incited her mother's ire. Her mother was irate because Saeng had spent money on the entire plant rather than planting it herself, a method that would have been far more cost - effective. When her mother was furious and in a state of disbelief, Saeng began to weep, and her mother forgave her for her actions. This incident serves as evidence that the course of events in the story is unpredictable.
1644	10512	4	1	The author most probably concludes the story with that paragraph to convey to the reader that despite facing failure, one should not be obstinate. Thus, although Saeng failed her driver's test, come spring, when the hibiscus plant commences budding, she will return to take the test once more. She interprets the budding of the plant as an auspicious sign indicating that she will pass the test.
1645	10513	4	1	The author concludes the story by having Saeng silently vow to herself, aiming to illustrate to the reader that she will undergo growth similar to the hibiscus plant and retake the test, this time with unwavering determination to succeed. The plant instills hope in Saeng as it evokes memories of the homeland she cherished deeply. When the hibiscus starts to bud and blossoms with beautiful flowers, Saeng too will “bloom” and obtain her license.
1646	10514	4	1	I believe the passage is attempting to convey the essence because within the passage, it states, “In the spring when the snows melt, and only the sun can achieve that, and the geese return, marking the hunting season, and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Thus, @CAPS1 commences in the spring, so it must be the sun during springtime.
1647	10515	4	1	The author employed the paragraph detailing how Saeng would undertake the test in the spring at the conclusion of the story. The verbiage utilized and the manner of its presentation can inform the reader that Saeng is at tranquility and acknowledges the fact that she resides in the U.S. When Saeng utters, “And this hibiscus plant is budding,” she is ruminating on how the plant evokes memories of her native country. Additionally, when she states, “Then I will take this test again,” she is pledging to herself that she will retake the test when she feels at ease in her new country. In a way, Saeng is also reminding herself that she should accept the reality of her relocation and that she can still be reminded of her native country through the new hibiscus plant and numerous other elements.
1648	10517	4	1	The author concludes this narrative with this paragraph for a compelling rationale. The author has the potential to pen a sequel to this one. She might desire to entice readers to return for more or wishes for them to understand that when things recommence, so will Saeng. Concluding the story with that paragraph is a prudent choice. The author intends for you to recognize that when the plant and geese resume their lives, Saeng will do the same. She will not abandon her efforts but rather retake the test. The author could be formulating plans to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves the reader pondering, and the sequel will likely revolve around the inception of Saeng's new life and her plans to uphold her vow. When everything rejuvenates in the spring, so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 relishes in provoking readers' curiosity about what lies ahead. Readers will depart and speculate about what the author will do next with Saeng. The author delights in keeping readers in suspense and awaiting an answer.
1649	10518	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to accentuate Saeng's resolve to surmount obstacles and assimilate into her new life. The hibiscus mentioned in the concluding quote symbolizes Saeng's nascent hope and determination to thrive in the United States. For instance, the text states, “... its delicate petals unfurled to expose a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a jolt of recognition so intense, it was nearly corporeal.” When Saeng discovered a plant that seemed to bridge her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was inundated with emotion. The hibiscus embodies new hope in an ostensibly insurmountable situation. When the hibiscus blossoms, her world will expand, and a new life will await. With this realization at the story's end, the reader comprehends that Saeng has found new stability and will ultimately achieve success. Moreover, the text remarks, “It felt sleek and cool, with a touch of velvet toward the center, just as she had anticipated.” Saeng's past memories could be rekindled when this hibiscus was present, serving as a profound source of inspiration. The author concluded the story with Saeng's newfound recollection and hope to demonstrate that she had indeed discovered something beneficial and steadfast in a new world.
1650	10519	4	1	The author concluded the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with the chosen paragraph to convey to the reader that despite Saeng's arduous experience of leaving her former home, she could still forge a fulfilling life with a fresh start here. In the final paragraph, winter symbolizes the challenging times of the past, while spring represents a more sanguine future and a new beginning. Although Saeng was mourning the loss of her past, she could still find contentment here. In the story, she once knew hibiscus in her homeland. She discovers hibiscus in her current location, and it serves as a likeness and reminder of her old home. Additionally, the story states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had previously regarded as peculiar had, through the quiet recurrence of season after season, become nearly familiar to her now.” This quote leads into the final paragraph and illustrates her acceptance that she can happily reside in this new home. The final paragraph declares, “... when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” When familiar things and those that remind her of her old home reappear, Saeng will possess the fortitude to strive for positive outcomes in her new life in a new home.
1651	10520	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that statement as it illustrates that one can always embark on a fresh start. One should never abandon hope when truly desiring something. The protagonist earnestly wished to pass the test, thus she exerted great effort, yet she failed. She understands that, akin to the plant, spring will present a new beginning in life, and one can always alter aspects of oneself that are disliked. I firmly concur with this statement because, were there no second chances, most individuals would be deemed failures, as everyone makes mistakes in life, and everyone possesses the capacity to rectify them. This is the rationale behind my belief that the author concludes the story with this statement.
1652	10521	4	1	The story concludes with that paragraph as Saeng holds the belief that in the upcoming spring, when her new hibiscus blossoms, she will be bestowed with good fortune to pass her driving test. It serves as an excellent way to conclude the narrative since the hibiscus had no involvement in her life prior to her taking the driving test. Presently, she believes that during her subsequent driving test, she will have a connection to her past experiences, the ability to surmount obstacles, and solace during a time of disappointment. Saeng opines that these factors can assist her in passing the test.
1653	10522	4	1	"The author may have had numerous motives for concluding the story with this paragraph. One such reason could be to elucidate how the protagonist has transformed within the narrative. At the onset of the story, the author appears disheartened and aggrieved by her failure in the test. In the final paragraph, it is evident that she has overcome her fear. Additionally, the geese's movement parallels her own. ""Saeng and her family have relocated to the United States, and just as the geese feel a sense of unease when migrating but return annually, Saeng, like the flower, is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt, much like the geese and the flower. She is aware that the flower will bloom and the geese will return in the spring, and this is what she must do. She will not relinquish her efforts but will attempt again later in the year. This exemplifies how she is adapting and evolving to harmonize with her new surroundings."
1654	10523	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to showcase Saeng's resolve not only to pass her driving test but also to acclimate to her new abode. The author employs the term ""vowed"" to convey a positive connotation within the paragraph. The author states, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had previously regarded as peculiar had become... familiar."" This statement is made to demonstrate that she is adapting to her new lifestyle. Nevertheless, the author utilizes the final paragraph to indicate that she requires a bit more time."
1655	10524	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng made a pledge to herself that she would never fail the test again. Saeng desired to preserve the memory of her past and homeland, which is why she purchased the flowers. At the conclusion of the story, she vows, ""In the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese return and the hibiscus is in bud, then I will take the test again."" She utters this because she now wishes to move forward and endeavor to become accustomed to her new home."
1656	10525	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph as it consolidates all the concepts and demonstrates that Saeng is prepared for what lies ahead. When the flower is incorporated, it affirms the flower's significance and its correlation to the girl's emotional state, whether in happiness or sorrow. Yet, when she declares that she vowed... and would retake the test, she indicates her readiness for the future while remaining receptive to novel experiences, enabling her to recognize her progress. Consequently, the author ends with that paragraph to evoke mystery regarding what transpired and to conclude the story.
1657	10526	4	1	The author concludes the story with this passage because it is now winter and the flowers have withered. However, during the period when she was planting, she attained greater maturity. As stated in the text, things that she once regarded as peculiar are now becoming familiar, and she is mastering the intricacies. This is because she is acquiring more knowledge about it and will be prepared for the test next spring.
1658	10527	4	1	The author employs this as the concluding paragraph of the story since, at the same time the following year, she will undertake the trial of life once more.
1659	10528	4	1	"The denouement of a narrative aids in discerning the story's significance. It serves as the ultimate resolution and is highly likely to be imprinted in the reader's memory. In the conclusion of the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with a paragraph brimming with encouragement. The conclusion inspires the reader to persevere, as it posits that when the flower blossoms the following year, Saeng will retake the test. This exemplifies encouragement as she possesses the motivation to try again and succeed. The author concludes with an atmosphere of encouragement, leaving the reader invigorated. Her conclusion is robust and appears to recapitulate the story's essence, as throughout, Saeng is repeatedly disappointed about the flower, yet her mother and homeland spur her to move forward and persevere. The ending employed is meaningful and effectively conveys what the author genuinely intended."
1660	10529	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the protagonist is beset with difficulties as she has relocated from her homeland, where the culture, traditions, and even cuisine diverge significantly. Consequently, the protagonist encounters challenges in acclimating to her new surroundings. The author concludes the narrative to illustrate that she will not desist from striving to attain her objective. She desires to retake the test to ascertain if circumstances have altered over time. The story is profoundly poignant and conveys a substantial amount of grief that is ultimately surmounted."
1661	10530	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with that particular paragraph regarding geese to illustrate that Saeng intends to surmount her impediments. She was profoundly disappointed upon failing the test, so she sought solace in recollections of her native land. She purchased a hibiscus, a flower she frequently encountered in her homeland, and that flower symbolized comfort and affection. Moreover, it represented her capacity to overcome obstacles. As she was planting her hibiscus and witnessed the geese soaring overhead, she recognized that she had to make another attempt.
1662	10531	4	1	The author posits this assertion as she intends to initiate her own garden. Her previous garden did not yield favorable results. As stated in the book, she required her mother's assistance. This indicates that despite the setback, she is determined to try again and establish a successful garden on her own.
1663	10532	4	1	The author concludes the passage when Saeng discerns that while she can yearn for her former abode, she must acclimate to the new locale she currently inhabits. Saeng laments the bygone memories of her homeland, as evidenced by the quote, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Nevertheless, she begins to recognize that not all has transformed; certain aspects remain familiar. “Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, the faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now.” Once Saeng realizes that not everything has changed, she acquires the fortitude to persevere in her new life in her new country, thus completing her transition from longing to acceptance.
1664	10533	4	1	The rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph is that it serves as an effective means to bring the narrative to a close. At the conclusion, there is discussion about how Saeng will return when the snow melts and subsequently retake the test. This ending not only provides a sense of closure but also hints at Saeng's determination to overcome her previous failure and move forward.
1665	10534	4	1	When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows dissipate, the geese reappear, and this hibiscus begins to bud; then she will retake that test. The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph because the narrative revolves around Saeng, who fails her driver's test and notices a familiar plant, prompting her to visit a florist shop. As Saeng gains knowledge about this familiar plant, it inspires her to retake the driver's test, as if the snow has vanished and the sun is shining. The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate that Saeng still harbors hope to achieve success and adapt to this new country. Initially, she suffered from acute homesickness, missing her grandmother and childhood keepsakes. The peak of her homesickness is evident when Saeng returns home and explains the nature of the hibiscus to her mother. “She found that she was still too tremulous to utter the words at home, lest she dissolve into tears again.” Saeng was ill - at - ease living in @LOCATION1 and desired to return to Vietnam. However, by the end, Saeng's attitude transforms from despondency to hope. Despite failing her driver's test, Saeng is resolute and hopeful to accomplish something in this new country by declaring, “...then I will take the test again.” Saeng has undergone a significant transformation within this story, and this shift in attitude is manifested in the excerpt about geese in the last paragraph, signifying her newfound optimism and determination.
1666	10537	4	1	I surmise that he incorporated this here because I believe he endeavors to convey that when the snow dissipates, one should simply disregard the initial instance. And when the geese reappear, it represents your @NUM1 opportunity. Subsequently, the budding of the hibiscus signifies that you have surmounted what you were attempting to achieve.
1667	10538	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as both parties were discussing the cold or the weather and the @CAPS1. Thus, it commences when the snow melts, as it pertains to the weather or the @CAPS1.
1668	10539	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner as it demonstrates how the protagonist has been influenced by the events transpiring within the narrative. At the onset of the story, we discover that the protagonist failed her driver's examination. Additionally, in the story, she expended a substantial sum of money on a single plant, which astonishes her mother. At that juncture, the reader would anticipate her to be profoundly sorrowful and despondent. However, due to her grandmother and her homeland, she instead surprises the reader by adopting an optimistic outlook and stating that when the flower blossoms anew, she will retake the test. This reveals the connection between the protagonist and the plant, endowing the plant with a quasi - human existence.
1669	10540	4	1	"I opine that the author opted to conclude the story with that paragraph to elucidate the overarching theme of the narrative. That paragraph encapsulates the themes of determination and surmounting obstacles. Saeng hails from another country and confronts challenges not only in the garden but also in her life. She had to learn to adapt to her new environment and never abandon her aspirations. Hence, by stating, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" she genuinely exhibits her determination and her fearlessness in overcoming the obstacles that lie ahead."
1670	10541	4	1	The author concludes the story in this fashion because rather than absorbing all the anguish, the protagonist can gaze towards the future. Moreover, by looking ahead, she can forget about the past and strive for improvement in the future.
1671	10542	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this segment as she stated, “A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear.” I surmise she implies that even though the geese flew overhead with their heads held high, Saeng did not. “Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She means that she will not keep her head down and will be appreciative of her new home in due course. When she gazes at her hibiscus, she will have cherished memories but not be sorrowful.
1672	10543	4	1	There are two rationales for why the author concluded the story with this paragraph. One reason is that Saeng silently picked up a Winter Hibiscus so that she could pass the driving test. Ultimately, the final reason the author concluded the story with this paragraph is that she desires to retake her driving test to achieve a passing score and be able to drive once she succeeds. These two reasons make it rather perplexing to discern what the author intended to convey in the story with that sentence.
1673	10544	4	1	I opine that the rationale behind the author concluding this paragraph in the story is to demonstrate the affinity Saeng had for the geese.
1674	10545	4	1	There exist numerous possibilities regarding why the author concluded her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the manner she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother remarks about the flowers Saeng unexpectedly purchased. The ending nearly reiterates this line. When Saeng makes that vow, she is essentially informing herself that she too possesses the strength to endure the winter and beyond. Additionally, in the story, the author states, “…she realized many of the things that she had regarded as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this assertion, the author reveals that although Saeng undoubtedly still deeply misses her country, she will ultimately adapt to her new home and triumph. When Saeng vows to retake her test in the spring, it is evident that subconsciously, she is indicating that she can surmount these hardships. All she requires is time.
1675	10546	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” when Saeng declares that she will retake the test in the spring, she anticipates walking home and seeing the flower she discovered. Moreover, the story mentions that in her childhood, she had encountered the same flower in her native country, and the next time she takes the driving test, she hopes to pass. This indicates her disappointment as the story reveals that she paid over nineteen dollars for the test. Her mother was astonished and briefly admonished her. Saeng began to weep, and her mother calmed down to show empathy. Now, she is resolute in retaking the test.
1676	10547	4	1	"Minfong Ho, the author of the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" concluded her story with @ORGANIZATION1 contemplating the spring as she aimed to render @ORGANIZATION1's future more auspicious. The character @ORGANIZATION1 appeared despondent and perpetually nostalgic for her past in Vietnam. Upon sighting the Hibiscus and Jasmine blossoms, she ""collapsed in tears,"" and the fragrance of Jasmine evoked memories of her grandmother styling her hair. To exacerbate Saeng's plight, she failed her driving examination, an outcome that most adolescents perceive as a significant setback. By this juncture in the story, I felt empathy for @ORGANIZATION1 and pondered whether her circumstances would improve, as she was estranged from all she knew and cherished, armed only with memories and a winter hibiscus distinct from those in Vietnam. Then, in the final line, @ORGANIZATION1 abruptly becomes sanguine about her future, stating, ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."
1677	10548	4	1	"The concluding passage of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" imparts a sense of optimism for the future. The protagonist, Saeng, having recently failed her test, is enveloped in despondency. Through a sequence of events, her melancholy dissipates, and she experiences a glimmer of hope. ""Then I will take that test again."" This final utterance exemplifies Saeng's resolve. She was disheartened by leaving her homeland and failing her examination, yet thanks to a flower, she regained her self - assurance. When individuals are distressed, it is facile to abandon their pursuits. Until the last paragraph, the narrative's tone was somber. When the author introduced the conclusion, it was akin to a beacon at the terminus of a dim tunnel. The author posits that even when circumstances are arduous and seemingly insurmountable, there will be something to buoy one's spirits. There is invariably a silver lining in adverse situations; one merely needs to seek it."
1678	10549	4	1	In surmising, it implies that during winter, spring, or other seasons, cultivating a garden becomes more arduous. Moreover, it might present a particular challenge to nurture the garden during that time of the year. Hence, I presume this is what the text is alluding to.
1679	10550	4	1	The author incorporates that sentence at the conclusion of the story because throughout the narrative, it has been emblematic of courage. This elucidates her improvement and the manifestation of courage as she intends to retake the test and refuses to be disheartened by her initial failure.
1680	10551	4	1	In my estimation, the author concluded his story with this paragraph for diverse reasons. It could signify a new beginning or a fresh start. For instance, when the geese migrate and then return, it indicates that the @CAPS1 are undergoing transformation. Consequently, the alteration or renewal of the @CAPS1 could symbolize his opportunity to retake the test and obtain another chance.
1681	10552	4	1	I surmise that they perceive it will bestow good fortune upon them.
1682	10553	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with this passage as it demonstrates that one can surmount an obstacle if endowed with determination. Saeng faltered in the initial examination. She procured a plant that evokes memories of her homeland. Despite the frigid, unyielding soil, she planted the flora. She came to the realization that what was once unfamiliar had now become an integral part of her daily existence. She resolved to retake the test. Saeng comprehended that even though one may encounter failure on a certain occasion (represented by @MONTH1), perseverance is essential if it aligns with one's beliefs. She also recognized that while she would never forget her home, she could still progress forward. Ultimately, Saeng understood that the forces of good can prevail over the forces of bad. After her test failure, she purchased the flower. The author concluded the story with this paragraph as it encapsulates the narrative flawlessly.
1683	10554	4	1	The author incorporates the excerpt at the conclusion for a significant purpose relevant to Saeng. The hibiscus represents everything - her homeland, her past, and her source of solace. Saeng believes that if the flower can blossom, so can she. This conviction will empower her to acclimate to her new abode and retake the examination. It also symbolizes hope, for if the plant can endure the winter and bloom in the spring, she too can persevere. The author employed this device to establish a connection between Saeng's emotions and the reality of the flower's ability to bloom.
1684	10555	4	1	The author concludes with that statement because geese migrate south during winter and return in spring. Saeng failed the test in winter but will retake it when spring arrives. As Saeng fails her driving test and spots the familiar plant, it indicates she will return to attempt the test again. The geese have departed but will come back as the season changes. Thus, both the geese and Saeng have a motive to return north or retake the test. The author adds the statement at the end as the geese's actions mirror Saeng's.
1685	10556	4	1	"The author concludes this tale with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng was not inclined to capitulate. Throughout the story, she had been in a state of despondency. From the moment she failed the test and yearned for Vietnam, numerous aspects of the place where she and her mother resided served as reminders of her homeland. ""She closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. Saeng could almost sense the delicate strands of her grandmother's long gray hair..."" This experience stirred profound emotions within her, as she witnessed how many elements evoked memories of Vietnam. The author ended the story in this manner to showcase how this entire experience had an impact on her."
1686	10557	4	1	The author opts to conclude the story in this manner to instill a sense of resolve. Saeng acquired the plant to evoke memories of her homeland and uplift her spirits. Once the plant blossoms, she anticipates a similar transformation within herself and feels prepared for the test.
1687	10558	4	1	The author concluded the passage with a profoundly impactful statement: “When the geese return in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese come back, and this hibiscus is in bud, I will retake that test.” This statement exemplifies renewal and perseverance. I believe she included this because, after observing that the plant can rejuvenate repeatedly, even after enduring harsh conditions, she realized she could do the same. She vowed to herself that when the time arrives, she will be ready to renew herself and regain her footing. It also conveys perseverance. The plant does not perish each season; it is resilient and rebounds. If the girl can persevere and return next year to retake the test, she will be regarded as steadfast. I think the girl aspires to be like the flower. She perceives it as indomitable, regenerative, and beautiful. Regardless of its growing location, the plant will always retain those qualities.
1688	10559	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this way to convey to readers that Saeng will not abandon her efforts after a single failure. She aims to achieve success to earn her mother's pride and demonstrate to herself that she is making a concerted effort. The text indicates that Saeng will retake the test in spring when the snow has melted, the geese have returned, and the hibiscus is budding. The hibiscus is not only significant to the story but also to her life; it aids her in moving forward and understanding how things change, develop, and adapt over time. Although it disappointed her mother, she somewhat comprehended why Saeng brought the plant home, as it may have provided comfort. There were likely numerous factors contributing to her missing the test, as she was not at home. She must adjust and adapt to her current circumstances.
1689	10560	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test, and when the same time of year recurs, she will have another opportunity to pass it. I infer this from the text, which states that she spent over @MONEY1 on it, while all the vegetable seeds in the garden did not cost as much. This is the reason I believe she concluded with that paragraph.
1690	10561	4	1	In the upcoming winter, when it is time for planting again, she will be well - prepared. This time, she will execute the task with significantly improved proficiency.
1691	10562	4	1	"The author incorporated this element to illustrate that it was winter, during which the flower was on the verge of blooming, and the geese were migrating here due to the cold climate. Moreover, the author made this statement because the story is titled ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" which clearly indicates that the hibiscus blooms in winter. This is the reason I believe the author chose to convey what she did."
1692	10563	4	1	"The author of the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the tale with a sentence asserting that when Saeng's hibiscus' initial bud emerges in the spring, she will return to take the driver's test. The author may have opted to end the story in such a manner. One might wonder, what if the plant perishes? Would she still go back to take the test? Presumably, the author intended to prompt the reader to engage in profound contemplation. In conclusion, the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" might have concluded the story to introduce an element of suspense."
1693	10564	4	1	"The story culminates with that line as @CAPS1 derives strength from the hibiscus, ensuring that she will not falter in the test on her subsequent attempt. During the period required for the hibiscus to mature, she will also undergo personal growth, thereby becoming fully prepared for the test. As the story states, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world"" (Ho). Saeng experienced a fulfilling childhood, receiving love and support. By revisiting those plants, especially the hibiscus, she can draw strength from her recollections. However, the memories evoked by the hibiscus are also poignant. The story notes, ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her"" (Ho). Confronting such sorrow will only fortify her resolve. In addition to the mere sight of the hibiscus, other factors will also contribute to her readiness for the test. The story describes, ""It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center – just as she had known it would feel"" (Ho). The tactile sensation of the hibiscus in @MONTH1 rekindles distant memories, such as assisting her grandmother with her hair. All these experiences will empower Saeng, enabling her to succeed in the test on her next try."
1694	10565	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as, come spring when the snow has melted, she will attempt the test once more. This conclusion ties up the narrative by suggesting a future action that is closely linked to the seasonal change, providing a sense of closure and anticipation for the character's next step.
1695	10566	4	1	The aforementioned quote implies that Saeng is elated to have returned. Additionally, Saeng expresses her willingness to undertake the endeavor again if the need arises. This indicates her positive attitude and resilience, suggesting that she has learned from her experiences and is ready to face future challenges with determination.
1696	10567	4	1	I surmise that the author concluded the story in such a manner because of the frigid conditions outside. Additionally, I conjecture that what the author intends to convey is that when she penned this letter, the outdoors was cold, and she would refrain from taking the test until the weather warmed up due to the cold. “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake that test.”
1697	10568	4	1	There exist numerous reasons for the author's statement, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author made this assertion as the girl forsook everything to come to this country and could not afford to fail. The girl stated, “That at last, she could hold on to. But where was the fine - footed charm? The hibiscus hedge?” She also said this because the hedge was all she had from her former home apart from her mother, and when “the hibiscus is budding” signifies the onset of a new life, the emergence of leaves, and the girl commencing to grow and progress in her life.
1698	10569	4	1	The rationale behind the author concluding the story with this paragraph is that if another attempt is made, it is likely to yield significantly better results now that they are cognizant of what they are doing. Moreover, if they make another attempt and the endeavor proves sufficiently productive, they can sell the output and generate income, leading them to continue this activity for years to come.
1699	10570	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story by presenting a resolution for Saeng to illustrate her unwavering perseverance and determination. The allusion to the spring blossoms symbolizes Saeng's fight to endure the hardships, which are personified by winter. Similar to the hibiscus struggling to acclimate to a new abode, Saeng is grappling with adapting to a new country. The final paragraph offers a resolution to Saeng's internal conflict throughout the story by implying that she will succeed in taking the test. In summary, the final paragraph in the story “Winter Hibiscus” resolves the conflict within the narrative and showcases Saeng's tenacity to the reader.
1700	10571	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it reveals what Saeng will undertake and whether she will attend school. Saeng was reluctant to go to school as she would await the snow to melt, the geese to return, and the hibiscus to bud, and she prefers gardening over school. Gardening evokes memories of her homeland. For instance, Saeng dug a hole and carefully placed the winter hibiscus into it. The aspects that reminded her of her homeland were the sound of eggs being beaten against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan, and the pungent aroma of bitter melon wafting out. Another example is when she went to the corner of the vegetable patch and began to dig a hole in the ground, which demonstrates her concern for the garden.
1701	10572	4	1	The author concludes her narrative with the quotation, “When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows dissolve and the geese reappear and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will undertake that test once more.” This is because the author is demonstrating that nature and the plant hold significant value for her. Saeng, the one uttering the quote, believes that the hibiscus will assist her in passing the test. Earlier in the story, it is shown that when she encounters difficulties, she rubs the plant's leaves in her hands to surmount the problem. The author is clarifying and depicting the notion that the plant aids Saeng in overcoming obstacles.
1702	10573	4	1	At the conclusion of the story, the young girl Saeng makes a solemn vow to herself that she will attempt the driver's test in the upcoming year. One rationale for her self - imposed vow is to demonstrate her ability to pass the test. Moreover, after she purchased and planted the flower, and as she reminisced about all the idyllic moments she had in Vietnam, it instilled in her the confidence to pursue what she desired. This shows that the flower served as a catalyst for her determination to take on the test.
1703	10574	4	1	The author incorporates this element into the paragraph to employ sarcasm, aiming to convey that it is nearly implausible for Saeng to retake the test. I assert this because the author's use of sarcasm implies that Saeng has no intention of taking the test. For instance, if someone were to urge me to take a test and I responded that I would do so only when @LOCATION1 assumes the presidency again, that would be a highly sarcastic statement, indicating that the event is unlikely to occur and I have no intention of taking the test, rather than simply saying no. The author included this to make it clear that the probability of Saeng taking the test is extremely low.
1704	10575	4	1	The author includes this paragraph to mark the conclusion of the story and to illustrate that Saeng has not surrendered. The author intends to showcase how the plant and the geese symbolize the continuation of Saeng's life in the United States. The geese will return, and the hibiscus will bud and blossom, and Saeng will retake and hopefully pass her driving test. This paragraph is not merely a conclusion but a new beginning for the geese, the winter hibiscus, and Saeng, signifying a fresh start and the promise of growth.
1705	10576	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to showcase @CAPS1's resilience and motivation. When she is both willing and capable, she will retake the test with greater self - assurance. Saeng utters this to herself as a means of persevering until she can drive. She declares that by the next spring, she will take her test, be able to drive, and become accustomed to her new home. This paragraph conveys the message that achieving goals takes time; one does not always succeed immediately, so perseverance is key.
1706	10577	4	1	In my estimation, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was dejected about failing her driving test. However, upon seeing those flowers, she realized that since coming to @CAPS1, she had forgotten all about her hometown. Consequently, she decided to reconnect with nature and postpone taking her test until spring rather than rushing the process.
1707	10578	4	1	I am of the opinion that the author concludes the story with that specific paragraph to convey that she still harbors hope of finding a sense of home and attaining happiness. In her mind, the hibiscus plant symbolizes home and the joyous memories she shared with her grandmother. Thus, when the plant buds, she will feel as if she is home again and will be content, at which point she will take the driving test. Moreover, that paragraph indicates that she is gradually acclimating to the new home and lifestyle. “A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had regarded as strange before had, through the quiet recurrence of season upon season, become almost familiar to her now, like these geese.” Through these instances, I believe the narrator included that last paragraph to illustrate Saeng's assimilation into her new lifestyle and her acceptance of her circumstances.
1708	10579	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng did not abandon the idea of taking the test. For instance, she states, “I will take the test again.” This indicates her desire to take the test and achieve a passing grade. Saeng intends to wait until spring arrives and the snow melts before retaking the test. In the initial part of the text above, it discusses her taking the test, and it concludes with her resolve to take it again.
1709	10580	4	1	"At the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story by stating, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author ends the story in this manner to disclose the hope that resides in Saeng's future. After failing her driver's test, Saeng returns home disheartened and sorrowful. Nevertheless, this final paragraph suggests that Saeng's fortune will soon change. The reader is left with an indication that Saeng will retake her test and succeed. Additionally, this concluding paragraph reflects Saeng's tenacious personality in surmounting the numerous obstacles she faces in @CAPS1. This paragraph proves that she will not yield, even after being compelled to reside in the United States instead of her homeland. Her success in integrating into her new life is evident in the quote, “Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had considered strange before had become... almost familiar.” Truly, Saeng is a determined character."
1710	10581	4	1	The rationale behind the author's decision to conclude this story with the paragraph is as follows. The story revolves around a girl yearning for her home country. This paragraph implies that by the next @DATE1, the girl will have adapted to her new country. Both the story and the paragraph showcase the girl's fortitude to overcome challenges. This is precisely why the author ended the story with this paragraph.
1711	10582	4	1	The author is informing us, the readers, that the girl intends to repeat the same actions next year when the show concludes, the geese return, and the climate is sufficiently warm for the hibiscus flower to bud or bloom once more. The author, in the month of @MONTH1, also concludes the sentence to indicate that this is the life the young girl has chosen, and she will persist in her new gardening endeavors until the subsequent spring.
1712	10584	4	1	Saeng concluded the narrative with that paragraph as it depicts what she has recently endured and gives the impression that she can confront such experiences again. In the event that she fails the driving test once more, she will utilize the plants to surmount her difficulties. In fact, she passed the test this time in @MONTH1. The distinctive plants demonstrate that she is stronger than she perceives herself to be, and she now believes that she is at ease with the plants that evoke memories of her childhood.
1713	10585	4	1	She demonstrates her affection for her grandmother and her fondness for their shared activities, such as gardening. Her mother is concerned about her, yet she imposes strict regulations upon her.
1714	10586	4	1	The author concluded the story in a manner that enlightens the reader. It reveals to the reader that regardless of what transpired in @MONTH1, no matter how dire the circumstances may seem, and however despondent one may feel, there is always a means to improve the situation. Saeng failed her test, was in an unfamiliar land, and had lost her grandmother, yet she still planned to make another attempt. Similar to the waves on the shore that perpetually strive to erode the sand by returning, Saeng is willing to persevere, and so should we all.
1715	10587	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because the current season has come to an end, and a new season is commencing.
1716	10588	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the statement, ""When they return, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows thaw and the geese migrate back and this hibiscus is in bud, then I will retake that test."" This quotation implies that once the flower begins to bud, Saeng will attempt the test anew, as she will possess the courage and determination to do so, confident in her ability to pass. The flower symbolizes something to her that instills motivation and resolve. Everyone has something that spurs them on in life, and for Saeng, it is her plant. The author also provides a hint as to the story's progression when the flower buds."
1717	10589	4	1	"Saeng is not merely disappointed from failing her driver's test; she is also distraught and longing for her homeland of Vietnam. As she walks home, she discovers a small fragment of Vietnam right in the United States. She purchases the exquisite winter hibiscus, or saebba, to evoke memories of her past. The conclusion of this story intertwines the two distinct countries, cultures, and almost parallel worlds that constitute her life. When she says, ""when they come back,"" she is referring to the geese. To her, the geese symbolize her life in @LOCATION2 and how she has become accustomed to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life, representing her past in Vietnam. It rekindles memories, and buying that plant was like acquiring a small piece of home. When the ""hibiscus is budding,"" she will attempt the test once more. When this small piece of home flourishes, she will try again. When she is more firmly established in the @CAPS1 culture while still maintaining a strong connection to her own, she will be ready."
1718	10590	4	1	I surmise that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it demonstrates that Saeng is not a quitter. Saeng eagerly anticipates the return of the Hibiscus. When the Hibiscus reappears, she will retake the test and prove to her mother that she is capable of success.
1719	10591	4	1	"The reason the author concluded the story with this paragraph is that when Saeng saw the geese, she realized that when spring returns, she will be prepared to seek out different flowers. Additionally, she reminisces about her homeland, where she could witness the flowers emerging from the ground. Although she is now in the city, she hopes that the flowers will bloom as vibrantly as those in her beloved homeland, which she misses dearly. Lastly, she personifies the flowers as her friends. She also recalls the ""Madagascar periwinkle"" growing wild from the crevices in brick walls or tiled roofs. Essentially, the author indicates that she is ready to search for other plants that evoke memories of her homeland."
1720	10592	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate a transformation in Saeng's character. At the onset of the story, Saeng is despondent about failing her driver's test. However, this concluding paragraph portrays the evolution that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng struggles to adapt to the transition from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds comfort in a native Vietnamese flower, the winter hibiscus. By referencing the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (""...and this hibiscus is budding...""), the author depicts Saeng's shift in attitude and her acceptance of @LOCATION2. Saeng now believes that, just as the hibiscus returns after winter, she will be able to retake and pass the driver's test. Moreover, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng's newfound adaptation to the wildlife of @LOCATION2. Prior to her encounter with the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no experience with Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng's mention of these creatures showcases her adjustment to @LOCATION2 (""...when the snow melts and the geese return...""). This demonstrates Saeng's growth and adaptation to her new environment. Initially, Saeng had difficulty leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing the @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph encapsulates the significant change that Saeng experiences. In this manner, the author includes this paragraph to highlight the character development that Saeng undergoes."
1721	10593	4	1	They conclude the story in such a manner because winter has ended and spring has arrived, and everything will once again be resplendent.
1722	10594	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with, “When they come back,” Saeng vowed silently to herself, “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.” Subsequently, she will become more accustomed. For instance, the author states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had regarded as peculiar before had, through the quiet recurrence of season upon season, become almost familiar to her now.” This indicates that she believes over a certain period, she will grow more accustomed to driving and then retake the test. Eventually, she will pass it.
1723	10595	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” chose to conclude the story in this fashion as she intended to incorporate the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to @LOCATION1 and has encountered difficulties integrating. She yearns for everything about her former home, from her grandmother to the native plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, thus feeling that all is forfeit. However, the hibiscus plant enabled her to recognize that she has another opportunity. The hibiscus can endure the winter and blossom in the spring, and this is what Saeng realizes she must do. The final paragraph reads, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring is the season for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers commence to bloom, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes that she too desires a new beginning to be ushered in by spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph weaves the theme of new beginnings into the story. It demonstrates @CAPS1's new epiphany and how the hibiscus inspired it.
1724	10596	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng genuinely aspires to pass the test. One can discern this when it states, “And in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” This passage reveals that she did not wish to fail. When Saeng returned home, she had the white bud in the pot, and her mother noticed that she was crying. Then her mother intended to plant the plant in the ground, but Saeng took the shovel and did it herself. This made her realize that she could take the test again.
1725	10597	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple reasons. Firstly, when the hibiscus buds in the spring, it signifies that the plant is on the verge of blooming. This also implies that Saeng will be prepared in the spring to retake the test. Additionally, the last paragraph is placed at the end because if the plant can survive, then the girl can pass her driver's test and attain happiness in both respects.
1726	10598	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author posits that it will be a transformative year or that some change is imminent. Moreover, the author feels that they could have performed better than they did and intends to retake that test.
1727	10599	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to accentuate the new beginning that Saeng is seeking. She was profoundly disappointed upon failing her driver's test, and the hibiscus was the source of her joy. She required a fresh start in a new country. The flower, the snow, the geese, and the test all symbolize new beginnings and challenges to surmount. The geese and snow signify a change in season, the budding hibiscus represents new life, and the passing of the test represents a milestone in Saeng's life. Concluding the story with this paragraph makes the reader anticipate something novel and exhilarating to befall Saeng.
1728	10600	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey to the reader that she is not finished gardening and will return when the plants bloom once more. Additionally, she is not ready to cease. She prefers gardening over attending school. This is the inference the author draws about the story through the last paragraph.
1729	10601	4	1	The author concludes this story with the few words “then I will take that test again” because she wishes to convey that she will not abandon something she failed at once. She will persevere until she succeeds in passing “the test.”
1730	10602	4	1	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story as she was already cognizant that she should not fear venturing into a new life or environment. For instance, in the story, the mother states, “Its flowers aren't pretty, but it's strong enough to endure the cold months. Here, this winter hibiscus.” This indicates that the mother desires Saeng to learn that she should be resilient even in difficult times. Another example is when the narrator remarks, “She realized that many of the things she had previously regarded as strange became familiar through the quiet repetition of season upon season…” This shows that Saeng realized that the new place she is currently in is quite similar to their old home. In conclusion, the last paragraph conveys that Saeng should confront the new realities of the world. She should be strong and embrace the flow of life.
1731	10603	4	1	The author concluded this narrative for an internal adjustment. Saeng's recollections are conveyed through the one associated with the hibiscus. Spring is a season in which everything is rejuvenated and novel. Just as in spring, Saeng's hope would be reinstated and flourish when the hibiscus begins to bud, and she will possess the capacity to attempt the test anew with greater fortitude and inspiration.
1732	10604	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the narrative with Saeng, the protagonist, pledging to undertake the driving examination in spring when the hibiscus is in bloom. This serves as a means of demonstrating to the reader that even after the story concludes, Saeng will not abandon her efforts. The author incorporates the notion of the blooming hibiscus as it symbolizes resilience for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is prevalent in her native country, and the one she purchased evokes memories of all she left behind when she migrated from Vietnam to @LOCATION1. Saeng endeavors to embrace her new lifestyle and employs the hibiscus as a coping mechanism during challenging times. After acquiring the flower, she vows to retake the failed driving test once spring arrives. Spring symbolizes a fresh commencement. Saeng also believes that if the hibiscus can endure the winter in @LOCATION1, so can she. The conclusion of this story employs extensive imagery suggesting that Saeng will remain steadfast and continue to reside in @LOCATION1.
1733	10605	4	1	The rationale behind the author's conclusion of the story with this paragraph is that Saeng fails the test and learns to appreciate nature to a greater extent.
1734	10606	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as Saeng will revisit the flowers come spring.
1735	10607	4	1	The author posits that concept based on the principle of perseverance. Initially, if one fails to achieve success on the first attempt, they should persevere and try again. For instance, in the event of failing an examination on the initial try, repeating the attempt may lead to success. In the story, Saeng was unable to pass a test; thus, allowing her a retake could have enabled her to succeed. Secondly, seeking assistance or utilizing study materials can be beneficial. For example, diligent studying significantly enhances the likelihood of passing. This is the interpretation I ascribe to the statement.
1736	10608	4	1	The author concludes this narrative with this paragraph as it represents how each year commences and concludes.
1737	10609	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as the author intends to convey to the reader that Saeng has been consoled by the hibiscus and is prepared to attempt the test anew. She has now become more receptive to the situation. At the onset of the story, Saeng was distressed and irked about failing her driver's test. For instance, “the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I - I failed the test,” Saeng informed her mother. Evidently, she was disheartened and disappointed in herself. The author did not wish to end the story with a sorrowful, unfulfilling conclusion. Saeng alters her stance towards the test by the story's end. For example, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” I believe this attitude stems from the memories of her mother country that soothe her and also her mother. In conclusion, the author ended the story thus to instruct the reader that change should be embraced and time does heal wounds.
1738	10610	4	1	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the narrative with the motivational passage as he/she aims to demonstrate to the reader that Saeng is resolved to acclimate to her new life and residence and surmount common impediments such as a driver's test. Saeng struggled to deal with her issue, so she purchased a hibiscus as it reminded her of home. I surmise that the line “and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” from the last paragraph symbolizes growth and the conquest of obstacles. The conclusion of the story is a gratifying ending.
1739	10611	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the snow thaws and the geese return, she will possess greater confidence in taking and passing the test. After she failed the test later in the story, the geese had flown away. Hence, when the geese return, they will remind her of what has just transpired. When the snow melts and spring arrives, the hibiscus flower will blossom once more.
1740	10612	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” with the return of spring come new hopes, comfort, and belief. As she stated in the story, “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She realizes that when the hibiscus reappears, it brings new hopes to her life for which to take the test. Here, the hibiscus signifies hope. Secondly, when she said “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” she implies that it is a source of comfort for her, stronger than hope, and even more so if her mother's support bolsters her self - confidence because it is not easy to do it without her mother's solace. Lastly, she said “Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and yes familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetitions of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She means that as the season approaches and the hibiscus grows, she will regain the belief and the strength she needs to take the test. The hibiscus holds great significance for her, representing new hopes, comfort, and belief.
1741	10613	4	1	"Upon returning from the disappointment of failing her driving test, Saeng finds solace in the discovery of the hibiscus flower. This floral find evokes precious recollections of Saeng's homeland, as it bears a striking resemblance to the blossoms that once flourished near her former residence. The author concludes the narrative by having Saeng silently vow, ""When they come back, when the snows thaw and the geese return and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake that test."" This comparison of Saeng to the hibiscus underscores their shared struggle to acclimate to new environments. The author demonstrates that Saeng recognizes this parallel and draws inspiration from it. In Saeng's view, if the hibiscus can endure relocation, so too can she."
1742	10614	4	1	"The narrative of ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves as an extended metaphor, symbolizing both the connection to a reassuring past and the anticipation of the future. Saeng yearns for her homeland yet must learn to adapt to her current circumstances and successfully pass her driver's test. The story reaches a fitting conclusion with Saeng's self - pledge that come spring, she will attempt the test once more. The hibiscus flower itself prompts this vow, offering her a sense of closure and alleviating some of her homesickness. Saeng's commitment indicates her growing acceptance of her situation. When she observes the Canada geese in flight, she experiences a moment of insight regarding the seasons. ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had once perceived as odd had now become... almost familiar to her."" This realization marks a significant milestone for Saeng, and the conclusion shows that she is capable of change."
1743	10615	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, Saeng shares an intimate emotional bond with the memories and recollections that the hibiscus evokes. At one juncture in the story, she weeps in mourning for her grandmother as the hibiscus plants reawaken long - buried memories. Subsequently, she presents the plant to her mother. Initially, her mother is perturbed but later comes to understand her daughter's actions and emotions. Saeng is disheartened by her failure to pass the test, and her mother empathizes with her distress. The author concludes the story in this manner to enable the reader to recognize that since the hibiscus holds such profound significance for Saeng, reminding her of her past, it will serve as a compelling reason and motivation for her to persevere and achieve her goal of passing the test."
1744	10616	4	1	As winter approaches, the geese embark on their southern migration, and the plants shed their leaves. Saeng declares that she will retake the test. It appears that the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus will instill hope and confidence in her. The hibiscus, in particular, is a poignant reminder of her homeland and her grandmother. When she first beheld it and touched its leaf, it brought a tear to her eye. When it reappears the following year, it will revitalize her spirit.
1745	10617	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she believes it effectively elucidates the events that transpired with Saeng.
1746	10618	4	1	The author concludes her narrative with the final paragraph as it elucidates the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscuses, and the profound emotions evoked merely by observing them. Moreover, it demonstrates that the hibiscus serves as a source of motivation for her, as it nostalgically reminds her of her beloved homeland, akin to possessing a tangible memory of it.
1747	10619	4	1	The author draws a parallel when stating that when the geese are primed, they will return, and when the flower reaches its readiness, it will commence budding and growth. Similarly, when she is prepared, she will undertake the test. She is elucidating that, like the geese and flowers, she requires time. Thus, Saeng can be compared to both the geese and the hibiscus, as they, too, in a sense, necessitate time to fulfill their respective purposes. In a way, Saeng has assimilated with these two entities.
1748	10620	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes the story with this particular sentence because it symbolizes the girl's perception of the world. The girl implies that when the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud, it portends the arrival of warmth. The warmth, in turn, uplifts her spirit as it evokes memories of her homeland. I believe that being reminded of her homeland will facilitate her performance on the test, as it will imbue her with greater happiness. This, I think, will enable her to excel on the examination. For instance, the author mentions in the story that the flower provides her with comfort. I contend that being at ease is the optimal approach to achieve success and pass the test. In conclusion, I opine that the author ends the story in this manner to enable readers to comprehend the connection between the girl and her homeland, and how the flower offers her solace.
1749	10621	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it presents an engaging ending that is intricately linked to the narrative.
1750	10622	4	1	I believe that the author concludes the story with that statement because it indicates that she is acclimating to the new environment. Additionally, it reveals that she is not inclined to surrender. Just as the geese persevere in their annual migrations between winter and spring, she remains steadfast in her resolve.
1751	10623	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng resolves to retake the failed driver's test in the spring. She does this as she finds solace in the temperate weather of spring. It evokes memories of her home, to which Saeng is deeply attached. It makes me recall all the places I've visited and how I still cherish my favorite one. Similar to Saeng, I acquire items that remind me of my former residence. Saeng's loyalty to her old home makes me feel less alone when I yearn for my old abode.
1752	10624	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph as Saeng intends to commence anew and perform better the second time, as she is averse to disappointing herself. This is the rationale behind the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph.
1753	10625	4	1	I opine that the author concludes the story in this manner as it depicts a fresh start. When spring arrives, all life rejuvenates. Plants regenerate, animals reappear, and the sun radiates brightly. This represents a new beginning for them, and it can be perceived similarly for her. She can attempt again as it offers her another opportunity. Another reason the author ended the story thus is that Saeng adores nature. Perhaps when nature surrounds her again, it will instill hope and confidence in her to pass her test.
1754	10626	4	1	The final paragraph of the story read: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that she is adapting and beginning to embrace the change. I surmise this because throughout the story, she is distressed and reluctant to accept the change. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept,” the text states. This last paragraph exudes optimism, speaking of the flower blossoming and the geese returning, suggesting that she is starting to accept the change. In my view, the author included that paragraph to conclude the story, showing that Saeng is beginning to accept the change and adopt an optimistic outlook.
1755	10627	4	1	Saeng informed her mother that she had failed the test. She sought to compensate for it by assisting in the garden. Her mother welcomed her in and initiated the preparation of dinner.
1756	10628	4	1	"The author concludes that upon the geese's return, she will undertake the test, as she believes she will be better prepared. Consequently, the test will be more manageable in the spring. This will afford her additional time for learning and studying, and hopefully, her mind will be more focused, rather than preoccupied with thoughts of home. Completing the driver's test in spring will be less arduous. She feels remorseful, as if she has disappointed her mother by failing it. ""I just stared at the hibiscus,"" which indicates that she was too ashamed to even meet her mother's gaze. Thus, next spring, she aims to please her mother by passing the test, as she will be fully ready."
1757	10629	4	1	The rationale behind the author's selection of this paragraph is that it signifies that when the snow thaws and all the geese return, the flowers @CAPS1. That solitary flower was the subject on which she had to @CAPS2 tests.
1758	10630	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the chosen paragraph to convey to readers the importance of perseverance. She imparts this message through this approach because she realizes that, ultimately, she will be well - equipped. In the story, the line “... Slowly fading into the distance.” may imply that she comprehends that what transpires is inevitable and that one should never cease striving towards a desired goal. Another possible reason she @MONTH1 employed this is that even when one is down, friends and family are there to offer support. The line “... Through the quiet repetition of season upon season.” essentially suggests that she merely needed to establish a routine to achieve her objective.
1759	10631	4	1	The author concludes the story with this sentence to draw a comparison between flowers and the test. Concluding in this manner demonstrates her resolve to persevere season after season, much like the annual return of geese. By making such an analogy, she shows that she has not abandoned her efforts and will continue to strive year after year. Moreover, it indicates that this girl is determined and will not desist until she attains success. Additionally, this final paragraph provides insights into the entire story. Ultimately, it evokes an overall sentiment for the entire narrative.
1760	10632	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to prompt the reader to engage in contemplation. When the author concludes in such a manner, he or she intends for the reader to formulate their own ending or prediction. At times, this may even hint at the possibility of a sequel.
1761	10633	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it bestows upon the story a felicitous ending, depicting how she perseveres and opts to retake the test. Moreover, she is loath to disappoint her mother; instead, she desires to bring her joy and seize a second opportunity at the test.
1762	10634	4	1	She concludes with that statement to illustrate her readiness to experience spring anew in the foreign country, now that the hibiscus has provided solace. The trial is adapting to the new nation, and she believes she failed because she sought comfort in her native flora. Nevertheless, she is confident that she will succeed in the test the following year, as each recurrence of the season enables her to become more acclimated to the new culture. When she utters, “When the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” all these signs signify a new year and facilitate her acceptance of the current circumstances.
1763	10635	4	1	She came to the realization that things not only come and go but also undergo transformation. During certain periods of the year, the world around her underwent changes beyond her control. Additionally, she had to grapple with the challenges of residing in a new country. For Saeng, living in a foreign land was arduous. She had to partake of novel cuisines, listen to unfamiliar sounds, and encounter sights she had never witnessed before. Failing her driving test was a difficult blow for her. Not comprehending the language and being oblivious to the happenings around her took a toll on her. The world around her was not something to which she was accustomed. She understood that she needed to adapt herself and exert greater effort to attain her desires.
1764	10636	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph to convey to the readers that she did not capitulate. Throughout the narrative, it appeared that she entertained thoughts of giving up; however, the recollections of her homeland consoled her when she felt on the verge of surrender. In the final paragraph of the story, she affirmed her resolve not to abandon her pursuit.
1765	10637	4	1	I surmise that the author concludes this story in such a manner because the beautiful `@CAPS1 brought her good fortune, as during the @NUM1 attempt, she was unaware of their presence.
1766	10638	4	1	"To me, it appears that whoever uttered those words must have been undergoing a multitude of experiences and felt as though they were being tested. Alternatively, perhaps someone whom she deeply loved had left her, as the text states, ""when they come back."" Thus, @CAPS1 surmises that someone @MONTH1 has departed. The reason I posit that the person @MONTH1 felt as if they were being tested is that it says, ""I will take the test again."
1767	10639	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this segment as it demonstrates her continued unease. For instance, when she broke down in the flower shop, it indicates that despite certain things evoking memories of home, it is not the same. One must adapt and acclimate to a new environment. This also suggests that she believes with more time to adjust to her new abode, she will be capable of passing the test.
1768	10640	4	1	"The author employs this conclusion for a specific purpose. The rationale behind the author's use of this cliffhanger - style conclusion is to maintain the reader's interest and leave them craving more. By stating, ""I will take that test again,"" the author prompts the reader to question whether Saeng will pass the test on the next attempt and to wonder what ""the test"" actually entails."
1769	10641	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph likely because she does not wish for the snow to melt, thereby preventing the geese from returning. Additionally, I believe it aims to apprise the reader of Saeng's thoughts at that moment.
1770	10642	4	1	There was a particular reason why the author concluded the story with that quote. The author intended to illustrate how the plant instilled in Saeng a novel sense of determination. Previously, Saeng was distraught and tearing the plant apart. However, it seems that she realized how the plant managed to bud against the odds and survive. Consequently, she is now resolved to confront the odds as well and retake the test she failed.
