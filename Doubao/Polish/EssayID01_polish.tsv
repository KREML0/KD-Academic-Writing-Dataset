1	1	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I contend that the impacts computers exert on individuals are highly beneficial in terms of learning skills and social interaction. They afford us opportunities to engage in conversations with friends and new acquaintances, facilitate our exploration of the world (including astronomy), and keep us out of trouble! Consider this: Don't you concur? How would you feel if your teenager were constantly on the phone with friends? Do you ever have the chance to converse with your friends or business partners? Well, now there's a novel way to communicate—the computer. There are numerous websites on the internet for this purpose, such as @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, Facebook, MySpace, etc. Just envision that while you're arranging a meeting with your boss via the computer, your teenager can enjoy chatting on the phone without the rush to hang up because you need the line. How did you learn about other countries or states outside your own? I've learned through the computer and the internet; it's a new avenue to stay informed about current affairs! You might think your child spends excessive time on the computer, but pose some questions to them about the economy, sea - floor spreading, or even about @DATE1, and you'll be astonished at their knowledge. Believe it or not, the computer is far more engaging than sitting in class all day reading from books. If your child is at home using the computer or at a local library, it's preferable to being out with friends, being disrespectful, or succumbing to peer pressure to do something they know is wrong. You might not know where your child is; heaven forbid they end up in a hospital bed due to a drive - by. Instead, having your child on the computer, learning, chatting, or simply playing games, is safe and sound in your home or community. I sincerely hope you now understand and agree with me, as computers can have a profound positive impact on you and your child. They provide us with time to interact with friends and new people, assist us in learning about the world, and, incredibly, keep us out of trouble. Thank you for your consideration.
2	2	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am of the opinion that the utilization of computers will confer numerous advantages upon us. For instance, it enables us to communicate and establish friendships with others through platforms like Facebook and MySpace. Employing computers can aid us in determining coordinates, locations, and accessing a vast amount of information. Moreover, computers are beneficial in the workplace, such as when drafting a house plan or typing a @NUM1 - page report for a job, which is far more efficient than manual writing. Now, let's delve into the remarkable realm of technology. Using a computer can enhance our lives by facilitating online communication and friendship - building. Many individuals have accounts on MySpace, Facebook, and AIM, all of which enable us to engage in conversations with one another. Some people believe that computers are detrimental, but how can one make friends if they have no means of communication? I am extremely fortunate to possess a computer that supports not only my academic endeavors but also my social life and friendship - making. Computers assist us in finding locations, coordinates, and a wealth of information online. If we didn't frequently access the internet, we wouldn't know how to navigate websites like @LOCATION1, which can help us with location and coordinate information. Would you prefer to use a computer or be in @LOCATION3 when you're supposed to be vacationing in @LOCATION2? A vast amount of information can be found on the internet. You can pose almost any question, and a computer will likely have the answer. Would you rather effortlessly create a house plan on a computer or spend @NUM1 hours painstakingly drawing one by hand, marred by eraser marks? It's highly unlikely you'll secure a job with such a subpar drawing. Additionally, when applying for a job, many applicants are required to write lengthy papers, such as a @NUM3 - word essay on why they are the best fit for the position. Many people I know dislike writing non - stop for hours when they could complete the task much more efficiently on a computer. This is why computers are in high demand nowadays. I hope this essay has influenced your perspective on computers, as they are truly remarkable tools to work with. The other day, I taught my mother how to use a computer, and she said it was the greatest invention since sliced bread! Now, go ahead and purchase a computer to help you chat online with friends, find locations, and access a vast amount of information with just a click of a button. It will also assist you in presenting neat, well - prepared, and printed work that your boss will surely appreciate.
3	3	1	1	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 In contemporary society, an increasing number of people are using computers, yet not everyone concurs that this trend is beneficial to society. Those who advocate for technological advancements believe that computers have a positive influence on individuals, while others hold different viewpoints. A significant portion of the global population currently uses computers, some for work and others for entertainment. Computers are one of humanity's greatest achievements. They are useful in numerous ways, such as accessing @CAPS4, news, and live streams. However, I must clarify that an excessive number of people spend an inordinate amount of time on computers and should instead engage in face - to - face interactions. Nevertheless, it is not our place to dictate their actions. When I grow up, I aspire to become an author or a journalist, and I am well aware that both professions require extensive computer use. Although one may demand more computer time than the other, the point remains clear. So, what if some experts claim that people are spending too much time on computers and neglecting exercise, nature, and social interactions with family and friends? For all we know, many people rely on computers for their livelihoods. We have no insight into their reasons for heavy computer use, and to be honest, it is none of our concern, nor should it be the so - called experts'. People engage in countless interactions on computers every day. Computers keep many children off the streets, preventing them from causing trouble. They also assist the @ORGANIZATION1 in tracking down most - wanted criminals. As demonstrated, computers are more valuable to society than one might initially think, and they bring significant benefits to it.
4	4	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I have discovered that numerous experts assert that computers do not contribute positively to our society. While this may be true in certain cases, studies predominantly indicate that computers can be of great assistance to people. Although nothing can fully replace in - person communication, computers can come remarkably close, as exemplified by webcams and email. @PERCENT1 of students with high grades refer to reliable websites for research or to find suitable books. Additionally, online catalogs and advertisements bolster the economy of stores worldwide. If people were prohibited from using computers, much of the modern world as we know it would cease to exist. @PERSON1 stated that the computer is the most effective form of modern communication due to its ability to enable writing, talking, and responding at a significantly lower cost. Almost every event I attend is organized via computer - mediated communication, such as email. ""@CAPS2 If a student is absent due to illness and needs homework or assistance with studying for a test, they can always contact their teacher via email, the most convenient form of communication. Even the post office relies on computers to deliver letters and packages. The president of the post office, @PERSON2, said, ""@CAPS3 It would be impossible to deliver mail to our customers if computers did not inform us of a zip code's location or a box's weight."" @CAPS4, which keeps people informed about global events, would not exist without the modern communication capabilities provided by computers. Since information can be disseminated rapidly, so can research. When a survey was conducted in the country of @LOCATION2, @PERCENT2 of people used computers for any type of research. Of these, @PERCENT3 were current students, and @PERCENT4 of them had good grades. When the same survey was carried out in @LOCATION1, @PERCENT5 of people used computers for various reasons, and @PERCENT2 were students with good grades. ""@CAPS3 If I were unable to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online, I probably would not have achieved an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Can you imagine if suddenly your newspaper reporters were unable to use the internet for their reports? The articles would likely be published @NUM1 days after the events. Most businesses, including newspapers, use the internet for advertising, shopping, and reading. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website, and @PERCENT5 of them held prominent positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports stated that they use an online catalog because it is more cost - effective. They also promote it as a means to save trees and enhance customer convenience. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can create websites to promote themselves and explain their offerings to potential customers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2, said that the internet saved her restaurant. ""@CAPS3 If it were not for the internet, @NUM3 more people would be unemployed in @LOCATION3. In conclusion, computers are indispensable to everyday people. Without them, many conveniences would disappear. They facilitate global communication, support people in researching school reports, and contribute to the improvement of the economy on a daily basis. In moderation, computers are the most useful tools available."
5	5	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I am firmly convinced that computers have a positive impact on individuals. They serve to connect families, offer a wealth of information for educational purposes, and provide great convenience. Computers represent a step towards the future, and we should fully capitalize on their potential. Firstly, the internet and email enable family members to stay connected. My family, residing @NUM1 hours away by car, enjoys communicating with me via email. This not only helps me maintain close ties with my family but also provides another compelling reason for the adoption of computers. Another family - related benefit is that when family members are idly sitting around, searching everywhere for a board game, it is far more convenient to look for it online. This way, they can quickly and easily find the desired game. Moreover, if a family wishes to participate in an activity and needs relevant information and contact numbers, they can simply access the internet. The internet provides not only the numbers but also some details about the activity, enabling more families to engage in joint activities. As is evident, computers are bringing families closer together. Another significant advantage of computers for society lies in education. With a vast amount of information readily available, more and more people are motivated to learn. Nowadays, people are eager to acquire knowledge, and the comprehensive tools on computers facilitate the educational process. Secondly, computers offer an alternative approach to higher education. If a student is unable to attend school or college due to illness, they need not miss any coursework. With just a click of a button, they can access the necessary materials. Finally, in @LOCATION2, most classrooms lack the financial resources to purchase a computer. The children are extremely eager to have one. If they were to receive a computer, it would bring about a significant transformation. They would be able to learn much more, including about distant countries. As a result, computers would revolutionize our learning methods. The last but not least reason for the usefulness of computers is convenience. In today's fast - paced world, we tend to avoid unnecessary outings and interactions. Computers offer the option of video conferencing, enabling effective communication between work partners. This ability to communicate for work purposes would alleviate the workload and stress on individuals. This is just one of the many ways in which computers are convenient. Additionally, one can book flights, vacations, rentals, etc. with a simple click of a button. For example, one could effortlessly plan a trip to @CAPS1 or a wonderful vacation. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset that enriches our lives in multiple aspects.
6	6	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I opine that computers exert a detrimental influence on us! In America, how many individuals have access to a computer daily? @NUM1, and how many use it for at least an hour a @NUM2? This implies that @NUM3 people who could exercise are instead squandering time and face the possibility of physical @CAPS1. Does that seem favorable to you? Contemplate all the actions involved when writing a letter. I rose, gathered all the materials, and then sat back down. After finishing writing, I had to put away all the materials, place the letter in the mailbox, and walk all the way back. This was my experience. Now, consider how one writes an email: simply sit down and move one's fingers. Can you discern the difference? @CAPS2 Instead of taking a beneficial walk to a friend's house to converse, you merely communicate with them electronically. Did you know that you can essentially purchase anything on your computer? Instead of engaging in activities that could enhance your well - being, your computer divulges information. This information can lead to various issues, and ultimately, everything you possess could be lost. All of this, just so you can go online. Believe it or not, you can physically sustain injuries from excessive computer use. @NUM4 Another aspect is that when you're at a computer @CAPS2, what happened to my grandpa illustrates that sitting in a wooden chair all day can lead to arthritis in your muscles. @CAPS3
7	7	1	1	Did you realize that an increasing number of individuals these days rely on computers for their safety, natural education, and social lives? In my view, the escalating utilization of computers is not advantageous to society. Initially, one's safety while using a computer is jeopardized. To commence, when someone communicates with another via a computer, they @MONTH1 can never ascertain who is on the other end. For instance, @CAPS1 if a young girl is playing a game on the computer and a person starts conversing with her, it could be a predator. She will remain unaware unless they meet in person. By then, it might be too late. Moreover, studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of people's information has become more widely exposed in the past @NUM1 years due to new chat websites such as MySpace and Facebook. On these platforms, people share their personal details, thereby putting their safety at risk. Ultimately, individuals should curtail their computer usage to safeguard their safety. Furthermore, in our world replete with magnificent landscapes, vast waters, dense forests, and verdant valleys, experiencing nature firsthand is imperative. @CAPS1 If you depend on your computer to educate yourself about the world, you should discontinue this practice. One must venture outdoors to experience the tactile sensations, scents, and even the flavors of nature. A recent study reveals that individuals who visited the Grand Canyon could compose a @NUM1 - page essay on what they learned. Those who merely read information from their computers were unable to write as extensively. In conclusion, society should distance itself from computers. Thirdly, a person's social life can be severely impaired by computer use for multiple reasons. One such reason is that a person may spend all their time on the computer instead of interacting with family and friends. Although you can chat with people online, it pales in comparison to face - to - face conversations. There's no need to communicate with a friend or family member online when you can do so in person. Finally, @CAPS1 if someone takes an embarrassing picture of you and uploads it to their computer, it will remain there indefinitely. Consequently, you can lose friends, whether you're the subject of the picture or the person who posted it. Thus, excessive computer use can easily ruin your family and social life. How would you feel @CAPS1 if it were your fault that someone's safety was at risk? Wouldn't you prefer to experience nature in person rather than observing it on your computer and missing out on the full impact? Couldn't you engage in face - to - face conversations with your friends and family instead of neglecting them for computer use? There are numerous ways in which the rising rate of computer use fails to benefit society. I urge you to concur with me that computers can endanger one's safety, diminish their understanding of nature, and disrupt their social life.
8	8	1	1	"@PERCENT1 of individuals concur that computers simplify life. I, too, share this sentiment. Utilizing computers fosters hand - eye coordination, enables people to acquire knowledge about distant places and individuals, and facilitates online communication. I believe these are all highly significant. Why wouldn't one desire to possess strong hand - eye coordination? I consider this a crucial skill. Computers assist in teaching and maintaining strong hand - eye coordination. While looking at the screen, one's hand maneuvers the mouse to the desired location. Good hand - eye coordination is applicable in numerous aspects of life; in fact, it is involved in almost everything. In sports such as baseball, hand - eye coordination is one of the most vital elements. Why not enhance this skill outside of the playing field? Additionally, hand - eye coordination can be employed while taking notes at @ORGANIZATION1. It is integral to almost every activity you undertake. One cannot afford to have poor hand - eye coordination, as it can impede normal functioning. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors affirm that hand - eye coordination is essential for a healthy lifestyle. ""I adore traveling, but I prefer to gather information about my destination before making travel arrangements,"" stated @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1. I'm certain many people share his sentiment. They wish to have up - to - date information about the places they plan to visit. Computers offer an abundance of information about various locations worldwide. Some books may not provide as much detail or may be outdated. Computers are also excellent for learning about different cultures and traditions. No one wants to be uninformed, right? People desire quick and easy access to global information, which computers can provide. I recall when I was around @NUM2 years old, our home phone malfunctioned, and we couldn't replace it immediately. The only means of communicating with our family and friends was through the computer. It made it convenient to email everyone and explain why we weren't answering the house phone. This situation occurs more frequently than one might think. People often rely on computers for communication. At work, if you need to communicate with an employee or colleague but cannot leave your desk, you can simply email the information. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees claim that emailing information is faster and more convenient than speaking on the phone or in person. Many people agree that computers significantly simplify life. Computers teach hand - eye coordination and facilitate communication with others. The most crucial reason is that they allow people to learn about distant places and individuals. You can influence public perception of computers. Write to your local newspaper. The time to act is now!"
9	9	1	1	"Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a profound impact on human existence. It has transformed the way we conduct nearly every aspect of our lives today. The most well - known manifestation of this is the computer. This device empowers people to make online purchases, engage in online conversations, and provides entertainment for some. These are all excellent attributes that enhance everyone's quality of life. Imagine opening your refrigerator and noticing it is nearly empty. Someone has the car, and the grocery store is too far away. What would you do? Well, you could use a computer to search for food online. There are numerous great deals, and some companies even offer free delivery! This is an amazing and effortless way to purchase food without leaving your home. However, food is not the only item you can buy. A wide range of products are available for purchase through the computer. Do you need new toys for children? Or perhaps a new hat for a friend? Maybe you want more curtains for your room? With easy internet access on a computer, you can acquire all these items and more. The computer has also revolutionized communication. Suppose someone wishes to communicate with a friend or relative living in a distant country. @CAPS1 If someone does not own a phone or @CAPS1 cannot make a call, all they need to do is use the computer. You can communicate with anyone simply by using your email address. Now, friends and families can converse with ease via the computer. Just type what you want to say, and ""boom,"" instant communication on the chat. Let's be realistic. Regardless of whether it's a child or a teenager, their entertainment options can be limited. But with a computer, all that can change. With a single click, you can watch a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 if you don't want to watch a movie? There are other forms of entertainment such as listening to music, watching interesting content, and perhaps the most popular, playing games. Everyone enjoys playing a game occasionally, and with thousands of online games to choose from, there is bound to be a game that everyone finds enjoyable. There are even educational games that many children love. With all the entertainment a computer can offer, who could dislike it? All in all, the computer is a revolutionary device that has transformed the way we shop, communicate, and find engaging entertainment. Being able to accomplish so much with just a few clicks is truly extraordinary. It amazes me to think, ""@CAPS1 if we can achieve this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future."
10	10	1	1	In @LOCATION1, we possess the technology of the computer. Some assert that computers are beneficial to society. I dissent; I believe they are detrimental for several reasons. These reasons include obesity, cramps, increased sexual harassment, and even cyberbullying. Firstly, if people do not disengage from computers and engage in physical exercise, it can lead to obesity. Consider this scenario: if you observe a child who has never attended school and initially weighs @NUM1 pounds. The only activity this child will be inclined to do is play on the computer, and as a result, they will gain weight. Secondly, the constant typing sound is all you hear when a child is on the computer. @CAPS1 When teenagers return home from school and immediately turn to the computer, spending long hours on it, especially on school nights, they are @CAPS1 more likely to experience severe cramps. These cramps can result from typing too rapidly, forcefully, and for extended periods. They can also occur from sitting for too long and then attempting to stand up, only to find that moving is painful due to muscle strain. Additionally, there is a significant increase in sexual harassment. Some children enter chat rooms to share good news with friends but leave feeling angry and frustrated. The reason is that someone has made fun of them, and they do not appreciate it. This occurs approximately @PERCENT1 of the time when teenagers and even adults enter online chat rooms. This is the third reason why computers have a substantial impact on people. The final reason is cyberbullying. Cyberbullying occurs when someone harasses another person online. Have you noticed that children may become impoverished or ill because they fear being hurt or killed over something trivial? Well, I have, and it is not pleasant. Now, the unfortunate reality is that if a child attends school online, they @MONTH1 may be cyberbullied for not being intelligent enough or not having the financial means to attend a traditional school. Cyberbullying typically takes place in online chat rooms. This is where families may face financial ruin, running out of money and food. They @MONTH1 may even lose their child or their home because someone wants to appear tough and gain popularity in school. In conclusion, these are just a few ways that computers affect people. Obesity, cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying are not matters to be taken lightly, and experiencing them is far from enjoyable. Now, it's your turn to share your thoughts on computers. Do you believe they are beneficial to society, or do they corrupt young minds and make life miserable for those who use them?
11	11	1	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, while the @CAPS1 populace recognizes the substantial advancements computers offer, they also expose us to @CAPS1 drawbacks. Computers are known to contribute to the development of health issues. As individuals become more immersed in the online realm, they tend to engage less with their families. One must not overlook the peril of online predators, who pose a lethal threat. @CAPS1 individuals who merely watch television are often termed ""couch potatoes."" Those fixated on their computer screens are no better. Numerous top doctors in @LOCATION2 assert that excessive computer usage can harm your health. Doctors worldwide emphasize the importance of exercise, yet the only ""exercise"" a computer addict undertakes is rapid typing. They can easily succumb to obesity, which often leads to depression as the realization sets in. Addiction itself is a grave health concern. It would not be surprising if rehab centers add a computer - focused wing in the near future. These problems are gradually spreading, and we must unite to eliminate them! Family time holds a cherished value among the @CAPS2 people, but recently, computers are undermining this tradition. With so many @CAPS1 individuals engrossed in online drama, friends, and video games, family interaction is on the decline. People gradually detach from reality and enter an alternate cyberspace world. They @MONTH1 only leave their rooms to use the restroom and eat, scarcely taking breaks. This can cause significant tension or sorrow in @CAPS1 families. Who can erase the terrifying abduction stories from their memories? Online predators are highly dangerous and extremely cunning. Your children might be conversing with someone they believe is another teenager seeking a confidant, when in reality, it could be a forty - year - old serial killer waiting for the right moment to strike. Studies indicate that one - fourth of online users have encountered a dangerous individual."
12	12	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I contend that computers detract from people's lives and are less significant than other aspects of life. Firstly, it is evident that the world is becoming obese due to a lack of physical activity. Moreover, people fail to recognize that @CAPS3 warming is emerging as a major problem. Finally, families are not as close - knit as they once were. These are the reasons why computers hold little importance in human society. Firstly, the world is becoming obese, and computers play a substantial role in this. Computers do not encourage people to exercise; instead, individuals simply sit on their couches and use them, which does nothing to help America regain its physical fitness. Additionally, computers can become a habit. If a person uses a computer daily, it will turn into an addiction, and they will be unable to stop. Finally, when people use computers, they are oblivious to the lack of exercise they are getting. This is the first reason why computers are detrimental. Next, @CAPS3 warming is melting the polar ice caps. Computers contribute to @CAPS3 warming as they consume electricity, which in turn melts the polar ice caps. If this trend continues, the ice caps will all melt, and we will lose our shorelines, and half of the world will be flooded. Finally, computers play a significant role in @CAPS3 warming because of their widespread popularity. This is another reason why computers are harmful. Lastly, the final reason why computers are bad is that they erode family life. For instance, an increasing number of families are splitting up, and scientists state that @PERCENT1 of the time, it is due to technology. When one person is on the computer, others feel that they are loved more than themselves. Then, they part ways permanently. This is the last reason why I believe computers are bad. In conclusion, it is clear that computers are a negative influence. Firstly, America is becoming obese because of computers. Secondly, computers are causing @CAPS3 warming and will eventually flood the earth. And last but not least, computers detract from people's family life and cause them to separate and become unhappy. These are all the reasons why computers are bad.
13	13	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I have read your argument regarding computers and believe they have a positive impact on people. The primary reason I hold this view is that computers offer a multitude of capabilities. For example, if you reside in Maine and your cousin lives in California, you can engage in a web chat with them. Secondly, you can access news from anywhere in the world. You could be on a plane, where it would otherwise be extremely boring, but you can take out your computer and start working. When you mentioned that computers detract from exercise, some individuals actually use computers to track their running speed, the number of miles they cover, and even their diet. The third reason is that some people's jobs are centered around computers or computer manufacturing. For instance, when you wrote this article, you did not use a typewriter but a computer and then printed it. Without computers, your @CAPS1 would be significantly more challenging. Thank you for considering my perspective. When you re - evaluate this issue, please take these three reasons into account.
14	14	1	1	My three key points for this newspaper article are as follows: Firstly, state my opinion on the effects of computers. Secondly, provide detailed reasons to persuade the local newspaper to concur with my stance. These are my three ideas for the newspaper article. To begin, my opinion is that computers are a waste of time. Many individuals squander time on computers, similar to how overweight people could be running or exercising instead of sitting in front of a computer. Instead of being on the computer, one should go out with their girlfriend, family, or friends to have a good time. Spending excessive time on the computer is detrimental, as many children watch inappropriate content meant for adults. It is beneficial to use the computer, but not for extended periods. You should agree with me because of my detailed points and reasons. My reasons include the fact that there is a great deal of inappropriate content, such as porn, on the internet. Many children watch this, which ruins their morals and future. They become addicted to such viewing. People who use computers for positive purposes, such as educational games, are an exception. These are my detailed points and reasons for you to agree with me. I will organize my ideas effectively and present them clearly. It is fine to use the computer, but not for too long. Instead, one should go out, play, and exercise and enjoy life rather than being glued to the computer. The negative aspect is that many children watch bad content, and the computer contains truly inappropriate material. Computers are used for everything these days. This is how I have organized my ideas. In conclusion, these are my ideas for the newspaper. I have stated my opinion on the effects of computers, provided detailed reasons to persuade the local newspaper to agree with me, and I believe I have organized and presented my ideas clearly. These ideas can help the newspaper understand the effects of computers.
15	15	1	1	Dear, in today's world, it is advisable for everyone to utilize computers. Computers have a positive influence on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable individuals to learn about distant places and people, and even facilitate online communication with others. Today, computers are akin to the world's largest repository of knowledge. Everything one needs to know can be found in a computer. You can explore faraway places, and with a click, all the necessary information appears right in front of you. Computers are efficient and user - friendly, accessible to everyone. Nowadays, children are highly addicted to computers and are on them every day. There are numerous websites that kids and teenagers frequent, such as @CAPS1 and Facebook, etc. On these platforms, children as young as ten years old are chatting with friends and posting pictures. There are also web - chat websites that allow users to use a webcam and communicate with people anywhere in the world. Computers are an excellent means of staying in touch with others. Every household should have a computer today.
16	16	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer powered on, and an image of a fair - haired girl appeared on the screen. Thanks to the actual @CAPS1 girl offering an explanation, it was effortless to gain insights into life in @LOCATION2. Visiting the library would not have provided such invaluable information and human interaction. Computers are an essential component of life if society aims to develop and expand. They should be supported as they cultivate hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant locations, and facilitate online communication with others.  Firstly, computers contribute to the teaching of hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is a valuable skill that aids in excelling at sports. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of children reported an improvement in their hand - eye coordination after using a computer. Even a simple task like tying can enhance this skill. Renowned neurologist @CAPS2 @PERSON1 stated in an article last week that, ""@CAPS3 and computer usage strengthen the @CAPS2. When using a computer, one automatically translates visual input into commands for the hands."" Enhanced hand - eye coordination can enhance performance in sports such as baseball and basketball. If someone wishes to improve in these sports, all they need to do is turn on the computer. Once people become more proficient in sports, they are more likely to participate and lead a healthier lifestyle. In fact, computers can assist with physical activity rather than impede it.  Additionally, computers allow individuals to access information about far - off places and people. If someone wants to research @LOCATION1, all they have to do is enter a search query, and a plethora of results will be presented, offering endless exploration. Moreover, the ability to learn about different cultures can foster greater understanding and tolerance among people. Computers are a versatile tool that can benefit people in various aspects of life.  Lastly, computers and technology enable people to engage in online chats. Computer - based chat and video chat can bridge the gap between different nations. When a story emerges about an event in @LOCATION3, people can simply log on to their computers and seek the perspective of an actual @LOCATION3 resident. Furthermore, video chat and online conversations can reduce costly phone bills. In this economic climate, no one wants to spend more than necessary. Another advantage is that one can connect with family members they rarely visit, strengthening family bonds.  Evidently, computers are a useful asset in today's era. Their advancements propel the world towards a better future. Computers are beneficial as they teach hand - eye coordination, allow people to learn about distant places and individuals, and enable online communication. Imagine a world without computers or technological advancements. The world would be fragmented, interpersonal contact scarce, and information dissemination slow. The internet is like a vast collection of libraries. People would know little about other nations, and news would spread at a snail's pace. Is this the kind of world we want to live in?"
17	17	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers exert a negative influence on people's lives. I hold this view because individuals who spend excessive time on computers do not venture outdoors as frequently as they should, fail to allocate sufficient time to their families, and computers have their limitations.  My primary reason is that I believe people need to increase their outdoor activities. When they remain indoors, they neglect physical exercise, which is detrimental to their health. Instead of merely watching sports events or checking scores, they should actively participate in games. I also believe that they should appreciate nature, as they are squandering the beauty that surrounds them. We should not waste our capabilities and privileges, should we?  Another factor is the lack of quality time spent with family. If family members are nearby, one should seize the opportunity to interact with them. Engaging in games or simply spending time together can be enjoyable and enhance social skills, something that computers cannot always achieve, leading me to my next point.  Computers are not all - encompassing. While some computer usage is acceptable, excessive reliance can lead to addiction. Although computers may contain a wealth of information, there is little that cannot be found in books. For instance, a computer cannot show affection to a dog. This is a clear indication that we should limit our computer time. There are numerous activities, such as sports, taking care of family, and pursuing hobbies, that cannot be accomplished on a computer.  It is important to remember that while computers can be useful on occasion, they cannot replace living a fulfilling life. This is why I advocate for spending less time on computers, more time outdoors, and engaging in meaningful interactions with family. Computers have their place, but they cannot do everything.
18	18	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I must concede that the experts are indeed correct. I am acquainted with individuals who spend the entire day on computers, and in my opinion, this is far from beneficial. Instead of using computers to learn about distant places and communicate with others, one should engage in physical exercise, relax, and interact with family and friends.  Physical exercise is far superior to computer use. When one sits in front of a computer, playing online games or browsing, they are likely to become bored and hungry. It is common to have snacks nearby while using a computer. Instead of spending @NUM1 or @NUM2 hours, or even the whole day, in front of a computer and potentially gaining weight, there are numerous ways to exercise. One can take walks, go jogging, or play a sport. There are countless activities available when not glued to a computer. I know people who work all day yet still return home to their computers.  Rest is also essential. One does not always have to immediately turn to a computer. One can relax by watching a movie, enjoying some popcorn, and simply having a good time. Taking a short nap is also an option. There is no need to rush to the computer if it is not necessary.  In my view, family and computers will always be present, but the question is which is more important. Friends may not always be reliable, and one only needs a select few. The key point is that both family and true friends have emotions. If one neglects them in favor of a computer that will still be there when they leave and return, something is amiss. Tomorrow is uncertain, and we should live in the present. Therefore, one should seize the opportunity to enjoy life, engage in active pursuits, spend time with family and friends, and if one is fond of computers, strive to maintain a balanced schedule.
19	19	1	1	I eagerly await the advancement of technology. The progress of technology is beginning to help find a cure for ailments. Without technology, we would not have reached the moon. Technology evolves as we innovate. People engage in technological pursuits for the betterment of life. Famous inventors, like Leonardo da Vinci with his flying machine, utilize technology to make advancements. Technology is truly remarkable.
20	20	1	1	Computers can be either beneficial or detrimental. I truly cannot perceive how computers could be a negative factor for me. I am also aware that computers can and will assist people across the globe. I believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals like me.  Computers teach hand - eye coordination. They are also invaluable when one needs to conduct research for a school project. With a computer, one can create a wide range of items, including music, designer @CAPS1 - shirts, logos, banners, and many other creative works. Additionally, computers allow users to search for available homes and apartments. One can even complete a job application online, saving trips to physical locations. How amazing is that!  I am an ordinary person, neither wealthy nor famous, yet computers offer a wealth of information that people rely on today. This is why I believe that computers have a positive influence on people, and one does not need to be extremely intelligent to use them.
21	21	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 daily, I am penning this correspondence to address the matter of computers in our contemporary society. Each day, novel discoveries are made by individuals who utilize computers within our community. Nevertheless, numerous individuals contend that computers are detrimental to our society. Today, I aim to persuade you and the broader society that computers are not as problematic as some individuals assert.  To commence, discoveries within our nation have been progressing at a rapid pace. Daily, new findings are conferring benefits upon our society, yet these are only rendered feasible through the assistance of computers. Without computers, certain diseases would have remained undiscovered, and a greater number of individuals would have perished.  Secondly, computers have also augmented medical care and have served as the decisive factor between life and death.  Finally, computers facilitate the acceleration of production rates for automobiles, household necessities, and numerous other objects.  Have you ever found yourself bored at home, seeking an activity on a dark, rainy, and frigid evening? Precisely as I surmised. Well, the recent technological advancements in social networking can even engage the most bored and solitary individuals, offering them something to occupy their time. Even if you merely wish to converse with someone, you can effortlessly achieve this via the internet. Thus, those of you in search of a special someone will always have a means to look. With all the social networks such as Twitter, MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube, you will never be at a loss for something to do.  During this economic recession, it appears that securing employment is arduous. However, the internet once again comes to the rescue. The internet can assist you in finding a job at least twice, if not three times, as swiftly. Many individuals also enhance their work efficiency by utilizing the computer. With Microsoft applications, it is far easier to complete the work you need to catch up on.  I hope that everyone can comprehend the extent to which computers aid rather than harm you. @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I trust that you and the rest of the community can recognize that computers offer more benefits than drawbacks. Thank you very much for your time and attention.
22	22	1	1	Dear local Newspaper @CAPS1, I propose that all computers be distributed to people around the world so that they can remain in their homes, engaging in conversations with their families and friends. Computers enable individuals globally to connect with one another. They also assist children in completing their homework and accessing information about events transpiring across the globe.
23	23	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, have you ever witnessed a child engrossed in a computer for hours on end, impervious to all distractions? I firmly believe that this phenomenon is extremely deleterious to the child, as it precludes them from engaging in physical exercise, interacting face - to - face with others, or fully utilizing their cognitive faculties to their maximum potential. As our society progresses, we tend to become more indolent and neglect these essential aspects of life. I am of the opinion that taking a step back from excessive computer use could yield greater benefits for society than continued reliance on them.  Obesity rates in the @LOCATION2 have reached an all - time high. @PERCENT1 of kids in the @LOCATION3 admit that they exercise only once a week and would prefer to spend their time on the computer. Consider this: @PERCENT1 of kids represents more than @NUM2 of @CAPS2 children. I conducted a comparison with @CAPS3 children who do not have access to this technology. I discovered that @PERCENT1 of children there also exercise only once a week, which is significantly less. These computers are having a profound impact on @LOCATION3. @PERCENT2 of children are overweight, and @PERCENT3 of them develop heart or blood - related problems in adulthood.  By exercise, I refer to activities such as playing with friends, cycling, or going for a jog. It does not seem overly onerous, does it? If we make a conscious effort to spend more time on physical activities rather than on computers, I believe we can reduce the prevalence of obesity, and I am confident that @CAPS2 can improve as a nation.  On the computer, there are popular websites such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7. These websites allow users to interact with people across the globe in various ways. However, they also enable anyone to communicate with others, potentially with malicious intent. More than @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in my school claim to have accounts on these platforms and have posted personal information. With this personal data at risk, and given the rise in crime associated with these websites by @PERCENT4, it is a cause for concern.  Moreover, these websites erode people's social skills. Individuals spend countless hours on these platforms, conversing with others online, and forget how to engage in face - to - face conversations. @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 students admit that they would say things online that they would never utter in person. This leads to increased problems in schools and could potentially result in harm to oneself or others.  I have heard numerous reports in the news about suicides linked to computer use. I firmly believe that with less computer dependency, people would spend more time with their families, and our nation would be more closely - knit and secure. Computers prevent us from exploring nature and fully engaging our minds. They offer an easy way out, and I, for one, find myself becoming more indolent as a result. Instead of visiting a library and reading a book, I can simply access information on the computer. Computers deprive us of the opportunity to apply our minds and solve real - life problems. I have spent countless hours on the computer, engrossed in games, without even realizing the passage of time. Eliminating excessive computer use would make a significant difference. Children are living through their computers, and we have the power to change this situation.
24	24	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I have learned that a significant number of individuals do not believe that computers contribute positively to society. I vehemently disagree with this view. Computers confer numerous benefits upon society, including the development of hand - eye coordination, the facilitation of learning about foreign locales, and the enhancement of online communication.  Some individuals are naturally endowed with excellent hand - eye coordination, but the majority, like myself, are not. Thanks to computers, my hand - eye coordination has witnessed a remarkable improvement. According to @PERSON2, ""On average, computers can enhance a person's hand - eye coordination by up to @PERCENT1."" Just consider, by learning to type, your hand - eye coordination can increase by @PERCENT1! This is truly astonishing. Possessing good hand - eye coordination can open many doors in life and is beneficial for mundane daily activities such as playing a musical instrument or performing household chores. It is also indispensable in sports, where accurate throwing, catching, and aiming are required. If more people dedicated more time to using computers, the overall hand - eye coordination of the population would increase. Who would not desire such an outcome?  Have you ever heard of @LOCATION1? It is a country in @LOCATION2 that remains relatively unknown to most. By conducting research on the computer, you can become an authority on this nation. The computer provides us with access to a vast reservoir of knowledge, enabling us to become more informed global citizens. This knowledge can enhance our travel experiences. Instead of revisiting the same vacation destinations year after year, you can explore a place you discovered online that appears equally captivating. Additionally, by learning about other countries and their inhabitants, we develop a greater sense of respect for them. We also gain insights into their traditions and cultures. As @PERSON1 aptly states, ""The internet grants us access to the world. We can acquire a wealth of new knowledge that will deepen our understanding of people, countries, and the environment."" @CAPS1 is correct; we can also become more environmentally conscious. Given the pressing issue of global warming, we can learn how to preserve foreign places by studying them on the internet. With a simple click of the mouse, you can have the entire world at your disposal!  In a recent study, @PERCENT2 of respondents claimed that they lack the time to meet with old friends. However, the internet has revolutionized communication, making it quick and effortless to interact with others online. Social networking sites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 can maintain your social life and even reconnect you with long - lost friends. For instance, @CAPS2 is ideal for staying in touch with family members. You can keep abreast of the lives of many people through @CAPS2! Moreover, you can forge new friendships. Most teenagers express a willingness to meet new people, and the internet offers an excellent platform for this purpose. Websites like @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 can connect you with random individuals in a chat room, facilitating conversations. I once engaged in a conversation with someone on @CAPS7 for over an hour. We discovered that we both had @CAPS4 accounts and have since maintained contact there. This online interaction also boosts your confidence, as you may find the courage to express yourself on the computer in ways you would not in real life. The computer can truly invigorate your social life.  As is evident, computers do not merely ""tax your brain""; they enhance hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning about distant places, and enrich your social life by enabling seamless communication with others. Computers contribute far more to society than most people realize."
25	25	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, right off the bat, I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial to numerous individuals, whether for accessing information or communicating with friends. Although it is true that many children should allocate more time to outdoor activities, the computer provides a well - structured environment that aids children in learning and interacting with their peers. I am of the opinion that children should have the freedom to use the computer for as long as they wish, provided they also make time to venture outside, socialize with friends, and so on. While the computer can be a source of entertainment, it is always crucial to step outside and appreciate the beauty of nature.  Another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is related to their well - being. If a child becomes addicted to the computer, it can impede their social interaction skills and may even cause significant harm to their cognitive development. However, I still advocate that children should have access to the computer, as it offers a wealth of educational opportunities.  Many children grow up to pursue careers in computer technology or software programming. Some even complete their education online or use the computer to teach others. The computer represents an endless source of intellectual stimulation, enabling people to learn, play, and explore new ideas. Many individuals harbor dreams of one day building a computer or developing innovative software programs.  All students should have the right to spend time on the computer, but they should also ensure they set aside time for outdoor activities and socializing with friends. Everyone holds their own views on the appropriate amount of computer use. I do not believe that children should spend excessive time on the computer, as it may have adverse effects on their health and how they are perceived by others. In conclusion, a balanced approach is essential to ensure that children can reap the benefits of computers while maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle.
26	26	1	1	"Do you contemplate whether computers are inutile? Or do you opine that they can be advantageous in numerous ways? I recall @CAPS4 when my elder sister had to conduct research on @CAPS1, the computer furnished her with all the information she required. The matter to deliberate upon is that an increasing number of individuals utilize computers, yet not everyone concurs that this is beneficial to society. I firmly believe that @CAPS2 indeed benefits society in multiple respects! Here's why: the computer enables you to communicate with friends, conduct research on people, places, or things, and unwind and relish playing on an engaging, entertaining website! My initial rationale is that @CAPS2 allows you to converse with family or friends, so you can reestablish contact if a friend of yours relocates to a different state; then, you can effortlessly reconnect directly via the computer. ""@CAPS2 is excellent for sending emails or pictures to friends, but if you do @CAPS2 from the computer, then @CAPS2 is accomplished much more rapidly!"" @CAPS3 @PERSON1, one of my neighbors. My subsequent reason is that you can research anything you desire, such as people, places, or things, and all relevant references will surface. @CAPS2 is ideal for researching any projects or school assignments you @MONTH1 have. I remember @CAPS4 when my brother was working on his project. Everything he encountered difficulty with, he discovered directly on the computer! My final reason is that there are numerous enjoyable and thrilling websites where you can relax and play! These websites can keep you occupied, and you won't be bored while playing! ""@CAPS4 when I'm bored, I access the computer and play games that I find on @CAPS5.com,"" @CAPS3 my younger cousin, @PERSON2. Computers @MONTH1 can cause people to become addicted to them. Yes, but you will learn some fascinating facts about how the internet operates. An increasing number of people use computers, yet not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I firmly believe that they do benefit society. Here's why: you can connect with people, conduct research, and play enjoyable games! @CAPS2's now or never to determine what you think! Contact me, and we'll discuss this thoroughly."
27	27	1	1	Computers are advantageous as they allow you to obtain information, play games, and acquire pictures. However, when you are using the computer, you may encounter something or someone that is malicious or infected with a virus. If there is a virus, you might want to shut down the computers to prevent the situation from deteriorating. There are websites tailored for kids, such as those offering games; there are also games for teenagers and adults. Additionally, certain pictures can be inappropriate for children as they often lead to unsuitable images. You should only search for information that you need, rather than items like weapons or knives. Moreover, there are different types of companies, such as @CAPS1&t and @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is a good place to purchase computers, and @CAPS1&t is also a viable option.
28	28	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, Computers are highly technological and have become an integral part of daily life. They play a significant role in society. Computers have been enhanced to perform a multitude of diverse tasks; without them, we would scarcely be able to accomplish anything. Although children should commence spending more time outdoors, computers educate children on novel concepts and are highly useful. With the prevalence of computers, children rarely venture outside. A substantial portion of the population in @LOCATION1 is obese, including children. As a result, they remain indoors and are glued to their computers. Children need to go outside periodically to breathe fresh air and engage in physical activity. If they limit their computer usage and participate in active games, it would be more beneficial for the child. Since computers are rapidly evolving and adapting, children spend half of their day simply staring at the screen, playing flash games like RuneScape. Instead of squandering their time on such activities, they should go outside, take a stroll, or engage in some form of physical activity! Computers impart new knowledge to children. If you search for something like ""trees"" on Google, you will obtain a plethora of websites containing information about trees. Children also play games, and unbeknownst to them, some of the games they play are educational. For instance, my younger sister visits a website called Nickelodeon.com, and I observe that it teaches her things she was previously unaware of. These types of games have prepared her for kindergarten. Nowadays, an increasing number of websites are emerging and gaining popularity, such as Bing. Computers are truly useful. Suppose you wish to know what is happening at work. Simply click your mouse on Internet Explorer and access your email. With computers, you can visit social networking sites like Facebook to connect with friends. You can also use instant messaging sites to communicate with friends and discover what they are up to. For entertainment purposes, you can play games. However, remember not to spend excessive time on the computer. Computers are of great significance in our community. Life would be extremely challenging without them. But remember to limit your computer usage! Although children should start going outside more often, computers educate children on new things and are highly useful."
29	29	1	1	Dear local newspaper, A significant number of people across the globe utilize or own computers. Although there are many individuals who believe that computers are beneficial, others may hold a different view. While using the computer, you can enhance your social skills by interacting with friends or family. Additionally, while on the computer, you may not notice it, but your hand - eye coordination is improving. Finally, you can conduct a search with a single click of a button, rather than sifting through dozens of books to find information on your topic. Computers offer numerous benefits. One of these is the ability to chat or communicate online with friends and family. You may have a distant friend whom you haven't spoken to in a while. With a computer, you can reestablish contact with your acquaintance. If you have a secure account for chatting, you may be able to make new friends, which is beneficial for your social life. It is always advantageous to have friends and maintain contact with family. Some individuals find it challenging to play the piano as they struggle to read the music while using their hands. On a computer, your hand - eye coordination improves over time as you search for a topic while typing. Moreover, this is an excellent memory exercise for your fingers as you eventually memorize the location of all the keys. People without computers have to search through numerous books to find information on their topic. In contrast, those with computers simply need to type in their topic, and all the necessary information is presented before them. You can even view pictures or videos related to your topic! Not many books that I am aware of can search for a topic, display pictures, and present videos using a single resource! Many people debate whether computers are beneficial or not. In my opinion, computers are highly advantageous for people. They enable individuals to be social and communicate with old friends. They also enhance hand - eye coordination. Finally, they offer the option to search for a topic without the hassle of searching through numerous books. So, the question now lies with you: Are computers beneficial for people or not?
30	30	1	1	Dear Newspaper People, I am of the opinion that computers contribute significantly to society for several reasons. Computers streamline work processes as they can perform tasks that humans are either unable to do or find arduous, such as solving complex problems. Moreover, children enjoy playing games on them. Computers render work more efficient and presentable. Typing is often swifter than writing and is always easier to read. Studies have indicated that individuals who use computers for work complete their tasks more rapidly and have up to @PERCENT1 more free time to engage in activities of their choice. Computers are also equipped with email, which allows you to send your completed work to your boss without the need for printing and wasting paper. Computers can solve intricate problems that people either cannot handle or do not wish to spend time on. If you need to solve a math problem, you can use a calculator or a computer, sparing you the effort of working it out independently. I have to solve numerous math problems for homework, and I find it far more convenient to use a calculator. My final reason for advocating the benefits of computers is that children enjoy playing games on them. Many people claim that children should not play computer games, but some of these games are educational. Even non - educational games allow children to have fun and give them something to anticipate after completing their work. @PERCENT2 of children state that they are happier when they have something enjoyable to look forward to, and happier children tend to perform better in their studies. I hope that after reading this, you will recognize the substantial contributions that computers make to society.
31	31	1	1	"I concur that computers undoubtedly confer an advantage upon our society. I hold this view because they facilitate our communication and video conferencing with family and friends online, serve as an excellent tool for schoolwork or professional endeavors. Above all, they offer enjoyment to children, and contemporary computer games assist them in preparing for real - life consequences. For instance, the game Webkinz instructs kids on pet care. ""@CAPS1, do you possess a @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 @CAPS4, my @CAPS5. ""@CAPS6, kindly send me a friend request,"" I retorted. Later that evening, I returned home and checked my @CAPS2. A new notification appeared, and I am now friends with my @CAPS5 @CAPS4. My entire family is on @CAPS2, and I deem it highly useful for several reasons, such as planning events and parties. I loathe writing invitations, yet now, for my birthday party each year, I simply type them up, which takes less than five minutes. Alternatively, for an even more straightforward method of sending invitations, you can even just compose an email or a @CAPS2 message. In fact, I was invited to a party yesterday via @CAPS2. It is so effortless; you merely create an event and tag all your friends in the note. Additionally, it is extremely easy to receive @CAPS13's as you are automatically notified. Technology of this kind significantly simplifies life. For example, have you ever acquired something new and been eager to show it to your friends? Well, now you can, from the comfort of your own home. All you require is a webcam, and you can instantly connect with a friend who also has one. ""@CAPS14, @PERSON1! I adore what you've done to your room; the pink wallpaper is so charming!"" I remarked. ""@CAPS15 to you! I love your hair today. It's so lovely,"" says @PERSON1. I relish webcamming with my friends because you can see and hear them as if they were right beside you. As you can observe, webcamming is far more convenient than expending more time, money, and my mother's time to get a ride to her house. Computers render life much more convenient. Another example of how this is so much easier is that computers now aid you with schoolwork. Have you ever had to write a report? Well, nowadays, teachers particularly appreciate reports typed because many students have illegible handwriting, and most kids dislike writing anyway. Like me, I type faster than I write, which is why I concur @PERCENT1 that computers are beneficial to society. Most importantly, computers can assist you in finding a good job online and even help you craft an outstanding resume. How remarkable would that be? If I were applying for a professional position, I know I'd type my resume. In conclusion, that's how computers are so helpful, advantageous, important, and enjoyable to our society."
32	32	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, and I am a @ORGANIZATION1 citizen. I firmly believe that computers do not benefit society at all. In my opinion, they deteriorate the quality of life in our town. People allocate an excessive amount of time to their computers, thereby reducing the time spent on physical exercise, appreciating nature, and interacting with family and friends. All these adverse impacts are what computers are inflicting on our society, and it is high time to put an end to this trend! Firstly, people are overly engrossed in computer usage. Teens frequent social networking sites, adults engage in chatrooms, and children play computer games. Instead, they should be engaging in outdoor activities, such as playing in the park or going for a stroll. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of adults are overweight? If people curtail their indoor computer time, we could potentially lower this figure significantly. Moreover, one can never be certain what teens are doing on the computer. While computers have their merits, they can also be detrimental. For example, in chatrooms, one has no idea what kind of individuals are present. Children must exercise caution regarding what they say or display on the internet. Instead of playing games or chatting with their romantic partners, teens should venture outside and engage in physical activity. Secondly, more citizens need to savor the beauty of nature and the surrounding scenery. We are all so preoccupied with checking our emails that we fail to notice what a glorious day it is outside. On a pleasant @DATE1 or @DATE2 day, people should take their children to a local park or pond. This reminds me of last @DATE2 when I visited my cousin's house. My aunt only permitted us to use electronic devices, including the computer, for one hour a day. We were outdoors every day, even if we were simply gazing at the clouds. This kept us active and allowed us to appreciate the environment. My final reason for believing that computers are negatively affecting society is that they detract from the time spent interacting with family and friends. I understand what you're thinking: when you're on the computer, you're communicating with loved ones, but it's not the same. Instead of instant - messaging, make a phone call. Perhaps even invite them out for a face - to - face conversation. This reminds me of my sister. When I get home, she is usually on @CAPS2. Now, instead of getting up to talk to me, she'll text me ""@CAPS3's up?"" or ""@CAPS4 was your day?"" Computers facilitate communication, but they also undermine in - person interaction. As you can see, I have presented three compelling reasons why I firmly believe that computers are having a negative impact on @ORGANIZATION1, and indeed, everywhere. You need to open your eyes and recognize that people spend far too much time on computers, which prevents them from enjoying nature and interacting with their families. I earnestly implore you to understand that our society will decline if we do not address this issue. So, what are you going to do about it?"
33	33	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am of the opinion that the influence of computers on people is decidedly positive. Computers can be employed for a wide array of purposes. For example, they enable us to explore historical knowledge, learn about individuals who have changed the world, and access other valuable information. They empower children to acquire knowledge. There are numerous websites that offer online tutoring or effective methods to help students succeed in school. Another positive aspect is online dating platforms. These platforms allow people to meet new individuals, thereby enhancing the quality of life. Popular sites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and others provide an excellent means to maintain contact with old friends or make new ones. However, in my view, the most advantageous application of computers is online education. For instance, after completing college and becoming a nurse, one can pursue a higher degree, such as becoming a registered nurse instead of remaining a @ORGANIZATION2. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people.
34	34	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, there is a rumor circulating that computers have a negative impact on a child's life. I vehemently disagree. A computer can benefit a child in numerous ways. It can assist students with their homework, enable them to communicate with friends, and support them in completing school projects. Moreover, most children do not spend an excessive amount of time on the computer. Homework plays a crucial role in school. Failing to complete it or not understanding it can have a detrimental effect on a student's academic performance. That is why there are websites on computers that help children learn how to solve problems or answer social studies questions when they are unsure. If you visit the school website, there is a link to math games and even a link to a science website. This helps children avoid becoming overly stressed about their homework. A computer also facilitates students' interaction with friends. A social life is of great importance to a @NUM1 grader. Here, platforms like AIM, Facebook, and MySpace on the computer help children connect with their friends. If a child has an argument at school, they can come home and resolve the issue rather than leaving it unresolved. A computer also allows children to make new friends from other towns. Teens need to expand their social circle and make new friends, which is beneficial for their personal growth. If a teen encounters difficulties with a task, they can seek help from others. Every student is assigned a take - home project at some point. Instead of rushing to the store to buy paper and pencils, one can stay at home, save money, and type the essay. Computers can also be useful for social studies or science projects. You can print pictures and gather information. Drawing can be cumbersome and messy, so using a computer saves time and avoids the mess. If there are words you do not understand, you can look them up. Computers are the most effective way to complete a project. Everyone uses computers, and they are as helpful to our parents as they are to us. They assist us with homework, allow us to communicate with friends, and even help us with our projects! Computers are one of the best technological advancements we have @DATE1.
35	35	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am convinced that computers exert a positive influence on people. One must wonder where we would be without them. Computers cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow people with the ability to explore any subject of interest, and enable individuals to communicate regardless of the distance between them. Evidently, computers are highly beneficial. I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. As previously mentioned, they enhance hand - eye coordination. I am aware that some people claim that excessive computer use reduces exercise time. However, computers can improve throwing skills. Hand - eye coordination is also essential for those aspiring to become surgeons or doctors. One needs to have steady hands and be prepared to perform any necessary tasks. Clearly, computers have a positive effect in this regard. I am of the opinion that computers have a positive impact on people. They empower people to learn about any topic they desire on the internet. Suppose you aspire to become an engineer in the future. You would want to acquire comprehensive knowledge to ensure success in your career. Similarly, if you aim to be a doctor, you would need to know how many years of college and medical school are required to obtain a medical degree. A computer can assist you in learning about these matters and much more. How could they not be considered positive? I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Another significant advantage is that they enable communication with others regardless of the geographical distance. While traditional mail can eventually reach its destination, @CAPS3 - mail is free and arrives within minutes, whereas mail can take weeks to reach a distant location. For example, if you come from another country, you would not want to lose touch with your childhood friends. With a computer, you can use Skype to see how they have changed. Talking on the phone or sending mail cannot compare to this experience. You will never lose touch! Computers enable people to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. They develop hand - eye coordination, provide the opportunity to learn about any subject, and facilitate communication across distances. There are no negative factors that can outweigh these benefits. They are eminently reasonable. So, what is your opinion? Do you think computers are beneficial to us, or do we need to reduce our computer usage?
36	36	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever contemplated the impact computers exert on individuals? It is an exceedingly adverse impact. Computers stand among the primary factors contributing to children's lack of physical activity and subsequent obesity. They can also detrimentally affect students' academic performance, and excessive engagement with the @CAPS6 isolates one from their cherished ones.  Firstly, an increasing number of children are utilizing computers far more frequently than is advisable. What, you may inquire, are the consequences? Given that computers are employed daily, particularly by young adolescents, it is highly probable for a child to become obese. Research from esteemed institutions such as @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION2 has revealed that @PERCENT1 of children who spend over two hours on the @CAPS6 are either obese or will become overweight in the future. After conversing with @PERSON1, a graduate from @LOCATION1, he informed me that when children devote more time to the @CAPS6, they merely stare at a luminous screen that can damage their eyesight, rather than spending time outdoors relishing the pleasant weather. Consequently, children accumulate body fat from sitting on a couch, fixated on the @CAPS6 all day, instead of engaging in physical exercise.  My second rationale for computers' negative influence on children is that they can undermine academic performance. After speaking with a current student at @ORGANIZATION1, she disclosed that the reason for her declining grades is her excessive preoccupation with @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc. She fails to focus on her @ORGANIZATION1 coursework as she ought to, and as a result, her grades have plummeted from @NUM1's to low @NUM2's. This indicates that even high - achieving students are experiencing academic setbacks due to excessive @CAPS6 usage. Moreover, excessive time spent on the @CAPS6, coupled with a lack of attention to @ORGANIZATION1 work, can impede performance on @ORGANIZATION3's assessments. This demonstrates that consistent @CAPS6 use undermines academic proficiency.  My final reason for computers' negative impact on children is that they impair social skills, preventing one from being an outgoing and communicative individual. Every time you log into that perilous device, your self - esteem diminishes as you rarely interact with friends or make phone calls. You simply sit on a rigid chair, gazing at an electronic device that offers no prospects for personal growth. Additionally, excessive @CAPS6 use drives your loved ones away. If you persist in this behavior, you will end up neglecting to spend time with them and never call your friends to check on their well - being. Furthermore, if your parents request you to disengage from the @CAPS6, you may become irritable and discourteous towards your family merely because you desire to return to your favored electronic device. Is this truly how you wish to treat your family?  In conclusion, computers have a detrimental effect on numerous young individuals. The reasons include reduced time for physical activity, impaired academic performance, and diminished social interaction due to excessive @CAPS6 use. The fundamental question, however, remains: do you believe computers have a negative or positive impact on people?
37	37	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have become aware that some individuals perceive computers as detrimental to us. Some contend that they serve as distractions to our physical and mental well - being. While I can understand this perspective, I firmly believe that computers offer substantial benefits to society as a whole.  I hold this view because computers facilitate learning, enable individuals to maintain contact with distant friends and family, and assist in maintaining organization. At times, individuals engage with the computer for learning purposes without even realizing it. Simply by visiting the @ORGANIZATION2 homepage, one can automatically access news feeds about global events. On other occasions, people deliberately go online to acquire knowledge. For instance, if someone is considering a visit to @LOCATION1, they are likely to search the internet for relevant information. A simple search for ""Ecuador"" will yield a plethora of results, including climate data, seasonal weather patterns, hotel options, and other details.  Moreover, computers are not solely a source of information for students. Many college students now have the option of taking courses online. This is because some students prefer the tranquility of their own homes to the distractions of a traditional classroom setting. Friends can indeed be a significant distraction in class, but how can one stay connected with friends who have moved away? I recall in second grade when my best friend, @LOCATION2, relocated. I was heartbroken and rarely had the opportunity to communicate with her. However, one day, our parents arranged a video chat, and it felt as though we were together. This experience made me realize how many people could utilize this technology to stay in touch with relatives and friends. Another effective means of communication is through email. Sending a message is a convenient way to maintain contact, and personal preferences can be easily shared. Emails can be sent worldwide with ease, and many individuals enjoy typing on a keyboard.  However, the abundance of typed documents can lead to disorganization. I, personally, detest clutter and have numerous school binders where papers can easily be misplaced. This is why I make the most of typing my papers whenever possible. My computer helps me stay organized as I am less likely to lose my work. Saving files is a foolproof method of ensuring their safety, and obtaining a hard copy is as simple as pressing the print button. I am certain that many others appreciate the organizational benefits of computers as well. Additionally, I am a faster typist than a writer, which results in neater work on the computer.  In summary, there are numerous reasons why computer usage is beneficial to society. They enable learning, facilitate communication with friends and family, and assist in maintaining organization. Many people would concur with this view. Don't you?"
38	38	1	1	"Dear local Newspaper, In contemporary society, an increasing number of individuals, including myself, are incorporating computers into their daily lives. In my opinion, the computer ranks among the most remarkable inventions of all time. Regrettably, certain so - called ""experts"" fail to recognize the advantages of computers and perceive excessive computer use as detrimental.  Computers offer students access to a vast array of information. This proves invaluable for children working on school projects. They can also utilize the information available on the computer for studying when textbooks prove inadequate. Additionally, students seeking local employment can search online for job openings.  Computers also serve as powerful communication tools. If you have a long - lost relative, you can easily locate them on the internet. Online communication is also beneficial for students who need to discuss homework with classmates or seek assistance. Although I am not particularly fond of this aspect, online chatting can even be used for online dating for those who are disinclined to venture out.  One of the most useful features of a computer is its navigation function. Suppose you forget the location of a relative's house. You can simply enter your address and theirs to obtain detailed directions. This method can be applied to virtually any destination.  If these reasons fail to convince you that the computer is an outstanding technological innovation, then you may be overlooking its potential. The computer is akin to a magical box with limitless applications. I strongly recommend that you acquire one."
39	39	1	1	Dear local Newspaper, A growing number of people use computers on a daily basis, yet not everyone concurs that computers benefit society. Proponents of technological advancement believe that computers have a positive influence on individuals. While I acknowledge this perspective under certain circumstances, upon careful consideration, I disagree. It is advisable to limit excessive computer use, primarily because it is far more beneficial to engage in physical exercise, appreciate nature, and interact with family.  Firstly, physical exercise is of utmost importance. Taking a stroll around the neighborhood or going on a hike with acquaintances can significantly enhance one's well - being. Even better, visiting the gym is an excellent way to spend an evening, as opposed to sitting in front of a computer screen all day. Exercise not only helps maintain physical fitness but also promotes long - term health and strength. In contrast, excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to weight gain and lethargy.  Secondly, one should embrace the beauty of nature. God's creations are the most magnificent aspects of our world, and we should not squander the opportunity to experience them. Activities such as jumping off a waterfall or visiting the park allow us to feel the wind on our faces and bring our imaginations to life.  Finally, social interaction with family and friends is crucial. Spending quality time with loved ones, whether it's watching movies, attending sports events, or going out for ice cream, strengthens relationships. The mall, water parks like Six Flags, or family - friendly venues such as Nomads or Chuck E. Cheese's offer excellent opportunities for interaction and bonding.  In conclusion, spending excessive time in front of a computer screen is a waste of time. Instead, one should engage in physical exercise, appreciate nature, and interact with family and friends. Technology can impede our ability to experience the real world. Thank you for considering my perspective. Have a good day!
40	40	1	1	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and attend Naylor School. I am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive impact on people. Please consider the following reasons.  Computers facilitate global communication. When my brother uses the computer, he can converse with our family in @LOCATION1. I prefer using Skype because it allows us to use a webcam to stay connected with our family in @CAPS1.R.  Moreover, computers enhance hand - eye coordination. They have assisted me in improving my ping - pong skills by training me to track the ball, a skill I can then apply in real - life situations.  Computers also provide extensive access to information. My mother found a job through online searches. Everyone can access weather forecasts and news updates.  Admittedly, some argue that computers lead to a lack of exercise, addiction, obesity, and can even disrupt personal relationships. However, despite these potential drawbacks, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to society.  In conclusion, these are the reasons why I advocate for the positive influence of computers. I hope that people will recognize the advantages of technological advancement, which continues to evolve and improve.
41	41	1	1	I believe computers offer significant advantages as they enable communication with friends and family. Moreover, individuals require computers for job - hunting. However, some individuals allocate an excessive amount of time to computers rather than to their homework, and this behavior must cease.
42	42	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: Computers exert a negative influence on people's ability to connect with others as they are often engrossed in the computer and rarely venture outdoors. Firstly, prolonged use of computers can damage eyesight. People I know have reported eye discomfort after using the computer. Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of long - term computer users are more likely to lose their eyesight compared to those who are outdoors throughout the day. Secondly, individuals who spend all day on electronic devices indoors are less likely to develop good interpersonal skills. Without such skills, one may have few friends, and communication with them is likely to be over the computer, where one can never truly know the other person. Additionally, staying indoors all day means not getting proper exercise, which can be detrimental to oneself and others. Thirdly, people may be ridiculed if they stay indoors on the computer all day. Computer - obsessed individuals are more likely to fail at school as they neglect homework and projects in favor of playing games. They are also more likely to have conflicts with parents or guardians as the latter rarely see or hear from them, and they may even be unable to pay bills online, which can have negative consequences for everyone. These are some reasons why I believe computers can be harmful. Thank you.
43	43	1	1	The impact of people using computers is not negative as one can acquire extensive knowledge from it. In fact, typing on the computer can exercise the fingers. Through typing, fingers gain muscle strength and one learns to type without looking at the keyboard. Using a computer can be beneficial in certain situations. For instance, when writing letters, one can simply type and print instead of using a pencil. Typing streamlines the process, saving hours of writing time. Computers are highly useful tools. For example, when researching about @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1, one can obtain almost all the necessary information with a single click. Computers save time and perform a great deal of work. They are indeed a helpful and excellent piece of technology.
44	44	1	1	Individuals are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. Those who do so have limited time to interact with family and friends. Children who spend time on the computer often receive poor grades and tire easily. Firstly, a large proportion of people are overly engrossed in computer use. @PERCENT1 of kids spend @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the computer. I once spent @NUM3 hours on my computer on @CAPS1. Many kids frequent @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and iTunes. My friend spent @NUM4 hours on these websites. People spend far too long on the computer. Secondly, children who use the computer extensively tend to get bad grades. @PERCENT2 of such kids forget to study for tests. I once stayed up all night on the computer and failed a test the next day. Kids also forget to do their homework. My friend was so absorbed in the computer that he forgot about his homework. Children should disengage from the computer and focus on school. Finally, kids become exhausted from long - term computer use. @PERCENT3 of kids are so tired that they are incapacitated after getting off the computer. I was so tired after a long session on the computer that I took a nap. @PERCENT4 of kids forget their after - school plans. One kid was so tired that he cancelled his plans with friends. In conclusion, kids and people in general spend too much time on computers, resulting in poor grades and fatigue. Action needs to be taken to address this issue.
45	45	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, do you really think computers are of no help in research? In fact, computers are quite useful. One does not necessarily gain weight by simply using a computer. Moreover, one can still communicate with children, friends, and family members via the computer. @CAPS1, can you be certain that books contain all the information you need for a school project or your family history? While books may document the history of wars and heroes, try to find the first ancestor of your family in books. Computers are the means by which we learn about our history, actors, slaves, sergeants, and more. Have you gained weight from excessive computer use? I haven't gained a single pound or ounce since I started using the computer. One's weight is not solely determined by computer use. How can you know if the person on the computer is not looking for diet foods or fat - free items, or if they are eating while using the computer? @CAPS1, do you get exorbitant phone bills for a two - minute long - distance call? Why do you think we have internet websites like MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, MSN, and many others? Most of my family members live in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and @LOCATION2, and a one - minute call costs about ten dollars. In contrast, you can use the internet from day to night at the same cost. So, @CAPS1, do you choose to pay over thirty dollars for a long - distance call or stay on the computer? Or do you want to get bad grades due to poor research? It's your choice. Decide whether to talk to family and friends on the phone and overspend on your bill or stay on web chat for as long as you like at the same cost.
46	46	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am here to convey that the time we invest in using computers is indispensable as it facilitates access to information, promotes intellectual growth, and enhances hand - eye coordination. I shall now elucidate the necessity of our computer usage by presenting three compelling reasons. Firstly, the time we spend on computers is crucial as it equips us with a wealth of information. It imparts knowledge about diverse places, people, cultures, and more. Acquiring such useful information requires time, thus justifying our computer usage for learning novel facts. Secondly, computers contribute to our cognitive development. For instance, if one encounters difficulties with fractions, a math website can offer assistance. Computers have the potential to augment our intelligence. Ultimately, it is about intellectual prowess rather than the amount of physical exercise. Thirdly, using computers fosters good hand - eye coordination. It aids in typing, enabling us to write essays more rapidly. With enhanced hand - eye coordination, typing errors are significantly reduced. In conclusion, a substantial amount of computer time is necessary due to its benefits in information acquisition, intellectual enhancement, and hand - eye coordination development. Perhaps, even more computer time could be advantageous as it not only enriches individuals but also benefits society.
47	47	1	1	Dear newspaper, I believe that the internet and computers serve as assets to society rather than liabilities. They are instrumental in academic pursuits, such as completing projects or sending emails. Nowadays, one can even pursue a college degree online! People also utilize the internet for entertainment and to maintain social connections. One of the primary justifications for computer ownership is its educational utility. For example, when working on a project, one can gather notes, or create a PowerPoint presentation. Additionally, computers are beneficial for educators. They enable teachers to deliver lessons in an engaging and comprehensible manner. The increasing prevalence of computer usage has revolutionized the way people obtain college degrees. Now, one can simply recline in bed, turn on a laptop, and attend college classes. I, for one, would prefer to study from the comfort of my home rather than commute to a campus regularly. Another significant advantage of the internet is email, which has streamlined our lives as more people adopt it. It can convey school announcements, such as early dismissals, and facilitate communication with old high - school friends. Moreover, the internet offers entertainment and relaxation. Approximately @PERCENT1 of computer users employ them for media consumption or leisure activities, such as gaming or watching YouTube. I kindly request that you publish this article in your newspaper to showcase the computer as a helpful tool, rather than a device that will lead to global obesity. Obesity is a result of individual lifestyle choices, not the computer itself. Therefore, let us not portray computers in a negative light.
48	48	1	1	"Have you ever experienced time passing in a flash while using the computer? You log on at @TIME1 pm, and suddenly, it's seven o'clock at night. Individuals should curtail their computer usage as they ought to be outdoors, spending quality time with family, and exploring alternative sources of information. One should be outside, relishing the fresh air and participating in sports, instead of being confined indoors with eyes fixed on a screen. Spending an entire day on the computer involves sedentary behavior, with no physical activity. Seventy - two percent of children who devote excessive time to computers are overweight. Using a computer on a beautiful day is akin to ignoring the melodious chirping of birds on the first day of @DATE1. Nature is captivating, and one should be outside appreciating it, rather than being trapped in a stuffy room hunched over a man - made device. Computer usage causes time to slip away unnoticed. One can lose an entire day to it. Wouldn't it be more enjoyable to engage in other activities? Being on the computer allows one to be isolated in a dark room. In contrast, one should be in the company of family and friends. Computers will remain a part of our lives for a long time, and their decline will only occur when a superior technology emerges. Your baby brother will grow up, and your grandparents may not be around tomorrow. Don't you wish to spend as much time as possible with them? You are also evolving, and you may soon leave for college or relocate for business. As my grandma once told my mom, ""They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye."" Nearly @PERCENT1 of parents share this sentiment. Therefore, do not squander all your time with a machine; cherish every moment with your beloved family. Additionally, there are alternative ways to access information and learn about new places. The world is replete with books on every imaginable topic. Using books to research information is preferable to relying solely on Google, as it is essential to learn how to use an index and locate books on library shelves. A visit to the library may not be everyone's preference, but if one wishes to learn about a place, why not visit it? If you are writing a report on @LOCATION2, a few - day trip to that location would be both enjoyable and educational. You can capture your own photos, rather than relying on online images. Even if the topic is as mundane as @LOCATION1, a family trip can still be a memorable experience. In conclusion, people should reduce their computer usage and allocate more time to outdoor activities, spending time with family, and exploring new places. Why waste the day staring at a screen when there is so much fun to be had?"
49	49	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to illustrate the impact of computers on individuals. Computers have a profound and positive influence, imparting a multitude of skills through a single technological innovation. They affect numerous people through their diverse functions. Computers offer numerous advantages that individuals can quickly grasp. They are widely adored and are regarded as one of the most remarkable inventions globally. Computers instill positive values and knowledge in people. They have a beneficial impact on individuals worldwide, teaching both new and pre - existing knowledge. For example, they enhance hand - eye coordination. When typing, one learns to perceive better visually. Moreover, computers enable people to gain insights, understand different cultures, and access information about individuals across the globe. Celebrities are highly popular on computers and other technological platforms. Computers are more effective in facilitating learning compared to other technologies. Whatever information can be obtained from other technologies is guaranteed to be available on a computer. While computers share similarities with other technologies, they outperform them in certain aspects. Computers are indispensable in life as they enable communication. In the absence of phones, one can communicate via email on the computer. It allows individuals to reconnect with long - lost friends and access images and videos from the past. Additionally, computers provide up - to - date news information. In conclusion, one must ponder the world without computers. Many technologies that are less effective than computers would not have gained popularity without the foundation set by computers. I am curious to envision such a world.
50	50	1	1	Computers are the most remarkable tools humanity has ever developed. They provide individuals with access to an unparalleled amount of information. With a single click, they enable us to connect with distant locations. Without computers, people would be severely limited in their knowledge, learning, and achievements. Modern planes and cars would not exist, and this very text would likely not have been created. Therefore, it is impossible to claim that too much time is spent on computers, as there is an abundance of knowledge and experiences waiting to be explored in a lifetime.
51	51	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever found yourself in need of directions without a map or a GPS device nearby, with only a computer at hand? Well, I suggest you utilize it to search for your desired destination. Computers are highly beneficial in everyone's daily lives, as they contain an abundance of facts and fascinating information. For instance, when trying to determine someone's residence, it's remarkably simple. Just access Google and enter the individual's address, and you'll have the answer.  Computers are also excellent for communication. Have you ever thought about a friend or a special person whom you haven't seen in a long time and missed them? No problem. Most computers are equipped with some form of camera, enabling you to engage in video chats or regular online conversations. This is extremely useful because, although you could simply make a phone call, it's preferable to communicate online. If you haven't seen the person and wish to see their picture, they can easily send it to you via a chat platform or your email. It's far superior to mailing a single picture, which can take days to arrive, when you can achieve the same result more swiftly through online means and video chats.  Moreover, computers are helpful for checking the weather. Suppose you plan to go somewhere but are unsure about the weather conditions. You could turn on the TV to find out, but there are numerous channels, and the weather updates often change rapidly, making it difficult to follow. On a computer, you can search for the weather forecast for an entire week. The information will remain on the screen, allowing you to view it at your leisure and see the entire week's forecast without the hassle of fast - changing images or issues related to lighting.  Computers are indeed incredibly useful. Some people advocate taking breaks from computers and spending time outdoors in nature, and I concur with this view. However, people and children can also get exercise by walking around the house, going outside, or going shopping. Computers are not only helpful but also convenient. For example, if you're browsing online and see clothes or shoes you want to purchase but don't want to travel to a mall half an hour away from your home, you can simply make the purchase online, and the items will be delivered to your doorstep without you having to lift a finger.  Additionally, computers have built - in dictionaries. If you're unsure how to spell a word, you can type it in as best you can, and the computer will correct your spelling and provide the definition. Computers also offer images of virtually everything. If you want to see what something looks like, you can enter the query, and it will display relevant pictures. Based on all the facts I've presented, I hope you'll agree with me that computers are highly beneficial, pleasant, and safe.
52	52	1	1	Dear Esteemed Members of Society, I am penning this letter to elucidate the numerous advantages of computers. My first rationale aims to expound on the various ways in which computers assist individuals. I firmly believe that the utilization of computers is an excellent concept. Proponents of this view assert that computers enhance concentration and attentiveness. This, in turn, contributes to improved eyesight and remarkable hand - eye coordination.  An important attribute of computers is their ability to educate users about distant locations, depending on their place of residence. The likely reason individuals would want to explore such places via a website is for vacation purposes.  My third reason for advocating the continued use of computers is the plethora of online platforms available for social interaction. As long as your friends are online, you can communicate with them through platforms such as IM, Skype, and Facebook, among others. These are all outstanding applications of computers.  Furthermore, individuals with well - established email systems on their computers can receive notifications regarding business opportunities, such as the sale of machinery or any matter related to business ethics.  Now that you are aware of my three crucial reasons – the development of hand - eye coordination, the acquisition of knowledge about other states, and the facilitation of communication with friends and business correspondence – I hope you have enjoyed reading this letter and will support my stance on this topic.
53	53	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Initially, I recognize that some individuals oppose the use of computers due to their perceived overuse. If computers were truly detrimental, they should not be employed at all. However, in my perspective, the benefits they offer far outweigh the drawbacks. The positive aspects of computer usage include access to resources, enhanced interpersonal interaction, and the potential for future advancements.  Despite the belief that computers are overused, those who hold this view still rely on them. Even I use the computer extensively, but I believe it can be harnessed for positive purposes. Firstly, computers provide access to online resources that are not available in traditional books. Search engines enable users to find information on various topics. Once a source is located, it often contains details that may have been overlooked in printed materials. It can present the other side of a story that was not covered in books. Projects that previously required a visit to the library can now be completed from the comfort of home, a significant development that is often overlooked. For instance, approximately @PERCENT1 of the time people spend on the computer is dedicated to research.  Secondly, computers facilitate interaction between friends. People can engage in conversations, exchange pictures, or play games. For example, I frequently play Xbox and communicate with my friends through it. Even a video game can provide an experience as enjoyable as being in the physical presence of friends. As @CAPS1 @CAPS2 stated, ""I have a computer not for friends, but for work."" This indicates that even prominent figures rely on computers for professional tasks. Some people compare using a computer to learning to ride a bike. My mother once shared a story about how she met my father because he fixed her computer at work. Thus, I owe my existence to a computer.  Moreover, computers are still in their infancy and will continue to evolve. Those who use computers have valid reasons for doing so. The continuous advancement of technology means that it will be impossible to halt the growth of computer usage. Attempts to discourage computer use with the claim that ""computers eat your brain"" are baseless.  In conclusion, I urge you not to attempt to change others' habits. I firmly believe that individuals should have the freedom to use computers if they so desire, considering the wealth of resources, the opportunities for social interaction, and the potential for future progress."
54	54	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Greetings! I am a student in the @NUM1 grade at @PERSON1. While perusing your newspaper, I came across an article stating that people are spending excessive time on computers and not enough time outdoors, exercising, or enjoying nature, and that this is detrimental to society. I wholeheartedly disagree with these assertions and would like to provide some counter - arguments.  Computers offer significant benefits to students. There are times when students forget their textbooks at school. In such situations, a computer can be a lifesaver. They can simply search for the necessary information online to complete their homework and avoid receiving a failing grade. Additionally, there is a website called Study Island, which offers online courses in math, reading, and science for students in the @LOCATION1 area. Although these courses are time - consuming, they account for a substantial portion of our grades. Therefore, achieving an @CAPS2 on Study Island can result in an @CAPS2 in one of our classes.  Computers also have a personal significance for me. I have a passion for the piano, but there are no piano instructors in my vicinity. However, there is a computer program called Synesthesia that helps users learn various songs on a keyboard or piano. Playing the piano enhances hand - eye coordination and instills discipline and dedication. Synesthesia is not the only free instrument - learning program available; there are numerous others. These programs are beneficial for individuals who cannot afford music lessons, and learning an instrument can have long - term benefits.  Regarding the claim in your article that people are not getting enough exercise due to excessive computer use, this is not entirely accurate. In fact, many people use the computer to research diet plans or local gyms. I know this because one day, when I accessed Google, the top search of the day was ""Weight Watchers diet plan."" My mother also uses an online video workout website to address her back problems. Thus, computers can assist not only with diet planning but also with physical therapy.  In conclusion, I hope this letter helps you recognize that computers are beneficial to our society. While we should not spend an inordinate amount of time on them, online learning sessions can be time - consuming but rewarding. Computers also help many people determine the appropriate diet and exercise routines to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle."
55	55	1	1	Are you skeptical? Computers are truly remarkable, and here are @NUM1 compelling reasons to support this claim. Firstly, computers are invaluable for students' academic pursuits. Kids can complete their homework on computers. This is advantageous because if they forget their textbooks at school, they can easily obtain the necessary answers from the computer. Moreover, computers are essential for business professionals, as they rely on them to store and manage all their important files.  Secondly, computers facilitate seamless communication. Video chatting with friends and family is an excellent feature. If a friend or relative travels out of town, they can simply bring their laptop or use a webcam, allowing you to communicate with them at any time. Video chatting is also beneficial for businesses. If a buyer is located in a different country, companies can use video chat to convey all the necessary information.  Finally, computers are incredibly resourceful. There are hundreds of websites where all you need to do is enter your query, and you'll be presented with thousands of links to explore and find answers. They are also useful for obtaining pictures or creating PowerPoint presentations.  In conclusion, computers are outstanding because they enable students to complete their homework, provide a means for video communication, and offer a vast array of online resources.
56	56	1	1	Over the past decade, the proportion of individuals utilizing computers has risen by approximately @PERCENT1. Suddenly, the world and its inhabitants have become reliant on the information computers offer. The diverse range of databases and resources, the enhanced communication, and the skills computers enable one to demonstrate all attest to their indispensability for this generation. Communication via computers benefits society as people can now interact with one another. Personally, I have been able to converse with and see my overseas family through the advanced technology of computers. Various communication programs include @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and email, the most commonly used platform. Without access to a computer and its contents, residents struggle to integrate into the rest of society, whether for school events, sports schedules, or staying in touch with distant family and friends. Computers render all these essentials part of society and the way this generation has chosen to commence our lives. Parents and teenagers nowadays have become rather indolent compared to their past behavior. They are uninterested in visiting the library to research information on people, places, and family heritage. Computers have been an immense convenience in an individual's life by enabling all the information once found in books to be accessible across the internet. For instance, if you are working on a school project, the internet will provide you with any requisite information. It is truly astonishing how significantly one electronic device can impact and influence a life. As a student, I am frequently curious about the references teachers make and additional information not provided. The internet allows anyone in possession of a computer to research their queries and respond to the subject almost instantaneously. The benefits of computers can virtually outweigh the few negative effects as it is a means for a person to discover diverse information on any desired topic. Besides information searching, computers can be employed to document one's own data. Microsoft has developed several applications that allow you to graph information, design presentations, and neatly record writing drafts. No person is perfect and is prone to mistakes. Microsoft helps conceal your accentuated imperfections by performing tasks as simple as creating a neater copy of your essay or converting your data lists into graph form to make it more visually appealing to viewers. Society has become dependent on sources scattered throughout the databases on computers. By directly considering the negative effects a computer can have on an individual and imposing restrictions on this information source, society can reap the positive contributions that computers currently make to our way of life.
57	57	1	1	In @DATE1, technology has advanced considerably. Computers are among the most futuristic objects. The computer is useful for connecting with people worldwide. Nevertheless, computers have adverse effects on people's lives. Children are diverting time from their homework to use the computer, citizens are gaining weight, and children are being abducted. School is of utmost importance and value if one wishes to succeed in life. However, computers have made it arduous for students to concentrate on their homework. This is a deplorable habit and a detrimental effect on students everywhere. Students' grades will decline, and they will not earn class credits if this issue is not addressed. Obesity is a significant problem in @LOCATION1. Five out of every ten @CAPS1 are either overweight or obese, which can lead to death. The problem lies in the fact that people are spending hours on the computer each day, most of which could be utilized for exercise. Exercise can be a crucial benefit to someone's life. If this problem is not tackled, millions of Americans will be overweight. @CAPS2 is a very serious and perilous topic. Every month, dozens of kids are kidnapped. Since the invention of the internet, there has been a twenty percent increase in the rate of missing children. Children will visit popular networking websites such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and Twitter and disclose their important information. Pedophiles use the internet to deceive children into revealing their addresses. This problem needs to be resolved and addressed by the police. Every day, more and more people use computers. Computers have both positive and negative effects on people's lives. The negative effects are extremely serious and dangerous. How would you feel if your child fails school, gains weight, or gets kidnapped because of the computer?
58	58	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, I am writing to you regarding the debate you are hosting, questioning whether people should use computers. The article stated, ""More and more people use computers, but not everyone concurs that this benefits society."" I believe people should refrain from using computers. Moreover, technology needs to decelerate as it is becoming overly advanced. My first rationale for people to curtail their computer usage is that you wouldn't want to say on your honeymoon, ""We could visit @LOCATION1 from our computer."" Your life will pass by swiftly, and you won't notice it; you'll end up overweight and old. Additionally, @PERCENT1 of computer users are overweight because they do not exercise. Secondly, as technology progresses, we will have less. Furthermore, it is more fulfilling to work rather than simply sit at your computer, receiving a monthly paycheck. In conclusion, you will lead a happier life by exploring the world. @PERCENT2 of computer users commit suicide. If it were up to me, I would restrict the use of computers. Consider all the drawbacks of computers, and you will think like me. I used to be a computer enthusiast."
59	59	1	1	You may find this difficult to believe, but numerous individuals perceive that computers instill a negative attitude in people. Now, you may be asserting that this is untrue, as everyone owns a computer. However, the reality is that not everyone does, and they believe it has a negative impact on people. People have multiple reasons for owning a computer, one of which is maintaining friendships. Did you know that some people own computers to stay in touch with friends from different states who reside far away? For example, many people use @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 to connect with friends. I can relate as I have both a @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 account that I use to keep in contact with family and friends from all over. Some people, like myself, even have friends from different countries! I understand that many people desire to learn about individuals from different countries, and this is one way to achieve it. Currently, I am learning some new things about @LOCATION1 because I am friends with someone who lives in @LOCATION2. During this wonderful learning journey, you may even embark on a vacation adventure. A recent survey indicated that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people enjoy traveling but are unsure where to go. Some individuals claim that people spend excessive time on the computer and insufficient time appreciating nature. These people are mistaken. If one is on the computer chatting with someone from a different state or country, that person might persuade them to visit. For example, they could access the internet, type in the desired destination, and obtain photographs and information about the place. Consequently, people would still get to enjoy nature. Sometimes, using the computer can be educational. Many people may disagree with this statement, but it is true. For instance, many high - school seniors use the computer to take online college courses to earn their degree because attending a regular college may conflict with their work schedule. This can also assist students of any grade in learning more about the topic they are studying and aid them in their reports. For example, they can obtain pictures and other information whenever they wish. As a result, the students' grades will improve. I hope many of you concur with my statement and help spread the word that computers can have a positive impact on the mind. For those who previously disagreed with the statement that computers are positive rather than negative, I hope you will reconsider your opinion.
60	60	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I concur that computers are beneficial to society. Computers have a positive impact on people, such as enhancing hand - eye coordination. They facilitate learning about other countries' religions and other aspects. You can communicate, meet others, and chat via computers. Another positive aspect of computers is that you can rapidly find all the information you need. In other words, computers are of great assistance to many people.
61	61	1	1	"I opine that it is acceptable for individuals to utilize computers as they can acquire new knowledge and encounter novel individuals. I do not deem it a poor notion to use computers, considering that some individuals with occupations work on computers throughout the day. Occasionally, computers can serve as a distraction; however, they can also be of great assistance. I believe that using computers can facilitate learning new things and meeting new people. The rhythmic clatter of people typing on the computer, forging new friendships, and having a pleasant time is palpable. When one discovers something novel, such as the fact that a rat can be as large as a house, excitement ensues, and one feels like the most intelligent person in the world. I do not think it is a bad idea to use computers because some people with jobs are engaged with computers all day. I believe that individuals who use computers throughout their workday need not be sophisticated, popular, or trendy; they are simply working to support themselves and their families. Indeed, sometimes computers can be a distraction, but they can also be extremely helpful. They can aid in learning new things, meeting new friends, and providing an activity during periods of boredom. I recall a time when I was bored and turned to the computer to search for information about @PERSON1. I discovered that she was a renowned singer, someone I had heard of but did not know much about. Chantrail @CAPS1, a @NUM2 - grade student, states, ""Only those who aspire to learn something or meet new friends will use computers. If you wish to learn something new or meet new people, I suggest you put aside those chips, rise from the couch, and use the computer."
62	62	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers exert a positive influence on people. They are beneficial as they enable users to access educational content. One can stay informed about the latest news on various topics and retain personal information. Computers are valuable assets as they facilitate the acquisition of knowledge. If you have a query or are uncertain about the meaning of something, you can find the answer on the internet. There are several reliable internet sources available to address questions. Had we not had computers, when you had a question, you would have to search through books, which is a more labor - intensive process. Another reason why computers are advantageous is that they allow users to catch up on recent events. You can learn about what is happening in other parts of the world, gain insights into celebrities, and check the weather. Although you can find some of this information on television, it is unpredictable when it will be broadcast. With computers, you can search for the latest news and obtain information whenever you desire. Moreover, computers enable you to organize information. You can use @ORGANIZATION1 to neatly store all the information you need. You can also create graphs on the computer. This ensures that your graphs are well - presented and accurate. If there were no computers, your information management would not be as efficient. I firmly believe that computers are a boon as they keep you updated on the latest news and help you maintain your information in an orderly manner. I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on people.
63	63	1	1	Dear newspaper, I contend that computers are beneficial as they provide access to the internet, platforms like MySpace, videos, and can be used for schoolwork such as mathematics and essay writing. Hence, I firmly believe that computers are advantageous as they offer a wide range of capabilities. Computers can significantly assist with schoolwork. You can print various materials, and they can aid in areas such as mathematics, writing, spelling, and most definitely in science and literature. The reason I selected these @NUM1 areas is that you can search for information on the computer and obtain accurate answers for math and spelling. For instance, using @NUM3 can enhance your writing and spelling skills. This is one of the reasons I appreciate computers; I enjoy using @NUM3, and I also like the @NUM3 class. Sometimes, I prefer reading on the computer, although not all the time. I initially learned to read by forcing myself to engage with computer - based reading materials. This is why computers are of great importance to me, as they allow me to look up words.
64	64	1	1	Dear Newspaper, People are allocating an excessive amount of time to using computers, which is inappropriate. They should be engaging in physical exercise and interacting with friends and family. Owning a computer also diverts their attention from schoolwork. Computers typically have such effects on their users. Instead of remaining seated at the computer all @DATE1, people should be outdoors getting exercise. The @LOCATION1 is one of the countries with a high prevalence of overweight individuals. Many teenagers spend the entire @DATE1 indoors at the computer, waiting for their friends' screen names to appear so they can chat. While computers do not need to be completely eliminated, while waiting for friends, they could be exercising. All they have to do is play some lively music and start dancing, which will provide the necessary exercise for the @DATE1. They could also perform ten push - ups and twenty sit - ups, or even more if they so desire. Instead of sitting at the computer all @DATE1, they should exercise. Having a computer affects the user as they have fewer face - to - face conversations with friends and family. You can invite your friend over to your house instead. If they can spend hours on the computer at home, they can surely socialize in person. Instead of video - chatting with your cousins in another state, plan for them to visit you one @DATE1. This way, you can have real conversations and observe what they are doing. You could also play board games, play hide - and - seek, etc. It is far more enjoyable to be with someone in person than to communicate with them online. The last, but certainly not least, effect that computers have on people's lives is that they distract from school. Once you start chatting with a friend, it is difficult to stop. Many people lack the self - control to stop, so they fail to complete their homework or study for an important test the @DATE1, resulting in poor grades. Some students attempt to do homework while using the computer simultaneously, and the homework is likely to be incorrect because they are not concentrating fully. Owning a computer impacts your life in multiple ways, some positive and some negative. It can prevent you from exercising, reduce face - to - face interaction with friends and family, and distract many students from their studies.
65	65	1	1	Do you allocate the entirety or a significant portion of your leisure time seated at your computer? In contemporary society, an increasing number of people are spending excessive amounts of time on computers. Obesity has emerged as a growing concern, interpersonal interaction is crucial, and exposure to fresh air is essential. Unfortunately, computers are undermining these aspects of people's lives. Detach yourself from your computer. A growing number of individuals are becoming obese, primarily due to spending an inordinate amount of time sitting in front of computers. There is no physical exercise involved in computer use. People should venture outdoors, engage in activities such as jogging, playing games, or cycling. Reducing computer time would alleviate the obesity problem in our society. Renowned scientists and researchers emphasize the significance of face - to - face interaction. Throughout our lives, we must engage in socialization. Failure to develop these skills may lead to dissatisfaction in the long run. Communicating with others via computer is far inferior to in - person conversations. Step outside and breathe in the fresh air. Immerse yourself in nature. Whether it's a day at the beach, a hike in the woods, or simply sitting on a swing in your backyard, these experiences can be highly rewarding. Fresh air can clear your mind. Research indicates that children who spend time outdoors tend to achieve better academic results than those who remain indoors using computers. Spending time outside can also help relieve stress. So, turn off your computer, rise from your chair, and engage in physical activity, interact with friends and family, or simply relax while enjoying the fresh air. People are squandering too much time on computers, which is having a detrimental impact on our society. Therefore, it is time to turn off your computer.
66	66	1	1	Would it not be remarkable to incorporate computers into daily life? In this nation, we possess such capability. One can utilize it to converse with individuals one never anticipated seeing again. Exploring distant locations is always a viable option. One can even simply employ it to assist with homework essays. Locating information, conducting research, and even virtually traversing different countries or continents are achievable on the computer. One can purchase plane tickets, reserve rooms, and even book tables at restaurants in other countries with just a few clicks. Moreover, one can research countries, towns, and cities via Google instead of having to venture out and obtain books. Reading about and interacting with people from diverse countries is always an alternative. The ability to communicate, read about others, and access different countries by merely clicking a button is truly astonishing. Computers also enable us to communicate with others when no other means are available. They endow people with the capacity to talk to and see individuals with whom they would otherwise never communicate again. For instance, my father had not seen his father since he was two, but he initiated communication with him, and we were able to see and chat with him through web chat. Thus, these web - chatting platforms such as ooVoo, Facebook, MySpace, Skype, etc., are facilitating people to reconnect. This advantage allows friendships and relationships to endure. Is that truly detrimental? Computers can aid people with their homework and essays. For example, they can type and print their essays instead of having to write them on paper. This is beneficial because, firstly, it enhances the presentation, and secondly, it can be modified more rapidly and easily. They can also acquire information about their studies more promptly and efficiently. Instead of searching for a word in a large dictionary, they can use an online dictionary and simply type in the word. Online dictionaries also offer pronunciation assistance and support different languages. This is extremely helpful as it enables them to complete their work and engage in activities such as exercising, enjoying nature, or interacting with family and friends. I hope you will seriously consider my opinion and contemplate whether using computers for daily necessities is truly that bad.
67	67	1	1	Do you contemplate whether computers impact people's society? Computers offer assistance to individuals of all ages. Firstly, they enable you to engage in conversations with friends and family. Additionally, they allow you to acquire extensive knowledge about history. Finally, computers serve as an excellent means to stay occupied. Firstly, computers provide an ideal avenue to communicate with friends with whom you have lost touch for an extended period. Moreover, they facilitate the process of meeting new friends and maintaining long - term connections with them. Ultimately, computer technology is remarkable as it allows you to communicate with family members across the state through video chat or via platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. Secondly, computers are an outstanding resource for learning about history. You can discover historical information about almost everything, spanning from the past to the present. You can learn about famous people, places, and events. That is why I believe computer technology is so remarkable. What do you think would transpire if we did not have it today? Finally, computers are a great way to stay engaged as you can dedicate time to researching information for school projects. Additionally, you can spend your leisure time playing educational games or even booking flight tickets for a vacation. Ultimately, technology exists for a purpose, so we should utilize it for various activities, such as catching up with friends or simply searching for information on any topic you need to explore. In conclusion, I have just elucidated why computer technology is advantageous. Firstly, it allows you to connect with friends and family. Secondly, it enables you to learn a great deal about history. Finally, it is an excellent way to stay busy. Now that I have explained why computer technology is a positive asset, I hope you concur with my perspective.
68	68	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing to convey my perspective on the effects that computers exert on people. I am of the opinion that computers can have both positive and negative impacts. Computers simplify tasks for people, yet individuals have become overly reliant on them. Mankind should also utilize books for research rather than relying solely on computers. Computers are highly beneficial to people. For example, if you have a strong desire to watch a particular movie but do not wish to wait in line, you can visit MovieTickets.com and purchase your tickets. Subsequently, upon arriving at the movie theater, all you need to do is proceed to the kiosk and redeem your tickets. Another instance is that computers enable people to pay their taxes. There is specialized software that can be downloaded onto your computer. Once the software is installed, it typically guides you through the process of bill - paying step by step. It is significantly faster and more convenient than paying ""manually"". These are some of the remarkable positive effects that computers have on people. However, computers also have their drawbacks. Over time, computers have contributed to making most people lethargic. Some individuals have become excessively dependent on their computers. Business owners and professionals in general are overly reliant on their laptops or Blackberries. Wherever you look, there is an adult engrossed in the internet or sending emails. This phenomenon is not limited to adults. Students are also becoming increasingly dependent on the internet. For virtually every assignment, students turn to Google, Bing, or sometimes Wikipedia. Students should allocate time to use their textbooks. Instead of doing homework, students prefer to watch @CAPS3, play video games, or text. This is understandable as homework can be tedious, but the effort will ultimately be rewarding. Spending an additional @NUM1 minutes using a textbook will not cause any harm. No one has ever perished from using a book instead of Google. Moreover, by using a textbook, you will gain a better understanding of the task at hand. That is not so bad, is it? As you can observe, computers have both positive and negative effects. While it is convenient to use the internet for homework, it may not be beneficial in the long run. Making purchases online is enjoyable as it saves both time and money on gas. I hope you and the readers of this newspaper will appreciate my viewpoint."
69	69	1	1	Some individuals hold the view that it is a prudent idea, while others do not. In my opinion, people invest a substantial amount of time on computers for valid reasons. Here are three justifications: @NUM1, adults engaging in work; @NUM2, students learning typing skills; and @NUM3, communicating with others. My first rationale is that parents undertake a significant amount of work on computers. For example, they handle tasks such as filing taxes, completing paperwork, booking airline tickets, and managing bank transactions. These activities are typically carried out on computers, which eliminates the need for physical travel. My second reason is that students need to learn typing skills to enable them to send emails or write documents. This not only enhances their learning capabilities but also allows them to familiarize themselves with @ORGANIZATION1. Computers are designed to provide entertainment for people of all ages. My final reason is that the ability to communicate with others is an invaluable skill, whether in person or remotely. Computers are advantageous because if you make a mistake while expressing your thoughts, you can easily correct it. This is not possible when communicating face - to - face. Additionally, you can make arrangements with friends who live far away. In my view, people should be permitted to use computers for work, gaming, accessing various websites, and numerous other activities, provided they have access to a computer at home.
70	70	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, envision a life bereft of computers. There would be no rapid access to information, no means of social interaction, and no way to safeguard your health records or other personal information. Without this technology, where would humanity stand? I firmly believe that the world is reaping the benefits of technological advancements in the present era. As a student, computers are an indispensable component that enables me to complete my academic tasks. Without the guidance provided by @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or other applications, it would be impossible for me to achieve my full potential in my assignments. How can a student be certain that the grammar in their homework is flawless without consulting a teacher? There is a solution: @ORGANIZATION2 tools. However, the only way to access these tools is through a computer or @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7. @ORGANIZATION2 tools allow you to verify your spelling, grammar, and punctuation with a simple click of the mouse. Computers are an essential learning instrument in the current school system. Not only are computers utilized for educational purposes, but they also prove to be highly beneficial in the real world. Many businesses rely entirely on the functionality of computers. In fact, according to @PERSON1 @CAPS9 @ORGANIZATION1, a local business, ""@LOCATION1,"" in our work, we are constantly engaged with computer - based operations. This would not be feasible without the efforts of our typists on the computer. Since businesses and companies across the nation are relying on technological advancements, why should we make any changes? We should continue to progress in this growth. @PERCENT1 of businesses in @LOCATION1 state that they would have to shut down if not for computers. With so many businesses in this situation, our economy would decline, which would be detrimental. We are all aware that computers and other forms of technology are excellent sources of entertainment. What you may not realize, however, is that they also provide a vast amount of knowledge to the average person. For example, suppose you have just finished watching a special on the Discovery Channel about @LOCATION2. If you wish to learn more, you can simply take out your iPod touch, log on to the internet, and search for ""@CAPS11 of @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2."" Within seconds, you will have access to the information you seek. Although some people may be skeptical, it is true that you can acquire a significant amount of knowledge from various technological devices. You can have all the resources you need at your fingertips. Computers offer far more than just entertainment. All rational individuals would concur that technological advancements are extremely beneficial to the public. Computers provide substantial guidance for our daily lives."
71	71	1	1	Computers have significantly assisted individuals over the past years. Owing to computers, scientists have discovered cures for diseases, and jobs have become less arduous. I am of the opinion that computers exert a fundamental influence on people. This is because they educate individuals in their occupations and offer people the opportunity to communicate with others without incurring any costs. If someone travels to a country they are unfamiliar with, they might utilize the computer to gain more knowledge about that country and its culture. Additionally, they might visit a website that can assist them in finding affordable options. If a child is preparing a report about a country in @LOCATION1, they can access the computer to obtain facts about that country. Computers educate people about places across the globe. One can visit a website featuring videos and written excerpts about global events and learn about current affairs. My grandmother would recount stories about @CAPS3 @CAPS4 before the advent of computers. Now, my father works in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and shares stories about his day. When comparing these two different decades, it seems that computers are highly beneficial within @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Prior to computers, stores had to perform calculations on paper when providing change to customers. Currently, people save time by inputting numbers into the computer. I believe that computers have facilitated people's jobs. Communicating with someone over the phone incurs costs. When one simply wishes to see someone, using the phone also comes at a cost. With computers, one can video chat or instant message others without any expenses. If you desire to see a friend in @CAPS9 but lack the funds to travel halfway around the world, you can engage in a video chat with her. Computers enable people to save money by communicating with friends, family, and even colleagues via the computer. Since their invention, computers have been extremely useful. They aid people in learning about places worldwide and anything they wish to know. They also simplify jobs and work and help people save a substantial amount of money by communicating via the computer rather than the phone. Computers have improved remarkably over the years. Previously, the screens were tiny, and one had to press numerous buttons just to turn it on. Now, computers can be as large as a flat @CAPS10 and can be powered on with a single button press. Who can predict what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now?
72	72	1	1	"Greetings, I have decided to contribute to the newspaper on the subject of computers and how they contribute to society. Computers are potent machines capable of performing otherwise mundane and tiresome tasks. They benefit individuals in numerous ways, such as being highly useful in business, advantageous in education, and facilitating connections between friends and family. Computers are valuable in business and are an indispensable tool in today's typical workplace, enabling work to be completed far more efficiently than without them. One reason computers are so valuable in the workplace is that they can store significantly more data than can be recorded on paper. Moreover, they can execute tasks and processes rapidly, which is crucial in a work environment. They can also be employed to transmit important information swiftly and effortlessly. These are all valid justifications for the benefits of computers in business and their role in expediting operations. Computers are essential in today's schools and educational programs as they enable students to work more efficiently. ""@PERCENT1 of all surveyed students stated that they prefer typing a school paper rather than writing it by hand, indicating their appreciation for computers in their education,"" remarked @PERSON2, a professor at @ORGANIZATION1. This demonstrates that computers are significant to students and are utilized to their advantage. In addition to students writing papers, teachers and school systems employ computers for grading, attendance records, and more. The teachers at my school are using @CAPS1 @CAPS2, hardware devices directly connected to computers, which can replace white @CAPS2. I have observed that students are becoming more engaged and focused in class due to the implementation of this computer technology. All of these factors are evidence of the usefulness of computers in educational processes and the need for their continued use. Many individuals desire to communicate with their friends and family during idle moments, and thanks to computers, social networking websites, and instant messaging programs, this has become significantly easier. ""@PERCENT2 of teens regularly visit at least one social networking site,"" stated @PERSON1, a psychologist specializing in adolescents. This indicates that people utilize these sites and enjoy them. Families separated because a member moved out of the house recently may wish to stay in touch, and computers make this possible. There are multiple means by which they can use their computers to maintain contact, such as the aforementioned instant messaging systems. The ability to communicate with one another brings happiness to these individuals and benefits society. Overall, the ability to communicate through computers is a source of enjoyment for many and is significant to contemporary society. In conclusion, computers contribute to society in ways that enhance the quality of life for everyone. Whether it is by improving business efficiency, enabling students to work more effectively and in a preferred manner, or facilitating communication, computers consistently benefit society. These machines rarely impede progress more than manual work would, and their positive impact far outweighs any negative aspects."
73	73	1	1	"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1"" echoes across the room. ""@CAPS4, oh, here comes Pete."" ""@CAPS5, is he gaining weight?"" ""All he does is spend the entire day playing on the computer."" There is an increasing number of teenagers throughout @LOCATION1 who are spending excessive time playing on the computer. This trend must be halted. ""@CAPS7, playing on computers is among the most unproductive ways to spend one's time,"" declared @CAPS8 @PERSON1 of the International Health Committee. There will always be obese individuals worldwide, but in the past @NUM1 years, @LOCATION2 has witnessed a doubling of the number of obese @CAPS7 in all of @LOCATION3. Statistics reveal that over @PERCENT1 of the American population is severely obese. The future of America may consist of obese and lazy @CAPS7 who prefer to sit in front of a screen all day. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS7 who do not experience nature during their youth never fully appreciate it. Since they spend all their time playing on computers and do not interact with nature, they will not care for it and may contribute to littering and pollution. Simply put, @CAPS7 spending excessive time on the computer can be detrimental to both the environment and themselves. Not only do computers harm the @CAPS7 and the environment, but they also impact family and friends. @CAPS7 who are constantly on the computer do not spend sufficient time with their loved ones. Families are meant to be close - knit, but this is not possible if someone is engrossed in computer games all day. Just a few weeks ago, @PERSON2 Rayfield reported that he was grounded because he spent so much time on the computer that he did not speak to his mother for two weeks. @PERCENT3 of divorces occur due to arguments over the amount of time spent on the computer, according to @CAPS8 @PERSON3 from the Yale Marriage Research Center. If @CAPS7 were aware that their excessive computer use could lead to their parents' divorce, they might reduce their screen time. Therefore, @CAPS7 should limit their computer usage due to the implications for their health, the environment, and their families. Ultimately, the choice lies with the people. Do you envision a nation of physically fit individuals with close - knit families or a dilapidated, obese community that is merely ""called"" @LOCATION4?"
74	74	1	1	I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on individuals. Computers enable people to maintain contact with friends and family residing at a distance. They also offer games for children that aid in their learning, and people can acquire new knowledge as well. My first point is that computers facilitate communication. If a family member lives far away, one can use email to stay in touch, thus preventing the loss of connection. Additionally, when friends move away, it is easy to keep in touch. Moreover, email can be used to share photos, as traditional mail is time - consuming. We should encourage people to stay connected! My second point is that computers provide games for children. These games can enhance children's learning. Sometimes, watching television is not as effective. When children actively participate in games and understand what they are doing, they become more intelligent. This is what we desire for our children, is it not? Furthermore, children enjoy playing these games. Should we really deprive them of this learning opportunity? My third point is that computers assist people in acquiring new knowledge. For instance, one can use the computer to stay informed about global events, learn new words, and benefit from visual aids. If someone is planning a trip and is unsure about the prices, they can easily check on the computer. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are highly useful. They help people stay connected, aid children in learning through games, and enable people to discover new things about the world. Therefore, I urge you to keep using computers. They are not a waste of time. Trust me!
75	75	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Over the past decade, technological advancements have completely transformed the world. Technology has streamlined people's lives and fostered greater global connectivity. It has created numerous job opportunities and accelerated routine tasks such as tax filing, message dissemination, news sharing, and teaching. However, numerous studies have shown that excessive technology use can lead to internet addiction among teenagers and adults. This addiction can result in individuals sacrificing time with their families, opportunities for exercise, and experiences in nature. As a member of the generation that has grown up in the era of new technology, I have directly witnessed its benefits. I firmly believe that this technology is a boon to contemporary society. A significant number of new jobs have been created as a result of technological progress. For example, the development of a new computer system could employ thousands of people, including founders, managers, innovators, and retail store employees. Managing a business or corporation is a challenging endeavor, but technological advancements have simplified the process and reduced time wastage. With modern technology, people can send emails instantaneously instead of distributing memos throughout the office. Additionally, businesses can update their stock information every minute, enhancing operational efficiency. Thanks to technological advancements, the general public can stay informed about global news in real - time. Moreover, tax filing can be completed online, saving time and effort. There is also a wider range of entertainment options available to everyone. Through today's new technology, people's lives have become significantly more convenient. They can work more efficiently, accomplish more tasks, acquire more knowledge, connect with people worldwide, and stay updated on local and international news. Technology is making a positive impact on society and will hopefully continue to make life easier.
76	76	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1's best acquaintance, @LOCATION2, was formerly a bookish individual lacking hand - eye coordination. However, once @CAPS2, he commenced using a computer, and now his hand - eye coordination surpasses mine. The computer not only imparts hand - eye coordination but also, @CAPS3, endows people with the capacity to learn about distant places and individuals. Moreover, it enables millions of people to engage in online conversations. @CAPS1's friend was not the sole person to acquire hand - eye coordination. Approximately @PERCENT1 of individuals learn hand - eye coordination through computer usage. Mastering @CAPS3 may require a few months, yet once a child grasps it, they will spend hours outdoors. Who would not desire to learn hand - eye coordination? Additionally, the computer empowers people to learn about far - off places and people. Computer engineer, @PERSON1, states, ""@NUM1 in every @NUM2 people gain knowledge about places and people via the internet."" Learning @CAPS3 will consume a few hours, but the outcome is an educated individual. Why would someone opine that we are spending excessive time online when we are being educated? Furthermore, do you not have a friend residing more than @NUM3 miles away? If so, @CAPS2, a computer will resolve your communication predicament. @CAPS1's friend, @LOCATION1, lives @NUM4 miles from me. We communicate using Hotmail, Yahoo, and Facebook. The most remarkable aspect is that it is cost - free, unlike a telephone. Moreover, computer specialist, @PERSON2, claims, ""I learned hand - eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, I was able to submit @CAPS1's essay punctually due to the information a computer provides, and I was able to communicate with @CAPS1's family."" I was reluctant to disclose this, but I too was a bookish person with no hand - eye coordination, and I learned in the same manner as @LOCATION2. We are not spending too much time; we are merely being educated."
77	77	1	1	Dear Newspaper, in @DATE1's era, we are reliant on computers. In @DATE1, computers have emerged as the most invaluable technological resource. We rely on computers for numerous purposes, and they contribute significantly to society. They facilitate online communication, are educational, and enhance hand - eye coordination. It is astonishing how extensively computers assist us. We need computers as indispensably as we need water. How could we survive without them? Computers have become the linchpin of friendships. They help sustain friendships when we do not see our friends regularly. I have a friend who relocated to @LOCATION1 last year. It was prohibitively expensive to simply call or text her. Consequently, I maintain contact with her via the computer. Every day, we @CAPS1 and use Skype to stay in touch. Those services cost @MONEY1 per year. If I were to call her, each call would cost @MONEY2. I am certain that without the internet, our friendship would have deteriorated. Computers have been extremely helpful to many individuals facing the same issue. Computers have become the primary source for obtaining information. They have become more popular than the library and textbooks combined. Countless essential resources are available on computers. Textbooks, calculators, and even homework are accessible online. Many people assert that computers are not educational, but scientists contend that they can elevate a student's grade from a @CAPS2 - to an A+. Teachers concur with this view. One of my classmates stated that computers transformed his life. He used to forget to jot down his homework, but now he can view it all online. Now he knows which pages to read from the science book. If you doubt that computers have changed students' lives, reconsider. There are also games that enhance hand - eye coordination. Many sports teams, such as the @CAPS3, utilize this. It has improved their hand - eye coordination by @PERCENT1. The team claims that without the hand - eye coordination game, they would never have won the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. This game is also freely available online for anyone to use. Everyone who has used it reports a significant improvement in their reaction time. The games are enjoyable and non - violent. They include games like baseball, hockey, and hurdles. This game has had a profound positive impact on people's lives. If we do not have computers, our hand - eye coordination will decline by @PERCENT2. Would you want to be the one to eliminate computers? In conclusion, computers have had a profound impact on @DATE1's society. Computers are educational, enable us to communicate with friends, and enhance hand - eye coordination. They have significantly improved our way of life for the better. Without computers, friendships would dissolve, grades would drop, and hand - eye coordination would plummet. We need computers as they have been beneficial to billions of people worldwide. Many people depend on computers. Therefore, removing computers would disappoint many lives. No rational person would want to take away computers. Computers have benefited society in myriad ways.
78	78	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1's stance on ""excessive computer time"" is outrageous. I believe people should explore more alternatives. These include engaging in physical activity, socializing with family and friends, and indulging in ""personal time,"" which involves doing whatever one desires indoors, excluding computer use. For physical activity, one can partake in any outdoor sport of preference. For socializing with family and friends, one can organize a pleasant family reunion at their residence or simply ""hang out"" with friends. During ""personal time,"" one can draw or read a book. There are numerous alternatives to ""computer time."" When engaging in physical activity, one can venture outdoors and play sports such as basketball, soccer, or baseball. One could even play games like hide - and - seek or tag with friends. Anything that keeps one active outside the house is preferable to using a computer! If one exercises daily, such as engaging in a ""workout"" to achieve fitness, they will surely achieve their goal instead of squandering time on the computer. Exercising is a prudent choice instead of using ""computer time."" Socializing with family and friends is a worthwhile use of time instead of ""computer time"" because it allows us to finally spend quality time with them, such as having conversations, playing games, or dining together. This is what is known as ""socializing."" Our family and friends will cherish the opportunity to spend time together over a meal and engage in a meaningful conversation. One could also play board games like ""Monopoly."" With friends, one can go to the movies, have a sleepover, or play outside. There are numerous excellent ideas for spending time with family and friends instead of using ""computer time."" The final alternative to ""computer time"" is engaging in ""personal time"" indoors. Warning! Avoid computer time! One could engage in a quiet activity like drawing a beautiful picture. This is a pleasant and tranquil alternative to using ""computer time."" One could even read a book. Perhaps one needs to catch up on their nightly reading for language arts and start reading their target book. If one chooses to engage in ""personal time,"" they will surely manage to forgo that unproductive ""computer time."" All of these ""alternatives"" to computer use are quite straightforward. It is unhealthy to remain sedentary in front of the computer all day! Instead, one can exercise, socialize with family and friends, and engage in ""personal time,"" but avoid using a computer!!! If one wishes to achieve a goal, they can certainly manage it."
79	79	1	1	Computers have caused many individuals to forfeit money, friends, and time. In fact, since the advent of computers this year, a large number of people have been spending an inordinate amount of time on the web. This can lead to the loss of time and friends. Computers and technology today have exerted a profound influence on a vast number of people. Spending excessive time on computers can result in the loss of time and money. For instance, my eldest brother was quite overweight at the age of @NUM1 or @NUM2 when our computer started functioning. However, this had a positive impact on him. He began participating in sports such as basketball and lacrosse and excelled at them, continuing with lacrosse throughout high school. In the process, he also saved my parents money. This is @CAPS1's illustration of how computers can have a negative effect on people. The new technology has caused people to squander a great deal of time that could be better spent on other activities that would benefit them in life. For example, many people in @LOCATION1 devote half of their day to computers, and a significant portion of this time is spent on video games. This is @CAPS1's demonstration that one of the effects computers can have on people is the loss of or estrangement from friends. For example, I used to be friends with a person, but he stopped communicating with me for almost the entire @DATE1 because he was constantly on the computer. This made me think that he no longer wanted to be friends, but in reality, he had dedicated almost all of the @DATE1 to the computer. Since then, I have visited his house approximately @NUM3 times this year, as opposed to every @DATE2. This is @CAPS1's example of how computers can transform one's life. The time has come to decide whether to own a computer or not. In my opinion, it would be optimal for everyone if we limited our computer use. However, if we choose to have computers, we should impose a specific time limit on their use. This way, you and your family members will not lose time, exercise time, or friends. Overall, I believe it would be best for everyone if we restricted our computer time instead of spending the entire day on them.
80	80	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1, and I firmly believe that computers are not highly beneficial to our society. Computers do not benefit us as they prevent many people from engaging in physical activity, leading a healthy lifestyle, participating in sports, and enjoying the outdoors. Computers are dissuading many people, particularly the younger generation, from exercising. Nowadays, instead of going to the gym, many people stay at home, chatting with friends or playing computer games on the computer. As a result, many people are not as healthy as they should be. It is also documented that individuals who spend long hours on the computer are damaging their eyes, leading to an increase in the number of people wearing glasses. If people were to engage in activities other than using the computer, they would lead happier, healthier, and more fulfilling lives. Unfortunately, many young people are not participating in sports. During this decade, numerous sports games have been developed for the computer. Now, instead of challenging themselves to strive for excellence, kids either play half - heartedly or do not play at all. The reason is that they can instead invest a great deal of effort in customizing their @CAPS4 or @ORGANIZATION1 teams in @PERSON2 or @NUM1. Moreover, the computer is not the only electronic device preventing kids from playing sports. Xbox, PlayStation, Xbox @NUM2, PSP, @NUM3, GameCube, and GameBoy are some of the console systems that offer games that distract kids. I myself have been guilty of thinking more about an Xbox game than my own hacky game! Not only are these electronics attracting kids like magnets, but parents are also allowing their children to play video games or stay on the computer for extended periods. Many of us have no idea what it truly means to go camping outdoors. People do not spend quality time with their families. I have noticed that @CAPS5 families are very close - knit, so it is natural to engage in activities with one's father, brother, or cousin. However, not many families are as close, and they do not engage in activities together. If some fathers took their sons fishing or camping, it would draw them away from computers, and the father - son bond would strengthen. These are my reasons, sir, and they should be carefully considered for some time. Just remember that many people need to exercise, many should play sports, and many families should experience the outdoors.
81	81	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I opine that the utilization of computers is a beneficial endeavor and it exerts no influence on physical exercise, appreciation of nature, and interaction with family and friends. Here are three rationales to substantiate my viewpoint: individuals acquire more knowledge on the internet; school - aged children can access online resources to ascertain their homework assignments; and the internet has a positive impact on daily life. My primary reason for deeming computer usage advantageous is that people can expand their knowledge on the internet. As the adage goes, one learns something novel each day. When one is inquisitive about a matter or ruminating on a thought, the internet can assist in uncovering the desired information. @ORGANIZATION1 is an excellent platform to find what one seeks. It also offers its own imagery if a picture is required for a project. My second significant reason for advocating internet use is that if one is a @CAPS1, they can log on to check their assignments for each subject. Suppose a @CAPS1 student is ill and unable to do homework during recess the next day. Instead, they can visit their school's website and click on their teachers' names to view their homework. This way, they can still have time to venture outdoors, play with friends, and engage with family members. My third and final reason for the internet's utility is that it positively affects daily life. In the absence of a television and with no knowledge of the weather, one can go online to determine if it will be snowy or rainy. This information can guide decisions on whether to don a jacket or a raincoat, or to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet proves to be a valuable asset in daily life. In conclusion, I firmly believe that internet use is highly beneficial and will not impede physical activity or interaction with family. To support this stance, I have stated that people learn more on the internet, children can access homework if they miss a day, and the internet has a positive impact on daily life.
82	82	1	1	Do you recall the last instance when you retrieved information on the computer? A multitude of individuals utilize computers, yet not all concur that this trend benefits society. Proponents of technological advancement assert that computers exert a positive influence on people. I am an advocate for computers as they facilitate writing, information retrieval, and communication. One of the reasons I support computers is their assistance in the realm of writing. Evidently, my handwriting is not of the highest caliber. To address this, I type the majority of my papers. Computers can also aid individuals with spelling and grammar. There are even systems available that enable users to speak, and the corresponding text will appear on the screen. This is merely one of the reasons I am in favor of computers. Secondly, computers are advantageous due to the vast amount of information they can provide. Prior to the advent of computers, one would have to visit a library and sift through approximately ten books, which might not even contain the desired information. Currently, one can access hundreds of articles on any topic within minutes. The quantity of available information is truly unimaginable. I consider computers to be a remarkable technological innovation because of the information they offer. Finally, I believe that computers are beneficial to us because of their role in communication. A recently emerged form of communication is @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is a website that allows users to send messages to friends, share pictures, videos, and numerous other content. Email enables instant transmission of letters to others via the internet. The forms of communication available on the internet are seemingly endless. This is the final reason I support computers. Computers are a significant boon to society. They facilitate writing, communication, and everyone can reap the benefits of computers.
83	83	1	1	Dear Newspaper, Computers have emerged as an outstanding learning resource, and I believe it is time we accord them due recognition instead of fretting over them. I will expound on why I consider computers to be remarkable. One of the reasons they are extremely helpful is that books do not always encompass all the requisite information. Hence, when one needs to ascertain a fact or gather more data for a project, they can turn to the computer, and all the information will be readily available. As a result, one will acquire more knowledge than when they commenced. The second reason is that one can access a computer from almost any location. Even if one does not possess a phone, they can engage in conversation or send a message. Not everyone owns a phone, but computers serve as an alternative means of communication. Another reason is that the weather is not always sunny. On rainy days, computers offer an enjoyable way to play and learn without the necessity of being outdoors. Computers do not supplant outdoor activities or exercise; they merely serve as a pastime when outdoor opportunities are limited. I hope you have appreciated and comprehended my reasons and will take them into account when deliberating on this topic.
84	84	1	1	I am of the opinion that computers are of great assistance to people as they offer a wealth of knowledge on various subjects, such as @CAPS1. If one is in search of employment, they can utilize computers to conduct a job search. Moreover, when faced with a problem, computers can provide solutions. If one intends to visit a particular place, they can use the computer to gather information about it. If they find it appealing, they can proceed to visit; otherwise, they can explore other destinations. I believe it is truly remarkable to search for individuals on the computer, as one can communicate with them and even have a visual interaction. One can also explore different cultures on the computer according to their interests. For instance, if one has a favorite person they wish to learn about, they can search for relevant information on the computer, watch videos, or explore different websites. It is truly fascinating. There are numerous online games available, including educational games such as math and science games, catering to diverse interests. Additionally, one can interact with other players while gaming. It is indeed an engaging experience. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are not detrimental to people; instead, they offer substantial assistance.
85	85	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, Are computers a boon or a bane to society? What is your stance? Would you relish being constantly engrossed in computer use? I, for one, would not. This is why I contend that computers have a negative impact on society. The primary reason I hold this view is that individuals can become addicted to computer use. Computer addiction can lead to severe consequences. For example, excessive computer use reduces the time dedicated to physical exercise, which is detrimental to one's physical health. A sedentary lifestyle can result in various issues, including obesity, health problems, and diseases such as diabetes. These are typically the most prevalent problems. One can mitigate this by powering off the computer and taking a short walk. However, due to the allure of modern computer technology, people are often reluctant to do so. This is one of the reasons computers have a negative impact on society. Another reason is that excessive computer use diminishes the time spent with family and friends. Even if one is unaware, prioritizing computer use over social interaction can have a profound impact on loved ones. They may feel disappointed, worried, or concerned. Constant computer use amounts to ignoring family, which can cause emotional distress. Consider how you would feel if your best friend, with whom you shared a close bond, suddenly stopped communicating and spending time with you. You would undoubtedly feel disappointed, as you have lost a dear friend due to computer addiction. These scenarios can unfold if one overindulges in computer use. In my personal opinion, computers do more harm than good. The final reason I assert that computers are not entirely beneficial pertains to safety. Nowadays, computers provide access to numerous websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, Twitter, and others. Many children engage in conversations with strangers and post pictures of themselves without considering the potential risks. Once posted, these pictures remain accessible, even if one attempts to delete them. Moreover, when using the computer, people often neglect safety precautions. For example, one may think they are chatting with a friend but end up communicating with a stranger. Subsequently, arranging a meeting with this supposed ""friend"" can be extremely dangerous. Clearly, safety is a significant concern when it comes to computer use. In conclusion, do you still believe that computers are a positive influence on society? My opinion remains steadfast, and I am certain that there are others who share this view. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers are more harmful than beneficial to those who use them."
86	86	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, as computers increasingly integrate into daily life, individuals commence to deliberate whether they exert a positive influence on people. Computers are a technological marvel that yields a beneficial effect on individuals. The World Wide Web, boundless social interaction, and simulations are merely a few of the advantages of computers. The internet offers access to the global network. An infinite quantity of information can be discovered on one's computer. ""In nearly every school, reliance on the internet to acquire information is widespread,"" stated the education secretary, @PERSON1. Additionally, search engines provide access to thousands of information - laden pages. Apart from the limitless information, the web hosts thousands of diverse web pages. Through these, people can learn about others' viewpoints or spend time engaging in games. The web is but one of the numerous remarkable aspects of computers. Socialization is a significant component of the modern lifestyle. Web - based platforms on computers enable people to communicate with friends residing miles away. No longer do people have to board an airplane to converse with friends on the other side of the world. Moreover, instant messaging and email serve as the primary communication systems for thousands of individuals. It is the most efficient means of communicating with friends. In fact, I re - established connections with numerous people I hadn't interacted with for a long time by receiving emails. Everyone enjoys communicating with their friends and family, and this is facilitated by the use of computers. Simulations are a substantial benefit of computers. Many simulation programs are employed to assist people in their lives. Many professions utilize simulations on computers to learn how to perform their jobs. Nine out of ten medical schools incorporate the use of surgery simulations as part of their training curriculum. Additionally, simulations and gaming on computers arouse interest among many people. I myself have developed a greater interest in history after playing numerous historically themed computer games. Also, many games and computer simulations have helped many people learn new things. There are countless learning games and simulations accessible via computer. Simulations add substantial benefits to owning a computer. As technology progresses, people are presented with numerous possibilities such as accessing information via the web, engaging in boundless social interaction, and utilizing simulations. The benefits of computers are numerous, while the problems are few. So, how can one keep up in a world where computer users hold an advantage if they deny the benefits of computers? Computers positively impact people."
87	87	1	1	"Computers, one of the highly favored technological devices, also happen to be among the many distractions. Numerous individuals contemplate whether computers are truly advantageous. I am one such contemplator. I opine that computers do not always confer benefits upon society. They present numerous distractions, including Facebook, online games, and even inappropriate images and videos. If one truly reflects on it, are computers as beneficial as we perceive them to be? My friend, @PERSON2, was recently introduced to Facebook and obtained a membership. Initially, it seemed like a trivial matter. She frequently went online merely to check her status and inbox messages, and that was that. However, she subsequently became completely addicted. She joined numerous clubs and groups and began to fall behind in school. After neglecting to study because she was online for nearly six hours every day, she was receiving a plethora of low grades on most of her tests. @PERSON2 would return home and not even bother with her homework but would immediately go online. After a month of membership, she was failing most of her classes, and her mother revoked her computer privileges. Observe, she was distracted by one minor thing, and her entire life was nearly derailed. ""But, mom, I'm in the middle of a game! And I'm winning!"" @PERSON1 declares triumphantly. @PERSON1 adores online games and wins almost @PERCENT1 of the time. Nevertheless, that is not the point. He plays games constantly. @PERSON1's gaming interferes with his interaction with his family. He has not played with his four - year - old sister, @PERSON3, since she was two years old. His mother often dines alone. Sometimes, he even views inappropriate pictures when his mother is out shopping. While playing a game, a girl messages him, ""@CAPS5 at my pic. They're hot!"" and he looks at them. He believes they are harmless, but his mother does not share this view. His gaming has disrupted his family and social life. Most people believe that computers are beneficial because one can find interesting information. However, one can obtain various types of information from books. Instead of typing '@ORGANIZATION1' on a computer, one could simply search for it in a library. It takes less time, and one is less likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. See? Computers are not as beneficial as most people think. There are various types of distractions, and these are just a few."
88	88	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, ""Oh no!"" I forgot the definition of this homework problem, and I don't have my notes. In such a situation, a computer would be extremely useful as one can simply type in the word and obtain a multitude of results. This is why I believe having constant access to a computer is highly advantageous because one can find the information one has been seeking. One can get in touch with a friend when necessary or simply engage in conversation when idle. If one is just sitting around with nothing to do, one can explore the computer and discover things one might not have known. Having access to a computer is truly beneficial because if one is in the middle of a conversation and forgets the name of an important fact one wishes to share, one can always look it up. For me, on many occasions, I simply need information about perhaps a sports player or facts about a famous event. Since our technology is so advanced, the computer is readily available with many of the useful facts we desire to know. Friends are an integral part of my life, and I enjoy communicating with them and inquiring about their well - being. Again, with the current advanced technology, there are numerous websites where we can communicate and check on each other. A significant reason why being able to communicate with friends and family is helpful is for staying in touch with those who are far away and those one doesn't usually see. On a computer, one can communicate with people not only from all over the United States but also from other countries! Finally, the times when I find having a computer nearby most useful are when I'm bored and have nothing to do! I can visit numerous educational websites on topics I might not have learned in school or topics I've always wanted to learn. On the internet, there are many things to keep one occupied, such as games, or one can even watch movies from the comfort of home on the computer! If one has a computer at home, one should not be bored because there are many things one can do or even learn! Having a computer at home is so beneficial; one can have fun while also learning how to be proficient with technology. Computers are the future, and it's a promising one. So, I recommend getting one and having a great time; you won't regret it."
89	89	1	1	Computers indeed confer benefits upon our society. They have significantly transformed the world. One can engage in numerous activities on the internet. Using a computer, one can communicate with people worldwide. The computer has a positive impact on the world. These are the ways in which computers benefit our society. There is a wide array of activities that can be carried out on the internet. One can play games with others. One can interact with people on specific websites. One can search for vacation destinations. If one is weary of staying at home, simply accessing the internet is an option. These are the things that can be done on the internet. On a computer, there are numerous features. Among them, chatting is the most excellent. One can be playing a game and still engage in chatting. If one is chatting with someone, one can simultaneously chat with another person. One can communicate with people from across the globe. This is why chatting is the best feature. The computer aids the world in multiple ways. It assists children when they need to conduct research. It helps the police apprehend criminals. The computer helps parents discover vacation options through advertisements. This is how the computer benefits the world. The computer does contribute to the betterment of our society. It has changed the world. One can perform many tasks on it. Using a computer, one can communicate with people from anywhere. The computer benefits the world on a daily basis. This is how the computer enriches our society.
90	90	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3, I believe that computers are a valuable tool. I am aware that some individuals use computers instead of enjoying outdoor activities or exercising, but not everyone does so. The computer is a worthy resource to invest time in. The effects that computers have on people are generally positive. It is true that people who use computers can communicate with others online and obtain information more rapidly than in a library. I am of the opinion that the effects a computer has on an individual are beneficial. When people use a computer, they can acquire information for research and work. That is because, when using a computer, one can relax while still accomplishing a considerable amount of work. One can also multitask while on a computer, such as holding one's dog or cat, eating, drinking, texting, or making a call. It is highly versatile. However, for some, computers can be a drawback as they are very expensive, and some people do not have the financial means to purchase one. But if one does have a computer, it can prove useful. For example, @CAPS4 achieved success, and without a computer, he might not have become as prosperous. Rumors aside, the computer is what he needed to succeed with Microsoft. So, computers are useful, and their impact on people is positive.
91	91	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I opine that computers are truly remarkable. They are genuinely useful. They can educate us about various matters. Moreover, they offer engaging games and websites, which is invariably an advantage. Computers are beneficial in numerous aspects. For instance, if you need to look up something for school, you can effortlessly access the computer and find the information. Additionally, some teachers now have websites, enabling you to utilize the online book instead of carrying a hefty social studies book home. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 students prefer using the internet book rather than taking the actual one home? Also, if you forget to jot down your homework, there is a website where you can look up all your assignments. Furthermore, computers can impart knowledge to us. There are websites featuring math games and school - related content. You can also readily access Google and search for information, which can provide you with thousands of details. Lastly, the internet is an excellent source of entertainment, with millions of games and fun websites like Facebook. Did you know @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 students use the computer for games and online communication? This also provides children with numerous activities on rainy days. So, whether you are using the internet for its utility, resources, or simply for the enjoyable games and websites, computers are truly helpful.
92	92	1	1	Dear local Newspaper; @CAPS1, are you aware that computers can instruct you to perform numerous tasks? You likely are! I comprehend that you may desire to know my stance on whether computers have a positive or negative impact on individuals. Well, I believe it has a positive influence. Computers teach you how to type and familiarize you with the keyboard keys. It also aids you in searching for information about people, states, and so on. Lastly, it facilitates interaction with other students when not at school. I encourage you to continue reading to discover my excellent and well - thought - out ideas. First of all, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people because they endow you with the learning skills to type. I recall last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, directed us to visit a website dedicated to learning how to type. It informed us that the main keys were A, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and colon (;). It was extremely beneficial. From then on, I typed in that manner. I think learning how to type is an outstanding skill. Typing is advantageous if you aspire to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary downtown at the law firm called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three offices, so she learned to type very rapidly. Typing is a significant part of your life. You can utilize it for a class project or an essay you need to type to apply for a scholarship or college. Typing is employed everywhere, even in math class, where my teacher types up materials and posts them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9. In addition, computers have a positive effect on people as they assist in looking up famous people, states, countries, etc. I remember in @NUM2 grade, I undertook a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade, I created a PowerPoint on... I've also completed a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I did one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm commencing one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can discern, I've been using a computer almost my entire life, except when I was a baby. But now that I reflect, when I was a baby, I received a small fake computer. I know computers are @LOCATION1, but they do have a positive impact on people. When was the last time you required a computer to help you look up something or someone? Presumably not too long ago. Computers are truly valuable. They can assist you in accomplishing anything. They've supported me throughout my life. To continue, computers have a positive impact on people. They help you interact with other people, students, and family members when out of contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. I was extremely sad. I didn't want her to leave. So then she gave me her email to communicate with her on the computer, and now we can talk. The computer has numerous websites where people can interact, such as @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, AOL, MSN, Yahoo, Gmail, Twitter, and many more. I enjoy conversing with people from all over the country. I talk to my friends when I'm at home and to family members. My favorite website is @CAPS14. I'm a huge fan of it. It's so much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? @CAPS1, do you have any interaction websites? If not, you should acquire one. This is why computers have a positive impact on people. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Firstly, they enable interaction with others. Secondly, they help in looking up information. Thirdly, they develop typing skills. Thank you for reading my letter, which I'm certain has convinced you of the positive impact of computers on people.
93	93	1	1	"Readers of ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" should be well - informed of the benefits that computers offer to society. Not only do they cultivate hand - eye coordination, but they also empower people to learn about distant places and provide a convenient means of online communication. In the contemporary era, good hand - eye coordination is essential for thriving in society. Using computers provides a means of both establishing and enhancing hand - eye coordination from the comfort of one's own home or workplace. Dr. @DR1, of @ORGANIZATION1 medical center, states that a recent study reveals @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 computer users possess better hand - eye coordination than those who do not regularly operate a computer. In a local primary school, students have initiated the ""@CAPS2 to learn"" program, which promotes rapid typing. School officials have witnessed a significant increase in the typing speed of children since the program's inception in @DATE1. In this regard, the computer offers a reliable path to improved hand - eye coordination. Even more importantly, the hand - eye coordination acquired from using a computer can enhance the likelihood of securing a job involving such skills as an adult, such as a secretary or graphic designer. While hand - eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people, the ability to learn about distant places with a simple keystroke is even more beneficial to all users. Websites such as Google and Yahoo can retrieve millions of results within seconds if you search for the name of a city or country. This can be useful when working on school projects; instead of having to carry numerous books home to complete an essay on @LOCATION1, you can simply search for the information on a computer at home. When summer arrives and the school year ends, you can instead research far - off places that could serve as vacation destinations rather than just for homework. All travel information, from plane tickets to the appropriate currency, is readily accessible on a computer. If ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" readers were aware of this, much inconvenience would be avoided and a great deal of time would be saved. The most widely used aspect of computers, even more so than research, is online communication. State officials, governors, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while checking the weather or their email. This is a far more convenient way to access government statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the @CAPS4. Social networking sites are also extremely popular, and on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, you can reconnect with people you don't see regularly or who don't live nearby. If your cousin is studying abroad and doesn't have access to an international phone, you can communicate with them via email on the computer, making it seem as if they're right there. It is absurd to think that someone could view computers—the gateway to distant places, improved hand - eye coordination, and connection with friends and family—as a detriment to society. They assist us in countless ways, and ""@CAPS5 @CAPS1"" readers should be aware of this."
94	94	1	1	Dear Newspaper Staff, I am here to assert that computers exert a negative influence on people. Although computers contain a vast amount of information, is it always accurate? There are numerous alternative activities to engage in rather than spending time on the computer. Moreover, computers are highly distracting. They may provide incorrect information. The process of turning on the computer, searching for information, and then turning it off consumes more time than simply retrieving a book, opening it, finding the information, closing it, and putting it back. Books are more often accurate. Computers require more time to obtain information compared to books. They also inundate you with excessive information. There are plenty of other worthwhile activities, such as reading a book or drawing. You could also engage in outdoor activities like shooting hoops or riding your bike. You can contact your friends and play with them. If you're truly bored and unsure what to do, you can invent a game. At times, computers can divert your attention. If you need to complete homework and have a computer nearby, it can lead you astray. When at work with a computer, it can be a temptation. Even observing others using computers can be distracting. When working on the computer, it's easy to shift from searching for something necessary, like @ORGANIZATION1, to something you desire to search, like @ORGANIZATION1 company. Do you understand what I mean by a negative impact? Computers do not always provide accurate information, there are better ways to spend your time, and they are highly distracting. They transform hard - working individuals into procrastinators and active people into the lazy. Computers have entered our world and have changed all our lives! They have brought about a significant alteration in daily life. Please concur with me.
95	95	1	1	"Although some individuals contend that computers transform us children into unthinking beings, I firmly believe that they have a positive impact on us. Computers enable us to explore far - off places that we might never otherwise visit. They can also help us reconnect with old friends or offer assistance with homework. One reason I believe computers are beneficial is that they facilitate exploration of other places. I am certain that every child dreams of visiting a particular place. However, not all of us can afford to travel long distances. Most families, though, do own computers. With parental permission, children can use the internet to learn a multitude of fascinating facts about their desired destinations. ""@I have always longed to visit @LOCATION1, but my parents lack the necessary income,"" said @PERSON1 of @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 @CAPS3 school. ""I used my computer and the internet to uncover hundreds of amazing facts about it."" As you can see, computers can help people realize their dreams. Another reason I think computers are advantageous is that they assist in connecting with friends. If you're like me, you enjoy communicating with your friends. A lot! But sometimes they are too far away to call without incurring high costs. A solution is this wonderful invention: the computer! You can engage in long - distance conversations without having to pay. This is particularly beneficial for me because not long ago, one of my best friends moved to @LOCATION2. I thought I'd never talk to him again. Then I discovered @CAPS7 @CAPS8. It allows you to communicate whenever and wherever you want! Now, my friend and I can stay in touch, and so can you! My final reason for believing computers are good is that they can also aid with homework. Have you ever encountered a difficult math problem you couldn't solve? Or forgotten the capital of a state you're studying? Well, the computer can solve both of these problems and more! @PERCENT1 of computers today come equipped with software that includes a calculator. For the remaining @PERCENT1, you can download and install software onto your computer at a low cost. And every computer in the world has internet capabilities. All you need to do is turn it on and embark on a journey! Don't fret about excessive computer use because computers can only help us, not harm us. Remember, computers help us fully realize our dreams. They also facilitate connection with others and help us succeed in school. So, get on the computer and start exploring. Have you used your computer today?"
96	96	1	1	The utilization of computers is undoubtedly correct. It is advantageous; one can uncover novel things and much more. Computers render people's lives significantly simpler. Computers can assist individuals in remarkable ways by searching for things one desperately requires. For instance, if one were a student and had to write a paper on @PERSON1, the computer has access to the internet, which contains billions of facts about @PERSON1 and a wealth of information on everything. It can also be useful by looking up the weather, the news, even events occurring around the world, and even answering one's questions. Discovering things on the computer is an everyday occurrence. For example, I read an article about the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and the next day, my teachers gave us a pop quiz on that topic, and I scored @NUM1. If a computer can enable someone to achieve a @NUM1 on their test, imagine what else it could do for the world. It might even help save lives. Undoubtedly, a computer can be beneficial. In ways such as checking the score from yesterday's game, seeing what's happening in one's community, watching videos, listening to music, chatting with friends and relatives, obtaining information on places, and medical matters. Essentially, a computer can do everything from looking up game scores to saving a life. Evidently, the use of computers is the optimal decision.
97	97	1	1	Dear Local @CAPS1, I believe that computers confer substantial benefits upon society. The majority of our contemporary activities would be infeasible without computers. The most significant application of computers is communication. If one is in @LOCATION1 on a business trip but needs to send a letter to their company, one can send an email, which is considerably less costly than paying for a piece of @CAPS1. The concern of experts that people are not spending sufficient time with family and friends is valid. Many individuals communicate with family and friends via computers. I would scarcely have the opportunity to converse with my cousin if I couldn't access Facebook. I would have had to wait another month to learn that my other cousin was engaged if I didn't follow her on @CAPS2. If the concern pertains to face - to - face interaction, the computer offers a solution as well, a video messaging site named ooVoo. Another means by which computers facilitate communication is through the dissemination of information. Many facts necessary for school are scattered across hundreds of books. Over the @CAPS3, I have conducted research for a project and have been able to obtain facts from the @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 regarding crime statistics. Frequently, researching an animal leads one online because more modern books recommend good websites to visit for additional information. Without the @CAPS3, a simple research project could take months. Some scientists opine that people are spending excessive time on the computer. This view is both correct and incorrect. Sitting at a computer watching YouTube for hours is not necessarily the best course of action. However, the @CAPS4 has also designed a game that allows one to have fun while exercising. Computers are akin to chocolate. They can be beneficial, but an overabundance is detrimental.
98	98	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, in this modern digital era, computers are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Presently, one can perform almost any task with computers, from communicating with others to learning about distant locations. Nevertheless, it is not all as idyllic as it appears, as people's lives have been disrupted due to the internet. For this very reason, computers are not a boon to our society. With computers, we can acquire knowledge, engage in shopping, and connect with friends. For many, this negates the need to venture outdoors. One can lead an entire life indoors. This lack of physical activity can result in obesity. Moreover, leading such a secluded lifestyle can sever ties with friends and family. To utilize computers judiciously, we must learn to balance computer usage with an active lifestyle. The issue is that not many individuals do so. Additionally, excessive online activity is known to create a secondary life. On websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, one can have an entirely different online existence, with friends one has never met in person. Sometimes, people are even known to believe that their online life is superior and become entrapped in it. Take the @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 as an example. It is highly popular but also extremely addictive. Some individuals play until their entire lives revolve around the game. The same holds true for the @CAPS6 of @CAPS7. This obsession with online games or @CAPS8 is not the intended purpose of the internet. Furthermore, people's lives and reputations have been damaged by computers. Cyberbullying is spreading rapidly. It is anonymous and can be harmful to others' lives. Internet videos of people behaving foolishly persist indefinitely. There is a video of a college student playing with a golf ball retriever like a sword, known as the @CAPS9 kid. The video has been viewed over @NUM1 million times. The individual in the video was ridiculed for years, sued those who posted the video online, and was driven into depression. Additionally, people can have their identities and credit card information stolen through computers. Identity and credit card theft are becoming increasingly common. Even my father had his credit card account compromised last year. Although computers can be helpful, they can cause far more harm. In conclusion, computers are a detriment to society. They can harm people, cause addiction, and isolate one's life. Clearly, this does not constitute a positive contribution to society. Allowing people to use computers in this manner is not a good thing.
99	99	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1: Have you received a photo of a @NUM1 - year - old child in a state of undress? If so, this is referred to as sexting. It can be shared on a computer or any other device. People should curtail their computer usage as it can lead to adverse consequences such as teenage sexting, which is harmful to younger children, and the risk of teens interacting with strangers. Lexi @NUM1 states that she has received Facebook texts on her mobile phone from other teenage kids that are inappropriate. @PERCENT1 of the teenage population in @LOCATION1 have @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 chat. Any of these websites can transfer photos to their mobile devices. This situation has spiraled out of control, and whatever is posted on the computer remains there permanently. More children under the age of @NUM3 are now using computers. There are chat rooms where they can interact with others. For example, @PERSON1 is a children's game with a chat feature, allowing one to communicate with anyone. However, when creating a @PERSON1 account, a child must provide a parent's email address, and the parent is required to read the following terms to make a decision for their child. Unfortunately, most parents do not even read these terms. @PERCENT2 of these parents simply agree to the terms without reading them. @PERSON2 was followed home from soccer practice when a man approximately @NUM4"" tall and around the age of @NUM5 said, ""@PERSON2, come get some candy."" @PERSON2 asked, ""How do you know my name?"" The man replied, ""Because I play with you all the time."" @PERSON2 promptly ran home and informed his parents. @PERSON2 plays on @CAPS6, another interactive game, and disclosed to this stranger that @CAPS5 lives in @LOCATION2 field and attends @LOCATION2 @CAPS7. By providing strangers with personal information, they can track one down and discover the street where one resides. We must safeguard our children and limit their computer usage to prevent sexting, keep young children away from potential risks, and halt instances of kidnapping. Help @LOCATION1, @CAPS8 become a safe haven for our children."
100	100	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, are you aware of how much time you spend on the computer? Well, it's time to rise and venture outdoors. That is one of the reasons why I believe people spend excessive time on it. Another reason is that it can damage one's eyesight. It's a beautiful sunny day; don't squander your time on the computer! Go outside! All children, @CAPS1, are sitting in front of the computer all day without getting any exercise. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 children who sit on the computer all day gain at least @NUM3 pounds? @PERSON1 informed me of this. I believe him because it's true; kids don't get up. They're missing out on a lovely day. Would you want to miss a beautiful sunny day? My final reason is that kids' eyesight can deteriorate. Having them stare at a screen all day is harmful. @PERSON1 told me that if you're on the computer for @NUM4 consecutive hours, your eyesight can worsen. I recall a time when I was on the computer for @NUM4 1/@NUM4 hours, and my eyes ached every time I blinked. I understand that the computer is enjoyable for playing games and chatting with friends, but you should take a break and engage in something else. In conclusion, simply go outside and have fun! @CAPS1, do you want to waste a beautiful sunny day indoors, harming your eyes? I know I don't!
101	101	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever journeyed to a place, captured photographs, and uploaded them onto the computer? If so, you will recall the location you visited. At the very least, you've been to @ORGANIZATION1, or @LOCATION1, or some other place. There exist individuals who remain engrossed in the computer throughout the day. Instead of immersing themselves in nature and embracing the experiences that life presents, they spend their time on Facebook or YouTube. This deeply repels me, as there are numerous enjoyable, beautiful, and entertaining activities to engage in. In my opinion, I firmly believe that computers exert negative influences on people. People miss out on the pleasure of nature and the opportunity to interact with friends and family. Some individuals no longer engage in physical exercise, and it is disheartening to witness obese people merely sitting there, taking no action to improve their lives. First and foremost, I would like to discuss obesity. Are you aware that @PERCENT1 of children are obese at a young age? Computers supplant physical exercise for young boys and girls. They ought to venture outside and participate in sports such as basketball or soccer. Another issue pertains to those gaming websites. Children become so consumed by computer games that the world around them fades away. All they concern themselves with is winning the game. While playing these games, they might be munching on Doritos. Before long, they gain five pounds. Subsequently, they will regret not exercising and find themselves unable to move freely. Later in life, when circumstances take a turn for the worse, they will realize how many wonderful things they have missed. Then they will lament, ""What have I done with my life?"" My next point highlights that people are failing to appreciate nature. Have you ever taken a leisurely stroll in the park? I certainly have. Yet, people remain indoors all day, merely stealing a glance out of the window without considering going outside. Nature is resplendent, emits a pleasant fragrance, and can be invigorating at times. But no. People laze around all day. In front of the computer, achieving absolutely nothing. Why can't they step outside for a walk or a jog? People can observe animals like squirrels scurrying up trees. How adorable. Instead, they play a virtual game where they shoot squirrels with a paintball gun. So much is forfeited due to computers. As much as the neglect of nature upsets me, some people even abandon their own families just to watch a rerun of Family Guy on YouTube. What has our society come to? Some children even assault their parents when the parents turn off the computer. I would much rather relish a meal with my family, then sit back, relax, and engage in conversation. Additionally, some people sacrifice sleep because they claim to be ""doing something important,"" thereby missing a family trip or even school. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers are detrimental due to their association with obesity, the loss of nature appreciation, and the lack of quality time spent with family and friends."
102	102	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Experts need not be overly concerned about individuals who spend a certain amount of time on the computer. Perhaps these individuals are well - aware of their actions and have legitimate reasons to remain on computers for extended periods. They may also have a penchant for learning about subjects they never previously considered exploring. The majority of people make efforts to avoid being overweight. Experts should refrain from attempting to reduce the number of computer users. One reason is that computers facilitate communication among people. It can involve interactions with friends, family members, and more. Approximately @PERCENT1 of people engage in online chats with their families or friends. Online chatting can be particularly useful in emergency situations. For instance, if an emergency occurs, one can quickly inform someone and even coordinate with the police. Undoubtedly, online chatting is an excellent way to utilize the computer during one's time online. Another reason is that the computer serves as a vast repository of information. If one needs to conduct research for school, the computer can offer valuable assistance. This can have positive impacts on individuals, potentially transforming them into better - informed and more capable individuals. It is undeniable that the ability to search for any information is a remarkable way to make use of the computer. A third reason is that computer usage can enhance hand - eye coordination and provide individuals with the opportunity to learn about distant places and cultures. It allows people to explore topics they never dared to dream of learning about. There are countless people and places in the world waiting to be discovered, and it is astonishing that almost every famous person and location can be found on the internet. Utilizing the computer in this manner is yet another outstanding idea. These are all excellent ways to use the computer. Spending time on the computer is not a waste of time; rather, people can use their time wisely. Surprisingly, all these reasons demonstrate the benefits of using the computer. Therefore, there is no need to try to limit people's computer usage.
103	103	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever found yourself running late for a party only to suddenly realize that you lack the directions to the host's residence? Have you ever been tasked with writing a paper but had no access to books or encyclopedias? Or have you ever simply desired to reconnect with an old acquaintance? If you have answered affirmatively to at least one of these questions, it is highly likely that you have utilized a computer at some point in your life. Computers have positive effects as they can provide you with prompt and reliable information, and they can also be a source of entertainment. To commence, let us revisit the example mentioned earlier. Have you ever been rushing to a party and then realized that you do not have the directions? If so, there are two courses of action available to you. You can attempt to call the host, who may not answer as they are likely enjoying the party, or you can turn to the computer. By typing in the person's address, you will obtain the directions within seconds. Call me unconventional, but this method appears to be quicker, more efficient, and more reliable. My mother often advises me, ""When you encounter difficulties in finding information, turn to the computer,"" because she is aware that the internet contains all the information that can be found in books and much more. With just a single click, you can access it. Evidently, the computer has positive effects on you as it offers quick and reliable information. Moreover, computers have positive effects when it comes to having fun. For example, @CAPS5 is a platform popular among both teenagers and adults, primarily used for socializing with friends via the computer. If you are waiting for another date or simply curious about what your last friend has been up to, the best option would be to log on to @CAPS5 and inquire. A study by @ORGANIZATION1 reveals that in a family of five, four members use the internet to communicate and socialize with friends. Clearly, this is how computers exert a positive influence. In conclusion, whether you are at home on a rainy day, feeling bored, or you have procrastinated on a research paper until the last minute, a computer will be there to assist you. The positive effects of computers include their ability to provide quick and reliable information and their capacity to offer an enjoyable experience."
104	104	1	1	Dear The @CAPS1, There has been an ongoing debate regarding whether computers have a positive or negative impact on people. Some contend that computers have adverse effects, such as causing people to spend excessive time on them, leading to a lack of exercise, and reducing interaction with family and friends. However, I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people as they cultivate hand - eye coordination, enable individuals to learn about foreign places, and facilitate online communication. In conclusion, computers indeed have a positive effect on people. Are you aware that hand - eye coordination can be extremely useful? It is true because in times of distress, when the phone is out of order and you do not have a cellphone, you can send an emergency email to a friend, asking them to call for help. Thanks to hand - eye coordination, you can type without having to look down at the keyboard. Additionally, if you are a college student with an important essay due the next day, hand - eye coordination can significantly aid you in taking notes without constantly referring back to the writing paper. Finally, hand - eye coordination can be beneficial if you plan to join the army. If you detect a threat, you can quickly aim and shoot without having to fumble with the gun after the threat has attacked. In summary, computers help develop hand - eye coordination. Have you ever yearned to visit foreign destinations? With computers, you can fulfill this desire. You can simply search for a place and explore what it has to offer. Furthermore, if you wish to learn a foreign language, all you need to do is type in the language along with your question and conduct a search. It is so straightforward that even a child could do it. Finally, if you want to learn how to cook like the people in foreign countries, just type in the type of food or its name and search. To sum up, computers allow people to learn about foreign places. Have you ever felt the urge to talk to someone? I certainly have. This is where computers come in handy. You can communicate with people online by simply entering the person's email address and typing your message. Moreover, you do not have to spend money on paper and envelopes. Additionally, having an email account is free, enabling you to communicate as much as you like. In conclusion, computers assist people in communicating online. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. They help people develop hand - eye coordination, learn about new places, and communicate with others.
105	105	1	1	"Computers are utilized globally on a daily basis, and in most cases, they are employed for valid reasons. Computers are beneficial as they make it possible to access all the information you need, such as for planning a trip. If you wish to visit a nearby yet upscale restaurant, you can use a computer to determine the distance. Computers also facilitate communication with friends you haven't seen in years and serve as an excellent means to meet new people. Suppose you are extremely stressed at work or school and forget your book; you can usually access the necessary materials on the computer and complete your tasks there. Firstly, computers are invaluable for travel and sightseeing. When you embark on a journey, don't you want to be well - informed? One of the most crucial details you seek is the cost, and the computer can often provide you with an almost exact price for everything. This is extremely helpful when traveling around the world. Additionally, when you are sightseeing, you typically want to find the most amazing or romantic spots at your destination. If you type in ""the most romantic spot in Somers,"" the computer should present you with a plethora of options. So, instead of driving miles to obtain a map or brochure, use your computer and print one out. Secondly, if there is a friend you haven't seen in a long time and you wish to communicate, you can turn to the computer. The computer offers numerous benefits; it can even inform you of your friend's whereabouts, allowing you to pay them a surprise visit. While using the computer, you can also meet new friends, engage in conversations with them, and perhaps even meet them in person someday. If you and your new friend get along well, you might become best friends. Therefore, if you haven't seen or spoken to someone you know in a while, use the computer to have a chat. Thirdly, imagine your teacher or boss has scolded you and no one has been kind to you all day, and you forget your homework book or paperwork. Where do you turn? The computer. It can provide you with most of the paperwork or workbooks you need to complete your tasks. If you forget your homework book, you don't want to receive a poor grade. So, you can go to your computer for assistance. Similarly, if you forget your paperwork and failing to finish a work project tonight could result in your dismissal, you can access the work on the computer and complete it, thereby saving your job. This is why computers are so helpful in our lives. In conclusion, computers are essential in our lives. They assist us with vacation planning, enable us to communicate with old friends we haven't seen in ages, and help us with schoolwork and job - related tasks. At least @PERCENT1 of our population uses computers every day, and without them, our society would face significant challenges. Therefore, we should carefully consider the role of computers and whether their use will benefit our society or lead to its decline."
106	106	1	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am firmly convinced that computers are advantageous to contemporary society. Not only do computers facilitate our connection with individuals, but also contemplate their remarkable efficiency. Moreover, one cannot overlook the fact that computers offer an abundance of entertainment. Therefore, before proclaiming, ""Computers are ruining our society,"" kindly consider my rationale for why computers are indispensable. What initially comes to mind when you hear the term 'computers'? Many individuals think of chatrooms and @CAPS2's. These are two instances of how a computer can unite people. Suppose you are conducting a report on life in @LOCATION1. However, all you can locate are those generic articles in antiquated books. A straightforward solution is to engage in an online conversation with an actual individual residing in @LOCATION1. Computers can even assist in connecting family members who live at great distances from one another. I know that I would be inundated with joy if an aunt or uncle contacted me via '@CAPS3' or email. In addition to facilitating human connection, computers are highly efficient. As students progress, homework is treated with greater seriousness. For example, one of my friends submitted an essay, but our teacher did not accept it. Her penmanship was illegible. Typing homework is an effortless alternative to submitting messy, unsophisticated work. The efficiency of a computer is also evident when attempting to accomplish seemingly simple tasks. Just envision how frequently you would become lost without digital directions. Or how many mistakes you would make if you did not print out a recipe for dinner. Most importantly, computers serve as the virtual portal to various forms of entertainment. Whether you enjoy playing computer games or even if seeking the best deal is your preference; a computer will cater to your needs. There are thousands of websites to explore and even more games awaiting to be played. A computer is anyone's ticket to leisure and enjoyment. So, you must make the decision. Will computers benefit society, or will they yield catastrophic consequences? I urge you to remember; computers are a means of connecting with people, and they are efficient. Above all, recall how much you can achieve with a computer."
107	107	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, have you ever experienced a computer crash when you needed to prepare a presentation? If so, it likely meant that you had to resort to the traditional method of presenting on paper. Recently, there has been an ongoing debate among experts regarding computers. Some contend that they enhance the efficiency of our lives, while others believe that they cause us to spend excessive time indoors rather than outdoors. I firmly believe that computers simplify our lives and that technological advancements have a positive impact on individuals. I hold this view because computers impart skills, keep us informed about global events, are efficient for work, and contribute to environmental conservation, and enable people to maintain contact. Computers have a positive influence on people as they facilitate family communication. Emails are a prime example of this. Instead of sending a physical letter, you can transmit it electronically. The recipient receives it more promptly and can respond in a more timely manner. Additionally, social networking sites aid families in staying connected. Facebook is one such example. You can monitor a person's activities and engage in conversation with them using Facebook chat. I can relate to this. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, so I do not see him frequently. Through Facebook, we can communicate and update each other on our lives. Moreover, you can view pictures of your family. Many families have accounts on photo - sharing sites. This allows them to view pictures of recent vacations or sporting events. They can leave comments, and every family member can observe how everyone has changed throughout the year. This is how computers enable people to stay in touch. Another reason why computers have a positive impact on people is that they teach skills and keep us informed. Computers enhance hand - eye coordination. When typing on a keyboard, you must know the location of each letter. This enables you to focus on the screen to identify errors. Hand - eye coordination is a valuable skill for everyone. Computers also keep us updated on world news. Many internet homepages have built - in news engines. These news engines keep people informed about major news events. For instance, the war in @LOCATION5, or more recently, the @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION4 earthquakes. Without the internet, we would be significantly behind on important global news updates. My final reason for the positive impact of computers on people is that they are efficient for work and environmentally friendly. Computers contribute to environmental conservation as they reduce paper consumption. Throughout the year, @CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper to write letters. With computers, this number decreases to the thousands. Why, you may ask? Emails do not require paper. They are electronic, which means no paper waste. They are also environmentally sustainable as newspaper companies are going out of business. Due to online newspapers, print news is becoming increasingly unpopular. Computers are efficient for work because creating presentations is incredibly easy. There are numerous programs available, allowing a large - scale presentation to be prepared in minutes. This is why computers simplify work while also benefiting the environment. As can be seen, computers have numerous positive effects on people. They enable family members to stay connected, teach skills, and are efficient for work while being environmentally friendly. This is why I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Let me pose this question to you again. @CAPS1, has your computer ever crashed when you needed to complete a significant project? Now you understand that computers make life more efficient. What would you do without them? So, it is now your turn. Go out and purchase a computer, and you will be grateful that you did.
108	108	1	1	"I noticed in one of the newspapers I received in the mail that there was an opportunity for people to express their opinions on children's computer usage overnight. I seized the opportunity to write this letter. Numerous individuals rely on computers for various purposes. These include: homework assignments such as essays, situations where family members are deployed to war and cannot use cell phones, and online job applications. To begin with, children have homework assignments, correct? Most of the time, people are required to write essays. I often ask my mother if I can write an essay for school, and she says, ""Why don't you stay after school to do it?"" @CAPS1 have busy lives and cannot stay after school. Additionally, school computers restrict access to most websites, unlike home computers. This is one of the primary reasons why children frequently use computers. Next, some family members are deployed to war. Typically, for security and privacy reasons, soldiers are not permitted to carry cell phones, but they can use computers for other purposes. Usually, family members know that you have a computer and want to contact you to reassure you that they are safe, so you do not have to worry for two years. Therefore, from the base where they are stationed, you can communicate with them via video mail. I have an @CAPS2 who was deployed to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2. We sometimes chat with him when he was in @LOCATION1. Lastly, job applications. Many people are home - bound but in need of employment. Numerous @CAPS3 commercials advertise online job opportunities. This is beneficial for all types of people, including the home - bound, the elderly, etc. However, it is particularly advantageous because it sometimes allows you to establish your own business and still earn a good income. In conclusion, some people do not use the internet merely for the sake of it; they are actually engaged in meaningful activities such as communicating with loved ones they will not see for an extended period or completing school assignments. Moreover, if people do not know others well, how can they determine if they are active or not? Both children and adults should still be able to use computers whenever they desire."
109	109	1	1	Dear editor, my name is @PERSON1, and I am of the opinion that computers are beneficial to the world and to people as well. I assert this because a multitude of individuals can communicate with family and friends across long distances. Additionally, computers can impart a wealth of knowledge. Finally, they enhance social interaction. In my firm conviction, computers are advantageous for the world. Firstly, numerous people can engage in long - distance communication with family and friends. Webcams enable you to chat and visually connect with the person. Moreover, @CAPS2 is another platform where you can interact with friends. You can share pictures and videos of yourself. Although you can achieve similar communication via phone, phone plans incur costs. In contrast, using a computer for such communication is entirely free. Secondly, computers educate users on skills that are valuable later in life and keep them informed. Programmers have developed computer programs that are both educational and engaging. There are programs like 'Type to Learn' or 'Type for Fun' that teach typing skills. There are also programs designed to improve reading abilities. These are highly beneficial for children as they need to acquire these skills regardless. Finally, computers foster social interaction. This is because platforms like @CAPS2 keep you informed about school and out - of - school events. You can communicate with people on @CAPS2 or exchange emails to have in - depth conversations. You can also meet new individuals from different locations and build positive relationships with them. You get to know your friends and understand who they are without having to make guesses. Therefore, this is why I believe that owning a computer is a prudent decision. You can communicate with people over long distances, learn life - essential skills, and enhance your social life. In my strong opinion, it is a great idea to have a computer.
110	110	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers are beneficial to society as they enable us to access online newspapers, communicate with friends and family via email, and offer a wide range of entertainment options such as playing games, watching videos, or movies. Staying informed about the latest news is of utmost importance. While traditional newspapers have their merits, they come at a cost. In contrast, online newspapers provide the latest news free of charge. This not only helps save money but also contributes to environmental conservation by reducing paper consumption. Here's another way computers help save trees. Email is an excellent means of communicating with individuals at a distance, and it is significantly faster than traditional mail. Email is also useful for sharing links to interesting websites, sending funny pictures, videos, or important notices. Thus, computers can serve as both a newspaper and an efficient communication tool. Moreover, computers are valuable for entertainment purposes. They are among the most popular sources of entertainment. Computers allow users to visit gaming websites, watch videos or movies, or play online games, including regular @CAPS1 games. I know that whenever I am bored, I turn to my computer and can always find something engaging to do online or a movie to watch. Therefore, computers are highly popular and are beneficial in multiple areas, including news dissemination, communication, and entertainment. People should focus on the positive aspects of computers, and they will recognize how remarkable they are.
111	111	1	1	"Dear @PERSON1, Contemporary wisdom encourages children to engage in outdoor activities rather than passively sitting in front of a computer. Computers often foster unwholesome habits. I refrain from using the computer unless it is essential for academic purposes or homework. Consider the adverse effects, such as inadequate physical activity and diminished interaction with friends and family. While the internet can be a source for finding diets and exercise plans, simply visiting a local gym to burn calories would suffice! The internet and computers are designed to captivate users, luring them into various websites and distractions. It is more effective to visit a local @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 for physical exercise. I am a member of a swim team affiliated with a @ORGANIZATION2. I prefer swimming to using the computer as it fulfills my need for physical activity. I shed @NUM1 pounds within a month of swimming. I also use the treadmill to alleviate stress or anger. Gyms are far superior to computers. I am certain that most of us have encountered inappropriate content on the computer. Although computers create employment opportunities, there is no justification for posting content that may hurt others' feelings. Recently, I came across a particularly cruel comment that made me empathize with the victim. I commend YouTube for its efforts to curtail inappropriate content. Once information is shared on the internet, it is irretrievable. While computers facilitate communication with friends, it is preferable to engage in face - to - face interaction or visit in person. As my @CAPS2 often remarks, ""Interact more; it builds character!"" Whenever possible, I choose to interact with my friends in person rather than relying on the computer. Nowadays, children can be inadvertently unkind. Excessive computer use can lead to social isolation from family. Since computers are highly engaging, users may become oblivious to their surroundings. @PERCENT1 of children neglect their homework due to computer use. Thank you for your time. I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact, and everyone would be happier without excessive computer use. They contribute to the nation's obesity rate, enable cyberbullying and the spread of inappropriate content, and isolate users from the real world. ( @CAPS5.S warns that one day, computers may dominate the world, and you will regret not heeding my advice.)"
112	112	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 paper, I am @PERSON1, and I am writing this letter to present an opposing view on the computer issue. While it is true that people may spend more time on computers than engaging in physical exercise, computers also offer opportunities for social interaction in chat rooms. Moreover, laptops allow users to access the digital world outdoors. Let me begin with the aspect of socialization. Some experts claim that people are spending less time with friends and family in person due to computer use. However, this does not necessarily mean that they are not being social. Platforms such as Facebook, @CAPS3, and chat rooms provide avenues for virtual communication. Users can maintain social connections verbally, even if not physically present. Regarding the claim that people are not enjoying the outdoors, this argument overlooks the fact that if this were the case, a significant portion of the population would exhibit signs of limited outdoor exposure. Additionally, laptops enable users to combine the pleasures of the outdoors with digital access. One can enjoy a sunny day outside, have some fruit, and relax while using a laptop until the battery runs out. Then, simply plug it in and continue to unwind. Computers also stimulate the imagination. Certain computer games encourage players to think creatively, envisioning ways to enhance the gaming experience. Simulators allow users to design and control virtual elements, which can be relevant to potential career interests. For me, computer games have enhanced my drawing skills. It is important to note that human behavior is not fixed. People have the ability to step away from the computer, engage in outdoor activities, and interact socially. As demonstrated, most physical activities can find a digital equivalent on the computer.
113	113	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers exert a positive influence on individuals and serve as valuable educational tools. I firmly believe that computers are indispensable in people's lives. They enable us to acquire knowledge about the world and stay informed about current events. Additionally, they facilitate communication with friends and family and assist students with their academic work. Firstly, computers provide comprehensive information about the world and various countries. They offer insights into ongoing wars, the actions of political leaders, and local news, including weather forecasts, traffic reports, and crime updates. Moreover, they provide access to stock market information, which is crucial for many investors. Secondly, computers offer multiple means of communication. Platforms such as AIM, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 allow people to interact with one another. Students can use computers to email teachers the necessary information by a specific deadline if they forget to submit something at school. They can also inquire about homework assignments. Many individuals reconnect with old friends through computers, which can bring joy and a sense of connection. Lastly, computers are invaluable resources for students. When students need information for projects or homework, computers offer a vast repository of knowledge. They provide answers to questions, images, and details about people, places, and events. They also offer the location and dates of relevant events. In conclusion, computers are an integral part of everyone's life. They enable us to learn about global events, communicate with loved ones, and support students' education. Even if people are not engaging in physical exercise, they are expanding their knowledge through computer - based research. One can still enjoy nature and spend time with family and friends through virtual communication. Computers are one of the greatest inventions, having a profound positive impact on people.
114	114	1	1	"Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1! Are computers not simply wonderful? They offer multiple benefits: expanding knowledge, providing entertainment through games, and facilitating communication with friends. I hope you will enjoy my essay on the computer world. Have you ever struggled to find information in a library? Forget about library cards; simply access the computer's @CAPS2. There, you can find any information you seek. Once, I was working on a project about my favorite rocker, @ORGANIZATION1. My mother suggested checking the library for a book, but I was unable to find one. Instead, I turned to the @CAPS2 on my computer, and to my delight, I found all the information I needed, which helped me excel in my project. The computer is a vast source of knowledge, allowing us to learn about global events, as well as the minutiae of the natural world, from insects to large plants. Now, let me share some of the games you can play on the computer. One of my favorite games, which is also @CAPS4's favorite, is ""Left @NUM1 Dead @NUM2."" If you have never played this game, you might think it is extremely difficult and scary, and it can be initially challenging and a bit intimidating, but it is also highly enjoyable. Another game I like is an online game called ""@PERSON1."" While it is fun, it can be time - consuming, which may dampen the excitement. For instance, as a level @NUM3 mage, I can defeat level @NUM4 @CAPS7 because I can utilize high - level spells. There are numerous activities to engage in on a computer. You can battle zombies, complete quests, or simply have fun at your own pace. Finally, I want to discuss how the @CAPS2 enables communication with friends. I moved to a new location, which made it difficult to meet my friends in person. However, I obtained their @CAPS9 - mail addresses, and now I can communicate with them and even see them via webcam. Another advantage of using the @CAPS10 or computer is the ability to stay in touch with family members who have joined the @ORGANIZATION2. My uncle is about to leave for the @ORGANIZATION2, and I will be able to see him on the webcam or chat with him. These are the reasons why having a computer is beneficial. It allows for knowledge acquisition, gaming entertainment, and communication with friends and family."
115	115	1	1	@CAPS1 judgment is derived from experience, and experience often results from poor judgment, as quoted from my uncle's father. Since computers have only been accessible to the public for a relatively short period, the general public has limited experience with them. Consequently, the public lacks @CAPS1 judgment when using computers, and the negative consequences are becoming increasingly apparent. Computers have caused harm to individuals. Firstly, computers can pose a @CAPS2 problem for users. In studies conducted in @LOCATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS3 who spend @NUM3 or more hours in front of the computer are wearing glasses due to the detrimental @CAPS2 effects of the screen on their eyes. Moreover, computer games are designed to be addictive, leading @CAPS3 to remain seated in front of the computer instead of engaging in physical exercise. This could be one of the primary causes of obesity in @LOCATION2. My younger brother was once addicted to a flying game. He spent hours in front of the computer every day and started to gain weight. As soon as he stopped playing the game and began spending more time outdoors, he immediately started to lose weight. Therefore, people should increase their physical activity instead of remaining sedentary in front of the computer. Secondly, computers have a negative impact on the environment. Computers require electricity to operate, and this electricity is primarily generated by power plants. Over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's power plants rely on coal, petroleum, or natural gas. When people turn on their computers out of boredom, they waste electricity that is not necessary. Additionally, scientists suspect that human activities, including the operation of power plants, are major contributors to global warming. It is well - known that power plants burn fossil fuels to generate electricity, establishing a clear link between computer use and global warming. Furthermore, power plants release pollutants into the atmosphere, which can lead to acid rain. Finally, excessive computer use affects people's practical skills. In a school survey, @CAPS3 who used their computers for more than @NUM4 hours per day were unaware of basic skills such as cooking or lighting a match. There is an obvious connection between the two, as most people rely on microwaves to quickly return to computer use. In normal circumstances, parents may light matches for fires or candles. However, in the event of a natural disaster in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4, how will @CAPS3 be able to survive? Without access to microwaves, the only means of cooking would be through fire. Moreover, without knowing how to light a match, @CAPS3 would be unable to start a fire. Clearly, excessive computer use can have severe consequences during natural disasters, even for adults. Therefore, we must curtail our computer use. Do you want @LOCATION2 to be associated with @CAPS5 and @CAPS6? Should our environment, our only home, suffer due to the boredom of a few individuals? How will we cope with a major natural disaster? In conclusion, people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers, and this trend must be reversed. People are becoming @CAPS6, damaging the environment, and losing essential life skills. We must unite and cooperate to ensure people's well - being, preserve our life skills, and most importantly, protect our beautiful @LOCATION5.
116	116	1	1	I concur with the newspaper's stance; individuals are allocating an excessive amount of time to computers and neglecting physical exercise. It is widely recognized that computers possess addictive qualities. Nevertheless, people ought to venture outdoors more frequently. Regrettably, individuals exacerbate this addiction by devising elements such as interminable games, which divert people from their lives, families, work, and exercise.
117	117	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper: Do you believe that computers are advantageous for everyone? I firmly contend that computers rank among the most remarkable inventions of all time. Their true merit lies in the vast reservoir of knowledge they offer. One can acquire hand - eye coordination, gain insights into distant locales, and engage in online conversations with others. Undoubtedly, continue reading to comprehend why computers hold immense significance for all of us. Many individuals perceive computers as detrimental to mental well - being, yet this is a fallacy. When using computers, one can enhance hand - eye coordination. Over time, one can develop proficient and rapid typing skills and improve eyesight by reviewing written work or notes for a paper. Moreover, one can unwind, have fun, and compose papers for reports. Assuredly, read on to discover the additional capabilities of computers. There exist numerous far - flung places with their own distinctive allures. The internet provides a comprehensive list of vacation destinations that captivate one's interest. It offers detailed information about the reasons to visit and reasonable pricing. Consider this: wouldn't it be exhilarating to visit a remarkable place like @LOCATION1? Without a doubt, keep reading. Have you ever yearned to play outside but were thwarted by rain or the absence of friends? Well, on the computer, you can communicate with friends online. You can inquire about their well - being and still enjoy a pleasant time. Additionally, you can even forge new friendships. A multitude of children and teenagers frequent the internet to make new acquaintances. Undoubtedly, you should acknowledge that computers are truly remarkable. I firmly believe that computers are both unique and indispensable. This is precisely why so many individuals, from children to adults, rely heavily on them. They utilize computers to enhance hand - eye coordination, explore distant places, and interact with others. Thank you for perusing my article, local newspaper.
118	118	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, as our technology progresses, so does the quality of our lives. Computers present an ideal avenue to enhance our lifestyle in ways that are advantageous to both us and future generations. The utilization of computers, and the internet alone, enables us to gain insights into the way of life in other regions of @LOCATION4, communicate with distant individuals, and express our innermost thoughts. Computers pave the way for a promising future. Firstly, a significant portion of the world's population, approximately @PERCENT1, lead sedentary lives within local town or city settings. This is precisely where computers prove invaluable, as they offer a means to explore other parts of the globe. Such exploration can cultivate an interest in diverse cultures and shape our perspectives as we uncover new aspects of other places. Subsequently, we can adopt a broader perspective when examining various topics. Through this process, we establish connections with alternative ways of life. As the philosopher and poet @PERSON1 astutely stated, ""We learn about ourselves through the discovery of others."" Moreover, another particularly useful feature of the internet accessible via computers is the ability to communicate with individuals residing in remote locations when physical visits are unfeasible. A @LOCATION2 study revealed that approximately @PERCENT2 of computer usage is dedicated to communication on platforms like Facebook or @CAPS9. A scientist from @LOCATION3, @PERSON3, posits that humans inherently relish communication as it fosters a sense of unity. This explains why numerous companies are recognizing the increasing popularity of platforms such as @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS6, and @ORGANIZATION1. And indeed, it is true. Engaging in conversations, chatting, or sending emails to others is a delightful experience. Without computers, such interactions would be unattainable. Lastly, computers afford us the opportunity to express our ideas like never before. In the past, fame was primarily associated with @LOCATION1, but now, one can achieve notoriety on @CAPS8 or @CAPS9. Just ask @PERSON2, whose voice resonated and caught the attention of a major record company. Now, his name is widely recognized, and his music is enjoyed by many. Similar to @PERSON2, those with a penchant for words can express themselves through blogging. As @PERSON4 stated in Computer Weekly, ""Approximately half of computer usage involves expressing opinions through blogging."" Like @PERSON2, we can persuade others to share our viewpoints and discover new things. Self - expression is of utmost importance to society, which is why computers wield such a profound influence on people. Evidently, computers exert a positive impact on both individuals and society. They enable us to learn about distant places, communicate with others, and inspire the world with our ideas. Welcome to the future."
119	119	1	1	"Dear People of @LOCATION2, how many hours per day do you dedicate to physical activity? Now, answer me this: how much time do you spend on your computer? An excessive number of individuals today are sedentary in front of computers, laptops, and the like, while insufficient numbers are lacing up their shoes for a jog. Computers are undermining us; they impede our social skills, compromise our health, and induce laziness. They are detrimental to our society. To begin with, millions of people register for @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and other similar websites to reconnect with others. Have you considered the implications? Now, there is no longer a necessity to drive to visit someone. There is neither a need nor a desire to interact with others in person. Suppose there is a woman sitting on her couch. Suddenly, the thought of her friend @PERSON1 lights up her face. She rises to start the car, but her eye catches the computer. She hesitates, torn between visiting her friend and engaging in an online chat. Yielding to laziness, she sits back down. Do you truly wish this to happen to everyone? Alas, it already has. Moving on, I would like to discuss our health. As most of us are aware, fresh air is beneficial. Imagine strolling along a forest trail. The crisp, cool air caresses your skin, and inhaling it brings a smile to your face. Your entire body is invigorated by the trek. With numerous such days ahead, you eagerly anticipate them. Now, envision sitting in front of a computer in a hot, stuffy room. Your back aches from prolonged sitting. You suspect you are catching a cold, and you have a migraine. You would like to leave, but there is another app request. You scarcely feel like returning to the real world. Which scenario do you prefer? Beyond all this, there is the issue of exercise. I mean, when was the last time you went for a bike ride? You are undoubtedly aware that exercise is beneficial for your body, yet you are too engrossed in the computer. I think it is safe to say that half of @LOCATION1 would rather update their @CAPS4 than get up and move. It is crucial for our health to be active. In conclusion, many of us are deliberating whether to spend more time on the computer. Well, here is your answer: ""No."" Insufficient people are engaging in social interactions these days. They are spending their prime years cooped up indoors, and most importantly, they are gaining weight. Computers are taking over our lives. It is now or never; make the change to a better and more fulfilling lifestyle. Please, @LOCATION1, turn off the computer."
120	120	1	1	Dear @CAPS1: The impact that computers have on me is that they impart hand - eye coordination skills. I glean knowledge from computers, and using them is an enjoyable experience. However, these are merely my personal viewpoints. Well, I shall proceed to elaborate on them. The advantage of computers lies in their ability to teach hand - eye coordination, which enhances visual perception. Additionally, it trains the hands to catch objects and react swiftly. For instance, I struggled with catching in baseball while simultaneously learning to use the computer. As I developed proficient typing skills, my hands became more responsive when fielding grounders and pop - flies. I was overjoyed to have learned how to use the computer and type. Undoubtedly, computers are exceptional as they allow for research and the discovery of important facts. Every time one conducts research, one acquires new knowledge. I must admit that I am particularly fond of computers because they assist me in uncovering crucial details about the subject of my project. Indeed, computers are incredibly entertaining as one can access various websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I visit myspace to converse with friends and make new acquaintances. This is what I cherish about myspace: the opportunity to meet new people and forge friendships. I frequent youtube to listen to music, watch music videos, and skateboard videos as I am an avid skater. I visit funnyjunk.com to play games as it offers a plethora of engaging options. My favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog. In conclusion, these are my opinions and the reasons that support the positive effects of computers. I invite you to contemplate the impact of computers and your own opinions and compare them with mine. However, the decision is entirely yours.
121	121	1	1	Do you contemplate whether computers are advantageous? You ought to concur, as they are the most beneficial entity in the market. Moreover, if several family members reside at a distance, you can instant - message, use Facebook, or even send emails to them. For teenagers or children, the chief allure is undoubtedly the entertainment. With a mere click of the mouse, you can watch your favorite shows or play engaging games. The computer is an extremely useful tool. If you have poor penmanship and a report is due, you can type it up on your computer, and your teacher will assume you spent the entire night on it. In reality, it was effortless, and you will also secure a better grade. If a large family trip is approaching, you can go online to streamline the planning process and at a lower cost. Additionally, for shopping, when it's someone's birthday, you can acquire gifts at a very low price, even with a discount! If your family lives far away and you don't get to see them often, the internet is the ideal place. You can communicate with them via instant messaging or Facebook. You can video - call them, and it will be as if they are right in the house with you. If you're on vacation, you can send them photos and maps of where you're going, along with information about the places. Entertainment is a teenager's preference. If you miss your favorite show, you can go to a streaming platform and watch it for free! YouTube is where you can find something humorous, exciting, or even rather distasteful. If someone like a well - known figure performs an amazing trick and you miss it, look it up. There are two types of games: you can play online games on platforms like AddictingGames.com or play multiplayer games online with friends. Now you understand why the internet is remarkable. It offers games, keeps you close to your family, and even provides assistance. So, it's your decision to conclude whether the internet is beneficial.
122	122	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, a significant percentage of the population in town utilizes the computer for at least five hours daily. People are expending an excessive amount of time on computers without reaping substantial benefits. Computers exert an impact on individuals, yet it is a negative one. People become addicted and distracted, rendering them unable to complete their work. Numerous inappropriate materials are present on computers, which neither children nor adults should encounter. Lastly, individuals who stare at a computer screen throughout the day are at risk of brain damage. The effects of computers can be highly detrimental and offer no advantages whatsoever. With children at school and adults at work, there is typically a considerable amount of work to be accomplished. However, computers often impede individuals from fulfilling their tasks. The other day in class, the teacher was collecting homework, but a certain number out of the total kids in the class did not have their assignments. When the teacher inquired about the reason, the kids stated that they were on the computer and forgot about the homework. When children and adults fail to complete their work, grades may decline, or people may face termination. The impact is extremely harmful, and all of this transpired solely due to the addiction and distraction caused by computers. Since some internet sources are highly social and not all individuals are kind, malicious and inappropriate articles and language may be encountered. Many children are unfamiliar with a large number of offensive words, and surely no one desires them to be exposed to such language. So, why allow them to access the computer and read about these unwholesome things? Adults are more aware of the harmful language, but why encourage them to write such things or comment in a mean - spirited manner? If adults and children are not exposed to these improper uses of language, our world could easily consist of more amiable and kind - hearted individuals. Studies indicate that if a person stares at a computer screen for at least three hours a day, within approximately two weeks, the person's brain could be damaged. The computer screen interacts with the human brain in some way, and prolonged exposure can permanently harm the brain. A student from an organization, who specializes in computer mechanics, stated, ""Limit the use of computers to only what is necessary to help prevent brain damage. The components of the computer screen are not conducive to your health!"" Who would want to have a damaged brain? Undoubtedly, this effect can be extremely serious. Therefore, in conclusion, people should recognize that computers are not beneficial. Computers do affect people, but not in a desirable way. Addiction and distraction from the computer can lead to the neglect of important work. Children and adults do not need to learn or be influenced by inappropriate language on the computer. Brain damage can be a severe problem caused by something as simple as staring at a computer screen. Take measures to prevent all these negative effects by restricting your computer usage. It is quite straightforward to avoid these negative impacts, but the choice lies with you."
123	123	1	1	Everywhere one looks, individuals are employing computers. Virtually everyone possesses one. While some assert that computers are detrimental, they actually confer substantial benefits upon society. Computers are utilized for research, social interaction, and a significant portion of our official work is carried out on them. One of the primary functions of computers is to provide research information. If one wishes to discover anything, the internet is the place to turn. It is an efficient means of studying or obtaining information for educational purposes. Prior to the advent of the internet and computers, it would take weeks to amass sufficient information for a paper or business task. This was because all information was sourced from books. Books did not always contain the exact information one required; one had to make do with what was written. Thanks to search engines and websites, one can input whatever one wishes to look up. It is far more convenient to log onto a computer and type in a question than to scour an entire book for an answer. Computers are the optimal method for researching a topic. Computers also serve as a medium for socialization. One can engage in conversation with almost anyone on the internet. Social interaction is one of the most crucial aspects of life. Scientific research has demonstrated that sociable individuals tend to live longer than those who are socially isolated. Phone calls only offer audio, which fails to provide the same experience as video chat. Video chat enables one to show someone a picture or an expression. Computers allow one to see individuals who would otherwise be out of sight. For instance, if one has a relative living at a great distance, video chat makes it possible to see them, highlighting that socializing through computers is one of the best ways to communicate with others. Our official operations are predominantly reliant on computers. Without them, it would be extremely challenging to detect an impending attack or threat. The official sector uses computers to store legal files, court cases, laws, etc. It is much easier to transfer files digitally than to send a physical copy. The retail market also depends on computers. They are necessary to assess financial performance. Computers are indispensable to our official functions and the economy. Although some experts claim that computers offer no benefits, they actually contribute significantly to our society. They facilitate research, social interaction, and support our official operations and the economy. Computers are essential to our way of life.
124	124	1	1	I opine that computers are highly useful as they can be accessed by anyone at any time. The rationale behind my belief is that they enable individuals to contact acquaintances and engage in conversations whenever they desire. Another advantage is that computers offer a plethora of entertainment options, such as playing games, searching for information, or conducting in - depth research on topics of interest. Moreover, computers are invaluable for professional and academic purposes. For example, in the workplace, they streamline tasks, and for students, they are essential for typing reports and projects and for storing private data. Computers can be a boon to those who genuinely need them for work or study, and they can also serve as a source of amusement when one has leisure time. I find computers truly remarkable as anyone can create their own website and develop unique content. A large number of people use the internet to open accounts on various platforms, such as social media sites, e - commerce platforms, or online forums. These individuals utilize computers in a constructive manner, leveraging them for their intended purposes. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are extremely helpful to those who enjoy exploring topics of curiosity or who have legitimate needs for their use.
125	125	1	1	Computers do not have a negative influence on kids. We simply adore using them because they offer assistance. This should convince the readers of the local newspaper, as we need to be able to communicate, write essays, and complete social studies or science homework. My stance is that we should be allowed to use computers. We are not causing any trouble, so you can just leave us be and let us attend to our tasks. Computers provide us with the information we need for our studies and guide us on what to do and where to find the necessary resources. You people can simply refrain from interfering because computers are not addictive to me or anyone else. Even if they were, does it truly matter? A computer is a device that provides us with what we require and the information we seek. It performs useful functions for us. The computer is an astonishing invention.
126	126	1	1	Esteemed @ORGANIZATION1, I am deeply concerned about the growing issue of people excessively using computers while neglecting physical exercise. This trend is extremely detrimental, and we must raise awareness about the potential consequences of a sedentary lifestyle. My first contention against the notion that computers are beneficial to people is that they significantly impair health. Prolonged computer use can lead to weight gain, heart - related problems, and in severe cases, even fatal outcomes. Another reason I consider computers to be a liability is their profound impact on the economy. Computers consume large amounts of electricity, affecting the power supply across all states. Moreover, they disrupt the job market. People become so addicted to computers that they lose the motivation to seek employment, instead choosing to engage in activities like gambling or online shopping. The final reason for my stance is the prevalence of illegal activities on computers. There are numerous cyber predators who target children, often resulting in abductions. Additionally, there are malicious websites and pop - ups that can lead to legal trouble. Children, lacking the necessary judgment, may click on these, causing long - term psychological trauma. @NUM1, I earnestly hope you will take this letter into account and take appropriate action, as these computers pose a threat to my health, yours, and that of our children. This is the reason for my writing this letter. If you concur with my views, I express my gratitude.
127	127	1	1	Computers have the potential to influence individuals' personalities and their social interactions. Why squander your valuable life sitting in front of a computer all day when you could engage in physical exercise, such as visiting your local gym? Computers serve as a hindrance to your social life, which is why they should be reserved for emergencies. Instead, you should allocate more time to your cherished family and friends. Additionally, you can immerse yourself in your surroundings and develop an appreciation for life and nature. Computers are primarily designed for business purposes, not for people to engage in idle activities. Exercise is of utmost importance as it promotes the growth and well - being of the human body. If you remain seated in front of a computer all day, your body will gradually deteriorate due to lack of proper exercise. Sports can be equally enjoyable and contribute to the development of the human body, providing the necessary physical activity. They also enhance hand - eye coordination, similar to some computer - related activities. In conclusion, exercise offers all the benefits that computers do, while also having a more positive impact on citizens. Family is a precious aspect of life, and since their time with us is limited, we should cherish every moment. Computers can isolate citizens from their family and friends, depriving them of real - life social interactions. Moreover, computers can be harmful to nature. For instance, printing from a computer leads to deforestation as more trees are cut down for paper production. We should use paper sparingly, only in emergencies. We all aspire to make the world a better place, so we must cease causing destruction for our own self - interest. In summary, computers will ultimately cause chaos and destruction. Instead of relying on them, we should engage in sufficient exercise, spend time with family, and enjoy nature and our surroundings. I sincerely urge you to consider my suggestions and hopefully agree with them.
128	128	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, in my view, while computers can be both entertaining and educational, they should not supplant daily life. I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people in ways they may not fully recognize. Three key factors support my stance: the blurring of reality and fantasy, the strain on relationships with family and friends, and the detrimental effects on health. Many children and young adults are susceptible to the fallacy that everything presented on the computer is true. In reality, it is often far from the truth. The alluring games and electronic features on computers create an illusion that the scenarios and activities depicted are real - life situations. This misrepresentation instills the wrong mindset in children, affecting their academic performance and behavior. They need to regain a proper sense of reality. Your family and friends have always stood by you through thick and thin. Unfortunately, computer addiction has distanced you from them. They are dissatisfied with your behavior and yearn for a change so that you can once again relish life. Interact with real people, not just computer - generated graphics. After all, those images are ephemeral and will not offer the support that your family and friends can provide. Your body is unique, and your health is invaluable. Although some computer programs may recommend exercise, you are unlikely to follow through. Both you and the developers of computer sites are aware of this. Spending the whole day staring at a screen is not only harmful to your eyes but also to your overall health. Moving your fingers to press buttons is not a substitute for physical activity. Since you are already sedentary, you are not doing anything beneficial for yourself. You should venture outdoors, breathe in fresh air, and connect with nature. Engage in activities like running or playing a ball game, but not on the computer. In conclusion, it is evident that computers can have a profound impact on a person. People often confuse fantasy with reality, lose touch with their friends and loved ones, and put their health at risk by spending hours motionless in front of a screen. Please take these risks into account and accept the facts, as we are squandering the opportunity to live and appreciate the world.
129	129	1	1	Greetings! I am @PERSON1, and I hold the view that computers are not inherently bad. Although people do spend excessive time on computers, they can also acquire a wealth of knowledge. Another reason is that some individuals, such as bullies, can use computers as a means to relieve stress and avoid engaging in bullying behavior. Additionally, computers facilitate communication with friends through video chats. Computers are excellent learning tools. For example, if your computer malfunctions or is infected with a virus, you can independently troubleshoot the problem. You can also catch up on the latest news and seek answers to your questions from others. In modern society, children, teenagers, and adults frequently use computers to look up information they do not understand. For instance, when I encounter an unfamiliar word while reading a book, I can visit @LOCATION1 to find its meaning. Bullies and individuals like the homeless who own computers can engage in various games, such as combat games, shooting games, and board games. They can even watch fights if they wish. This is beneficial as it reduces the likelihood of physical confrontations, ensuring everyone's well - being. Bullies can also use computers to relax and avoid those they dislike. Computers offer a sense of relaxation as you can control your environment without the need to interact with others. Children, teenagers, and adults no longer need to leave home to communicate with friends, thanks to the built - in webcam on most computers. My father, for example, is planning to purchase a computer with a webcam so that he can stay in touch with our family, as he now resides in @LOCATION2. Similarly, if a friend moves away, you can still communicate with them via webcam or exchange messages. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a valuable asset as they enable learning, promote positive behavior, and enhance communication.
130	130	1	1	Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, the use of computers is a highly debated topic, with people holding diverse opinions. However, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on their users. These remarkable devices empower individuals to communicate and socialize with friends and family. They keep people informed about global events and provide updates on the status of countries and various happenings. Moreover, computers offer a vast amount of information, enabling users to conduct in - depth research on any topic. In today's society, computers are indispensable, and opposing their use is a preposterous idea. A growing number of people, regardless of age, are leveraging computers to socialize through various websites and applications. Computers allow for remote communication, eliminating the need for physical presence. The social aspect of computers is gaining popularity, with social networking sites and instant messaging being two prominent examples. Social networking sites enable users to create profiles, share photos, and post information for their friends to view. Depriving people of computers would severely limit their social lives. Computers have a positive social impact on many individuals, enhancing the quality of their lives. Current news is filled with both exciting events and tragic disasters, and people often want to stay updated. Most individuals prefer not to wait for the newspaper and instead turn to online news sources. Online news is extremely popular and beneficial, providing the latest stories and real - time updates. It played a crucial role in the aftermath of the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Due to its speed and accessibility, people were able to start donating and providing assistance just one day after the disaster. This rapid response is instrumental in @LOCATION2's recovery. Computers provide access to online news, which is undoubtedly beneficial to people's lives. Before the advent of computers, people relied on books and newspapers for research. This involved sifting through numerous pages, which was an inefficient and disorganized process. Now, computers offer access to an infinite amount of information. It is easy to retrieve data for articles or essays as it is stored in a centralized location. This enables efficient and well - structured research. There are also online databases on the internet. You simply need to enter a keyword, and you can obtain instant information. This saves time and streamlines the research process. In conclusion, despite being in use for a relatively short time, computers have significantly contributed to the development of society. They facilitate social interaction, provide access to the latest news, and enable efficient research. Without a doubt, computers have a positive impact on society and its people. Regardless of what experts may say, computers will continue to be a valuable asset to society.
131	131	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are commencing to pose a problem in numerous households. I perceive that an excessive number of individuals are becoming addicted to computers. Such individuals are more prone to gain weight, have limited social time, and spend an inordinate amount of time indoors. In an article by @CAPS6 that I recently perused in the @ORGANIZATION1, it centered on @CAPS6 experiment regarding computer usage. Dr. @PERSON1, a @CAPS3 professor, asserted that his findings indicated that individuals addicted to computers only leave their residences to run errands. When this occurs, it disrupts their lives as well as their physical well - being, as our bodies require sunlight. Moreover, his study also revealed that individuals who venture outside more and use the computer less tend to be happier. @PERCENT1 of the study's participants began to exhibit greater joy once they reduced their computer usage. I prefer it when the people around me are content, not irritable. Don't you? I have noticed some students in my school who are gaining weight. These are students who have recently started spending a couple of hours on the computer each day. This is extremely detrimental to their health and physique. If someone sits at their computer all day, the food they consume is not burned off, and it all accumulates as fat. Additionally, statistics demonstrate that @PERCENT2 of all obese individuals in a weight - loss class gained their excess weight from sitting at the computer all day. If people treat their bodies in this manner, they could develop some form of health condition. Last week, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1 interviewed a @NUM2 - year - old @PERSON2. @PERSON2's best friend has been ignoring @PERSON2 because he acquired an @ORGANIZATION1 computer. Now, @PERSON2's friend no longer wishes to hang out with @PERSON2 or any of his other friends. Furthermore, when people become addicted to computers, they become less sociable with friends and other individuals such as parents, teachers, and more. When people sacrifice their social time for computer games, chat rooms, or movie websites, they forfeit a substantial portion of their lives. This can be rectified if parents take a firm stance, set limitations, and encourage children to spend more time outdoors. As is evident, computers @MONTH1 offer certain benefits, but they also present numerous drawbacks. Addicted computer users become less social, refrain from going outside, and start to ""put on weight."" The consequence of this is a world populated by individuals who sit at the computer all day, consuming food and gaining weight."
132	132	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I comprehend that the notion of technological advancements benefiting society is a highly controversial topic. Nevertheless, I advocate for these technological advancements and believe that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. They enable friends and family residing at a distance from one another to communicate and maintain contact. Computers @CAPS7 facilitate easy access to news and online textbooks, which bestows an enormous number of benefits upon contemporary society. In the long term, conducting more tasks via computer rather than on paper will conserve billions of trees! @CAPS7, computers impart hand - eye coordination, which is an extremely crucial skill. These technological advancements are highly advantageous to our society and should be utilized to our advantage! ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1!"" exclaims the @CAPS3 computer as I receive a video call from @CAPS3 cousin, @PERSON4. The progress in technology has furnished numerous novel means for @CAPS3 family and me to communicate with one another. @CAPS3 cousins and I seldom encounter one another, yet computers render it feasible for us to stay connected. Four out of five teenagers would concur that without computers or technological advancements, their long - distance relationships with family and friends would be unfeasible. For instance, I engage in a weekly oovoo video chat with @CAPS3 cousin, whom I only see during holidays. Teen @CAPS4, @PERSON2, remarks: ""Technologies such as computers and cell phones are beneficial for teens, but they should be supervised and not overused."" Computers are excellent for maintaining contact with distant family and friends! Subsequently, computers provide easy access to news and online textbooks. @CAPS5 if more individuals capitalized on this, we could save millions of trees and foster a healthier environment. Environmentalist @PERSON3 states: ""@CAPS5 if more schools transitioned to online textbooks, they would ultimately save thousands of dollars that could be allocated elsewhere."" I concur, says @CAPS3 friend @PERSON1. ""@CAPS5 if we didn't have to carry so many textbooks home every day, I might not have scoliosis!"" @CAPS7, computers afford rapid access to news, enabling us to learn about accidents immediately rather than awaiting the arrival of the newspaper. @CAPS7, computers assist children in developing hand - eye coordination, which is a very important skill. Computer activities stimulate our brains and @MONTH1 may even enhance our accuracy in baseball during the next season! Three out of five children at @ORGANIZATION2 claim that @CAPS5 if they had not had access to a computer during their upbringing, they would not be as proficient in their sport. Computers are an extremely valuable resource for numerous aspects of our lives that we should exploit."
133	133	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 of the Newspaper, There is no doubt that computers do not always benefit society. Firstly, most people have a limited amount of time to allocate to various tasks. Secondly, many friends may become annoyed if you fail to interact with them. Last but not least, one must be vigilant about their health. In summary, computers are not always a positive influence. In my opinion, time is a precious commodity. When people become overly engrossed in something, it is difficult to disengage. This is analogous to smoking. The nicotine is addictive, so once one starts, it is extremely challenging to quit. Many indolent individuals tend to procrastinate. In other words, they squander time. The time that could be dedicated to homework or even work is being wasted. Some people are aware that they need to complete certain tasks but keep postponing them. For example, one may need to paint their house or repair the car's engine but continuously puts it off. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people engage in this behavior in @LOCATION1 every day. As is obvious, many @CAPS3 do not give sufficient thought to the value of time. The next significant issue is social interaction. You and I are well aware that everyone requires companionship. When you do not interact with your friends, they may lose interest in communicating with you. They may even avoid you if you neglect them. Pets, on the other hand, depend on you. They typically just lounge around the house when they are lonely. I am certain you know that pets need affection and playtime. Parents need to be present for their children. When you were young, did you not need assistance? I know I did. That is why parents need to engage actively with their children. In conclusion, the more you associate with your friends and stay away from the computer, the better off you will be. This leads us to the next major topic, health. Maintaining good health is no trivial matter. If you desire a long life and wish to witness your children grow up, the healthier you are, the better your quality of life will be. Everyone needs exercise. Exercise helps prevent diseases and keeps you in shape. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people are overweight. When you are sitting in front of a computer screen, playing games or sending emails, it is as sedentary as watching television. You are well aware that most video games are not beneficial for you. Last but not least, most people do not maintain a healthy diet when they play video games or use the computer. You and I know that a balanced diet and regular exercise are essential for a happy life. In my view, computers do not always benefit society. Time management is a crucial aspect that many @CAPS3 overlook. Secondly, social interaction, which is vital for everyone, is another important consideration. Last but not least, everyone needs to prioritize their health for a long and fulfilling life. As can be seen, many people would be better off reducing their computer usage.
134	134	1	1	Computers represent the future. I am of the opinion that computers have a positive impact on society. I hold this view because computers enable individuals to communicate with friends and family who are geographically distant. They also provide access to thousands of websites from which one can acquire valuable information. Lastly, they develop hand - eye coordination. Firstly, computers facilitate online socialization. I know that upon returning home from school, I can communicate with virtually any of my friends online. Opponents of computers claim that it detracts from family interaction, but this is inaccurate. I communicate with all my aunts via Facebook and other social media platforms. Additionally, when my parents are at work, they can message me via the computer without having to use a phone to call home. Another advantage is that it simplifies the process of getting in touch with friends. For instance, if a friend is supposed to visit but gets sick, he can simply send me an online message instead of looking up my number and calling. My second reason is that computers are beneficial for education. When I am confronted with a problem at home, I can use the computer to search for the solution. Moreover, when I need to complete projects, the computer is an invaluable resource for me and many other students. When working on a project, I cannot obtain all the necessary information from a single book, so I turn to the computer to gather more details about the subject. This significantly improves students' grades as they have access to more resources and information compared to relying solely on textbooks. My final reason is that using a computer can enhance hand - eye coordination. There are numerous interactive websites on the computer that offer real - life benefits. I know of one website that helped me improve my baseball fielding skills through interactive games. There are similar websites for other sports such as basketball and football. Thus, the computer can contribute to real - life activities. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers can greatly benefit society. They enable communication with friends, assist with schoolwork, and enhance hand - eye coordination.
135	135	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing to apprise you of the effects that computers have on individuals. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, allow people to explore various locations, and enable online communication with family and friends. Firstly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination. They assist you in becoming a more proficient speller and enable you to type rapidly and without looking at the keys. I can attest that it has benefited me, and I am confident it will benefit you as well. Secondly, computers facilitate interaction with family and friends and also provide opportunities to make new acquaintances. Platforms like MySpace allow you to chat with friends and forge new connections. In my opinion, Facebook is a more sophisticated social network, and Twitter serves as another avenue for communicating with friends. Even email services such as Yahoo, Gmail, and AOL enable seamless communication. Teachers can also use computers to communicate with parents, which allows for interaction without the need for everyone to be present in a phone conversation. Next, computers enable you to search for both new and well - known places such as landmarks, businesses like salons, nail parlors, gyms, and various restaurants. You can even check the release dates of movies. In such cases, a computer can be extremely helpful. In conclusion, computers are advantageous. They inform, educate, and instruct. I am fond of my computer as it aids me with my homework and study. Suppose you are unable to communicate with someone over the phone; you can send them an email or engage in a chat. It is both enjoyable and fascinating to learn new things. You can upload pictures, music, and videos, and even write essays. The computer is a highly educational tool.
136	136	1	1	"There are numerous facets to this computer - related issue. In fact, it's quite straightforward: computers are detrimental to our lives. Now, consider how often you see your child engrossed in it. Computers have a negative impact on kids' academic performance. They prevent people from taking a drive to @ORGANIZATION1's residence. Moreover, people rarely ride their bicycles. Computers are truly a cause for concern. It all begins with grades. Parents tell their children to start working on their papers. The kids agree, yet they end up on Facebook. More often than not, both kids and parents misuse the computer. In fact, @PERCENT2 of Americans utilize it. Although that might seem like a small percentage, it's more than half of the country. As for me, I don't abuse the computer because I need to maintain @CAPS6 grades. Most students have @CAPS2 - average grades, as studies indicate it's due to computers. Also, if your son has a laptop, don't assume he's doing work. I own computers, but we have books for a reason - no annoying pop - ups or distractions while working. Once, when I was working on a project, a pop - up appeared, advertising ""Traffic Rush"" for free on my computer. Foolishly, I downloaded it, and @CAPS6 parents caught me playing. Has this changed your perspective? Since you probably haven't changed your mind, here's another reason why computers are bad: your car. All men love cars. Computers are preventing more than @PERCENT3 of people from working or driving their cars. The only person unaffected is @CAPS6 dad, who works on his cars day in and day out. @CAPS6 grandmom said something interesting to me the next day: ""@CAPS3 your dad visits me more often than @CAPS6 other sons. @CAPS6 other sons are obsessed with computers."" People are extremely fond of computers these days. Lately, I've seen fewer and fewer people outdoors. There's only one reason for this: everyone is secluded in their basements in the dark, so when the light comes on, it's blinding. Come on, has this changed your mind yet? Well, since you're still reading, it means you can't make up your mind. Here's another point: people are starting to lose interest in riding their bikes. This is what they think on Facebook: ""@CAPS4 it's easier to talk online. Why do I need to ride to talk in person?"" That @PERCENT1 is accurate for what they're thinking. We conducted a survey of all the kids with Facebook accounts, and that's what most of them said. It's truly astonishing. A stay - at - home mother said, ""@CAPS6 son is gaining weight. All he does is eat and go on Facebook. I even catch him at night when he's supposed to be off during the day."" That's a sad situation for that mother. I ride @CAPS6 bike frequently. Here's a real - life story: once, I was just sitting around doing nothing when @CAPS6 mom said we were going for a @NUM1 - mile bike ride. I got up and did it. That should change your mind, or nothing will. So, in conclusion, I have no more reasons to oppose computers, but just remember your grades, cars, and your weight. Please, change your mind."
137	137	1	1	Dear newspaper, I firmly believe that computers offer significant advantages. This is because they enable us to acquire knowledge about distant locations, stay informed about the latest news, and communicate with others. In school, many research projects focus on various parts of the world. When using a computer, one can access articles about a place, obtain pictures, and incorporate them into a slideshow or photo story. There are also educational websites where children can learn math facts, from basic arithmetic to multiplication tables. @CAPS1, the computer is an excellent learning tool. The computer also keeps you updated with the news. There are news websites that provide minute - by - minute coverage of world events, informing us about disasters that occur in far - off places. Often, families are scattered across the globe. You can communicate with family members or friends who have moved through a simple chat room and catch up on each other's lives. This is a valuable means for families to stay connected. @CAPS1, the computer has numerous benefits that people worldwide can utilize, from learning about a foreign country to chatting with a cousin in California and staying informed about local happenings.
138	138	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, there has been extensive discussion regarding whether computers impact people positively or negatively. I am of the opinion that computers generally have a negative impact on most individuals. I hold this view because people lose their interpersonal skills by communicating through the computer, computers also pose risks, and people tend to neglect their life priorities. As far as I know, most computer users employ them to communicate with friends and others globally. Instead of socializing in person, they communicate via the computer. If they do this more often than meeting face - to - face, they will fail to recognize the facial expressions of certain people. When communicating in person, one experiences the full spectrum of interaction, including tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language, which are often absent when using a computer, unless a webcam is employed. Computers have given rise to numerous dangers. These risks affect every user and their families. There have been many instances of young teenagers being deceived by older users. The older users may persuade teens to expose parts of their bodies or make them believe that they can relate to their problems and are of the same age. Sometimes, teens are convinced to leave their homes and neighborhoods to meet the other users. Another form of danger is cyberbullying. Cyberbullies undermine one's self - esteem. They insult and harass victims, sometimes even driving them to suicidal thoughts. If there were no computers, none of these dangers would exist. With the advent of computers, people have lost their judgment regarding priorities. Some computer users tend to forget about important aspects of life, such as family, schoolwork, and their own health. Some people prefer to stay on the computer rather than spend time with family and friends. Others choose not to do their homework and instead focus on their online social lives. Since they spend a significant amount of time on the computer, they often neglect their health. They exercise less and eat less healthily. In my opinion, a life without computers would be beneficial for everyone. People would retain their interpersonal skills, there would be less danger, and people would focus more on important matters rather than their online social lives.
139	139	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers do have a positive influence on people. However, I don't think computers are the reason people don't exercise or enjoy nature. People make their own life choices. The computer is merely a tool. If someone chooses to spend time on the computer instead of with their family, that's their decision and problem, not the computer's. For instance, I enjoy working and playing on the computer. Despite my computer usage, I still engage in activities such as talking to my family, playing basketball, and socializing with my friends. That's my choice. I could easily stay in my room and be on the computer all the time, but there's nothing wrong with that as it's my life decision. No one should tell you to get off the computer because it's your choice. If you prefer to be on the computer rather than go outside, that's entirely up to you. Only you know what's best for you.
140	140	1	1	Dear editor, I've heard that some experts claim @CAPS1 spend excessive time online. I firmly believe they are incorrect. Through the internet, people can learn about distant places without incurring the cost of travel. Our military uses the internet to communicate with their families and friends back home. Additionally, it helps us develop excellent hand - eye coordination. If someone is planning a trip to @LOCATION1, they would frequently consult the internet. First, they would research the attractions in @LOCATION1. Second, they would compare hotels in @LOCATION1. Third, they would check the weather in @LOCATION1. Finally, they would look into airports for flights to and from @LOCATION1. Without the internet, planning vacations would be nearly impossible. People use the internet not only for entertainment but also for communication purposes. They use webcams to converse with people in far - off locations. It's a fast, cost - free, and convenient way to communicate. Our military uses webcams to allow soldiers to talk to their families. How would you feel if you were a soldier fighting for your country, and the means to talk to your family was available, yet you couldn't use it? It's cruel and unjust to deny soldiers the opportunity to communicate with their families. The internet also provides us with something valuable. It aids in the development of hand - eye coordination, which is essential in many activities. In basketball, you need to be able to dribble while looking up. When driving, you need to be able to steer the car while observing the road. Without hand - eye coordination, there would be more accidents due to careless mistakes. The internet helps make the world a safer place. In some respects, the experts are right. We should go out and enjoy nature, but we also need to utilize and enjoy the internet. Some people use it for entertainment and to improve hand - eye coordination, while others use it to communicate with their loved ones or plan vacations. Regardless of who you are or what you do, the internet plays a crucial role in life.
141	141	1	1	"Dear @PERSON3 of the @LOCATION1, I firmly contend that computers exert a positive influence on us. As computers continue to evolve, so do their applications. They are remarkable tools, yet they do not supplant our thought processes, nor do they replace the need to venture outdoors and engage in sports. Computers facilitate our connection with relatives and friends and enable us to acquire knowledge about distant places. They are also invaluable for research!  First and foremost, computers are positively impacting us, especially when it comes to reconnecting with family and friends. My mother, who was adopted, yearned to find her birth family @NUM1 years ago. A year later, her birth father located her on a genealogy website. Thanks to this, she reunited with her family, and I now have two additional @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, as well as a cousin, @PERSON4. I cherish them deeply. Without the computer, I would never have had the opportunity to get to know them.  Regarding communication, I was laboring intensively on a significant science project. Since we couldn't collaborate in person, it was impractical for one individual to coordinate with four others. However, by emailing our ideas and insights, we successfully completed the project. ""There are never enough hours in the day!"" is a common lament. In fact, over @PERCENT1 of adults, as per a statistic from @ORGANIZATION1, complain about the lack of time. The computer allows for multitasking, enabling us to be on a business call while simultaneously emailing our mother to remind her that we haven't forgotten her birthday.  Moreover, computers enhance our understanding of other countries, their cultures, and current affairs. Many individuals without televisions rely on the internet for news. For instance, in @NUM2 grade, I had to research @CAPS4, a country in @LOCATION2. Conducting research in books would have been time - consuming and inefficient, as we would have sifted through a plethora of irrelevant information. In contrast, the computer offers a swift and straightforward solution. All we need to do is type in our query, and the information is at our fingertips, unlike searching through a book, which can be a laborious process. In today's economy, time is a precious commodity that we cannot afford to squander.  Furthermore, computers are indispensable for various types of research and navigation. Those who claim that people spend excessive time on computers and neglect exercise are not always correct. I am constantly exploring different exercises to achieve a flat stomach, and many of my friends do the same. Additionally, looking up directions on maps can be frustrating and time - consuming. On the computer, maps are regularly updated, and we can obtain clear and rapid directions. I, for one, appreciate efficiency and convenience.  In the realm of criminal investigations, computers play a crucial role in quickly identifying individuals through fingerprint analysis, thereby safeguarding public safety. In conclusion, computers have a profoundly positive impact on us and are a boon to society, from facilitating connections to enhancing communication and providing access to life - changing information. I sincerely hope that you share my perspective on this matter. Advanced computers are our allies, not our adversaries."
142	142	1	1	"As an increasing number of individuals become accustomed to utilizing computers, I am of the opinion that this trend is having a detrimental impact on society. Due to the prevalence of computers, people are not engaging in sufficient physical exercise, which is of utmost importance. Additionally, individuals are losing the ability to appreciate and immerse themselves in nature while they still can. Finally, people are gradually losing their capacity to communicate effectively with family and friends. As people become more entrenched in technology, they are becoming increasingly detached from the world around them. Therefore, the advancements in technology are exerting a negative influence on society.  When the average person uses a computer, whether for business, academic work, socializing, or entertainment, they can easily become engrossed for extended periods. They often claim to be ""too preoccupied"" for exercise, which is becoming increasingly vital for our health and well - being. With the allure of music, companionship, and digital distractions at our fingertips, who has the time to go for a walk, jog, or bike ride? The presence of computers has diminished people's motivation to exercise. In an era where physical activity is more crucial than ever, we are neglecting this essential aspect of our lives.  Every day, rainforests are being deforested, polluted, and degraded. We need to step away from our computer screens and reconnect with the natural world. We must take the time to appreciate and protect the environment. As time progresses, the use of communication technology via the internet is exacerbating the issue of maintaining healthy relationships. ""Face - to - face interaction"" is a concept that is often lacking in the digital realm. This means that while we may encounter individuals online whom we consider ""friends,"" we may not truly know them until we meet them in person, which can pose potential risks.  Moreover, the emotional depth and human connection that are inherent in relationships cannot be replicated or programmed, regardless of how advanced our technology becomes. As is evident, the over - reliance on computers is having a negative impact on our society. We are failing to allocate time for exercise and meaningful human interaction, both of which are essential for our well - being. In a world where it is more important than ever to lead healthy, fulfilling, and socially connected lives, we are gradually losing touch with what truly matters. Therefore, computers are having a negative impact on society."
143	143	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and I am a student at @ORGANIZATION1 Middle School. I wish to express my opinion on how computers affect people. There are numerous aspects, such as games, chat rooms, social networking, and the provision of information for homework or work.  Let me begin by stating that in my view, the use of computers is highly beneficial. Only those lacking in foresight would eschew their use. Computers offer extensive assistance. For example, if I am a cook and forget how to prepare a particular dish, I can simply access the computer and find the solution with ease. I have used computers throughout my life, and I believe they have contributed to my intellectual development. I even assist my mother in using the computer on occasion.  Chat rooms are excellent platforms for making new friends and communicating with family members, especially those residing in different parts of the world. I regularly communicate with my cousin, who lives in Colombia. I also interact with my friends on Facebook to inquire about homework assignments.  Games are not only a source of entertainment but also serve educational purposes. When we are bored or have nothing to do, we can engage in a wide variety of games, ranging from action - packed adventures to intellectually stimulating challenges like chess or Sudoku. These games help to exercise our minds and improve our cognitive abilities. Additionally, they familiarize us with the computer interface, as many people struggle to type without looking at the keyboard.  In conclusion, these are my thoughts on the impact of computers. Although some may argue that computers detract from time spent on exercise and face - to - face interaction, I believe that they offer alternative forms of mental stimulation and social connection. Until next time.
144	144	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are a valuable asset to our planet. The advent of new technology has simplified our lives and made them more manageable. Computers offer several benefits, including the development of hand - eye coordination, enhanced communication capabilities, and a novel means of entertainment.  Computers contribute to the improvement of hand - eye coordination through typing. Whether we are aware of it or not, rapid typing exercises our hands and enhances their dexterity. Typing without making errors also helps to refine our motor skills, making our hands more agile and responsive. The constant movement of our hands across the keyboard provides a substantial amount of exercise, which is beneficial for our overall physical well - being.  In terms of communication, computers have revolutionized the way we interact with others. They enable us to communicate with people from different parts of the world, regardless of geographical barriers. With the use of webcams, we can have face - to - face conversations with individuals who are far away. This is particularly useful in business meetings, where participants from different locations can collaborate effectively. For example, if a company has a project in Hong Kong, the management can hold a virtual meeting to monitor its progress. Additionally, computers allow us to communicate with individuals who we are unable to visit in person, such as those in the hospital. Through video calls, we can maintain a connection and offer support.  Computers also offer a wide range of entertainment options. There are countless games available, both pre - installed on the computer and accessible on the internet. Instead of succumbing to boredom, we can simply click the mouse and embark on a gaming adventure. Moreover, we can watch videos on platforms like YouTube, listen to music, or enjoy comedy shows. Videos provide a means of self - expression, allowing us to share our emotions through various genres, such as comedy, horror, or drama. Social networking sites like Facebook also offer teenagers a platform to connect with their friends.  In conclusion, computers are beneficial to people of all ages, including children, adults, and teenagers. With just a click of the mouse, we can harness the power of technology and enjoy the benefits of improved hand - eye coordination, enhanced communication, and engaging entertainment. So, I encourage you to acquire a computer and experience the wonders it has to offer.
145	145	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers are a valuable asset to society. The latest technological advancements have made life more convenient and manageable. Computers are indispensable for various tasks, including typing, editing, and presenting information. As you, the administrators of the local newspaper, are likely aware, computers are essential for publishing and disseminating news. Without computers, the production of newspapers, as well as other forms of media, would be virtually impossible.  The government also relies heavily on computers to communicate with the public and other countries. Typed documents are used to announce laws, regulations, and important policies. In addition, computers are used in business for marketing, advertising, and communication. Without computers, the modern business world would come to a standstill.  In our daily lives, computers have become an integral part of our communication systems. For example, if we are running late for work due to traffic, we can simply send an email to our boss to explain the situation. This not only saves time but also reduces stress. In fact, computers have become the primary means of communication for people around the world. Through email, social networking sites like Facebook and AOL, and video chat, we can stay connected with friends, family, and colleagues, regardless of their location.  In the educational sector, computers are equally important. Teachers and administrators use computers to communicate with each other and with students. They also use computers to conduct research, prepare lesson plans, and grade assignments. For students, computers are essential for completing homework, conducting research, and collaborating on projects. Without the internet, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to access the vast amount of information available today.  In conclusion, computers are a remarkable technological advancement that has had a profound impact on society. They have made our lives easier, more efficient, and more connected. Without computers, newspapers would not be able to print, teachers would not be able to communicate effectively, and students would struggle to complete their academic tasks. As a student, I have personally benefited from the use of computers in my studies and in my social life. Therefore, I believe that computers should be embraced and utilized to their fullest potential. If computers are such a valuable resource for society, it is illogical to view them as a cause for concern.
146	146	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that the utilization of computers significantly aids individuals. In the absence of computers, our knowledge about anyone or anything would be severely limited. For instance, regarding all of the @CAPS1, without computers, I would be completely oblivious to them and their lives. However, with computers, I am well - informed about them, such as the fact that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 was shot in the back of the head, and @CAPS4 was also shot. I also know a great deal about the @ORGANIZATION1. They are white people who instill fear in black people. The same can be said about wars like World @NUM1 and World @NUM2, as well as the @CAPS5 and @PERSON1 and the @CAPS6 war. There was an incident where a plain spy plane was flying across @LOCATION1 and was shot down because we were attempting to determine if they had any nuclear bombs there. Similarly, Google and Yahoo are extremely useful. With Google, you can type in anything, and you will receive an answer, most likely a correct one. Yahoo and Google are excellent for work, product research, and studying. Thus, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial.
147	147	1	1	Hour upon hour of engaging in online gaming and posting blogs on social networking sites is a common sight. Unaware of their surroundings, many individuals become engrossed in their computer screens and only disengage when absolutely necessary. This is not the direction the world should take, yet it is what society is fostering. Computers do not confer positive benefits on society. Due to the excessive time spent on the computer, people's bodies are suffering negative consequences. Moreover, there is a dwindling amount of face - to - face interaction with family and friends. Another major issue is cyberbullying. These are all problems that demand attention. With so much time spent in a stuffy, dark room in front of a computer, how can our bodies be properly maintained? Exercise is a crucial component of a healthy lifestyle. It is akin to attempting to make bread without flour; without this essential ingredient, the bread will not reach its full potential. The same holds true for the health and functioning of our bodies. Exercise must be incorporated to burn fat and calories, and it is also necessary to build and maintain muscles. In fact, it is recommended to engage in at least one hour of exercise or outdoor play per day. Unfortunately, not many people achieve this goal, which further exacerbates the negative effects on the body. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 helps maintain strong bones. To obtain the recommended daily dose of @CAPS2 @CAPS1, one only needs to absorb @NUM1 minutes of sunlight per day. Although this may not seem like a large amount, @PERCENT1 of our population fails to receive it because they are indoors, glued to their computers. Parties, lunch breaks, or family dinners are ideal opportunities for socialization. However, what if one decides to skip a lunch break with friends and instead spends time posting a daily blog? This is valuable social time lost. If this habit persists, one may find themselves drifting away from their friends as they do not make the effort to spend time with them during lunch breaks. Even when a child interacts by chatting with friends on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6, inappropriate things could be said. Children will not learn at a young age how to think on their feet in real - life language situations. This will have an impact on their later years, such as during college or job interviews. Social skills are the differentiator between success and failure. Spending one's life on a computer is equivalent to being a caterpillar in its cocoon, while at least attempting to be more active will transform you. @CAPS7 and @CAPS7 are all manifestations of the menacing cyberbullying. One simple way to prevent this is to spend less time on the computer. The effects of cyberbullying can be extremely harsh. A recent study indicated that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be bullied in person than over the internet because the cruelty displayed through cyberbullying is often more severe. In conclusion, computers have more negative effects on society than positive ones. A lack of exercise and proper body maintenance results, social interaction and skills decline, and cyberbullying, which can be life - threatening, occurs. To prevent society from becoming a social wasteland filled with the glow of computer screens, let's all turn off the monitors and embrace the outdoors and its benefits.
148	148	1	1	I am of the firm belief that computers confer numerous benefits upon our society. Computers have been in existence for many years, and they are ubiquitous. This indicates that people hold them in high regard. There are countless uses and enjoyable experiences one can have with a computer. Computers bring happiness to people, which in turn contributes to a better society as it becomes more cheerful. They make people happy because one can play games such as Tetris, @CAPS1, and even card games. Computer games are a source of happiness because whenever people are bored and have nothing to do, they can simply log on to the computer and play a game. Some of the remarkable games available on a computer include @CAPS1, cards, pinball, and other excellent ones. The computer creates a happier home environment because as soon as children return from school, they use it for gaming or chatting with friends. Another reason why computers are beneficial to society is that one can now pay bills and make purchases via the internet. When paying bills or buying things online, there is no need to venture out and waste money on gas, which makes people extremely pleased when they save money. It also helps reduce pollution because if cars are not on the road, there is less emissions. Thus, computers are also playing a role in saving society. My final reason for advocating that computers are beneficial to society is that they can enhance one's intelligence and improve academic performance by facilitating learning about different people and cultures. For example, on my last social studies research project, I utilized the computer and received an A. This made me happy, and in effect, it contributes to the happiness of society. Now, you are aware of my reasons for believing that computers are beneficial to society. They bring us happiness, make us smarter, and contribute to a better society. I am a staunch advocate of computers, and everyone else should be too.
149	149	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am expressing my opinion that as people spend more time on computers, they spend less time with their families. I have three reasons to discuss whether computers are beneficial or detrimental. Not everyone concurs that computers are advantageous for society. There are both positive and negative effects that computers have on people. My rationale for supporting this @CAPS1, regarding whether computers are good or bad, is that computers have a positive impact on people. The second @CAPS1 is the ability to communicate with others online. The last @CAPS1 I present is the importance of spending more time with family rather than on the computer. The first reason I have for the positive aspect of computers is their positive influence on people. The examples I have to support this @CAPS1 are that computers teach hand - eye coordination and enable people to learn about distant places and people. The second reason regarding computers is the opportunity to talk to people online. The examples to support my @CAPS1 are websites that kids use to communicate with their friends, such as MySpace and Facebook. The places that kids like to visit are YouTube and even engage in blogging about everything and everyone. Some of these activities can be beneficial as long as you do not post pictures or other personal information on your MySpace or Facebook. However, I believe that these websites are dangerous because someone could hack into your file and attempt to communicate with you as if they were your friend. The third reason to support my @CAPS1 is that we should allocate more time to our families instead of being on the computer constantly. I have examples of what we can do with our families instead of using the computer. I have some @CAPS1 of games that we can play with our families, such as Monopoly, Sorry, Candy Land, card games, video games. We can also have conversations with our family members instead of chatting with friends all the time. We should cherish what we have in life, not just through computers but also with our families. In conclusion, I am reiterating my opinion that people spend more time on computers than with their own families. I have three reasons for discussing whether computers are good or bad. The reasons I have to support my @CAPS1 are that computers have a positive effect on people, the ability to talk to people online, and the need to spend more time with family than on the computer.
150	150	1	1	Dear Newspaper, although @CAPS1 computers do have certain drawbacks, they also offer numerous advantages. Some of the benefits are that they can display magnificent pictures of nature, and you can keep these pictures until you wish to send them via email. You can even purchase tickets for planes, trains, and movies. Let's not overlook the shopping and other opportunities available on the internet. When you access the internet, you can find countless pictures of anything you desire, such as pictures of nature and celebrities. Approximately @PERCENT1 of all pictures on the internet are authentic. A computer can also store pictures taken with a digital camera. It can even transfer a project from a flash drive and then download it. The computer can also send the pictures via email to any existing email address. If you want to go to the movies or take a vacation, you can obtain movie tickets online. You can purchase them from any ticket - selling website. If you plan to go on vacation, you can book your hotel, plane, train, or boat tickets online. Buying tickets is not the only activity you can engage in on the internet; you can also make purchases. You can order @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2, GameCube, Xbox, Xbox @NUM3, Wii, and even computer games. You can also buy game systems and household appliances. Additionally, you can save clothes and other store products in your online cart. On the internet, you can watch videos on almost any website you visit. Some videos may be educational, some may be humorous, and others may be rather strange. @PERCENT2 of all teenagers enjoy watching music videos. Some videos simply feature the artist singing and dancing in a background, while other times people make parodies of other artists. Even though computers have both pros and cons, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, as exemplified in the passage above.
151	151	1	1	Dear local newspaper, my perspective on the influence that computers exert on individuals is decidedly positive. Three primary factors support this view: people can expand their knowledge of diverse cultures, explore various places, and some individuals engage in online work.  The first reason computers have a beneficial impact on people is that they facilitate learning about cultures across the globe. Gaining insights into different cultures is crucial as it equips individuals with the understanding necessary to respect one another when traveling.  The second reason is that computers aid in learning about places worldwide. Familiarizing oneself with different locations is essential to avoid getting lost and to identify renowned destinations worth visiting.  The third reason is that computers provide opportunities for some people to find employment online, while others work remotely. This arrangement offers positive benefits to individuals.  In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people as they assist in learning about cultures, places, and job prospects in their vicinity.
152	152	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, there exists a significant number of individuals in the world who believe that constant computer use is advantageous as it enables online communication and broadens global knowledge. Conversely, there are those who hold opposing views, and I am among them. Excessive computer usage can profoundly impact one's life. People may cease physical activity, fail to appreciate the beauty of nature and life, and neglect spending quality time with family and friends.  I sincerely hope that as you peruse this letter, you will take these points into consideration. Firstly, when individuals devote excessive time to the computer, they fail to meet their body's exercise requirements. This leads to lethargy and a reluctance to engage in any form of activity, which is detrimental to both health and overall well - being. People often become overweight, and due to their sedentary lifestyle, they are disinclined to engage in physical exercise. There are numerous enjoyable and health - promoting activities available, such as playing sports, which not only provide exercise but also entertainment. However, some individuals are too indolent to participate because they are constantly glued to their computers. Instead, they remain confined indoors, deprived of fresh air, which is harmful to their bodies.  Finally, people frequently lose touch with family members and friends because they are preoccupied with computer games. I have personally experienced the loss of a few friends due to my excessive computer use on @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and games. I felt remorseful when I realized what I had done and would not wish this fate on anyone else.  In conclusion, excessive computer use is not beneficial. It can lead to laziness, a failure to enjoy life to the fullest, and the loss of important relationships. I hope that after reading this, you will recognize the negative impacts of excessive computer use.
153	153	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are an invaluable asset in society. They empower individuals to acquire knowledge about diverse cultures, facilitate communication with friends and family via the internet, such as through Facebook or @CAPS1, and serve as a reliable research tool for school projects and interviews.  Firstly, learning about different cultures is instrumental in fostering global unity. For instance, in our educational institutions, we study @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, which instill in us a greater sense of respect for these cultures. However, not everyone has access to such educational opportunities, and they turn to the internet for knowledge. Without computers, we would remain oblivious to the lifestyles of people @NUM1 miles away, whether they are arduous or opulent, and we would be unable to offer assistance. The earthquake in @LOCATION1 is a case in point, and such knowledge brings us closer to world peace, free from war and conflicts.  Secondly, computers enable seamless communication with friends and family worldwide. I recall a time when a friend in @LOCATION2 was in peril, and I was unable to meet him in person. Through email and video chat, I was able to stay connected with him, and seeing his face reassured me. I cannot fathom how I would have coped without the internet. Moreover, socializing with friends on internet platforms is extremely useful.  Finally, computers are indispensable for educational purposes. They are used for research projects, study tools, and essay writing. The internet is a highly reliable and accurate source of information, although one must be cautious of fake websites. Many teachers in my school maintain blogs or pages where they post @CAPS4, study links, and handouts. For example, my @CAPS2 teacher, @CAPS5, provides study links before tests. Additionally, @CAPS6 is a website that helps us learn vocabulary through games.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our daily lives and have a positive impact on society. They support educational endeavors, cultural learning, and social interaction, making our lives more fulfilling. As a respected newspaper with discerning readership, I trust that you recognize the significant positive influence of computers on society.
154	154	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, there has been extensive debate regarding the impact of computers on society. Some so - called ""experts"" claim that computers are beneficial, while others argue that they are detrimental, as they contribute to childhood obesity, diminish social skills, and lower educational attainment.  In recent years, studies have indicated that children who frequently use computers are less likely and less willing to engage in physical activity. Dr. @PERSON1 asserts that ""the more time children spend on computers, the more time they waste being sedentary."" A study conducted by the @ORGANIZATION1 reveals that children who use computers for @NUM1 hours a day are more likely to be obese than those who use them for one hour or less. Computers keep children indoors all day, and the ease of using a computer often discourages them from expending energy on physical activities. Thus, computers are a direct cause of childhood obesity and pose a threat to society.  Some may believe that computers enhance social skills, but this is a fallacy. Online communication lacks the authenticity of face - to - face interaction. On a computer, one can communicate privately and say anything without immediate consequences, unlike in public settings where inappropriate remarks can lead to trouble. People who use computers extensively often appear awkward in social gatherings. My cousin, who spends all his time on the computer, was so engrossed in the screen during Christmas that he never looked up. Computers are eroding the social lives of millions of people.  Furthermore, individuals who use computers frequently are often less intellectually developed than those who do not. Although ""experts"" claim that computers offer infinite knowledge, the mere availability of information does not guarantee its utilization. I have observed students on numerous projects and homework assignments saying ""@CAPS2 I just copied and printed an article on Google."" This passive approach to learning results in no real educational gain.  Since the invention of the computer, there was initially hope for societal progress. However, computers are now undermining society by causing obesity, social awkwardness, and reduced educational levels. Given these facts, how can anyone still claim that computers are beneficial?"
155	155	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 there has been a lot of talk about how computers effect society. Some ""experts"" say computers are good for society and some think the opposite computers are bad for society because they make children obese, decrease a person social skills, and even make children less educated. Computers are just plain bad. In recent years studies show that children that use the computer often are less likely and less willing to get active. Dr. @PERSON1 says, ""The more children use computers is the more time they waste @CAPS3 not being active at all."" A study conducted @CAPS3 the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that children that use the computer @NUM1 hours a day are more obese then children who use it one hour or less a day. Computers keep children inside all day. A child on the computer is wasting time not being active. The main reason children become fat on the computer is because it is easier to just go on the computer than to walk and exert energy. Computer are a direct cause to child obesity, and they are a threat to society. Some of you @MONTH1 think a computer can increase social skills, and you are dead wrong! On a computer you can ""talk"" to friends, but it is not like you are actually talking to them. On a computer you can talk in privite and say what ever the heck you want. In public if you say something bad you will get in a lot of trouble. A computer offers no face to face interaction. So when a person who uses a computer often is at a social gathering they are usually very awkward. My cousin spends all of his time on the computer and when I went to his on christmas he never took his eyes off the screen! Computers is destroying the social life millions of people. Did you know that people who use the computer often are usually less smart than kids who don't? ""Experts"" on computers say that computers can be used for infenite nolege. The key word in that fraise is ""can"". just because kids have knoledge at their finger tips doesn't mean the will use it. On many projects and homework assignments I have record kids say ""@CAPS2 I just copied and printed an article on google."" @CAPS3 copying and printing students don't learn anything. Computers are slowly making people less educated. Ever since the invention of the computer people have seen promise for society. Now computers are destroying society @CAPS3 making people fat, socialy weird, and less educated. So how can people still think computers are good?"
156	156	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I recently perused your article concerning computer usage. In my view, computers are indeed a boon. Nevertheless, I contend that they can also exert a detrimental influence. I firmly believe that computers rank among mankind's most remarkable technological achievements. One can engage in typing, delve into historical events, explore diverse locales, and acquaint oneself with various cultures. Moreover, individuals can communicate with those from afar via chat applications or webcams. This is precisely how I converse with my relatives in [LOCATION2]. Computers have undoubtedly been a profound blessing in my life. However, despite their numerous advantages, computers can also prove to be a bane. Regrettably, many individuals tend to overindulge in their use. In fact, I am acquainted with a kind - hearted, sweet, and caring individual who adores children. The only drawback is that she is an obsessive [CAPS2] user. She is so enamored with [CAPS2] that whenever she visits, if I'm using my laptop, she invariably requests to check her [CAPS2] status. My point is that she has allowed [CAPS2] to dominate her life, which is truly regrettable. The other day, I read an article about computer usage in [LOCATION1]. Dr. [PERSON1] covered this topic in the article. She stated, ""The average American spends four hours or more on the computer. While there are those who venture outdoors when the weather is pleasant, I commend them for it."" As you can see, even an expert concurs. In conclusion, I assert that computers can have either a positive or negative impact, depending on how one utilizes them and the amount of time dedicated to their use. Therefore, my message to the residents of [LOCATION1] is to use computers judiciously. Do not squander all your time on them, for life is far too short. Instead, spend quality time with family and friends and embrace the outdoors."
157	157	1	1	"Dear [CAPS1], To what extent do you allocate your daily time to computer usage, an hour, two hours? While computers represent remarkable technological advancements, they also pose significant risks to one's well - being. Individuals often spend extended periods on computers, resulting in reduced physical activity, impaired communication skills, and exposure to perilous online content. From [DATE2] to [DATE3], the prevalence of obesity among [LOCATION2] citizens escalated from [PERCENT2] to [PERCENT1]. A recent study reveals that the proportion of families with computers has risen to [NUM3] out of [DATE1], compared to [NUM4] out of [DATE1] in [DATE4]. Scientists have discerned a correlation between these trends. Those who spend excessive time on computers lead a sedentary lifestyle, preferring to remain glued to their screens rather than engage in physical exercise. The dearth of physical activity contributes to obesity and cardiovascular issues. During a visit to the hospital, a surgeon reported a substantial increase in heart surgeries in [DATE1]. The computer's manual advises limiting usage to an hour at a time. Currently, social networking platforms such as [CAPS6]'s Twitter or Facebook are all the rage. These platforms enable teenagers to interact with their peers. However, [CAPS6]'s communication is often substandard. For instance, they might write "" [CAPS3] [CAPS4] going [NUM2] dance,"" with both spelling and grammar errors. This form of language is not confined to the virtual realm; it has permeated real - life conversations. [PERSON1], the grandmother of a social networking enthusiast, lamented, ""I can hardly have a proper conversation with her as she speaks as if she were on the computer. It's truly disheartening."" [PERSON2], an English teacher for [NUM7] [DATE1], has observed a decline in teenagers' ability to write grammatically correct essays. When she corrects their work, she often encounters text written in a social networking style. ""It's disheartening to witness the erosion of literary skills as children spend excessive time on computers,"" she remarks. The typical routine for children in [LOCATION1] [CAPS7] is to return home and immerse themselves in computer use for hours until a parent arrives. Would you want your child to surf the internet unsupervised for hours, with you having no knowledge of their activities? Parental controls have their limitations, as children can easily bypass them. The risks are ever - present. While the internet offers a wealth of valuable information, it also harbors a great deal of harmful content. You never know what your child is searching for or who they are communicating with; it could be someone like "" [CAPS8],"" who lives just four blocks away."
158	158	1	1	Dear Newspaper, Although some opine that computers do not contribute to societal progress, I firmly hold the opposite view. Computers play an indispensable role in enabling businesses to flourish, keeping individuals informed about global events, and facilitating seamless communication among people. Computers confer substantial benefits upon both small and large enterprises worldwide. Envision a scenario where businesses operate without the aid of computers. The lack of instant communication would lead to inefficiencies, potentially causing delays in product assembly and shipment. Any business owner would shudder at the thought of running a business without this essential tool. A survey indicates that [NUM1] out of [NUM2] business owners and employees prefer the assistance of computers in the workplace. In fact, nearly every contemporary business relies on at least one computer. For example, companies engaged in mass - production often depend on computers to perform tasks with greater precision than human workers. Additionally, computer - operated robots are employed to undertake hazardous jobs, thereby safeguarding the well - being of employees. Businesses also rely on computers to rapidly exchange information with other enterprises and individuals. However, businesses are not the sole beneficiaries of computers. People utilize computers as extensively, if not more so, than businesses. Individuals like you and me leverage computers to maintain contact with friends and acquaintances. Thanks to platforms like [CAPS2] and email, staying in touch has become effortless. Families use computers to plan gatherings, and friends use them to keep in touch after graduating from school or if they live apart. With computers, individuals can maintain constant communication regardless of their geographical location. Moreover, people have an insatiable appetite for immediate news. Without computers, it would be significantly more challenging to access global information. Imagine a natural disaster occurring without timely knowledge; in such a situation, we would be unable to provide prompt assistance. The recent earthquakes in [LOCATION1] and [LOCATION2] have underscored the importance of staying informed about the world. While newspapers offer news and information, they are often a day or two behind, and they frequently rely on computers to gather that data. Eighty - seven percent of scientists concur that obtaining information would be far more arduous without computers.
159	159	1	1	"Envision yourself standing outdoors, the gentle rays of the sun caressing your back, and then plunging into a pool, feeling the refreshing water envelop you. Regrettably, this idyllic scene is becoming increasingly rare as children and their parents are devoting excessive time to computers. The lack of physical activity resulting from computer overuse can be extremely perilous, and it is also causing families to drift apart. I firmly believe that people need to recognize that computers are overshadowing human well - being. Humans, especially children, require regular exercise. However, the prevalence of computers is making this increasingly difficult. With each passing year, a growing number of children are succumbing to obesity, a trend exacerbated by computer use. Instead of lounging in front of the computer, munching on potato chips, children should be outdoors, cycling, swimming, or participating in sports with their peers. Even in winter, children could engage in activities such as sledding. It is essential for children to experience the wonders of nature rather than being confined to a computer screen. Moreover, computers can pose significant risks. [NUM1] - year - olds are creating Facebook accounts, and [NUM2] - year - olds are now easily accessible on the internet. Naive teenagers often seek ""friends"" in chatrooms or on [CAPS2], where they are frequently deceived about the true identities and ages of their online contacts. Many teenagers arrange to meet their online acquaintances, often with tragic consequences such as rape or murder. There are numerous malicious individuals in the world who exploit the internet to target unsuspecting victims. Many teenagers unwittingly disclose personal information such as their surnames, cellphone numbers, or addresses, making it easy for predators to track them down. This not only endangers the teenagers themselves but also their entire families. Computers are also straining relationships between family members and friends. Platforms like [CAPS1], [CAPS2], [CAPS3], farm - related games, and [CAPS4] are causing divisions among people. Some families even have dinner in front of the computer. When friends visit each other's homes, they often simply sit in front of the computer. Why is staring at a computer screen considered so enjoyable? Families should engage in activities together, such as having dinner at a restaurant, going out for ice cream, or shopping. It is not difficult to reduce computer usage by [NUM4] or [NUM5] hours. Admittedly, I am somewhat addicted to the computer, but I do not spend as much time on it as some others. Instead of having dinner in front of the computer, families should dine out together. Instead of online shopping, one can go shopping with friends. By cutting back on computer use, I am reaping the benefits. We are not getting enough exercise, which can have serious health implications, and it is high time that families and friends spent more quality time together. We must regain control over our lives and limit the dominance of computers."
160	160	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I concur that people are allocating an excessive amount of time to computers, thereby neglecting other crucial aspects of life. For instance, they are failing to engage in physical exercise, appreciate the beauty of nature, and spend quality time with their families. These are all vital elements that people seem to be overlooking. Firstly, individuals who spend long hours on computers often neglect physical activity. Exercise is essential for maintaining good health. If one fails to exercise regularly, as they age, their bones may become weaker, and they are at a higher risk of obesity and cardiovascular problems. By being overly engrossed in computers, people are disregarding their physical well - being. Secondly, people are losing touch with nature. The sounds of birds chirping and the sight of blooming plants are being forgotten. They are not recycling, which is essential for keeping our planet clean. The air we breathe is becoming increasingly polluted because people do not care about environmental conservation. Instead of being glued to their computers, they should actively contribute to making the world a better place. Finally, people are neglecting their loved ones. Spending time with family is of utmost importance. People often fail to recognize that family is the cornerstone of life. Instead of sitting in front of the computer, it can be incredibly enjoyable to go to the beach with one's family members. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a significant impact on people. Due to excessive computer use, people are not exercising, not appreciating nature, and not spending time with their families. Now that you have heard my perspective, I encourage you to reflect on your own relationship with computers.
161	161	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers exert a highly positive influence on individuals. I concur that computers have a beneficial impact. They cultivate hand - eye coordination. It endows people with the capacity to learn about diverse individuals and locations, and one can engage in online conversations. @CAPS3 Firstly, computers foster hand - eye coordination. For instance, when learning to type, one can memorize the keys. Consequently, there is no need to glance down at the keyboard. Computers also enhance hand - eye coordination when using a mouse. When desiring to click on an object, one must look at the screen and maneuver the mouse to click on the icon. @CAPS3 A final aspect of how computers teach hand - eye coordination is that once one knows what to do, there is no need to search the screen for an icon. One can simply move the mouse to a spot on the screen and know what action to take. Computers instill hand - eye coordination when typing, when moving the mouse to click on an icon, and when memorizing all of the icons. @CAPS3 Secondly, computers enhance cognitive abilities. For example, if one has a history project and needs to acquire knowledge about China, the computer can be utilized. How frequently would information about China appear in the newspaper? The computer enables rapid access to information. Another example is that computers can uncover details about famous individuals that were previously unknown. One can discover the college a famous actor attended within seconds. @CAPS3 A final example is that a search engine can retrieve famous pictures. If one is working on a project that requires pictures, @ORGANIZATION1 can provide the necessary photos. Computers augment intelligence as one can look up different countries, individuals, and renowned places. @CAPS3 Lastly, computers afford the opportunity to communicate online with friends. For example, one can catch up with friends seen infrequently during school. Online communication is as swift as texting. Additionally, one can resume a conversation with a friend. Did the bell ring in the middle of a conversation? Well, one can continue it on @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. Lastly, one can simply engage in conversation. One can make plans or discuss upcoming events. Computers facilitate communication with friends. In conclusion, computers do have a positive impact on others. One can develop hand - eye coordination, look up foreign countries and people, and communicate with friends.
162	162	1	1	Since the invention of computers, a monumental transformation in the societal functioning has occurred. Individuals can access their computers to interact with peers, gather information on any subject for a school paper, or simply utilize the internet to watch videos and read stories. Magazine and newspaper articles, books, and even movies and shows are accessible on contemporary computers! This technological advancement has rendered the @NUM1 century the most progressive era the world has ever witnessed and is advantageous to society. The “computer age” has provided individuals in today's society with the remarkable opportunity to expand their imaginations through technology. In less than a minute, one can access the internet, type into @ORGANIZATION1 the desired movie or book, and commence watching immediately. People have always asserted that books can transport one anywhere. Well, computers can achieve the same, except with greater efficiency and a wider range of options. Instead of purchasing a book, one can go online and read about the distant city of @LOCATION1 or the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and do so at an astonishing speed. Some contend that by squandering time on computers, people are expending time that could be dedicated to studying or spending time with family. However, any information required to enhance one's knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet. And if one wishes to spend time with family, one can even connect the computer to a TV and watch a free movie with the family! The computer age has arrived, and it is precisely what society needs. Imagine this: you are working on a school project about a subject you know nothing about. Would you prefer to drive for minutes, spend thirty minutes searching for everything you need, or do you think it is more prudent to spend five minutes searching for the required website on the internet? Evidently, the latter option is far more reasonable. The computer significantly simplifies the process of conducting research for school or work. Additionally, one can create entire presentations on a computer with remarkable ease! As an eighth - grade student, I am unsure how I would manage without the internet. I rely on my computer to conduct research for almost every project, and I even create some of my best projects on it! The computer makes the lives of hard - working students and adults much easier. People's lives have not only been simplified in the realm of research; computers also facilitate communication with friends and family! Through email, video chat, and instant messaging, we can communicate with whomever we desire, whenever we wish. With some computers, one can even see and converse with any person of choice. Without these computers, we would once again have to resort to traditional mail, which makes instant communication arduous. Without telephones, we would have no other means of communication. Computers have enhanced communication so significantly that it is folly to claim they are not beneficial to society. How can a machine with so many capabilities be anything but useful? We can see the computer as a tool to broaden research for school and other pursuits. In essence, the computer age is here, and it is amazing.
163	163	1	1	Computers are overutilized and can influence the minds of some individuals. Computers are partially accountable for America's high obesity rate. American teens are neglecting their homework and not investing time in school due to computers. These high - tech devices should be restricted and provided only to those who genuinely require them. People allocate an excessive amount of time to computers. The time spent on computers is time that should be dedicated to physical exercise. Computers contribute to obesity; studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of obese Americans admit to being addicted to computers. This is why computers have a detrimental impact. The internet on computers is unsafe. Experts assert that popular chatting sites such as MySpace are responsible for the sudden increase in murders and rapes. The number of convicted criminals and sex offenders is substantial. Yet, parents allow their children to use these sites. People fail to comprehend the problems computers pose. Apart from other factors, computers impede teens' learning. The computer is supposed to be a helpful tool for learning. However, computers are being employed for other purposes. Computers discourage kids from studying or completing homework. Although there are useful websites and tools, they are not frequently utilized. Computers harm people in numerous ways. America should institute an off - computer week to counteract its adverse influence on children. I hope that one day, we can all permanently turn off our computers.
164	164	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1, do you believe computers have a positive or negative impact on people? Personally, I opine that computers have a positive influence on people because with computers, many individuals can conduct research on the past. Additionally, I do not concur that computers have a negative impact on anyone because with computers, many people develop hand - eye coordination, gain the ability to learn about distant people and places, and can communicate with old friends or family members. Moreover, computers can be used to assist someone in finding information about nature, such as different trees, plants, animals, and many other elements of nature. Subsequently, computers are also sometimes employed to contact individuals who reside far away. Some methods of contacting people on a computer include using emails, instant messaging, Facebook, MySpace, and many other websites. In addition, I believe computers have a positive impact on people, but others may disagree, which is acceptable as not everyone holds the same opinion on matters in the world. Furthermore, computers can be extremely useful to many people as they can utilize computers to find information on history, any events that may have occurred in the past but are no longer relevant in the present. Finally, computers are useful to scientists, business workers, many adults, and even children can use computers if they need to type something for school or find information for a project they are undertaking.
165	165	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, daily, @CAPS1 technology is evolving. One of the most significant and popular machines in the technological society is the computer. Some individuals dislike computers. They believe computers are undermining social skills and physical health. The reason I am writing to you is to persuade those people to recognize the merits of a computer. Firstly, computers assist us in receiving and sending @CAPS8. One of the remarkable features of computers is email. Without email, we would be completely uninformed. For example, @CAPS2 if there is a snow day at your child's school, you receive an email from the superintendent stating that school is canceled. Without that email, we would be unaware of @CAPS8. Another example, @CAPS6 suppose you lose your voice due to a severe cold. You do not feel well and need to inform work about your illness. Now you are in a predicament because you cannot speak. @CAPS2 if you had a computer, you could have simply emailed your boss. Another positive aspect that computers offer is facilitating communication. With the plethora of social networking platforms available, such as @CAPS4, Twitter, @CAPS3, and Yahoo Messenger, it is nearly impossible not to stay in touch with friends and family. Using @CAPS4, one can search for old friends and family. Once found, one can send a friend request and become online friends. Once online friends, one can instant message, video chat, view their status, and browse their photos. So, with a computer, @CAPS7 it is nearly impossible not to maintain contact. The final reason computers are excellent is that they simplify shopping. @CAPS2 if you have used Amazon, eBay, or Overstock, you understand what I mean. One can purchase almost anything online, from electronics to @CAPS5 animals. The possibilities are endless. With a computer, one can even order household groceries online. For example, @CAPS6 suppose you return home from work with severe diarrhea. But @CAPS7 it is @DATE1, so you need to go grocery shopping. You have spent @PERCENT1 of the day on the toilet, and all you have is your laptop. Well, you can shop online. As you can see, computers facilitate communication, shopping, and the exchange of @CAPS8.
166	166	1	1	"To the editor, it's a splendid day. The sun is radiating its brilliance, the birds are warbling melodiously, and a languid breeze is wafting through the trees. Yet, you fail to notice any of this because you're slumped in front of your computer, typing away on @CAPS2 or dealing with email. In the era of modern technology, this is a prevalent scenario. Experts are apprehensive that excessive computer usage can jeopardize your health, impede your social skills, and lead to a disconnection from nature. While computers are beneficial in our lives, an overabundance of anything is never advisable. As previously mentioned, computers can have a detrimental impact on your health. Computers induce people to become indolent. They prefer to engage in @CAPS2 and email rather than venture outside and exercise in the cool, crisp, invigorating air. In fact, statistics recently released by the @ORGANIZATION1 indicate that computers are the @NUM1 leading cause of obesity. And weight issues are not the sole concern related to computers. Spending excessive time in front of the computer will also exact a toll on your eyes. Even local doctors have pointed this out. ""@CAPS4 Since computers have become a ubiquitous household item, the number of eye problems has increased by about @NUM2 or @NUM3 more kids every year than the previous year,"" says @ORGANIZATION3 of the @ORGANIZATION2. And if that isn't sufficient, typing countless @CAPS5 and emails day after day can result in repetitive strain syndrome, also known as carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel was more prevalent when typewriters were in vogue but declined once computers with newer, more user - friendly keyboards emerged. However, excessive daily use of computers is causing doctors to encounter more cases of carpal tunnel. It is evident that if you wish to maintain good health, computer usage should be restricted. Secondly, spending too much time on the computer impairs your ability to communicate with others. Computers are useful when you need to converse with someone, but people have become so accustomed to this mode of communication that they sometimes find it awkward to engage in face - to - face conversations. Their eyes wander everywhere except towards the person, they shift their weight restlessly, and struggle to find the appropriate words to express things that should be effortless. This awkwardness can also undermine previously close friendships. Friends will converse incessantly through @CAPS2 but are at a loss for words when they meet in person. I recall on @DATE1, I didn't see one of my friends at all; we merely @CAPS8 each other daily. When we saw each other at school, we found it arduous to sustain a conversation, and it took some time to get used to talking face to face again. And this isn't the only way in which friendships are put at risk by computers. Personal and meaningful conversations @MONTH1 sometimes be disrupted. You're on the phone with your friend, sharing something important and seeking advice. A few seconds after you start talking, you're interrupted by a loud @CAPS7! followed by a ""hold on, so - and - so just @CAPS8 me."" @CAPS9, computers seriously undermine social skills and personal relationships. Another reason to monitor your computer usage is that it can cause you to..."
167	167	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, the question of whether @CAPS1 are beneficial to our society is being debated. I must assert that they have both merits and demerits, and it's truly difficult to take a definitive stance. They are advantageous as children and teenagers can acquire the information necessary for their school studies, they enable people to communicate with others in distant locations, and they enhance hand - eye coordination. These are the positive aspects; now, let's explore some of the negative aspects of computers. People allocate excessive time to using the computer instead of engaging in physical exercise, they miss out on the opportunity to appreciate nature, and they cease interacting with friends and family. Anyone can choose a side, but I simply can't, as I can empathize with both perspectives. For instance, one of the positive attributes of computers is the ability to chat with people worldwide. I can relate to this because while I reside here in @CAPS2 @CAPS3, my mother and step - father live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, so I don't see them frequently. However, thanks to computers, I can communicate with them whenever I desire. Honestly, I can't fathom what my life would be like without a computer and the ability to @CAPS4 now. Nevertheless, I can also relate to one of the negative aspects of computers, which is that people spend too much time on them. I can identify with this, and many others can as well, because when I was around @NUM1, after school, I would immediately turn on my laptop and spend around @NUM2. When my grandmother arrives at @NUM3 pm, she always enters the room and scolds me, saying, ""You're on that thing too much; it's bad for your hands!"" in her characteristic way. So, in my opinion, I believe that computers can be both beneficial and detrimental to our society; for me, there is no clear - cut side to take. Others may share the same sentiment, while others @MONTH1 not. It's up to them to make a decision, so ask yourself, ""Do you believe that computers are good or bad for our society?"
168	168	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: Do you genuinely believe that computers are as excellent as they seem? Computers are so indispensable today that almost everyone owns one. They are truly remarkable, serving as outstanding means to access information, connecting individuals from across the globe, and presenting numerous @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities. Hopefully, by the conclusion of this letter, you will concur with my viewpoint. Firstly, computers assist people in obtaining information. With Google and other similar programs, computers offer an unparalleled avenue to access knowledge, placing the entire world within easy reach. In my school, surveys reveal that @PERCENT1 of all students utilize the computer to conduct research for school projects and assignments. Through computers, one can explore a multitude of diverse websites from all corners of the world on a particular topic and even access online books for reference. This is one compelling reason why computers are highly valuable, and there are two other equally significant reasons. Secondly, computers shrink the world as people start to establish connections with an ever - increasing number of individuals. More than @PERCENT2 of people engage in emailing, @CAPS2, or video - chatting on a daily basis. Isn't it wonderful when you befriend someone in college, only to discover that they live halfway across the globe, yet you can still maintain contact through the computer? Did you know that many military personnel use video - chatting to stay in touch with their loved ones back home? Computers are remarkable because they bridge the gap between people, allowing them to feel connected even when physically apart. However, there is an even more compelling reason why computers are beneficial. Finally, computers present a plethora of opportunities, such as in education and employment. According to @ORGANIZATION1, there are more single parents today than at any other time, and the number is still rising significantly in this economic climate. Some of these parents could greatly benefit from a better education to increase their income for their families, but when can they find the time to attend school amidst work and caring for their children? Now, there are numerous online college courses available that enable individuals to acquire the education they've always aspired to. Through Craigslist and other online advertisements, many people can post job offers, while others can email their resumes to apply for these positions. By viewing online job postings, people can apply more conveniently from a greater distance. Computers open up a world of opportunities for people. Computers are truly remarkable machines that many people often take for granted. They provide people with information, connect individuals from around the world, and offer numerous @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities. So, @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I hope you can understand my perspective on why computers are so extraordinary.
169	169	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, after perusing your article regarding technological advancements, I wish to share my perspective on this controversial topic. Globally, people are leveraging computers for a wide array of purposes, whether it's for gaming, buying and selling goods, or communicating with individuals in different countries; the possibilities are endless. However, this is not necessarily a positive development. A significant number of people, especially adolescents who are drawn to the games offered by computers, become addicted to them. Based on my personal experience of computer addiction, I can sincerely state that I was almost completely under the computer's control. My academic performance began to decline, I distanced myself from my friends and family, and I encountered difficulties in various aspects of my life. Many parents witness their children going through this and often feel powerless to intervene. This poses a substantial challenge for parents. My advice is simple: prevent your children from succumbing to computer addiction!
170	170	1	1	There are certain effects of computers on individuals that I both concur with and dissent from. There are numerous people worldwide who use computers daily, while others use them occasionally. Moreover, computers consistently provide information whenever they are utilized. I am of the opinion that computers generally have a positive impact on people. However, computers also have their drawbacks. It's not always the case that the computer will provide the information you need. Some websites offer accurate and useful content, while others fail to impart positive knowledge. This is one aspect of computers that I find unappealing. Nevertheless, this isn't overly problematic as computers offer numerous more enjoyable advantages. One of the most widely used and popular features globally is instant @CAPS7. Instant @CAPS7 refers to the act of communicating with another person via the internet. Many individuals use this feature to stay in touch with close family members or friends. There are several names for instant @CAPS7, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 - mail, and many others! Admittedly, computers can be highly addictive, but it's essential to take breaks and enjoy some fresh air from time to time. I agree that some people spend excessive time on computers and become extremely lethargic. This is a disadvantage that can prevent individuals from exercising and socializing with friends and family. There's no issue with using the computer for an hour or more each day, but prolonged use is not advisable. There are countless activities one can engage in on a computer; I can't list them all, including @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS7, and even online shopping. I enjoy using the computer periodically to engage in the activities I've mentioned. Additionally, if you don't own a computer, reading this @MONTH1 persuade you to get one. In my view, computers have a highly positive influence.
171	171	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1's perspective on the impacts of computers is that certain individuals are allocating an excessive amount of time to computers. While computers are beneficial for short - term use, spending the entire day on them is not advisable. @CAPS1's first rationale for believing that excessive computer use is unfavorable is that it is preferable to engage in outdoor activities with others throughout the day. One could socialize with friends, participate in sports, or pursue other endeavors. Prolonged computer use may lead to the estrangement of friendships. @CAPS1's second reason for opposing all - day computer use is that a sedentary lifestyle without exercise can result in weight gain. Instead of sitting at a computer all day, it is beneficial to take a walk outdoors or visit a gym. Exercise promotes good health, as evidenced by someone @CAPS1 knows who spends all day on the computer and rarely goes outside. Although computers offer educational value, excessive use is not healthy. @CAPS1's final point regarding the negative effects of computers is that some individuals may misuse them for unwholesome purposes, such as accessing inappropriate websites. This can lead to addiction, as one becomes engrossed in computer activities. Moreover, some people misuse computer cameras. Hence, it is better to limit computer use. These are @CAPS1's reasons for the adverse impacts computers can have on people if they do not venture outdoors to engage in activities or socialize with friends.
172	172	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I concur that individuals should curtail their excessive computer usage and instead increase physical activity or spend quality time with friends and family. While computers enable one to learn about distant locations, it is more enriching to experience these places firsthand rather than sitting at a desk. Additionally, our country ranks among the top @NUM1 nations with a high prevalence of obesity. I attribute this in part to computer use, as a significant number of students in our school have Facebook accounts, and approximately @PERCENT1 of these students spend at least an hour on the platform daily. This excessive internet use deprives people of the necessary exercise, contributing to the high obesity rate in our country. Although the internet facilitates communication with loved ones, face - to - face interaction is essential. Engaging in outdoor activities like sports or taking a stroll with friends not only promotes physical health but also strengthens relationships. Failing to do so may lead to a lack of a healthy relationship, as friends may not always be available online. Moreover, a sedentary lifestyle centered around the computer can breed laziness, causing individuals to lose interest in other activities.
173	173	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I wish to share my thoughts on computers. In today's world, computers are indispensable. Many individuals' livelihoods depend on computers, including those involved in repair, manufacturing, and sales. Moreover, numerous people work remotely and rely on computers for their jobs. Without computers, a vast number of individuals would face unemployment and reduced income. Additionally, computers are vital for educational purposes. For instance, a student with a broken finger may need to type instead of writing. Similarly, when students encounter a question without immediate assistance, they can access the internet for answers and knowledge. Computers offer various forms of assistance, such as providing directions, phone numbers, and solutions. Online shopping is also a convenient option, especially for those living far from their preferred stores. However, I advocate that children should limit their computer use and engage in outdoor exercise. Currently, the prevalence of obesity is alarmingly high. If people opted for a walk instead of prolonged computer use, the number of overweight individuals would decrease. Exercise is essential for maintaining physical and mental well - being. Without it, people may become obese, lethargic, and prone to illness and mood disorders. Therefore, it is in everyone's best interest to exercise regularly. While computers are integral to many lives, a balance with physical activity is necessary for a healthy lifestyle.
174	174	1	1	Computers are astonishing in their capabilities. They can have a profound impact on an individual's financial situation, either positively or negatively. Moreover, they can generate remarkable graphics that are beyond the reach of traditional artists. Computers are also invaluable for research activities. However, they can also consume one's life, not in the literal sense but by reducing engagement in out - of - home activities. Let's examine the benefits and challenges related to financial management. In the past, people used to store money in chests and hide them. Nowadays, financial transactions are as simple as clicking and entering a security number. One can also invest through computers, but investing is a risky endeavor with no guarantee of success. Today's computers are high - definition. Their screens are made of a liquid - crystal formula that solidifies, and the back - light pixels work to bring stunning graphics to life. Many individuals earn money by selling computer - generated graphics, which is another advantage of computers. I attended a school to learn graphic production. Teens, children, and adults all use computers for recreational activities. On modern computers, one can play games, watch videos, and listen to music. People engage in these activities for entertainment. However, some individuals may get into trouble while surfing the web. There is nothing wrong with relaxing by playing games for a while. Personally, I enjoy watching funny videos on YouTube after school and once had a YouTube account with many views. The drawback of computers is that they can disrupt personal plans and social lives. Some people become addicted, like those addicted to World of Warcraft. I once had an issue with excessive YouTube checking. Despite these problems, I believe that the benefits of computers outweigh the drawbacks.
175	175	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, computers are highly coveted in the modern era, and technological advancements are occurring at an unprecedented pace. Social networking platforms such as @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 are ubiquitous on the internet. While computers have their merits, some children consider them indispensable. Excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on society. Snacks like Oreos, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS6 are commonly consumed while using the computer. Spending hours each day sitting at the computer and consuming these snacks can lead to weight gain. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS7 children are overweight, which is a health concern. A significant portion of these overweight children use the computer daily, indicating that computers are exacerbating the obesity problem. Those who are fond of using computers typically have social network accounts, whether it's @CAPS5 or @CAPS4. Some children mistakenly believe they are immune to trouble when posting messages or pictures online. There have been tragic cases, such as a girl being harassed to the point of death due to malicious online messages. Other girls have sent nude pictures, which were then circulated, irrevocably altering their lives. If we continue to rely solely on the internet and neglect real - world social interaction, we may face challenges in the future. Instead of being confined to typing on a computer, we should explore the world and acquire practical knowledge. As @CAPS10, we should strive to be less dependent on computers. By reducing computer time, we can address these issues. Computers are remarkable tools, but they should not replace outdoor activities with friends, such as playing baseball.
176	176	1	1	Computers and the @CAPS1 were a technological breakthrough. They exposed the average world to things that were never considered possible. However, as these technologies advanced over the years, they have become such an addiction that it has begun to threaten people's lives. I have been presented with a choice: to side with the addictive computers or to oppose them. The only obvious choice is to oppose. First, computers have led to a decrease in exercise worldwide. Studies indicate that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 computer users do not exercise. With less exercise globally, nations are becoming more overweight. This is a significant problem in the United States, where computers are the primary cause of the @CAPS2.S being overweight and unhealthy. By reducing computer use, we can restore our world to good health and bring back exercise and well - being. Secondly, I'm certain you've all heard of online predators. It's terrifying just to contemplate. As computer technology has advanced, the number of online predators has increased. I recall a few years ago, while watching the news, a story about a normal teenage girl being killed by someone she met on MySpace. Such incidents still occur, and their frequency is rising. By putting people on computers, you're putting them at risk of death. This is an extreme problem caused by computers. Finally, one of the many effects of computers is that time spent on the computer is time taken away from family and friends. This can damage relationships within and outside the family. Many people have become extremely addicted to online games. The more they play, the more they distance themselves from those they knew and loved. Computers are a leading cause of dysfunctional families as they draw the user away from the outside world. These people need to reconnect with their families and friends. You must act now, before it's too late and computers have overtaken the world. If you know anyone who has succumbed to computer addiction, do what you can to help them recover. We need to rapidly reduce any form of computer use. Hurry, it's now or never.
177	177	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers offer substantial benefits to society in contemporary times. There is an abundance of knowledge to acquire on a computer, and learning via a computer is far more engaging than learning from a book. For instance, suppose a student needs to complete a report but cannot access any books. All the student has to do is enter a few keywords on the internet, and hundreds of websites related to any topic they wish to study will appear. Another way in which computers benefit society is by providing means to maintain contact with family and friends who live at a great distance. Take me as an example; I reside far from my friends. The only way I can communicate with them outside of school is through a computer. We can engage in conversations in a chat room or while playing a game. The same holds true for family. Suppose your children go on vacation and want to stay in touch. All you need to do is type as much as you like and click send, and the message will instantly reach the other computer. However, if you were to send a letter through the mail, it might take a week or two to reach your child, and vice versa. Most importantly, there are numerous fascinating activities one can undertake on a computer. There are a plethora of games to play and videos to watch. You can create music and even earn money from it. My personal favorite is computer programs, with Flash Macromedia being the best. You can create your own animation clips or even a movie. Computers are truly enjoyable to use. In today's society, computers have numerous advantages, for which I am extremely grateful. That is why I believe computers are beneficial to society.
178	178	1	1	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 play a significant role in our world today. For example, people utilize computers to obtain information, engage in chat rooms, primarily to communicate with and find friends. I believe this @CAPS6 is having a detrimental impact on people. My first reason for thinking that computers @CAPS6 are having a negative impact is due to the information available on websites. For instance, people post and blog falsehoods about others online. This is ruining many individuals as it initiates rumors and gossip. Moreover, the lies being posted can interfere with numerous lives. Another way in which computers affect people's lives is through dangerous chat rooms. This is not advisable because you are unfamiliar with the person you are conversing with. The individual could be pretending to be someone else and be highly hypocritical. The consequences of this could be extremely unpleasant. You might divulge your phone number, address, and other personal information. The outcome could be death, kidnapping, or cyberbullying. Lastly, I want to discuss the false information disseminated to thousands of people online. In other words, the ""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Your @CAPS4 love"" @CAPS2 ""@CAPS6 Your @CAPS7 @CAPS8 On You?"" @CAPS9 These are placed on either side of your screen to extract money from you. On the one hand, they attract the readers' attention. For example, these passages are designed to copy your phone number, obtain your account number, and then steal your money. This does not benefit our people as it exists solely for financial gain. In conclusion, from my perspective, I do not consider computers an ideal way for people to spend their time."
179	179	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, You @MONTH1 may have heard that there are both advantages and disadvantages to using a computer. However, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. For example, you can communicate with others, conduct business, and use it for learning purposes. In today's era of rapid technological progress, a computer is an essential tool. Communication via phone is no longer as convenient as it once was because people are often occupied and on their computers. You can use computers to interact with individuals from different countries, enabling us to gain insights into their way of life. Through social networks such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can make plans with friends. Computers are a crucial communication technology. Currently, most business operations are conducted over the internet or using a computer. The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is fully computerized today, which is a major mode of trade. Many business transactions and presentations are carried out on a computer to maximize efficiency. Computers allow us to conduct business with foreign countries without the need to travel there. They represent a significant advancement in the business world. Computers also facilitate extensive learning. Search engines enable us to enter keywords and access multiple websites on any given topic. We can conduct research and obtain accurate information with just a click. This research can be utilized to write essays at school. Computers assist us in learning both within and outside the school environment. A computer is a remarkable technological advancement with diverse applications. Although it @MONTH1 may have a few drawbacks, its advantages are far more numerous. Computers enable you to communicate, conduct business, and learn. Life would be significantly slower without computers to expedite processes.
180	180	1	1	In my view, the presence of computers is highly beneficial and contributes positively to our society. I hold this opinion for three reasons. Firstly, it enables people to relax and unwind after a long day at work. Secondly, it allows individuals to communicate with their friends. Thirdly, it aids in schoolwork and simplifies tasks. These are just a few of the reasons why computers are advantageous to society. Firstly, I would like to emphasize that after a long day of work, all one desires is to relax. Television can become monotonous, and playing games on the computer is an excellent way to unwind. You can visit @CAPS2 to watch amusing videos or access @CAPS3 to view your friends' new photo albums. Your personal computer offers a multitude of possibilities. There are numerous games, such as @CAPS4 come or @CAPS5 cam, which can be extremely enjoyable. Can you see why computers are an effective means of calming down? Apart from helping you relax after a strenuous workday, computers also enable you to communicate with friends and family. AIM is a great platform for chatting with friends and planning get - togethers. Alternatively, you can have a simple conversation. @CAPS3 and @CAPS7 are excellent websites for staying in touch with old friends and even making new ones. Many teenagers and adults use @CAPS3 because it is so engaging that they find it difficult to disengage. As you grow older, you tend to communicate less with your friends, and eventually, you may have few friends left. @CAPS3 prevents this by allowing you to stay in constant contact. It is essential to maintain friendships. Most importantly, computers are indispensable for schoolwork. Without a computer, you cannot retrieve pictures from @ORGANIZATION1 or type an essay. Additionally, you cannot search for words on @LOCATION1. Some teachers require essays to be typed, and in such cases, a computer is necessary. I visit the school's website to check for homework assignments, and teachers often post extra - credit opportunities online. In conclusion, computers are beneficial to society. Firstly, they allow you to relax and unwind. Secondly, they facilitate communication with old and new friends. Thirdly, and most importantly, they are highly useful for schoolwork and accessing information. Now, you should understand why computers are important and useful in society.
181	181	1	1	"Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers, which are machines, have existed for @MONTH1 years. With the internet, one can engage in activities such as playing games, conducting research for information, and even communicating with friends and family, all via a computer. Advancements in computer technology are advantageous to @CAPS1 society for several reasons. These include that computers enhance hand - eye coordination, offer copious information, and enable people to communicate online. As previously mentioned, utilizing a computer can improve hand - eye coordination. In fact, it is well - known that computers can significantly improve one's reflexes. This brings to mind a time when my brother visited an eye doctor and was informed that his eyes had difficulty focusing. Patrick, my brother, was then effectively assigned by the doctor to play computer games to aid his hand - eye coordination. In fact, @PERCENT1 concur that computers can have a colossal, positive impact on reflexes and hand - eye coordination. If computers are helpful in this regard and, in some cases, essential for one's eyes, then why would the use of computers be regarded as detrimental when they are clearly a beneficial element in @CAPS1 society? Computers are also beneficial because of their vast resourcefulness. The internet provides an abundance of information for people of all ages who aspire to learn and prosper. For example, the majority of schools have their students employ computers for research. When I refer to the majority of schools, I mean @PERCENT2 of schools assign students to conduct research using a computer. The principal of New City @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2, states, ""@CAPS1 students use computers at least weekly, if not more frequently. They are an excellent resource with limitless information."" Computers are a gateway to an innumerable amount of knowledge that everyone should have access to. It is widely recognized that almost everyone knows someone who resides far away. I, myself, have a friend who lives in @LOCATION1 whom I miss dearly. When long - distance phone calls are prohibitively expensive in most parts of the world, I rely on computers to converse with my distant friends. Computers serve as the bridge between @CAPS2 (my @CAPS3 friend) and me. However, computers are not solely used for long - distance communication. I also use computers to send emails, instant messages, engage in video chats, and simply stay connected with family and friends. A local teenage boy, @PERSON1, remarks, ""I use my computer to maintain connections with friends and my family who live in another county. I'm unsure what I would do without it."" This implies that @PERSON1 and thousands of others depend on computers for communication with friends and family. Computers are necessary for @MONTH1 reasons. They assist people, educate them, and connect them. In my opinion, one must have access to a computer in order to thrive in life."
182	182	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I believe that more individuals should refrain from spending excessive time on their computers. The reasons for my stance are as follows: first, people ought to spend quality time with their family and friends; second, they need to increase their physical activity; and finally, they should venture outdoors to appreciate nature. My initial reason is that individuals who own computers tend to seclude themselves in their rooms throughout the day, depriving themselves of fresh air. They should go outside and immerse themselves in nature. Those who have a passion for animals and enjoy studying them should venture outdoors, breathe in the fresh air, observe the animals, and conduct studies on them. While it is acceptable to study animals via a computer, one should not become overly reliant on it. Instead, they should go outside and observe the animals directly rather than fixating on the computer screen. My second reason is that people need to engage in more physical exercise. Many individuals are gaining weight because they spend hours sitting in front of the computer, remaining sedentary. People are becoming increasingly lethargic each day due to their excessive computer use @NUM1. If you enjoy using the computer for study purposes, consider taking a walk, going for a run, jogging, or riding a bike for a while. My final reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family. People should step away from the computer and make plans with their family. Organize a get - together with your family, visit places, and relax. Those who are constantly on the computer do not spend sufficient time with their family and are oblivious to what is happening around them. Some individuals even fall into depression because they spend too much time on the computer and not enough time with their loved ones. These are the reasons why I believe that we should limit our computer usage. We should allocate more time to be with friends and family, or go outside and relish the beauty of nature.
183	183	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I overheard a conversation among some individuals regarding the amount of time their families devote to using computers. In my view, people should avoid spending extended periods of time staring at a computer screen. I hold this opinion because it detracts from time that could be spent on important tasks, and there are healthier alternatives to confining oneself to a computer monitor, such as going outdoors or engaging in physical activity. Another reason is that it allows for more time to be spent in the company of family and friends. Firstly, one should not squander excessive time on the computer. There are other tasks that could be accomplished, such as @CAPS2 working, or for most teenagers, completing homework. Studies indicate that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers are easily distracted by social networking websites such as @CAPS1, ""Twitter"", and ""AOL"". Workers in the workplace are also prone to distraction. At times, when the job becomes monotonous, employees turn to the computer instead of fulfilling their work responsibilities. Children could be performing household chores or offering assistance around the house, but they choose to use the computer instead. A typical routine for teenagers often involves waking up, getting ready, using the computer, going to school, returning home, having a snack, and then returning to the computer. We need to break these habits of constantly gravitating towards the computer. Staring at a computer screen for long durations is detrimental to one's health. Instead, one could participate in a sport or simply go outside and play. According to a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1, ""As @CAPS2 technology advances, seizure rates have also increased."" Participating in a sport would be both healthier and more enjoyable than engaging in online conversations. Moreover, one does not engage in physical exercise while using the computer, and being active helps maintain a good physique while being fun. The most crucial reason for limiting computer use is that it consumes valuable time that could be spent with family and friends. Many people rarely see their family when they are at home because they are engrossed in the computer. Laptops have made it easier for people to isolate themselves. Bringing a laptop into one's room and closing the door is a common practice. Wouldn't it be more rewarding to meet up with the friends you communicate with online in person? In conclusion, we should restrict our computer usage to focus on other tasks, engage in physical activity, and spend quality time with friends and family."
184	184	1	1	Dear readers of the newspaper, I believe that you should be cautious about allowing your @CAPS1 to spend more than an hour a day on the computer. The reasons for my concern are significant and I hope you will consider them carefully. Firstly, excessive computer use can cause your @CAPS1 to lose focus in school. When @CAPS1 are engrossed in the computer, their minds are preoccupied with the virtual world, making it difficult for them to concentrate on their studies. They may become so fixated on the computer that they neglect their academic responsibilities. To illustrate, they may constantly think about the next game or online activity instead of paying attention in class. This lack of focus can have a detrimental impact on their academic performance. Secondly, allowing your @CAPS1 to spend too much time on the computer can lead to an addiction - like behavior. Just as one can become addicted to drugs, @CAPS1 can become addicted to the computer. They may constantly @CAPS2 about the computer, and their conversations may revolve solely around it. This can make them seem as if they have no real - life interests or social skills. It is important to prevent your @CAPS1 from falling into this trap, as it can isolate them from the real world and hinder their personal development. Most importantly, excessive computer use can lead to weight gain and a sedentary lifestyle. Your @CAPS1 may only get up to use the bathroom or eat, and they will rarely engage in physical activity. They will not go outside to play or explore nature, which is essential for their physical and mental well - being. This lack of exercise can lead to various health problems, including obesity and related diseases. I speak from personal experience. My brother is currently in the hospital due to excessive computer use. The doctor has given a grim prognosis, and I am praying for his recovery. I hope you will not let your @CAPS1 go through the same ordeal. It can have a lasting and negative impact on their lives. Thank you for taking the time to read this article. I sincerely hope that you will remember these points and make informed decisions regarding your @CAPS1's computer usage.
185	185	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, There are numerous individuals who utilize computers, this advanced technological marvel. Many people believe that the advent of computers has brought about a multitude of benefits. However, not everyone shares this view. There are many who oppose the excessive use of computers, arguing that it detracts from time that could be spent enjoying nature, engaging in physical exercise, and interacting with friends and family. Nevertheless, I believe that computers offer several advantages for users, such as facilitating communication with those who are not physically present and providing access to a wealth of information, which gives people something productive to do. One of the impacts that computers have on individuals is that they enable communication with people whom one may not frequently encounter in person. This is because not all of one's friends attend the same school, resulting in limited face - to - face interactions. However, through platforms such as email, MySpace, and Facebook, it becomes easier to stay in touch. Instead of traveling long distances to meet friends, one can communicate with them online. I believe that when there are other activities to be done, computers can still serve as a convenient means of communication. The second impact of computers on people is that they provide a vast source of information. Consider a situation where one has to complete a project but lacks sufficient information. With a computer, one can access a plethora of resources and find the necessary information. The internet offers endless websites filled with valuable data, making it an ideal tool for research. Additionally, when planning a trip, one can use the computer to determine the cost, travel time, and other details. This information is readily available on various websites, and it would be difficult to obtain it through other means. The third impact of computers on people is that they offer a source of entertainment and engagement. There are times when one may have nothing specific to do and may feel bored. In such situations, the computer can provide a variety of activities, such as playing games or watching videos on YouTube. For example, one can watch funny videos that keep them entertained. Another option is to download music. If one has some free time and nothing else to do, they can take advantage of the computer to engage in these activities. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a significant impact on people. While there are concerns about how people spend their time on computers, I firmly believe that there are many positive effects. These include the ability to communicate with others, access information, and have something to do during leisure time. I hope that you will agree with my perspective.
186	186	1	1	Esteemed Newspaper, I am penning this letter to advocate for the inclusion of an article in your publication regarding the detrimental impacts of computers on individuals. Computers render one unhealthy, facilitate cyberbullying, and influence academic performance. Firstly, computers exert adverse effects on people as they contribute to poor health. This assertion stems from the fact that the majority of individuals fail to engage in sufficient physical activity. Subsequently, a lack of exercise leads to obesity. Eventually, one may or may not develop diabetes due to obesity, yet in most cases, it does occur. The subsequent reason for the negative effects of computers is that children experience bullying on the internet. This is significant because when children are bullied, they develop a poor self - image. Subsequently, they become profoundly depressed. This phenomenon is referred to as cyberbullying. For instance, a man visited our school to discuss his son, who had committed suicide as a result of being bullied both online and at school. This exemplifies why bullying is a crucial issue and why computers have a negative impact on people. My third and final reason for the adverse effects of computers on people is that children perform poorly in school. They underperform because they allocate excessive time to using the computer, causing them to neglect their homework and preparation for tests and quizzes. Additionally, children are distracted in school as they are preoccupied with the thought of returning home to use the computer. Moreover, children may eventually perceive school as a waste of time and drop out. It is a well - established fact that @PERCENT1 of the students who have dropped out of school were those who were constantly on the computer and regarded school as a waste of time. This is how computers affect academic performance. Now, bear in mind that computers have negative effects on people as they compromise health, enable bullying, and impact schoolwork. This is how computers exert a detrimental influence on individuals.
187	187	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that individuals should possess computers. I hold this view because children can engage in educational games, such as math games or reading - related games, to enhance their learning. Adults, on the other hand, can access websites to watch workout videos and settle their bills online. Additionally, computers are invaluable when children need to complete their homework. Nevertheless, computers also have drawbacks. For example, children may claim to be doing their homework while actually browsing YouTube, MySpace, or Facebook. Despite these negative aspects, the advantages of computers far outweigh the disadvantages. This is the rationale behind my belief that we should have computers.
188	188	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, there is a divergence of opinion regarding computers. Some contend that computers have a detrimental impact on family and friends, while others assert that they are an indispensable aspect of society. I wholeheartedly concur with the latter group. Computers empower students to conduct research for school - related information that they may require. People can communicate with their friends via platforms such as Facebook or @CAPS1. Moreover, one can compose a rough draft on the computer, save it, and then revisit it to make the necessary final adjustments. I will expound on these points in the following three paragraphs. Computers offer a rapid and convenient means of gathering information for school projects or papers. While I understand the concern that computers may encroach on family time, the same can be said about books. In fact, books may consume more time and yield less information. For example, a book may cover multiple subjects, and one may read the entire volume only to glean a few sentences of relevant information. Another advantage of computer research is its efficiency. One can access a page, extract information, and when the information on that page is exhausted, simply click on another link to continue the search. Without computers, individuals would have to visit the library and spend a significant amount of time searching for materials. Is it truly worthwhile to expend so much time? People can interact with their friends on Facebook or @CAPS1. Some argue that computers distract from real - life friendships, but in reality, they facilitate more frequent communication. For instance, when on vacation, one may grow weary of constant interaction with family and yearn for the company of friends. All one needs to do is turn on the computer to establish a connection. Chat rooms also provide an opportunity to meet individuals of the same age from neighboring towns or anywhere in the country. These new acquaintances may even become one's new best friends. When writing a paper, would one prefer to write it multiple times? There is a more straightforward alternative: the computer. One can write the first draft and then simply reread it and make necessary changes to obtain the final version. Computers also assist with spelling. All one has to do is press a button.
189	189	1	1	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1, technology is ubiquitous, and this trend is unlikely to change. Implementing a schedule can be beneficial, and encouragement can have a profound impact on many individuals. Engaging in activities can divert one's attention from other concerns. Read on to discover more. Scheduling is of utmost importance. It is advisable to limit computer usage. For every half - hour of computer time, allocate at least @NUM1 minutes to outdoor activities or socializing with friends. Endeavor to commit the schedule to memory. Encouragement has a positive effect on me and numerous others. Try to motivate family members and friends. The government is also taking steps to address this issue. Encouragement truly helps. Activities can effectively reduce computer usage. Consider participating in neighborhood activities or after - school programs. There are a plethora of enjoyable options. Do you believe that scheduling is effective? Do you appreciate encouragement? Do activities help you focus less on other matters? If so, these strategies can be highly beneficial.
190	190	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, can you envision a world where technology dictates human interaction? This is not an outlandish concept. Some may perceive this as a remarkable advancement, but I hold a different view. I believe that computers isolate people from reality, foster false identities, and offer no physical benefits. These are the impacts I believe computers have on individuals. Firstly, computers detach people from the real world. It is far easier for someone to remain seated at a computer, aimlessly browsing a social networking site, than to venture out and meet new people in person. Certainly, one can send as many friend requests as desired, but nothing can compare to the first - hand impression gained from meeting someone face - to - face. Computers can also affect family relationships and the time spent with loved ones. Secondly, computers create false personas. If I had a Facebook or @CAPS3 account, it would be effortless to fabricate false information about myself or others. The computer lacks the ability to discern the truth. This enables individuals to form “friendships” with those who are unaware of the real person. I consider this a serious problem as it may ultimately lead to unstable relationships. Lastly, I believe that computers offer no physical advantages. Our nation is currently facing a severe health crisis. With the easy availability of fast food and drugs, I do not believe that computers contribute positively. People need self - discipline, and there is an appropriate time and place for everything, including computer use. However, those lacking self - control may overuse computers, which is detrimental. So, can you imagine a world dominated by computers? I believe that gradually, this is becoming a reality, slowly eroding the human element. I anticipate that the consequences will be severe, including detachment from reality, the creation of false identities, and the absence of physical benefits. I do not believe this is right, and I sincerely hope that I have convinced you to share my perspective.
191	191	1	1	Dear The @CAPS1, I comprehend that you harbor certain apprehensions regarding computers. Nevertheless, I opine that such concerns are unwarranted. Computers possess an array of positive attributes. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning about distant locales and individuals, and enable online communication with family and friends. Firstly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination. There exists a plethora of engaging online games that can augment reflexes and eyesight. This can aid in rehabilitating or improving some individuals' reflexes by sharpening their visual acuity. Another remarkable aspect of computers is the ability to gain knowledge about far - off places and people. This is highly advantageous as, if one desires to visit a distant location but is unable to do so, accessing the computer and conducting a search can evoke a sense of being there. It can also assist in studying individuals who reside far away and whom one may never meet in person. Finally, when using a computer, one can engage in online conversations with family and friends. There are numerous websites where one can interact and socialize with loved ones. Computers are extremely useful as they foster togetherness and happiness among family and friends. In conclusion, I believe that computers are an outstanding, enjoyable, and beneficial invention. Bear in mind these positive traits of computers and refrain from removing them; we rely on them.
192	192	1	1	How many times per @MONTH1 do you utilize the computer in a single day? Quite frequently, I presume. I firmly believe that computers undoubtedly contribute to the betterment of society. The internet offers substantial assistance to numerous individuals due to its remarkable convenience. Computers empower people to engage in online communication with others. The internet, accessible via computers, simplifies the lives of many. One instance is in the realm of education. From personal experience, I can attest that the internet is a valuable resource. When I lack sufficient study materials, the internet provides the necessary support. Another reason for the internet's usefulness is in the job market. Are you aware that @PERCENT1 of individuals aged @NUM1 have internet - based jobs? Moreover, the internet can assist individuals in job hunting. The final advantage of the internet is in the domain of shopping. I recall a time when I needed a specific book for school, and no local bookstore had it. My mother successfully ordered it online. Undoubtedly, the internet is of great help to numerous people. Another reason computers are beneficial to our society is that they afford people the opportunity to explore distant places. Many individuals cannot afford to travel extensively outside the United States. With computers, people can learn about these places and even gain a virtual experience of being there. Sometimes, it can almost replicate the actual experience. Another scenario where computers prove useful is when one is curious and wishes to learn more. Once, my family attended a wedding in @LOCATION1, but we knew little about the area. @CAPS1, we turned to the internet to discover details such as the local cuisine and the weather conditions. Additionally, people can learn about their ancestral origins. If individuals know the place their ancestors hailed from, they can use computers to find recipes, religious practices, and celebrated holidays. Evidently, computers facilitate learning about far - off places. My final reason for the benefits of computers to society is that they enable people to communicate with others. Sometimes, close friends may lose touch, but through the internet, they can reconnect. Did you know that there are websites that can tell you the whereabouts of your high - school classmates? There are also platforms like Facebook for social connection. Moreover, people can meet new individuals online. There are numerous dating sites that connect people through the internet. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of people on dating sites arrange meetings? Sometimes, long - distance calls are impractical, and online chat platforms like Google Chat are extremely helpful. Without a doubt, computers are highly beneficial.
193	193	1	1	Dear @PERSON1 weekly, the dawn of the new millennium ushered in a novel wave of technology. Computers, the primary invention, are likely utilized by everyone. They impart valuable knowledge, such as information about vacation destinations or distant countries. Moreover, computers enable communication with friends and family, whether they are nearby or far away. Additionally, typing on a computer enhances hand - eye coordination, which can be advantageous in other aspects of life. Undoubtedly, the computer is an exceptional invention. Have you ever yearned to embark on an overseas vacation? The computer serves as an excellent resource for learning about such places, with potentially significant impacts. For instance, one might initially plan to visit the Bahamas but discover new locations like @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION3. Furthermore, computers are highly beneficial to students. Students often undertake projects on global locations, and the computer is their primary source of information. Whenever I have an essay to write, I always turn to the computer first. Recently, my grandmother relocated to @LOCATION2, and while I can only communicate with her on the phone, the computer allows me to see her via webcam. This enables me to maintain contact with loved ones whom I do not see regularly. For example, platforms like @CAPS1 or Twitter help keep in touch with high - school friends. Computers also facilitate email communication with family and friends, allowing for occasional greetings. Sports demand a high level of hand - eye coordination, and computers can enhance this skill. By looking at the screen while typing, one simultaneously engages in two tasks, thereby improving hand - eye coordination. A sport that requires such coordination is @CAPS2. When the ball is in the air, one must focus on it while positioning the stick correctly. Although hand - eye coordination is primarily honed through the capabilities of the computer. In conclusion, I wish to emphasize that the computer is an invaluable source of knowledge. It enables us to stay connected with high - school friends and distant family members and teaches us hand - eye coordination. The computer is an indispensable piece of technology.
194	194	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you envision our society evolving into one characterized by obesity, laziness, and a lack of appreciation for family and friends? @CAPS2, do you desire a society devoid of respect for nature? Excessive computer usage will lead our society to become indolent, overly reliant on technology, and potentially brainwashed. People will neglect their family and friends. Most crucially, our society will lose all appreciation and respect for mother nature. Is this the world you wish to inhabit? Have you ever read @CAPS3 @NUM1? In the book, the government employs technology to manipulate and brainwash people. If our society, like the one in the book, becomes overly dependent on computers and technology, we will experience an internal collapse, transitioning from a respected world power to a third - world country. We will need to redesign buildings to accommodate our larger bodies. Our nation will no longer command respect. There may be charities in other countries to fund the construction of gyms and pools, yet they will likely remain unused. Recent research from @ORGANIZATION1 indicates that @PERCENT1 of individuals who spend over an hour and a half on their computers daily weigh more than @NUM2 pounds. People may forget how to communicate verbally. Babies may learn to type before learning to talk or walk. Is this beneficial for our country? It is often said that a supportive family and a circle of good friends are life's greatest treasures. According to @PERSON1, a renowned psychologist, ""Individuals with more friends have a @PERCENT2 reduced risk of depression."" Friends have a tangible impact on one's health. Excessive computer users tend to lose friends and become estranged from their families. The resulting mental health issues can be severe, and people will regrettably miss out on the positive aspects of life. It is essential for people to be happy, but if communication is limited to email and social networking sites, one is not sufficiently social. While online chatting has its merits, face - to - face interaction is far more rewarding than viewing a picture on a screen. No one desires such an outcome, so it is imperative to limit computer usage. Excessive computer use also leads to a lack of respect for nature. People once held nature in high regard for various reasons, the most significant being its daily influence on our lives and possessions. Everything, including ourselves, has its roots in nature. Even the weather can have a profound impact on us. We depend on nature, and if we fail to respect it, it may turn against us. Moderation is key, even when it comes to computers. Excessive use can have detrimental consequences. Our society will lose its respect, our relationships will suffer, and we will lose all respect for nature. The time to limit computer usage is now, or we will face numerous grave problems."
195	195	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1's concept regarding ""Computers"" is truly innovative and well - conceived. Undoubtedly, in contemporary times, we rely on computers for information retrieval. Why has this need arisen now when computers did not exist previously? Research indicates that over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 assert that computers are indispensable. Allow me to elaborate further. Firstly, computers enable us to explore places, communicate with friends and family. @CAPS1's view on using the local internet is that it is beneficial primarily for those with knowledge in this area, and I do not intend to be disrespectful. For younger individuals, it is advisable to be in bed by @NUM1 pm, and one should never overlook the beauty of nature and the fresh air outside. In conclusion, the internet in today's world is highly beneficial to people."
196	196	1	1	In the contemporary era at @LOCATION2, the utilization of computers is an exceptionally beneficial phenomenon. This assertion stems from the fact that individuals employ computers for research purposes, to maintain communication with friends and family, and for engaging with music. These activities are equally essential for both adults and children. Continue reading, and I shall elucidate the significance of this. My initial rationale for deeming computers advantageous is that they serve as an excellent resource for conducting in - depth research on specific topics. Across @LOCATION1, children leverage the internet to complete class projects. Adults can utilize computers to search for particular food recipes. Whenever one requires assistance, the computer is invariably available. Some individuals even rely on computers for their professional endeavors. Computers can facilitate numerous tasks. Another compelling reason for the usefulness of computers is the ability to stay connected with friends and family. A remarkable feature on computers is the webcam. With this device, one can visually communicate with others via a small camera, even if they are geographically distant. One can also access platforms like MySpace or Facebook. These two websites are utilized for sharing pictures and interacting with selected friends. It is an effective means for people to get acquainted with one another. A comparable option is instant messaging, which enables online conversations with friends. Do not cease reading; there is more to come! My final reason for considering computers to be an outstanding asset is the extensive range of music - related activities they offer. One can use computers to listen to music and transfer music to an iPod or @NUM1 player. Some individuals utilize computers to compose music. One can acquire a program to create beats and assemble them into a song. Music is a universal delight cherished by all age groups. This is why I firmly believe that owning a computer is an extremely positive development. One can conduct research, maintain contact with loved ones, and engage extensively with music. There are far more than these @NUM2 benefits that a computer can provide. I am convinced that the world would be unrecognizable without computers.
197	197	1	1	"Dear newspaper, I am cognizant that computers can exert a captivating influence on individuals, yet in reality, they are among the most indispensable tools in our lives. Computers serve a multitude of purposes, such as assisting with schoolwork, planning that long - awaited trip, and keeping abreast of the latest news. Read on to comprehend the true significance of computers. Consider a scenario where you have a science project on protoplasms due. You aspire to achieve the best possible outcome. When you discover that the sole book you find on the subject fails to provide the information necessary for the desired score, you realize that the next logical step is to turn to the computer. The computer offers an inexhaustible supply of information that can enhance any report. For instance, when a teacher assigns a biography on ""The life and times: @PERSON1,"" you may wish to delve deeper and explore aspects like his neighborhood, sources of inspiration, and the influences he encountered. All this information can be readily found on the computer. When you come across a ""five nights and four days"" trip to @ORGANIZATION1 on sale, you naturally want to find the best deal. When you recognize that your family is in need of a vacation, the computer is the only viable option for research. You cannot expect to find the ideal trip of a lifetime in a book. While you may learn that @CAPS1 is having a significant sale, you cannot search for the most advantageous deal without a computer. I conducted a survey with seven of my friends, and it was revealed that six out of the seven parents had booked a trip to @ORGANIZATION1 through their accounts. If you are an avid fan of road trips, you can only discover the best deals or @CAPS2's lowest prices via the computer. If you reside in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4 and plan a trip to @LOCATION1, the deals available on the computer can be highly beneficial. If you live in @LOCATION2 and are aware that the hottest day in @DATE1 is approaching, you will be eager to prepare for the beach. However, if you consider computers a waste of time, you will remain oblivious to the fact that all the beaches will be open and offering free drinks throughout the day. Instead, you will be at home, consuming a @CAPS3.V. and watching old reruns of The @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Not only does the computer provide local news, but it also keeps you informed about significant events such as the devastating earthquake in @LOCATION5. You will learn about the relief efforts and how you can contribute. Therefore, computers are not only useful for online activities like @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 but can also help you achieve an A+ on your history report. They can create lasting memories for your children and ensure that you are well - prepared to enjoy the day in @DATE1 rather than being confined to your home. Perhaps after finding a great deal or helping your child improve their grades, you will fully appreciate the value of computers."
198	198	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, statistics indicate that @PERCENT1 of the population in @LOCATION2 alone spend the majority of their time on computers or laptops. I firmly believe that the impact of computers on humans is predominantly negative, as it leads to a lack of physical exercise and diminishes face - to - face interaction. As a society, we must address this issue to create a healthier environment. The number of individuals who fail to engage in sufficient exercise has increased significantly over the past decade. Doctor @PERSON1, an expert in the relationship between health and computer usage, surveyed @NUM1 people. Astonishingly, @PERCENT2 of them reported rarely going outdoors because they are entrapped in the digital realm. This startling statistic reveals that only one in twenty people actually engage in any form of physical activity. @PERSON2 stated, ""This alarming statistic implies that the majority, if not all, of the population is physically unfit, a problem that demands immediate attention."" @CAPS3 further elaborated that excessive computer use and a sedentary lifestyle are the primary contributors to poor health. In addition to the lack of exercise, many individuals are losing the vital physical interaction that is essential for human well - being. As technology has advanced, most people have become so engrossed in their digital devices that they miss out on the normal face - to - face interactions they would have otherwise experienced. @PERSON3 concurred with this view, stating, ""I am a college graduate with a degree, but it wasn't always this way. When I was younger, I was addicted to my computer. As soon as I got home from school, I would immerse myself in it. I didn't even talk to my family. If I could turn back time, I would change my behavior."" This statement underscores the importance of physical interaction. @PERSON3 regretted his past actions and made a conscious effort to change once he reached high school. No one desires to live with regrets, which is why maintaining physical human interactions is crucial for a fulfilling life. The lack of exercise and physical interaction are pressing issues that require immediate solutions. In conclusion, the widespread use of computers has given rise to a growing epidemic in @LOCATION1. The primary reasons for the negative impact of computers on humans are the limited physical activity they promote and the significant reduction in face - to - face interactions. Thank you for your attention, and remember: computers can have a detrimental effect on many people's lives."
199	199	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, the rhythmic click - clack sounds you hear are the keys of @ORGANIZATION2 computers being struck at this very moment. In contemporary society, computers have become ubiquitous, even in the most impoverished regions like @LOCATION3. In @LOCATION2, these time - consuming and often detrimental computers are eroding the essence and joys of @ORGANIZATION2 life that are rightfully ours. Computers have become our primary source of information and leisure, yet we are neglecting the fact that there is a rich and fulfilling life beyond the digital screen, such as spending quality time with family and immersing ourselves in the beauty of nature. Excessive computer use is having a severe impact on our health. Computers can cause a plethora of serious problems, including vision impairment and obesity. This is primarily due to the fact that we spend long hours sitting in front of the screen without engaging in any physical activity. Computers are like insidious predators that gradually consume our minds and bodies, leaving us in a state of despair. Do you not agree? Did you know that according to @ORGANIZATION2, the second leading cause of obesity is computer use? It is indeed true! I have personally experienced the adverse effects of excessive computer use. During my childhood, at the age of @NUM1, I was completely addicted to the computer. My eyes were glued to the screen day and night, and my mind was preoccupied solely with the digital world. My mother was furious and repeatedly scolded me to stay away from the computer, but I was unable to break free from its hold. Slowly but surely, I began to gain weight, and I eventually discovered that I was overweight for my age. To this day, I have not been able to shed the pounds I gained from my excessive computer use, and I am certain that many others are in the same situation. Obesity is not solely caused by overeating; it is also a result of a lack of cardiovascular exercise, which computers prevent us from engaging in. Therefore, it is evident that computers are detrimental to our health. As reported by @PERCENT1 of the population in the state of @LOCATION1, computers are also encroaching on family time. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of families are unable to spend as much time together as they would like, primarily due to computer use? Children are engrossed in computer games, mothers are searching for recipes online for dinner, and fathers are trading stocks on the internet. Instead of engaging in meaningful family activities, they are glued to their screens. In my own family, we used to have a lot of quality time together, but since the advent of the computer, I rarely get to interact with my family. According to @ORGANIZATION2, children who spend more time with their families are more likely to become better parents in the future. I am confident that you are a caring family person, and I urge you to take action and limit computer use to bring families closer together. @LOCATION1 is blessed with the most breathtaking natural scenery, with beautiful birds, fascinating animals, and the enchanting seasons of @DATE1 and fall. If anyone wishes to experience the wonders of nature, @LOCATION1 is the ideal destination. However, it is disheartening to note that the residents of @LOCATION1 are failing to appreciate the beauty of nature because they are too preoccupied with their computers. I recall one instance when we went on a camping trip. We were all excited to enjoy nature, but a boy brought his computer. To our dismay, everyone forgot about nature and started playing with the computer. Many people missed out on the opportunity to witness the magnificent yellow @CAPS3 and other natural wonders. It is truly unfortunate that so many people are missing out on these precious experiences. People today are failing to appreciate the beauty of nature, and they will surely regret it one day. As nature may not always be accessible, we should not allow computers to dictate our lives. Instead, we should take control and make the most of our time. The decision is in our hands; we must choose to say no to excessive computer use. Let us go outside, enjoy nature, spend time with our families, and prioritize our health. We are intelligent and well - informed individuals, and we should not let computers control our lives. Although computers can be entertaining and useful, their negative impacts far outweigh their benefits. Say no to computers, or you will surely regret it.
200	200	1	1	"Dear Readers of @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, it has come to my attention that there is a debate regarding the impact of computers on people. I firmly believe that having computers in our lives is highly beneficial. Firstly, computers assist students in enhancing the quality of their schoolwork. Secondly, they enable us to gain knowledge about distant places and other countries. Lastly, computers facilitate online communication with others through webcams. My first reason for advocating the use of computers is their invaluable assistance in schoolwork. When teachers assign essays, for example, if students complete their work on a computer, it appears neater and more professional, which can potentially lead to higher grades. This is particularly true for college students. A college university once conducted a poll, and @PERCENT1 of the students admitted that they would be at a loss without their computers or laptops. One student even said, ""If I didn't have my laptop, I would probably fail most of my classes."" Clearly, computers play a crucial role in students' academic success. My second reason for considering computers beneficial is their ability to provide information about far - flung places and other countries. I conducted a poll to determine how many people use computers to stay informed about global events, and @PERCENT2 of the respondents stated that they rely on computers to learn about what is happening in other countries. Computers are an excellent resource for anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of the world. My final reason for the usefulness of computers is their role in facilitating communication. Suppose you are married and pregnant (assuming you are not the father), and your spouse is in @LOCATION2. Thanks to webcams, you can have a face - to - face conversation with them whenever you need to. So, dear readers of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I hope you can now understand why I believe that having computers is a positive thing. They help students excel in their schoolwork, allow us to explore and learn about different parts of the world, and provide a means of staying connected with loved ones through webcams."
201	201	1	1	Computers and contemporary technology are progressing at a rapid pace, and an increasing number of individuals are commencing to utilize them. Some individuals assert that computers exert a detrimental influence on @LOCATION1. I hold a contrary view. I opine that computers represent an astonishing breakthrough in modern science. I am of the belief that computers are eminently suitable for schoolwork and communication with others, provided they are employed in moderation. Computers render school projects so straightforward that I am uncertain whether we could manage without them. Our social studies teacher @PERSON1 states that @PERCENT1 of his projects involve something related to the computer. The internet is an excellent resource for conducting research for substantial papers and projects. With over thirty million educational and informational websites, it is facile to locate the requisite information promptly and effortlessly. Once you have concluded your research, it is uncomplicated to type your report. If it is not a written report, then there are numerous other programs available for elaborate presentations. Take Microsoft @CAPS1 as an illustration: you can create exotic backgrounds and texts, as well as distinctive animations to emphasize or make it stand out vividly. Computers also serve as an ideal means of communicating with friends and family. Email is swift and convenient for conveying your thoughts to others. If you desire to chat, you can utilize @CAPS2 or instant messaging. This enables you to type and send emails more expeditiously. Both of these programs are an innovative way to converse with a family member who is not at home. For instance, let's say my father travels to @LOCATION2 on business. We can exchange emails daily. And now, with @ORGANIZATION1 (a video chat), you can visually perceive the person and engage in a real - time conversation as if they were present at home. Computers possess their advantages, yet they also have drawbacks. Computers are superb for communication and schoolwork, but excessive usage can be detrimental to health. Here is an example: my older brother @PERSON2 is a senior in high school. He attends school from @NUM1 to @NUM2:pm, and upon returning home, he heads directly to his computer. He spends at least five hours on it each night, leaving little time for dinner and very little else, including sleep. I believe that computers are a remarkable innovation in modern technology as long as individuals exercise self - restraint. Computers are unveiling new features daily, and who can fathom what they will be like...
202	202	1	1	I wholeheartedly concur with those who contend that computers currently have a pernicious impact on us. Although computers are remarkable, they do entail numerous adverse effects on their users. New technology, such as webcams for video chatting and cellphones for taking pictures, @CAPS1, nonetheless, it has negative consequences. There have been numerous suicides attributed to cyberbullying, which occurs when individuals harass children via the internet. Additionally, some individuals transmit explicit pictures online or even during webcam sessions. This is not only illegal but also preposterous that both young and older individuals would engage in such actions. Moreover, there are websites where people can post highly personal pictures of you, which can significantly alter your life. Many individuals have computer games or download games from websites. Most people actually become addicted to these games. They would play incessantly if possible, and when not playing, they yearn to do so. This causes them to miss out on a plethora of experiences. They may not engage in sufficient exercise or complete their homework, which will lead to a decline in their grades. They may also neglect spending time with their families. It may even transform their personality. The most crucial aspect of computer usage is personal safety. There are predators lurking across the internet who can feign being someone from school and inquire about your residence. You should never disclose your address or full name online. They can, and most likely will, visit your home. This could potentially endanger your life or that of your family members. Computers can be enjoyable, and you can acquire a vast amount of information, but only if you exercise prudence in their use. Remember not to disclose your address or send personal pictures online. They could spread across the internet overnight. Lastly, prioritize your family, grades, and health over some unproductive game. Be prudent and safeguard yourself!
203	203	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I am of the opinion that people require computers. It enables them to explore the world if they are unable to do so physically. It can be employed to transmit crucial messages to individuals who are geographically distant. Moreover, if someone has a parent or a loved one far away, they can interact visually through the computer. Here are examples of these three aspects. Some individuals are physically or mentally incapacitated and cannot afford to travel. It is disheartening that some people are so severely afflicted by a disease or illness that they are unable to visit different places. However, by accessing the internet, they can search for pictures and information about places they have never visited, which can enhance their understanding of the world. There are also individuals who have phobias that impede them from traveling to various locations. They can turn to the internet to discover methods to overcome their fears, which will eventually enable them to travel. Then, there are those who lack the financial means. The internet can assist them in finding a well - paying job, which they can utilize to afford global travel and experience the world firsthand. What if you need to send a truly vital message to prevent someone from taking a certain action, save a life, or even halt a war? Consider a scenario where a war has erupted due to a misunderstanding. If the government ascertains the truth and knows how to resolve the situation, they can send a message to the aggressors, explaining what transpired and clarifying that it was not what they assumed. This could potentially end the conflict. What if a bomb is discovered in the White House? You would either want to evacuate the building or locate and disarm the bomb. If someone becomes aware of this and sends a message to the White House, it could save the lives of everyone inside. Sometimes, loved ones are deployed to a far - off location, and direct communication becomes challenging. For example, if someone in the military has a child, the computer allows them to see and talk to the child via a webcam, maintaining the family bond. Additionally, you might encounter an old friend on Facebook whom you haven't seen in years. You can add them as a friend and rekindle your friendship. In conclusion, the computer can perform numerous beneficial functions. It can mend relationships, save lives, help overcome fears, and facilitate global exploration. While we may sometimes overindulge, it remains an extremely useful tool. It is not entirely bad; it has its moments of being both good and bad.
204	204	1	1	Do you seek my perspective on the effects of computers on people? Well, I firmly believe that computers facilitate people's education, and many individuals rely on them. It is time to determine whether you concur with me that computers have positive impacts on people. Do you agree that computers can be beneficial to people? For example, if you have a question that no one at home can answer, why not @ORGANIZATION2 it? Inevitably, you will encounter a school project from time to time. When you need information and the library is closed, you may feel at a loss. However, the solution is simple: conduct your research on your computer. I recall one instance when I participated in a @CAPS1 contest, and the @CAPS2 I needed went missing. Then, I remembered that I had stored it in my computer. People can depend on computers. Just reflect on it! Nearly @PERCENT1 of jobs worldwide rely on computer technology. Take the @ORGANIZATION1 job as an example. It would be arduous to monitor the annual amount of trash disposal without a computer. Banks also rely on computers to keep track of everyone's accounts and financial situations. Let's not overlook what lawyers do. Some lawyers in court use computers to transcribe every word spoken, converting them into shorthand to keep pace with the conversation. Did you realize that without computers, half of the million jobs in the world would likely fail? Some individuals would agree that certain online games are educational. For instance, there is @CAPS4, which teaches you words you may have never encountered before. And don't forget @CAPS5, which enhances your numerical counting skills. Last but not least is @CAPS6 @CAPS7, which sharpens your skills and exercises your brain. Strategic thinking becomes useful in these games. Clearly, you can now recognize that some games are highly educational. In conclusion, I am convinced that the effects of computers on people are positive. Computers are helpful, reliable, and can educate people. The time to decide is now: do you agree that computers have positive effects on people?
205	205	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1. I have recently been apprised of how people perceive computers and their effects. In my opinion, I find that computers exert a highly negative influence on young kids, teens, and adults. Numerous detrimental aspects are associated with computer ownership. Firstly, individuals who are overly engrossed in this electronic device are finding less time for exercise and self - care. Moreover, the only exposure to nature they have is through online pictures, rather than experiencing the full beauty of our remaining natural world. Another negative consequence is that they are becoming increasingly detached from their loved ones. What has happened to our society? Why can we no longer think independently? I sincerely and strongly hope that my words will change the minds of some individuals. Thank you very much. Exercise is a crucial element in anyone's life, especially for growing kids and teens. What exercise benefits can you obtain from using a computer? Stronger fingers? A higher risk of syndrome @CAPS10. ""@CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of kids with @CAPS7 problems such as obesity have access to the internet,"" according to @PERSON2 of the, ""@CAPS3 feel right with @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"" in Huntington Beach, @LOCATION1. When you immerse yourself in computers, you may not even consider maintaining physical fitness. Instead, you might munch on chips while typing. What @CAPS4 @CAPS7 benefits can that game offer? With the threat of global warming, what you saw outdoors yesterday may no longer exist today. Inhaling fresh, natural air can truly soothe a stressed - out child. Whatever happened to playing with sidewalk chalk, tag, or simply running around? Is it no longer fashionable to take care of oneself? Yes, it seems unfashionable to focus on self - care. Inspire yourself by writing poems about your emotions or drawing a landscape. Nowadays, instead of @CAPS10 climbing a tree, we are using our mouse to navigate to the next website. There are so many things we take for granted, and one day, when you look back, you will truly miss those @DATE1 days. Family time is of utmost importance in anyone's life. Without a family, you are incomplete. When did game night or family time disappear? Just because our society deems computers a normal part of daily life at home does not mean that your family and friends should no longer be your top priority. If you want to visit a friend's house, don't just email about it. Walk @CAPS2 there to fully experience the interaction. Since when has a computer replaced a family? Never. If we break free from this artificial reality, @CAPS10 we can eliminate the negativity in our lives. @CAPS10 We can regain a genuine life and think more clearly. What makes a computer superior to real life? Absolutely nothing. Ask yourself this question. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the presence of computers in our lives has made us less astute. The negatives outweigh the positives. Sure, you can quickly send a message or play @CAPS9, but is it really that bad to use traditional methods like making a phone call or sending a letter? I reiterate, thank you for taking the time to read this. Whether I have changed your mind or not, @CAPS10 always think about the implications the next time you are online."
206	206	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I concur that computers have exerted a profound influence on human society. Thus, in my view, they stand as one of the most remarkable inventions. I hold this stance because there exist diverse utility programs and websites that offer assistance in people's daily lives. Particularly, students possess the capability to engage in studies through educational web - pages. Moreover, individuals are enabled to communicate via the internet. Lastly, one can type stories rather than penning them by hand.  The advantage of online study is truly significant. Various websites brimming with extensive information and verifiable facts can substantially impact the academic performance of most students. Are you aware that approximately @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 visit educational websites to gather information for writing, be it an essay or a non - fiction narrative? Thanks to computers, students have a high probability of attaining a passing grade.  Online communication has had a far - reaching global impact. Whether one utilizes Facebook, @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc., interacting with family or friends is an excellent experience. For example, I use Facebook and relish conversing with my family in @LOCATION2, whom I encounter roughly once every couple of years. Online communication has transformed people's lives as it provides an effortless means of instant interaction. With just a click of a button, one can establish immediate communication with someone.  Finally, individuals have the option to type on a program when they wish to compose a letter or a story. For instance, if one uses Microsoft Word, they can write whatever they desire. This has affected people positively as it is a swifter and more convenient method of writing. Therefore, if one finishes earlier than they would have through hand - writing, they will have additional leisure time or more time to complete the remaining work. Also, it is effortless for me as I type with great speed; of course, after practice.  In conclusion, the invention of computers has been and continues to be beneficial to society in numerous ways. However, I believe the three aspects I have elaborated on in this letter have had the most substantial impact on us. I hope this aids you in addressing your queries regarding how computers have influenced people. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. Have a good day.
207	207	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 posits that a computer is entirely innocuous. It facilitates people in acquiring knowledge about unfamiliar subjects. Additionally, it enables individuals to interact with people across the globe. Another advantage is that it allows people to maintain contact with family and friends worldwide. Computers are not detrimental; rather, they are beneficial.  Computers serve as a valuable learning tool. Educational institutions such as mine possess over a hundred computers, which are solely utilized for educational purposes. Moreover, even if we attempt to access other websites, we are redirected to blocked pages. Computers have provided the blueprints for the construction of cars and other machinery. One of the primary functions of computers is for learning.  Are you contemplating a vacation but unsure about the local customs and practices? A computer can offer assistance in such situations. It enables you to take a virtual tour, allowing you to understand the local people and the appearance of the place. It can also provide guidance on local traditions and beliefs. Computers are an excellent means of exploration.  Computers are also an effective medium for communication. Family members residing on the other side of the world can use computers to communicate and inquire about each other's well - being. Similarly, old friends who have relocated can still maintain contact. Establishing communication with friends and family is indeed a positive experience.  These reasons demonstrate that computers are not harmful in any way. They contribute to a person's education, facilitate the understanding of different cultures around the world, and promote positive social interaction. This is why computers are beneficial rather than harmful.
208	208	1	1	Dear newspaper editor, I have recently become aware that some individuals believe computers have a detrimental impact on people. However, I firmly hold the view that computers have a positive influence.  I believe computers have a positive effect because they simplify the process of learning about other countries. Additionally, they facilitate communication between people from different nations. Another reason is that they enable people to gain insights into diverse cultures, religions, and traditions.  The reason some people perceive computers as having a negative impact is that individuals are spending more time on computers than with their families. Moreover, people are using computers more frequently than exercise equipment, bicycles, or scooters.  Now that you are informed about both the positive and negative effects of computers, which stance will you adopt? Will you oppose the use of computers or support it? I would undoubtedly choose the latter.
209	209	1	1	Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1's perspective on the effects of computers on people is that spending time on a computer is not as bad as some might think; it does not deteriorate one's cognitive abilities like video games. There are several compelling reasons why computers are advantageous and offer assistance.  Occasionally, computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. One can utilize the computer for homework or to search for stores, among other things. Although some computers are sluggish, not all of the newer models, such as those available as of @DATE1, suffer from this issue. Computers can also enhance reading skills as they offer various resources. One can engage in conversations with friends, and listening to music is a straightforward task; one can access a website with a comprehensive collection of preferred songs.  Many individuals use computers to search for employment opportunities, learn about healthy eating habits, and fitness routines. Paying bills online is more convenient than traditional methods. The computer provides an easy - to - use platform for financial transactions, and I believe you should concur with @CAPS1's opinion.
210	210	1	1	Dear Newspaper, The query at hand is whether people are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer. In my opinion, they are not, as there are numerous benefits associated with computer usage.  Typing on a computer enhances hand - eye coordination. It is also an effective way to learn, and one can communicate with others simultaneously. Hand - eye coordination is of great significance as we employ it daily in activities such as sports, note - taking, and even video - game playing. Using a computer is beneficial as it fosters the development of hand - eye coordination. Whether one is typing, playing an online game, or surfing the web, these activities contribute to the improvement of this skill.  Learning hand - eye coordination is essential because most educators nowadays expect students to type and print their papers neatly. If children can master hand - eye coordination, they can type more rapidly and submit neater assignments. When students use the computer, they further refine their hand - eye coordination skills.  My world cultures teacher allows us to access an online textbook if we fail to complete our homework in class, eliminating the need to carry a bulky textbook. Naturally, students prefer online access to lugging around a large textbook. Have you ever considered how much more convenient it is to take a college course online, especially for working parents, compared to attending a physical college? Everything can be accomplished on a portable laptop, eliminating the need for commuting.  Using a computer to learn about different places is effortless. There are websites replete with pictures of beautiful foreign locales, including hot deserts and tropical rainforests, featuring monkeys and tigers. Learning on a computer is both enjoyable and straightforward.  Since the widespread adoption of cell phones, many people have discarded their home phones to save money. However, cell phones sometimes lose signal. This is where a computer proves useful. It is easy to communicate with others through forums, chat websites, and email. One can engage in intelligent conversations, and it is both simple and cost - free.  I trust you have understood my reasons for believing that it is acceptable for people to spend time on the computer. While it is important for people to spend time outdoors or with family, in moderation, computer usage can be beneficial. It is easy to develop hand - eye coordination and communicate effectively using a computer.
211	211	1	1	Not everyone perceives computers as beneficial; however, they serve as an excellent resource for information retrieval. While it is unwise to be on the computer for seven hours, occasional usage is not detrimental. An individual who spends the entire day on the computer without engaging in other activities is clearly leading an unhealthy lifestyle. People ought to regulate their computer usage time. Avoid overindulgence! As previously mentioned, computers are also highly valuable for accessing information. If one possesses a computer or laptop and needs to find information on a particular subject, the internet is readily available. For children requiring assistance with homework or projects, the computer can be utilized to look up facts and information, which is far more convenient than searching for books containing the necessary details. Thus, computers possess remarkable qualities and resources. They are not inherently bad or unhealthy unless they become the sole focus of one's life. This is my perspective on computers.
212	212	1	1	I opine that individuals are allocating an excessive amount of time to their computers, neglecting the enjoyment of nature and other aspects of life. My rationale is that people engage solely in web - surfing, constant communication with others, and they remain sedentary, consuming junk food and abstaining from exercise. These are my three justifications. Firstly, people tend to spend a great deal of time surfing the web. There are over a million websites accessible. People often visit numerous sites, either to browse or make purchases. The appropriate uses of the computer should be restricted to homework or business - related tasks. Additionally, people play an excessive number of video games on the computer. Secondly, people frequent @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or utilize webcams. They can spend hours on these platforms conversing with others. For some, these virtual interactions become their entire existence. I know someone who has a @CAPS1 account and, after school, does nothing but chat with people online. They have virtual friends on @CAPS1 but lack real - life companions. Thirdly, when people are on the computer, they often consume junk food and forgo exercise. They may consume potato chips, cookies, and soda. If one maintains such a lifestyle for a week, they will feel extremely fatigued and lethargic. Moreover, they are likely to gain weight. Their bodies will become unhealthy and out of shape. Now that you have perused my reasons, I hope you find them compelling. My reasons encompass people's excessive web - surfing, constant communication, and their consumption of junk food with no exercise.
213	213	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I wish to express my agreement with your assertion that some individuals spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer. My reasons are that people should engage in exercise, venture outdoors, and have fun. By continuing to read, you will comprehend the necessity of these activities. Firstly, exercise is crucial. I emphasize exercise because one should not be glued to the computer all day. There are numerous physical activities available, such as running, jogging, and cycling. It is acceptable to use the computer occasionally for learning purposes, but books and schools also serve as valuable sources of knowledge. Secondly, going outside is essential as people need to breathe fresh air and avoid being confined indoors all day. It also offers opportunities for exploration, such as going on a hike to discover the wonders of the natural world and to have an enjoyable time. Another aspect is nature. One can visit the zoo to learn about various species. Furthermore, one can engage in a plethora of activities without being constantly on the computer. Lastly, one can interact with friends, visit the mall, have sleepovers, and watch movies. There is no need to be on the computer all day; one should have fun. This is why I advocate for reducing computer usage. One can engage in other activities and still acquire knowledge without relying solely on the computer. Perhaps, instead of chatting online, one can visit a friend's house in person. Thank you for your time. I look forward to further communication.
214	214	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, imagine you are at home, engrossed in your computer. Hours, perhaps even days, have passed since you last inhaled fresh outdoor air. This may seem absurd, yet it is a reality for over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of the population in @LOCATION1. Look around; computers are ubiquitous, present in movies, chain restaurants, homes, offices, and schools. Due to excessive computer use, many experts are concerned that people are devoting too much time to their computers, while neglecting exercise, nature, and interactions with family and friends. I propose that people everywhere should limit their computer use to a reasonable amount each day. Say @CAPS2 to computers. Our days are being squandered on virtual games and other downloads. Firstly, people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers and insufficient time exercising. Over the past two years, obesity has emerged as a significant issue in @LOCATION1, with over @PERCENT1 of the population affected. Obesity significantly increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes, heart failure, and depression. Recently, my cousin passed away from cancer, which was exacerbated by her obesity. We cannot remain idle; we must get up and move away from the computer. Additionally, people should disconnect from their computers and start appreciating nature. A total of <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of individuals in @LOCATION1 do not spend enough time outdoors. With global warming threatening our environment, people should be more inclined to spend time outside. Did you know that our environment is disappearing at an alarming rate? I consulted my good friend, an environmental expert from the Institute of Clean Our World (COW).
215	215	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I am conveying my apprehensions regarding the adverse effects that new technologies, particularly computers, have on humans. Computers exert a harmful influence on humans as people are expending an excessive amount of their quality time on them, which consequently leads to a reduction in exercise and less time spent outdoors and interacting with friends and family. Firstly, people are spending an inordinate amount of time surfing the internet. Studies indicate that the average @CAPS1 spends a total of @NUM1 hours per day on the computer, nearly double the recommended amount. Dr. @DR1 from the @CAPS1 Technology Society warns that if this trend of increased internet usage persists over the coming years, most @CAPS3 will completely lose touch with family and friends outside the virtual social network. The average weight of a @NUM2 - year - old has risen from @NUM3 pounds in @DATE1 to @NUM4 pounds today. Statistics demonstrate that the primary cause of this significant weight gain is the excessive time spent on computers, combined with a lack of exercise. Teenagers should exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each session. However, the average adolescent only spends ten minutes per week exercising, excluding gym classes. All these statistics need to change, and a starting point would be to reduce computer use, as people are spending too much time on them and too little time exercising. Secondly, computers are impeding people's ability to go outside and enjoy nature. From my personal experience, nature is a magnificent aspect of life. Nevertheless, nowadays, I find myself spending an excessive amount of time on social networks such as Facebook, MySpace, and other similar platforms. How frequently do you venture outside for a walk, a bike ride, or other outdoor activities? A study conducted by @PERSON2 reveals that the average person in @LOCATION1 has only spent a total of @NUM5 days outdoors in the past two years after acquiring a new computer. This situation must change; people need to appreciate the beauty of the world. Thirdly, computers have had a negative impact on the interaction between family and friends. As @ORGANIZATION1 states, ""@CAPS6 people only interact with family during mandatory events such as school meetings."" Family and friends are of utmost importance in everyone's lives. I cherish the moments when I sit down with my mother and have a conversation over a cup of hot chocolate. Currently, @PERCENT1 of people do not spend any time with their family, and @PERCENT2 of people use computers to interact with friends. It is of vital importance that people cease relying so heavily on computers, as @PERSON1 from I.U.M warns, ""Before you know it, you will have lost all communication with family and friends."" Computers facilitate the loss of communication and interaction with family and friends. In conclusion, I earnestly urge you to make the right decision by reducing computer use. By doing so, you will become a happier and stronger individual. Computers have a detrimental impact on humans as people spend too much time on them, resulting in a lack of exercise, reduced time outdoors, and diminished interaction with family and friends. Please excuse any lack of organization in this letter due to space constraints. Thank you."
216	216	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you today to illustrate why advanced technology exerts a positive influence on individuals. My rationale for penning this is that computers enable people to engage in online conversations with others, learn about distant locales, and ultimately, cultivate hand - eye coordination. As you peruse my letter, I trust you will concur. Firstly, computers facilitate online communication with others. The reason I hold this view is that if you are unable to locate your phone, be it a landline or a cell phone, you can check if the person is online. Moreover, it is akin to texting but with a larger keyboard and screen. I can relate to this as I was texting someone and then went online to find them, and we exchanged messages instead. I hope you can appreciate why computers can be beneficial to people. Secondly, not many individuals will visit the library to gather information for a school paper. The reason for this is that a computer provides access to search engines like Google, simplifying the process of finding information. Another factor is that going to the library in @MONTH1 incurs additional expenses for filling up your gas tank. I can attest to this as every time my family visits the library, we have to refuel the car afterward. This is yet another reason why computers are advantageous. Finally, computers can impart hand - eye coordination. The reason is that when you are writing an email, you need to be aware of the keys your fingers touch. Another aspect is that if your child takes karate, they might have acquired the ability to move their hands quickly from using a computer. I can relate to this as when I was in first grade, there was a man who asked me and my friends to get in his truck to help find his lost puppy, and he tried to grab me, but I pulled my hand away before being pinned. I hope you can understand why we need computers. I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my essay. Once again, my reasons for writing are that people can communicate with others online, learn about faraway places, and develop hand - eye coordination. I hope you will reconsider why we should have computers in school.
217	217	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I concur that computers have a beneficial impact on individuals. They help develop hand - eye coordination, obviate the need to visit the library, and enhance social skills. Continue reading to discover the reasons. We utilize computers daily, and they are imparting knowledge to us. We may not even be cognizant of it, but they are teaching us hand - eye coordination. When we type, we use our eyes to focus on the screen and our hands to operate the keyboard. A single error prompts our hands to correct it automatically. Similarly, when we play online games, the same principle applies. Our eyes are vigilant while our hands deftly manipulate the keyboard. Hand - eye coordination is a crucial skill in sports, and I believe that since we spend a significant amount of time on computers, they offer a rapid means of acquiring this skill. Next, consider how many students' parents are employed. My parents work, and at times, it becomes arduous to walk to the library as not everyone resides within walking distance of one. This is where a computer proves invaluable. If you have a project to complete but your parents are at work, you can simply conduct a search on @ORGANIZATION1. You may even obtain more information than what is available in the library. How is this possible, you might ask? Well, for instance, if @CAPS1 you had to undertake a project on @CAPS2. Suppose you managed to visit a library, but there were only @NUM1 books on @CAPS2, out of which @NUM2 were already checked out. You could attempt to borrow from another library, but it may not be accessible in a timely manner. According to a survey, @PERCENT1 of students reported encountering this situation, but the computer came to their rescue. So, what else did they say? HELLO @ORGANIZATION1! Last but not least, a computer enhances your social skills. When I first relocated here, I was extremely introverted. After creating a @CAPS3, I began interacting with individuals from my school and even forged friendships with them. I am not suggesting that you should eschew in - person conversations and solely rely on @CAPS3, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, or @CAPS8 for communication. What I am proposing is that if you initiate online conversations, you can get to know the person a bit, and when you meet in person, you will discover common interests, facilitating the formation of friendships. Additionally, I have numerous friends in @LOCATION1 and cousins in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. We are well aware that it is not feasible to travel constantly, and sometimes, you cannot even meet them. This is where social networks are invaluable. You can stay in touch without expending excessive minutes on your phone. Can it get any better? In conclusion, computers have a highly positive influence on people. They contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination, enable efficient research without leaving home, and help you achieve a high grade on your project. They also enhance your social skills. Even the data collected supports this. Thank you for investing your time and effort in reading this. I hope it has convinced many.
218	218	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, do you, @CAPS1, desire for your children and citizens to become overweight and lethargic, or to be active, acquire daily skills, and become more amicable towards those around them? @PERCENT1 of parents would opt for the latter over the former. I believe that after reading this, the additional @PERCENT2 will be persuaded. Currently, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals are overweight or obese. This can be attributed to a lack of exercise and physical inactivity. Our children need to learn to venture outside and engage in at least an hour of exercise daily. This can divert their attention from the computer screen. A commendable approach is to encourage them to join a sports team or a club. This can dissuade people from excessive screen time and the @ORGANIZATION2 routine. If we can entice people out of the office, it may even lead them to embrace nature. There are numerous engaging activities at the local park every day. For example, you can ride a bike, play games, or simply have fun with friends. Learning can also be expedited by getting people away from their computer chairs. If they need to look up information, encourage them to use a dictionary, thesaurus, or a book. While the computer can be a source of learning, it can also expose kids to inappropriate content. However, it can also assist in exploring career options and understanding life. Prolonged sitting in front of a screen can have detrimental effects on your health. There are more fulfilling activities to engage in rather than relying solely on the internet. You can still have a great time even if you are not particularly athletic. For example, boys can visit a park, engage in career - related activities, or even engage in friendly wrestling. In conclusion, I advocate for people to rise from their seats and venture outdoors. Stepping outside can facilitate socialization, learning, and even weight loss. So, I leave it to you to decide whether to accept this challenge. However, be aware that excessive time in front of a computer can lead to the need for glasses and obesity.
219	219	1	1	Dear Newspaper, it has recently come to my attention that some individuals claim computers are unimportant. I vehemently disagree with this assertion. I believe that computers foster excellent hand - eye coordination, endow people with the ability to learn about distant locations, and enable online communication with family and friends. Computers play a significant role in teaching hand - eye coordination. Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of all football players possess outstanding hand - eye coordination. I am certain that this is because after a strenuous game, football players log into @CAPS2 to update their status about their victory. Moreover, they may play ping - pong games on the computer to test their hand - eye coordination. Do you have good hand - eye coordination? My second reason for disagreeing with the previous statement is that computers empower people to learn about faraway places without leaving home. It is far more efficient than going to the library. At the library, you first have to travel there, then select your book, and finally check it out. In the time it takes to complete these steps, you could have finished your entire project using a computer! Finally, computers are of utmost importance as they keep people connected. Do you have family members living far away? I certainly do. I cannot always call them when I wish to converse, so I simply log on to @CAPS2. If they are online, I can have a conversation with them. I don't know about you, but I am very close to my grandma. Unfortunately, she lives more than @NUM1 hours away from me. She is located in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. By car, it takes one and a half days, and by plane, it takes three hours! So, it is much more convenient to log on to @CAPS2 and have a private conversation with her rather than undertaking a long - distance journey. In conclusion, I am confident that you will agree with me. Computers are truly remarkable! They help you develop hand - eye coordination, allow for rapid research, and enable you to stay in touch with distant friends and family.
220	220	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, imagine being at home with nothing constructive to do. You cannot play basketball with your friends because you lack hand - eye coordination. You wish to learn about @LOCATION1, but there are no relevant books. And you yearn to communicate with your friends. This is precisely what would transpire if we did not have technological advancements. Without hand - eye coordination, we would be unable to perform basic tasks. We would not be able to learn about faraway places, and online communication would be impossible. Computers enrich our lives in numerous ways. To commence, hand - eye coordination is of paramount importance. Without it, we would struggle to hold a pencil or perform simple actions. @PERCENT1 of people have witnessed an improvement in their hand - eye coordination through computer usage. This was substantiated in a @DATE1 study conducted by @CAPS2, under the leadership of @PERSON2, the head of human reactions. ""@CAPS3 understands that your hands are the most prominent part of your body, and the computer helps refine the movements to enhance hand - eye coordination,"" @PERSON1 stated in a @DATE2 interview with a science magazine. When you are clumsy, you are prone to breaking valuable items. For instance, @PERSON3 in @LOCATION2 accidentally broke her mother's glass vase. This could have been avoided if she had utilized a computer to improve her hand - eye coordination. Additionally, computers grant us the ability to learn about faraway places. In the absence of books, @PERCENT2 of people prefer to search for information on a computer. This is an established fact. Some individuals would not have been aware of the earthquake in @LOCATION3 if it were not for the websites that provided real - time updates. Campers would have remained oblivious. @ORGANIZATION2 featured a front - page article advocating the use of computers over books. Books can become outdated, but computers always offer up - to - date answers. Moreover, online communication is indispensable. Whether it is for business meetings, government plans, or casual chatting, people need to stay connected. If the president were unable to conduct video conferences, he would have to travel constantly. Email is the primary means of communication for @PERSON5 from @CAPS4 with her colleagues. ""I am located so far away, and it is so much more convenient,"" she says. Online communication streamlines business operations and major corporations. It seems that @CAPS6 is now the preferred mode of communication for kids. It makes them feel like they are part of something larger. Now, envision happy, healthy, and educated Americans, both young and old. They can explore and research anything they desire. Technology is truly astonishing. It allows you to communicate online, learn about faraway places, and practice hand - eye coordination. This undoubtedly seems like a positive development. So, @ORGANIZATION1, the benefits of computers are undeniable. Please concur with me, @ORGANIZATION1!"
221	221	1	1	In the month of @MONTH1, certain individuals opine that computers consume an inordinate amount of time that could be dedicated to significant matters. Nevertheless, truly, all the information one desires to acquire is readily accessible. One can delve into the realm of nature, explore captivating websites, and even study history. Here are the reasons regarding the impact of computers. Firstly, a wealth of knowledge about nature can be gleaned online. One can observe diverse species of animals and conduct in - depth studies on them. Additionally, learn about plants and their influence on life. Moreover, information about @LOCATION1 and its ongoing transformations can be obtained. Secondly, numerous engaging websites are available for one to join. There are games that can keep one occupied throughout the day. One can even engage in online conversations with friends or perhaps reconnect with long - lost acquaintances. Educational websites are accessible for students seeking study materials or assistance. Lastly, computers offer extensive insights into history. Comparisons can be made between the people, events, and world - renowned figures of the past and those of the present. Most importantly, the life - altering stories and their impact on contemporary lives can be discovered. I hope I have provided sufficient reasons for you to concur with me. As is evident, computers possess a plethora of resources from which one can learn, and learning websites and history merely scratch the surface. Ponder upon this! Thank you for listening.
222	222	1	1	"Computers and the @CAPS1 have revolutionized the way the world operates today. From stock market transactions to instant messaging (@CAPS2), individuals have based crucial life decisions on the information they have perused. Although some individuals contend that computers are distancing people from the allure of nature, relatives, or physical activity, I assert that @CAPS11 is merely facilitating the world on a daily basis. For instance, in the realm of communication, numerous individuals have close relatives residing overseas, across the country, or even in the neighboring town. The @CAPS1 enables them to converse with individuals with whom they would otherwise be unable to communicate. On multiple occasions, my family has planned trips together despite living across the continent. What would have taken months via postal letters was accomplished in as little as an hour through the @CAPS1. Another means of communicating with friends or family is through a website named @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is a platform that allows users to communicate, @CAPS6, or send pictures to others. Other similar websites include @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. @PERCENT1 of the population in @LOCATION1 has an account on one of these platforms. Another method of communication, primarily for business purposes, is @CAPS6. Multiple servers offer @CAPS6 services, such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, or @CAPS8. ""@ORGANIZATION3 is my personal preference,"" states @PERSON2, @CAPS9 of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS10 newspaper. ""@CAPS11 has been of immeasurable assistance when I need to contact someone at short notice."" This is one reason why I advocate for the use of computers. Another reason is that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of all students rely on the @CAPS1 for research papers and other assignments. ""Even though I still utilize books,"" remarks college student @PERSON1, ""the @CAPS1 is significantly faster, and the articles are more up - to - date."" Search @CAPS13 are highly popular, such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS14.com. @NUM2 of all computer users with @CAPS1 access have used @ORGANIZATION1 at some point. Another useful program provided by all computer companies is @CAPS15 @CAPS16. This program can be employed for everything from research papers to various tasks. It also features a spell - check, a punctuation - check, and an error - check function. The primary reason for writing this paper is that experts have been lamenting that people are spending excessive time on the computer, and @CAPS11 is distracting them from the important aspects of life, such as friends, family, and nature. However, based on the examples presented in this paper, I have demonstrated that the @CAPS1 enhances communication and kindles curiosity about the world's appearance and functionality. Regarding physical activity, it is common sense to allocate at least an hour to personal fitness."
223	223	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that the increasing prevalence of computer usage is detrimental for several reasons. Firstly, it is detrimental to people's health. Secondly, individuals who spend excessive time on computers often decline to spend time with family and friends. Thirdly, one can gain more knowledge about a subject by directly exploring it rather than relying on a computer. The first adverse effect of computer usage on individuals is the health concern. Health is of utmost importance, yet sitting in front of a computer for extended periods exacerbates the situation. The way one hunches their back to view something small on the computer screen or holds the mouse for a prolonged period while waiting to click can lead to arthritis. The second negative impact of computer usage is that people who are engrossed in computers sometimes refuse to spend time with family or friends. For example, suppose a week ago you promised to attend a family gathering, and everyone was counting on your presence. However, once you start using the computer and discover fascinating websites you've never heard of, time slips by. Before you realize it, it's the day of the family gathering, and you make excuses not to attend, which deeply wounds your family. My final reason for considering computers a poor choice is that one can learn about a place by visiting it in person. It is far more enjoyable to travel and interact with people from that location than to sit in front of a computer, experiencing neck, back, and eye strain. In conclusion, in my personal view, computers have a negative impact on people's health, potentially causing long - term back and neck problems and reducing physical activity. People who are heavy computer users often avoid spending time with family and friends. Additionally, one can acquire more in - depth knowledge about a culture or a place by directly exploring it rather than spending hours on a computer. I hope my perspective can convince others of the adverse effects of excessive computer usage and prompt them to take appropriate action.
224	224	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, computers exert highly beneficial effects on people. This is because they enhance hand - eye coordination, enable individuals to learn about distant locations, and facilitate online communication with others. Computers offer positive impacts for everyone. They contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. When a person types, they use their hands while simultaneously looking at the monitor to locate letters. Computer games also play a role in teaching this skill, as in games, events occur rapidly, requiring the player to observe the screen and quickly press the correct keys, thereby significantly improving hand - eye coordination. Studies indicate that individuals who use computers have @PERCENT1 better hand - eye coordination than those who do not. Moreover, computers assist in learning about far - off places. One can search for information online and obtain numerous facts about a particular location. Sheral from @LOCATION4 stated, ""I heard someone at school mention @LOCATION2 but knew nothing about it. So, I searched for it and found a wealth of facts."" This demonstrates that computers can help individuals learn about foreign countries. Additionally, computers enable people to communicate with others who are hundreds or thousands of miles away. This can be achieved through email or video chat. A @CAPS2 revealed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat because it is faster and allows both parties to see each other. Regardless of the method, they are efficient ways to contact distant individuals. Jack from @LOCATION1 said, ""Thanks to video chat, I was able to talk to and see my cousin from @LOCATION3, whom I rarely see."" This illustrates that computers are a positive addition to people's lives. In summary, computers are helpful in multiple ways. They teach hand - eye coordination, allow people to learn about far - away places, and facilitate communication with others. Computers are truly a valuable asset for everyone."
225	225	1	1	"Computers, @CAPS1, they signify how far we have advanced. Computers present numerous opportunities for the world, yet we often fail to capitalize on them. Computers have led many individuals to a sedentary lifestyle, depriving them of physical exercise. They captivate many and can become highly addictive if not used in moderation. Moreover, computers are attention - grabbers, diminishing interaction with family members. Envision spending seven years of your life seated in front of a computer, rising only when absolutely necessary. You might even decide to abandon sports from your life. Now, contemplate the impact this would have on your body. Even if you maintain a healthy diet, the lack of exercise would be detrimental. I recall visiting my cousin @PERSON2's house when she suggested playing the game @CAPS2 fit. If you've never played it, upon signing in, it conducts certain tests to determine your body's age. My body was @NUM1 years old, while I was only @NUM2 years old. All those years spent in front of the computer had taken a toll. I do not wish for others to experience the same. Do not repeat my mistake, readers of the @LOCATION1 current. I have a friend named @PERSON1, who is a computer addict. She would spend days continuously on the computer. Sometimes, she would skip school or attend school solely to use the computer. She would become aggressive when someone attempted to pull her away. I detested witnessing my friend in such a state, especially as I watched it unfold. It began innocently enough. She was fond of a particular website on the internet. It was sometimes alarming when she spoke to me about it, clearly having spent the entire night on it. If you think this could never happen to you, you are mistaken. I had the same thought when I first looked at the website that triggered her addiction. Fortunately, I managed to curb my addiction before it became severe, but many others like @PERSON1 may become consumed by computers. Many of you reading this should recognize the danger. ""@CAPS3!.... @CAPS3!... I'm talking to you!"" This is the plea of your family members when you are engrossed in the computer. It often goes unheeded because computers are so captivating that you can't even bear to talk to your own family. My mother often tries to get my attention in this way but ends up calling my cell phone or instant - messaging me. This is truly disheartening. By doing so, you also become detached, which is never a positive outcome. The more you ignore your family for the computer, the weaker your bond will become, and the less fulfilling your life will be. Computers are indeed remarkable, but the lack of exercise they cause is extremely unhealthy and is occurring at an alarming rate. They can also be perilous, as many people may become addicted. The more you chat with strangers in chat rooms, the less you will communicate with your family. Computers can be regarded as the devil's tools, as they will undoubtedly ruin you, readers. Always exercise caution, as computers are not as they seem."
226	226	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 out of every ten individuals allocate their time to computers. I am of the opinion that people ought not to devote @CAPS3 excessive time to their computers as it can detrimentally affect their eyesight. They @MONTH1 access inappropriate videos or images. Moreover, their utility bills will escalate. Are you aware that a significant number of people spend a great deal of time on computers? Well, I firmly believe they should refrain from sitting in front of them to avoid eye damage. When one sits and stares at a computer screen, their eyes begin to ache. Subsequently, when they visit an optometrist, the doctor will likely prescribe glasses. My second contention is that people visit inappropriate websites and view improper videos. Once, my friend was sitting at the computer and started watching inappropriate videos. @CAPS3 When her father discovered this, he terminated their internet service. Can you fathom the exorbitant bills you would incur? Why squander excessive money by spending @CAPS3 too much time on the computer when you can power it off and spend quality time with your friends? For instance, instead of spending @CAPS3 an inordinate amount of time on the computer, venture outside and engage in activities such as soccer or kickball. In conclusion, people should curtail their @CAPS3 excessive computer usage. Prolonged computer use can harm your eyes. People @MONTH1 watch inappropriate content, and your bills will rise. It appears to me that people require alternative activities to disengage from computers. I sincerely hope you concur with my viewpoints.
227	227	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I posit that computers are a valuable asset for the following three rationales. First, they facilitate learning by enabling individuals to access information from diverse sources. Second, they enable people to communicate with friends and family via @CAPS2. Lastly, they alleviate stress through engaging in computer games. Learning is of paramount importance, and computers expedite the learning process. They allow individuals to explore distant locations such as @LOCATION1. It is far more convenient to learn on a computer than to visit a library and borrow a book. If one is working on a project and requires last - minute information, they can simply access the computer and search for their topic. Learning on a computer is considerably more convenient than visiting the @CAPS1. Another advantage of computers is the ability to communicate with distant friends and family using @CAPS2. @CAPS2 enables real - time communication between individuals via the computer. These individuals may reside nearby or on the other side of the globe. My cousin is spending a semester in Spain for college. I have had numerous video calls with her using @CAPS2. The remarkable aspect of @CAPS2 is the ability to visually see the person with whom one is conversing. @CAPS2 is an excellent means of maintaining contact with far - flung friends and family. My final reason is that computers reduce stress through gaming. Computer games are highly entertaining. They encompass a wide range of games, from @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the word to @CAPS5 @CAPS6 beauty barn. Computer games are an effective stress - reliever as they allow individuals to unwind rather than overburden themselves with excessive work. They also offer educational games, such as “Which country is which,” which imparts geographical knowledge while being enjoyable. Computers are an invaluable resource. They aid in learning about distant places, facilitate communication with remote individuals, and provide engaging gaming experiences. Computers will continue to be widely utilized and never fall into disuse. There is always something productive to do on a computer.
228	228	1	1	Dear Readers of the local newspaper, I am deeply concerned that excessive computer usage can lead to trouble, violence, and illegal crimes. Firstly, I am alarmed that people spend an inordinate amount of time on computers, which can result in social unrest. In @DATE2, @PERCENT1 of the population in @LOCATION1 engaged in unethical behavior, such as spreading rumors and slandering individuals they despise. In @DATE1, @PERCENT2 of teens aged @NUM1 were involved in rumor - spreading activities, which can have a detrimental impact on all children. These issues will inevitably lead to the consequences outlined below. Secondly, I am worried that excessive computer use can incite violence. Given the trends identified in the @NUM3 paragraph, if this pattern persists, it may escalate into violent behavior. In @DATE1, @NUM4 individuals lost their lives due to online crimes. @NUM5 threats were detected on major websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. Lastly, I am concerned that excessive computer usage can lead to illegal activities. In @DATE3, a girl was fatally shot by a boy she met online. It was later discovered that the boy had fabricated his identity. On a website, a group of men discussed their hatred for children and planned to attack them at bus stops. Fortunately, the police intervened before the crime could be committed. In conclusion, I am gravely concerned that excessive computer use is causing trouble, violence, and illegal crimes. This situation urgently needs to be addressed before everyone becomes addicted to spreading rumors. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.
229	229	1	1	Dear Readers, In contemporary society, computers have become ubiquitous. While they offer certain advantages, their overuse is largely unnatural. Computers have enabled people to perform tasks previously unimaginable. In the past, when individuals relocated, they had to rely on postal letters and endure long waiting periods for responses. Today, they can simply log into platforms such as AIM, Facebook, or MySpace for instant communication. However, these benefits are overshadowed by numerous drawbacks. People are spending less time outdoors and have lost appreciation for the natural beauty around them. Social interactions have diminished, and I can scarcely recall the last time I had a face - to - face conversation without necessity. The anonymity of the internet allows individuals to engage in unrestricted behavior. One might assume this is a positive aspect, but it is not. Hackers can infiltrate various systems, and cyberbullying has become rampant, with perpetrators remaining undetected. Online, people can assume false identities. For example, a @NUM1 - year - old could pose as a ten - year - old to stalk a @NUM2 - year - old. In the pre - computer era, such behavior was impossible. If people become aware of the detrimental impact of excessive computer use on our lives, they will reduce their screen time and embrace a more active lifestyle. It is time to take action, raise awareness, and spread the word about the importance of limiting computer usage.
230	230	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 what would you choose to do during your leisure time? Would you venture outdoors and play soccer with your children, or would you grab a snack and log onto Facebook or check your email? The central question is whether computers have a negative or positive influence on people. I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact. Communicating with friends on the computer does not foster the development of social skills. Moreover, computer usage can be highly addictive. Finally, it detracts from the physical exercise necessary for a healthy lifestyle. I am confident that after careful deliberation, you will concur with me that computers have a negative effect on individuals. Platforms such as Facebook, iChat, and email offer convenient ways to communicate with friends and family online. However, do these methods truly enhance your social skills? Online communication fails to provide the opportunity to develop effective social skills. When meeting someone in person for the first time, you may struggle to determine what to say and how to behave. Typing on a keyboard does not facilitate genuine interaction. Why not invite someone over or go out for lunch with your family instead? Computers are also highly addictive. I can attest that once I log onto the computer, I may remain engaged for hours. This is a common phenomenon among many individuals. Although not everyone uses a computer daily, the majority do. When I log onto Facebook and see a large number of people online, the number continues to grow over time. The addictive nature of computers leads to a lack of physical activity. Medical professionals recommend that adults and children engage in at least one hour of exercise per day. Computer usage encroaches on this time. Instead of sitting at the computer for an hour, you could be exercising. Often, when people sit at the computer, they snack, which further emphasizes the importance of exercise for maintaining health. I am confident that I would feel better if I went for a run instead of using the computer. You may argue that you can manage both, but some people prioritize exercise. When others see you constantly on the computer, what kind of example does it set? If everyone limited their computer time, we would all feel better and be more socially active. I trust that you will agree with me that computers have a negative impact on people.
231	231	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, some individuals perceive the clicking and clacking of computers as a nuisance. What they fail to recognize is that these devices are enhancing the lives of the youth, rendering them more convenient, and could offer similar benefits to them as well. This is precisely why computers exert a highly positive influence on people. Firstly, computers are not detrimental if they merely facilitate better interpersonal connections. One frequently encounters advertisements for dating websites and similar platforms. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of couples meet online? That is a substantial figure, and one must consider that they might never have met without the aid of computers. Secondly, computers provide an enormous amount of entertainment. There are over @NUM1 computer games available online, and @CAPS2 of them are free. I wager that nearly every child has played an online game at some point. Consider this: your child could either be out causing trouble or safely at home, enjoying themselves on the computer. You might be thinking that computers seem juvenile and childish. However, computers are not solely for amusement. They offer a wealth of information. They are extremely useful for teenagers in school for projects, and they also benefit adults in numerous ways. They provide information on vacations, hotels, etc. Additionally, computers now feature numerous videos on how to perform various tasks and other valuable information. As you can clearly see, computers are not merely a source of annoyance. They bring people together, offer entertainment, and contain highly useful information. Ponder this: a computer might one day save your life. Computers enhance people's daily lives and could enhance yours too.
232	232	1	1	"Recently, a technological phenomenon has swept across the globe. Wherever one looks, whether at home, school, work, or on the streets, people are observed texting, conversing on phones, blogging, and engaging in other computer-related activities. This situation concerns some individuals. They believe that the current generations are overly reliant on computers and are not spending sufficient time exercising outdoors or socializing. However, they are mistaken. These experts are being overly critical of computers, as not everyone is mindlessly fixated on a screen, lost in a virtual world. In fact, most of these ""computer enthusiasts"" are utilizing computers for practical purposes. While they are also used for entertainment, computers also enable society to reconnect with long-lost friends or obtain directions to a well-known restaurant. As is evident, computers are not transforming us into zombies. Computers are sometimes regarded as a nuisance. Parents often complain about having to drag their children away from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. However, this does not necessarily imply that it is a bad thing. Everyone uses the computer. ""@CAPS2 complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too frequently,"" @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 remarks. ""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has their own."" This is a common scenario among many students' parents. Approximately @PERCENT1 of adults admit that they too have embraced new trends such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So, why do we need these things? What makes them so significant to us? The answer is straightforward: they make us feel connected. However, upon further reflection, it may not be that simple. Many people have diverse opinions regarding the importance of computers to them, but most concur that friends play a crucial role. ""Everyone is already online,"" @PERSON2, a computer technician, states. ""If all your friends are involved in something, wouldn't you want to be as well?"" As the well-known saying, ""If your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?"" comes to mind, let me provide an answer: no. Being connected and taking extreme actions are two distinct concepts. When you reconnect with high school friends or schoolmates, you are glad that you can communicate with them, whether face-to-face or via computer screens. Lastly, the computer is an excellent resource. While some people complain, others are leveraging its capabilities by searching for directions to events or facts for their next report. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 generate billions from the queries typed into the search engine. The information and locations that emerge from the computer are like hidden gems waiting to be discovered. In conclusion, it is easy to understand why the computer and its resources are so highly regarded. Everyone uses it for different purposes and hobbies. Some use it for pure entertainment, others for information, and still others for reconnection. My personal preference is to discover hidden bands, the truly remarkable ones that @CAPS9 even knows about. This is why I am convinced that the computer has a positive impact on the world."
233	233	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers are both beneficial and consequential. Computers offer entertainment, are highly informative, and are extremely useful. I enjoy watching all the interesting videos on YouTube, while older individuals may prefer to watch the news. You can also send emails, which is much simpler than sending a regular envelope. Depending on your location, you may have to wait days or even weeks for a letter to arrive, but with email, it can reach its destination within seconds. That's a significant difference, isn't it? People who rely on computers can upload important information. The military and police use the internet on their computers to control specialized equipment such as @CAPS1.A.V. for the army or daily monitoring systems for police officers. I myself use a computer to research school subjects like math and history. However, computers are not without their drawbacks. Some people abuse them. Hackers can break into other computers and steal important information, which can make your life miserable. It can even affect your home. Online gamers spend countless hours playing, which can make you a ""game addict,"" causing you to spend less time with your friends and family. They play so frequently that they may require glasses after just a few weekends. In the future, computers may completely replace newspapers."
234	234	1	1	Numerous individuals hold the view that computers are not advantageous. They believe that people spend an excessive amount of time on computers and engage in less physical activity. They are also concerned that prolonged screen time may be harmful to one's eyes. While these statements may hold some truth, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial. One can communicate with individuals from different regions and acquire knowledge about various parts of the world. Additionally, the computer can be utilized for research purposes. Firstly, the computer enables communication with others. Whether through a webcam or social networks to @LOCATION1 and engage in conversations, one can chat with people without incurring phone bills. For instance, I have family members in another country, and we often communicate via the computer. We use the webcam to talk and chat. Making international phone calls can be extremely costly. If I did not have a computer, my contact with my @CAPS2 family from another country would be significantly limited. Moreover, the computer allows one to explore foreign countries. Many individuals, including @CAPS2 parents, have utilized the computer to learn about other nations. @CAPS2 mother, whenever @CAPS1 plans a vacation, searches for information about the destination country. For example, on @DATE1, when we were planning a trip to a tropical destination, @CAPS2 mom looked up the country to determine what to pack. Without the computer, we might have packed inappropriate items. Lastly, computers are an excellent research tool. I cannot quantify the number of times I have used the computer for research. Although books and encyclopedias are valuable resources, the computer offers a vast amount of information. There are numerous links and websites to explore, and one can find pictures, videos, maps, and much more. I have frequently used the computer for research, and sometimes it is a requirement to cite specific websites for school projects. If one has a computer at home, they can develop their computer skills for school. Overall, the positive aspects of computers outweigh the negative ones. One can communicate with others without the burden of high phone bills, learn about different places and cultures, and use the computer for research. Computers are truly remarkable!
235	235	1	1	To Whom It May Concern, I am of the opinion that computers are highly beneficial in most people's lives. Firstly, they can be used for almost every purpose imaginable. Secondly, computers offer numerous advantages. They should not disrupt one's daily schedule or interfere with family time. People can utilize computers for a wide range of activities. There are hundreds of websites available on the computer. For example, one can play various types of games, chat with others, listen to music, watch videos, search for places, and much more. Computers are extremely versatile and useful. Additionally, computers are beneficial for individuals. They enhance eye coordination. One can also practice math, social studies, and other subjects online. The internet features a plethora of educational games, which are beneficial for those who require additional assistance. Moreover, using a computer improves hand coordination as one needs to learn how to type. With practice, one can type proficiently without looking at the keyboard. A computer should not impede one's daily routine or family interactions. A computer is a tool that one uses when necessary or for entertainment. For instance, I have a computer at home, and someone uses it every day. However, it has never affected our daily lives. We children still attend school, our parents go to work, we have dinner together, and we carry out our regular activities without any interference from the computer. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a valuable addition to people's homes. They can be used for a multitude of purposes, offer numerous benefits, and should not disrupt one's daily schedule in any way.
236	236	1	1	Dear Newspaper Staff, I posit that computers are advantageous. Consider a scenario where a family member travels out of town, and one wishes to maintain contact. In the absence of a phone, one can utilize a chat website to stay connected. When feeling idle, I visit Google to search for images and engage in games. One may search for one topic and discover something else that captivates the attention. Computers are useful wherever one goes; they can assist with school projects. Moreover, when at school, they can aid in spelling. If one needs to know which country has the largest population, the computer will promptly provide the answer. Computers are advancing annually. Initially, the computer was merely a screen and a mouse; now, we have laptops that can be carried everywhere. People can exercise and enjoy nature while bringing a laptop. During exercise, one can access YouTube to listen to music and watch amusing videos. This is why I believe computers are beneficial.
237	237	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am penning this letter to expound on my perspective regarding the impacts of computers on individuals. There are three primary concerns: identity theft, cyberbullying, and addiction. I will now elaborate on each in a separate paragraph. My first rationale for believing that computers have adverse effects is identity theft. In the United States, numerous individuals have their identities stolen due to the online disclosure of private information via computers. This can result in substantial debt for the affected person. How can we encourage people to use computers when they are at risk of having their identities stolen? If this is happening to innocent individuals, it must cease. We should not condone such online behavior; thus, we should reject computers. I understand that it is indeed fascinating to learn about people from different countries, yet there are drawbacks. Engaging in online conversations with strangers can be perilous. These individuals may pose as famous personalities and bully others for their amusement. It has been established that cyberbullying can lead children and even adults down the path of depression and, in extreme cases, suicide. I find it utterly foolish to sacrifice one's life for the sake of a computer. Hence, I reiterate my stance against computers. My final reason for opposing computers is that people become addicted to the allure of the digital world. This addiction can lead to estrangement from friends and family as individuals become immersed in the virtual realm. Additionally, personal hygiene and proper nutrition may be neglected. The so - called computer is akin to a drug that causes one to lose touch with reality. Once again, I firmly say no to computers. I have presented my opinion and three supporting arguments, namely identity theft, cyberbullying, and addiction. Say no to computers.
238	238	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I wholeheartedly concur with the experts on computers. Proponents of technological advancements assert that computers have a positive influence on individuals. They claim that computers enhance hand - eye coordination, enable learning from distant locations, and facilitate online communication. While these benefits are valid, there are numerous negative impacts that are often overlooked. Prolonged computer use can impair vision due to the proximity to the screen. Moreover, computers are highly addictive for many people worldwide, leading to a sedentary lifestyle and contributing to the prevalent issue of obesity. Additionally, computers tend to consume a significant amount of time from people's lives. In my view, although computers offer some advantages, these can be achieved in more beneficial ways. For instance, hand - eye coordination can be practiced by playing tennis with a friend, which also provides exercise. Instead of communicating with friends online, one can opt to call them on the phone and enjoy the outdoors. If one wishes to learn about a distant place, visiting it in person is a far more enriching experience. There are countless activities that can rival and surpass the functions of a computer. However, I am not suggesting that computers are entirely useless. I recognize that, like most things in the world, computers have both positive and negative aspects. In my honest opinion, the negative impacts outweigh the positive ones.
239	239	1	1	Personally, I am of the opinion that individuals should curtail their computer usage. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, excessive computer use often leads to a lack of physical activity. People tend to spend an inordinate amount of time on computers and neglect exercise. This sedentary lifestyle can result in weight gain and various health problems. Instead of sitting in front of a computer, individuals should engage in activities such as running or going to the gym. Even if one has home exercise equipment, it is still preferable to use it rather than remain glued to the computer screen. If people dedicated as much time to exercise as they do to computers, the average weight of humans would significantly decrease. Secondly, excessive computer use prevents people from appreciating nature. Spending long hours indoors in front of a computer means missing out on the fresh air and natural beauty outside. I, for one, would much rather be outside playing baseball and staying fit than sitting inside getting overweight. Even viewing nature through a computer screen cannot compare to the real experience of being outdoors. If people spent as much time enjoying nature as they do on computers, our world would be a healthier and cleaner place. Finally, computer addiction can lead to a decline in social interaction with family and friends. People may isolate themselves in a dark room, ignoring their loved ones while engrossed in the digital world. This is not only detrimental to relationships but also to one's emotional well - being. If a person spends all their time on the computer, they will gradually lose touch with the people who matter most to them. In conclusion, it is evident that people would be better off spending more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends rather than indulging in excessive computer use. Even if one currently spends only a small amount of time on the computer, there is a risk of gradually increasing usage until it becomes all - consuming.
240	240	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, This letter aims to convey my perspective on computers. Indeed, people spend a considerable amount of time on computers because they are extremely useful in various aspects. Computers assist us in our jobs, educational pursuits, and other professional endeavors. For example, in the field of science, as a student in the @NUM1 grade, my teacher @PERSON1 assigns homework every @DATE1. We are required to compile @NUM2 facts on any topic of our choice for @ORGANIZATION1. Many students search for information about bears on @ORGANIZATION2 to complete their assignments. In the workplace, secretaries rely heavily on computers. In our school, secretaries and teachers use computers for attendance tracking, grading, and accessing student information such as attendance records, grades, phone numbers, and schedules. Computers also play a crucial role in communication. My father uses the computer to stay in touch with our family in @LOCATION1. We engage in conversations to catch up on each other's lives and learn about recent events. Just last week, I was chatting with my cousin, and she told me that her dog had @NUM3 puppies. Our family also utilizes the computer for online shopping. My uncle visited ticketmaster.com to purchase two tickets for a WWE event. He also books his flight tickets online to travel to @LOCATION1. In essence, people use computers extensively because of their numerous benefits. However, it is not advisable to be solely engrossed in the digital world. It is essential to venture outdoors, appreciate nature, lead an active lifestyle, and exercise not only for physical fitness but also for overall health. @CAPS1, I hope you appreciate and understand my opinion on computers. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter; I truly value your attention.
241	241	1	1	Dear local @ORGANIZATION1 administrators @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, recently I have observed that some citizens of @ORGANIZATION1 have been utilizing computers and laptops extensively. Some individuals opine that @CAPS2 is a waste of time that could be spent in the company of family and friends, including those residing afar. In fact, @CAPS2 facilitates research and learning about @ORGANIZATION1 - related matters, and it also aids in relaxing individuals. In contemporary times, those who oppose it may have family and friends living far away, and face - to - face communication is not feasible. While there are options like making calls or writing letters, platforms such as email, Facebook, and @ORGANIZATION2 are more convenient and user - friendly. When making a call, one cannot be certain if the recipient's phone is busy or if they are in an unfavorable situation. @CAPS2 takes time, but it is better to stay online and send a message, knowing that one's intention is conveyed. Moreover, @CAPS2 is useful in advertising and sales. However, it can sometimes be unreliable as anyone can modify content on the site. Nevertheless, not all online information is of this nature. One should steer clear of scams and dubious content, which may surface. Some people find that @CAPS2 can be a respite from work or a source of entertainment. There are engaging games and opportunities to interact. In research, the internet helps @PERCENT1 of people unwind and calm down after a long @CAPS5, which is beneficial for stress management. Computers offer numerous advantages. There are also other reliable resources. Additionally, the internet is ubiquitous.
242	242	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, in our town, the daily number of computer users is on the rise. Some individuals assert that the computer enables a wide range of activities and communication with others. However, I contend that our town should not support technological advancements. By doing so, residents will have more time for physical exercise, in - person conversations with family and friends, and participation in various town - wide activities. Do you aspire to be overweight and out of shape? If one spends excessive time sitting at the computer daily, this is likely to be the outcome. ""@CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated, 'I believe exercise should be an integral part of everyone's daily routine.'"" Excessive computer attachment may lead to a lack of physical activity. In the state of @LOCATION1, it has been proven that @PERCENT1 of residents are overweight due to insufficient exercise, while @PERCENT2 are overweight because of improper diet. This indicates that more people in @LOCATION1 lack exercise than have dietary issues. No one desires to be overweight, and this situation can be altered! Each year, an increasing number of people create Facebook and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 accounts. Some school - going children spend the entire day online chatting with friends who live nearby. Students are reluctant to communicate with their friends over the phone and prefer online interactions instead. ""@CAPS4 cannot accurately discern the tone of an online message,"" @PERSON3 noted. Messages can be interpreted in multiple ways. Phone calls are a swift and straightforward means of communication, eliminating the need to wait for a typed response. If you are a frequent computer user, arrange a real - life meeting with your friends. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, and holiday strolls are events offered by every town! Instead of merely fantasizing about joining a team, take action! Towns care about their residents and aim to provide enjoyable experiences, which is why these activities are organized. ""@CAPS5 strive to make the town vibrant and foster a sense of community,"" says @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2. Participating in these activities will allow you to meet peers in the town. If your town offers such activities, it is extending a helping hand. Engaging in town - related activities is far more rewarding than sitting at home on the computer! Whether technology advances or not, why stay indoors and do nothing but chat? Interact with people in person. Maintaining physical fitness, having real - life conversations, and participating in town activities are the ideal choices. Thank you for your attention."
243	243	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever contemplated how your life would be without a computer? I firmly believe that computers exert a profound influence on people globally. They are invaluable in both professional and academic settings. Moreover, computers facilitate communication for students and adults alike. Many individuals wish to visit certain places but lack information about their appearance and location. With a computer, all such details can be easily obtained. Let us delve into the perspectives of students on this topic. Computers streamline tasks at work and school. Consider this: without computers, every paper would have to be written by hand, a process that can be extremely time - consuming. When typing a school paper, spell - check ensures accuracy, which is often difficult to achieve when writing by hand. Work is completed more expeditiously on a computer, leaving more time for socializing with friends. A hastily written paper may be difficult to decipher, whereas computer - generated work is always neat. You can email your work to a friend or save it on your computer. If any changes are required, it is much quicker than rewriting the entire paper. Computers have a positive impact on me as they expedite my work. They also enhance communication among people. In schools, students often seek help from friends regarding homework. Without computers, they would have no way to ask questions and might end up with incorrect answers. I enjoy spending time with friends, and making plans is essential for this. When on the computer, one can log on to Facebook and communicate with friends about their evening plans if they are online. This is far more convenient than looking up phone numbers and making calls. Many people wish to stay in touch with old school friends, and computers make this effortless. Additionally, computers enable you to explore places you wish to visit. Many individuals love to travel, and with a computer, you can access maps and find the shortest route to your destination. You can also determine the most suitable mode of transportation, which may not necessarily be by car. I would not want to visit a place that lacks visual appeal. Now, I can simply visit the relevant website and gather all the information I need about a place. If a place is @NUM1 hours away, I would not want to undertake such a long journey, so it is important to know the distance. Computers provide all this information and details about the local weather. I rely on computers for most of my activities. The insights presented here reflect our thoughts on the impact of computers in today's world. They simplify work, enhance communication, and provide information about travel destinations. The computer is an extremely reliable tool, and those who disagree are missing out on a great deal.
244	244	1	1	Dear @CITY1 authorities, currently, I am writing to address the issue of people spending excessive time on computers, thereby neglecting face - to - face interactions with family, friends, and others. While it is true that people can obtain valuable information from the computer for important papers or college essays, there is a growing concern that individuals are becoming increasingly lethargic and missing out on the benefits of exercise and fresh air. To elaborate on the impact on social relationships, consider this scenario: your friends are organizing a large beach party that everyone is looking forward to. You ask your friends to pick you up, but before they arrive, you start chatting with someone on the computer. When your friends come to your house, you are so engrossed that you miss their arrival. The next day at school, they are talking about the wonderful party you missed. This is just one example. Now, let me briefly discuss the positive aspect of using the computer for information. Suppose you are working on a paper. You search for relevant information, find a good source, extract useful content, and then finalize your paper. You receive a good grade and feel satisfied. This is one of the few positive outcomes of computer use. For some reason, some people prefer to stay indoors on the computer, while others venture outside on pleasant days. Whether it is MySpace, Facebook, or other platforms, it is beneficial to communicate with others. However, if one is overly concerned about the quality of their pictures, it is a misplaced priority. What truly matters is one's well - being and happiness. I believe I have presented all the points I intended to make. These are the reasons why computers have both positive and negative aspects. The negative aspects include lack of exercise and reduced social interaction with friends.
245	245	1	1	I am of the opinion that computers are a boon to society. They enhance hand - eye coordination. When typing on a computer, one gradually becomes so proficient that there is no need to look at the keyboard. Moreover, computers enable individuals to explore different places and acquire new knowledge. One can search for any information on the internet. For instance, if one wishes to learn about a particular country, they can conduct a search and discover a wealth of new information. Suppose one is planning a vacation but is undecided about the destination. By using the computer, one can research tourist attractions in various countries and make an informed decision. Additionally, computers facilitate communication with people who are geographically distant. If one is on vacation or living in a different location from loved ones, video - chatting over the computer allows for face - to - face interaction. In conclusion, these are the reasons why I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to our society.
246	246	1	1	"Dear editor, Have you ever yearned to acquire knowledge so intensely that you find it impossible to concentrate on anything else? Have you ever embarked on a quest to uncover that information and experienced an epiphany? What means did you employ to seek this knowledge? Chances are, you utilized a computer. All one needs to do is input their query, press ""enter,"" and lo and behold! The screen populates with a plethora of information - laden websites. Computers assist numerous individuals in addressing their daily queries. Our nation has become more intellectually astute due to computers. You can engage in discourse with friends who have relocated across the state, country, or even the globe. With every click of the mouse, there are novel insights to be gleaned. You can even utilize the computer for personal amusement. Computers have presented a multitude of opportunities that the world ought to embrace. When I was four years old, my erstwhile best friends moved to Florida. I was utterly devastated. Initially, we attempted to correspond via letters. Subsequently, as we grew older and our schedules became increasingly congested, our connection with one another came to a halt. As technology and computers have advanced, my friend and I engage in texting, emailing, and instant - messaging each other incessantly. It has rendered our long - distance friendship more manageable and intimate. Thanks to computers, you can communicate with friends you believed were lost to time. You can also encounter new individuals through one of the numerous available platforms. How would you relish conversing with someone in @LOCATION2? Global communication has also opened up a multitude of business prospects. Given the faltering economy, computers will create job opportunities, aid college students in preparing for their future careers, and hopefully enhance the lives of many. Communication is indispensable for various aspects to improve our world for generations to come. Instead of frequenting a noisy arcade, why not indulge in thrilling games within the privacy of your own abode? Any game you can conceive of can likely be found on the @CAPS1. From a simple game of solitaire to an advanced - level strategy game, games catering to any age and difficulty level are accessible. Now, some people in @MONTH1 opine that all children will do is sit in front of the computer and play games. There will undoubtedly be individuals who will decline to venture outdoors, spend time with friends, or simply read in the open air. Such people will surely exist. I cannot prevent this. What we can do is encourage those who refuse to go outside to do so. I know many individuals who manage their time judiciously and still have a fulfilling experience. We can also motivate children to utilize exercise programs on their computers and video games to improve their health. There are numerous enjoyable games that enable you to become a healthier and better - rounded individual while having fun. The computers in our homes are currently equipped with such an abundance of information that attempting to assimilate it all would be overwhelming. @ORGANIZATION1, a renowned search engine, empowers you to look up anything you could ever wish to know, from the vice - president's birthday to the price of eggs in @LOCATION4 to the width of the @LOCATION1, all with the click of a button. This knowledge is incredibly beneficial for homework assignments. Most reference books are outdated, and the information is inaccurate, but computers are updated so frequently that you have access to all the facts at all times. I believe our country has become significantly more intelligent because of computers. So whether you wish to converse with your long - lost friend in @LOCATION2 or consult an expert on ospreys in @LOCATION3, you can find your answer on the computer. While you're at it, play a couple of exciting games and learn about the best movies ever released in @DATE1. Have fun and acquire a wealth of knowledge!"
247	247	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, A multitude of individuals are currently utilizing computers. Nevertheless, everyone is entitled to their own perspective regarding them. Some individuals harbor a dislike for computers, while there are those like me who hold a favorable view. Computers facilitate rapid communication, offer a diverse array of games for entertainment, and serve as a repository of information. Nine out of ten individuals appreciate what computers can accomplish for them. Unlike the traditional method of sending and writing letters, instant messaging is a far swifter and more convenient means of communicating with another person. Sending and receiving letters can span days or weeks; in contrast, instant messaging takes merely a few seconds! Even better, it is free! Instant messaging is not the sole avenue for communicating with friends or family; video chat is also available. Video chat is akin to a telephone conversation, but it allows you to visually perceive the person you are conversing with. You can engage in a video chat with someone from a foreign country, and astonishingly, it is also free! Making long - distance calls can be prohibitively expensive, but video chat incurs no cost! A computer is not only advantageous for communication but also offers the opportunity to play engaging and entertaining games! Everyone, regardless of age, derives pleasure from playing games. There are countless websites on the internet, and among them are numerous game - specific platforms. Most game sites feature virtual games that can be played online at no cost! There are single - player, two - player, and multiplayer options. This implies that you can play alone, with a friend, or with the entire family. Everyone can partake and have a great time. Additionally, computers can serve both as a source of entertainment and a tool for work. They provide a vast amount of information, akin to having your own personal library at your fingertips! Whether you are conducting research for a project, seeking knowledge, or simply aiming to stay informed, the internet can assist you in any subject area. All you need to do is search for the topic you require, whether it's learning to cook a particular dish, studying space, attempting to spell a word, or any other query that comes to mind, and the information will be readily available, and once again, for free! In conclusion, computers are useful for a multitude of purposes, and these are merely a few examples. I hope you view computers in the same light as I and millions of others do. As is evident, computers have improved the lives of countless individuals.
248	248	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers represent a cutting - edge technology that continues to evolve and improve. They can perform a multitude of functions, such as facilitating the acquisition of new knowledge and enabling communication with new and old friends. Some individuals even pursue online education. What many people appreciate about computers is the availability of games. Computers are a significant asset to us, offering both utility and enjoyment. Computers can impart a wealth of new and exciting knowledge. There is a vast expanse of information to be learned. Some of the subjects you can explore on the computer include geographical locations, historical figures, animals, plants, and culinary recipes. I once needed to find a recipe for caramel apples, and I used the computer to do so. Some people leverage the computer for educational purposes. There are online colleges and online high schools. It is a novel approach to homeschooling. Not everyone can attend large @CAPS1, so online colleges provide a more accessible alternative. Moreover, suppose you are working on a project and require information. Instead of rushing to the library, you can use the computer to find it. There are numerous other activities you can engage in on the computer, such as reconnecting with friends. Everyone has friends, be they new or old. In the past, before the advent of computers, if you wanted to communicate with a friend, you had to send a letter. With computers, you can now send a message much more rapidly. It is now known as an email. You simply type your message and click ""send"" to dispatch it to your friend. Not everyone uses email; some prefer instant messaging. Examples of instant - messaging platforms include AIM or Meebo. I relocated from @LOCATION1 to here, and I have friends whom I rarely get to see. I am certain that many people face a similar situation. Well, with the computer, you can now see and chat with people! For instance, @ORGANIZATION2 is a platform that allows you to interact with your friends in this manner. It is an effortless and enjoyable way to maintain contact with friends and even family. There is still more that a computer can offer. Another function is the ability to play video games. They are incredibly entertaining, and when I refer to video games, I mean those that kids, teens, and adults all enjoy. Whenever you are bored, you can play online games. You can also play games that you have purchased. They are both engaging and fun! Even very young children can play games. Sometimes, you can even play with your friends online. I know that when I am bored, I log on to the computer and play a game called @CAPS2 @NUM1. Computers are remarkable, and there are countless other things you can do besides what I have mentioned. I hope I have convinced you or demonstrated how computers are beneficial to us."
249	249	1	1	"According to @PERSON1, an economic expert, for every hour you spend using the computer, your electricity bill increases by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 individual spends @NUM1 hours on the computer daily. I am of the opinion that spending an excessive amount of time on the computer can be detrimental. It results in economic loss due to the inflated electric bill, health deterioration as you are less likely to engage in physical exercise, and social isolation as you spend less time interacting with your community. Financial loss is a concern for many individuals. If everyone spent @NUM2 fewer hours on the computer, they could save @MONEY1 on their electric bill. In a survey, @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people stated that they would do anything to save money. Therefore, reducing computer usage would lead to substantial financial savings. In addition to financial loss, there is also a significant health issue. Many are discussing the growing problem of obesity among Americans. A portion of this problem can be attributed to excessive computer use. Professor @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1 asserts that ""the obesity problem in @LOCATION1 could be alleviated if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising."" Currently, @NUM5 out of @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 fewer hours on the computer, the ratio would decrease to @NUM1 out of @NUM6. Although health is a pressing issue, the impact on the community is even more severe. People rarely engage in face - to - face conversations anymore. They communicate via @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. Communities are spending less time together in the real world compared to the virtual realm. @PERSON1, an expert in human behavior, posits that when people reduce their computer usage, they spend more time interacting with one another. It is a well - established fact that increased social interaction leads to greater enjoyment. Thus, I would argue that spending less time on the computer would be advantageous for our community. It would yield financial, health, and social benefits. These are all crucial aspects that we compromise if we spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer."
250	250	1	1	I do not concur that computers are beneficial to society. Many individuals squander their lives in front of the computer instead of engaging in physical exercise, socializing with friends, or spending quality time with family. @NUM1 people will admit that they spend at least @NUM2 hours a day on their computers, which is entirely unnecessary. Why is obesity such a prevalent issue in the world today? It is due to a lack of physical activity. And what is the primary culprit? Undoubtedly, it is computers. For people to maintain good health, a significant amount of physical exertion is required. When someone can remain sedentary all day, clicking a mouse or typing on a keyboard, how much physical activity are they actually getting? Moreover, there are numerous disorders in the world. @PERCENT1 of the population will agree that increased physical activity can help prevent these often - painful disorders. Too many people are choosing their computers over exercise, and it is causing them numerous health problems that could have easily been avoided. Secondly, it is widely acknowledged that friends are indispensable in life. However, people are now communicating with their friends online or in computer games instead of meeting them in person. Online interactions are fraught with misunderstandings that often lead to the dissolution of friendships. Additionally, it is more challenging to meet new people or make a large number of new friends online. When you go out and engage in real - world interactions, you can make many more friends, which enriches your life significantly. Finally, would anyone desire for their family to become fragmented? Well, this is one of the many consequences of excessive computer use. Family members spend less time together, which can weaken the family bond. Moreover, husbands and wives may communicate infrequently, often resulting in separation or divorce. This can force a child to make difficult choices. Physical activity, friends, and family are essential elements of life, and computers put these at risk. So, take a stand and put an end to this negative trend. Stop excessive computer use before it's too late.
251	251	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I have ascertained that certain experts opine that individuals allocate an excessive amount of time to computers when they could be engaging in physical exercise or spending time with friends and family. Conversely, I hold a divergent view. Computers serve as an excellent medium for learning and communicating with others, and here are the reasons: Firstly, I wish to emphasize the substantial assistance computers offer in the educational realm. The majority of students utilize them on a daily basis. We can prepare for examinations by exploring websites replete with information and conduct research on topics that elude our comprehension. For instance, if one desires to discover how planets form, simply input the query into a search engine, and a plethora of websites will promptly appear. Another application of computers in school is during project work. We can employ diverse tools to create a slide - show while simultaneously sourcing information from the internet. Additionally, the internet facilitates communication between teachers and students. If a teacher establishes a blog, students can stay informed about class activities, homework assignments, and access useful links that enhance their understanding of specific topics. Another aspect I would like to highlight is that while experts claim computers deprive us of time with loved ones, in reality, the opposite is true; computers elevate communication to a new echelon. For example, if one wishes to converse with an old acquaintance, they can log onto platforms like MSN or AIM to catch up on each other's lives. A second mode of communication with friends is via @ORGANIZATION1, an economical and convenient means of contacting friends abroad. Alternatively, one can adopt a more traditional approach and send an email. Although it may take longer to receive a response, the wait is worthwhile. Finally, for parents whose children reside far away, video chat is an ideal communication method as it enables them to see and hear their children. Lastly, I would like to underscore the vast amount of knowledge we can acquire through computers. One can visit a search engine and search for any topic in the world, and it is inevitable to obtain hundreds of results. Irrespective of one's interests, valuable information can always be found. The internet also allows us to stay updated on current news, such as weather forecasts. Moreover, there are websites where one can pose questions and receive prompt answers. Although it is necessary to verify the reliability of sources, I believe the benefits outweigh the effort. Finally, if one is planning a trip, flight information can be retrieved with a single click. There are also numerous websites that provide weather forecasts and information about the destination. Next time, carefully consider what you hear about computers, as they are not as detrimental as they may seem. While it may sometimes be preferable to engage in outdoor activities, computers play a crucial role in learning and communication.
252	252	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I concur that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. My agreement stems from the fact that computers are capable of imparting knowledge to people. Moreover, they enable individuals to interact with one another and express their beliefs and creativity. Computers have a positive impact on people because I firmly believe they can educate individuals extensively. Computers can present information in a visual format, which is beneficial for both children and adults. I recall that during my childhood, I used to play math and science games on the computer to aid in my test preparation. Computers also prove invaluable in the professional lives of adults. I am at a loss to imagine what many adults in the world would do without computers. When one contemplates the multitude of jobs that rely on computers today, such as email communication, it becomes evident that computers are indispensable. What would some businesses do without email? Additionally, adults enjoy accessing websites to stay informed about the news and sports events. We can all glean a wealth of knowledge from computers, and there are numerous individuals whose jobs are computer - dependent. We learn something new every day, and computers can enhance the learning process. Furthermore, computers facilitate online chats, email communication, and now, with the integration of webcams, face - to - face conversations with people across the globe are possible. I am aware that email is a boon for individuals in long - distance relationships, as it is a swift and efficient means of communication. Thanks to the built - in webcams and microphones in computers, I can now communicate with my friends and family, see them, and hear their voices without the need for travel, simply by clicking a button. There are websites that enable individuals to connect with others online via webcam or microphone. Such platforms are extremely beneficial. Consider those individuals in relationships; computers truly play a supportive role. Lastly, there are many people who channel their imagination through computers, pouring their thoughts and emotions into digital content. I know numerous individuals who express their feelings in writing because they would never have the courage to voice them aloud. Now, envision a world without computers. This is what comes to mind when people make negative remarks about computers. In my opinion, everything has its uses, and computers undoubtedly bring about a positive impact on the world.
253	253	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you believe that computers are advantageous? An increasing number of individuals are utilizing computers, yet not everyone concurs that this trend is beneficial to society. I vehemently oppose this view. My first contention is that computers pose safety risks. My second reason is that they can embroil users in significant trouble. My third argument is that one can never anticipate what may transpire while using a computer. Read on to understand the rationale behind my disagreement. First, allow me to elucidate why I hold this stance. The primary reason for my opposition is that computers are not secure, as there is a risk of someone tracing one's location. What then? Secondly, computers can lead users into various predicaments, such as posting inappropriate content online or making derogatory remarks to others. Moreover, computers can be detrimental because if someone has a crush on you and you reject them, they may post malicious and hurtful content. If your friends see this, you are likely to be infuriated. Finally, in conclusion, these are the reasons why I believe computers are not beneficial. One can never predict what might occur on a computer; there are numerous websites, some of which may introduce viruses to your system. Additionally, I believe that computers are not conducive to a positive outcome, so it is advisable to keep children away from them. Also, exercise caution regarding your online activities.
254	254	1	1	I entered my living room and witnessed my brother engrossed in the computer, chatting with his friends on Facebook. I mused to myself that he is constantly glued to the computer, never using it for academic purposes. Many people assert that we do not require computers, and I personally concur with this assertion. In the town of @ORGANIZATION1, the majority of residents own computers. Without a computer to access information, one must visit the library and borrow a book. Just the other day, my friend @PERSON1 went to the library and checked out a book about the @CAPS1 culture. He was captivated by the book, reading it thoroughly. He used it for a book report on different cultures. When he submitted the report to the teacher, the teacher was visibly pleased. When he received his test back, he had achieved an @NUM1. He did not rely on the internet. Unlike a book, a computer is not portable. If you wish to learn about something while traveling in a car, you cannot use a computer, whereas a book can be easily read. Additionally, books are often more engaging to read. The absence of a computer can lead to other positive activities, such as exercise. While my brother spends all day indoors, my friends and I are outside playing football, basketball, baseball, soccer, kickball, and dodgeball. We are in excellent physical shape because of the activities we engage in almost daily. In contrast, my brother has become obese. Before he had a computer, he was as slender as we are. Spending excessive time on the computer is also detrimental to health, as it can lead to late - night use, missed buses, and poor academic performance. After our games, we watch a little television and then go to sleep to recharge. We typically get at least @NUM2 hours of sleep each day, which enables us to perform well in school. We also make healthy food choices, such as consuming fruits and vegetables, to maintain our energy levels. My brother, on the other hand, indulges in junk food, which has contributed to his obesity. Not having a computer allows you to spend more quality time with your family. When we go out for a meal, my brother is always eager to return to the computer, preventing us from fully enjoying our food. He is often in such a rush that he may even pick at other people's plates to finish faster, while everyone else wants to savor their meals. When we plan to go to the movies, my brother prefers to stay home on the computer. Even if we rent a movie and watch it at home, he will not join us. This behavior truly upsets my parents, siblings, and me. It seems as though he has distanced himself from the family. It is as if he has forgotten about us. This is why I believe computers should be regulated. They can lead to obesity and poor academic performance. If you desire your children to be healthier, achieve better grades, and spend more time with the family, either sell your computer or limit its use. This issue is prevalent worldwide.
255	255	1	1	Dear Newspaper editor, Computers represent a remarkable technological advancement, yet some individuals hold a contrary view. While some consider them a great asset, others perceive them as a health hazard. I firmly believe that computers are an outstanding addition. I have formulated @NUM1 reasons to support my perspective. Computers facilitate staying in touch with distant friends and family members, assist in research endeavors, and even enable online shopping. Firstly, if you have relatives or friends residing far away, computers offer websites such as AOL, Facebook, and MySpace for communication. Most of these platforms allow free account creation, eliminating the need to worry about monthly subscription fees. This is far more cost - effective and convenient than traveling and incurring gas expenses for in - person visits. Moreover, computers are equipped with webcams for video chat, which allows users to see and converse with each other simultaneously, a truly remarkable feature. Secondly, the internet serves as a valuable resource for research. When working on a project and requiring more in - depth information than what books can provide, search engines like Google or Ask.com can be utilized. The necessary details and information can be easily retrieved within a few minutes, which is significantly more efficient than spending an hour or more reading. Lastly, online shopping is a convenient alternative when you desire or need a particular item. For example, if you are looking for a unique toy for your child but cannot find it in local stores, you can purchase it online. Online retailers often offer fast shipping services. I am an advocate of online shopping. I remember that when I desperately wanted a bike, my mother purchased it for me online as a birthday gift. In conclusion, computers are extremely useful. Whether you need information, wish to communicate with someone, or make a purchase, computers have you covered. I rely on computers extensively and firmly believe they are an invaluable asset.
256	256	1	1	"Some individuals in @MONTH1 concur that computers do not contribute to physical fitness, or that excessive time is spent on them. Nevertheless, they facilitate maintaining contact with friends and family, meeting new acquaintances, and storing information. Without these crucial technological devices, these activities would be unfeasible. Most families are dispersed across the country, and @MONTH1 even reside in another nation. Due to travel expenses, in - person meetings are infrequent. However, computers enable effortless and rapid communication, quicker than one can utter ""@LOCATION1."" Moreover, numerous individuals create websites that allow us to easily keep abreast of our distant relatives. Facebook, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 of fish, and singles net are all platforms where one can find friends or a suitable partner. This presents an opportunity to discover @CAPS1 individuals with similar interests. Half of my mother's boyfriends were sourced from these sites. Without these platforms, there might be fewer divorces and more idyllic endings. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals work from home. It has its advantages and tasks can be accomplished. Many people possess important papers and information that could be lost instantaneously. With such technology, data can be saved with a mere click of the mouse. More businesses are being conducted at home thanks to this user - friendly technology. Although exercise remains important, with a simple button press, I can converse with my aunt, find a compatible partner, and safeguard my entire life. New technologies like computers can transform the world and expedite @MONTH1 tasks."
257	257	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, My perspective on the computer is that it can have detrimental effects on the citizens of @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I believe that some individuals are not engaging in sufficient physical activity, and I also consider that excessive computer use leading to laziness is equally problematic. There are three reasons for my stance. Firstly, people are not getting enough exercise. I selected this reason because individuals I know have gained significant weight. It is rather disheartening as they do nothing but remain glued to the computer and consume food. Additionally, prolonged computer use can damage eyesight due to constant exposure to the screen. Once, after using the computer, my eyes felt peculiar. Moreover, people become frail and weak. If one rises from the computer and attempts exercise, their bones may become feeble. Secondly, people become lazy and undergo changes. For example, they may repeatedly ask others to fetch items or perform tasks, and one might comply out of friendship. Another aspect is that the person's behavior changes; they become reluctant to participate in enjoyable events with friends. Eventually, the friendship may dissolve. It is deeply hurtful when someone you've known for a long time replaces you with a computer, which can lead to depression and, for some, suicidal thoughts. Thirdly, individuals can become addicted to the computer. For instance, when there is a birthday celebration, a person might say, ""First, I've got to beat this level."" Once the person says this, they are unlikely to disengage from the computer. Time passes quickly, and this is akin to squandering days of one's life. Those who have passed away would cherish every moment, so wasting time is unacceptable. Eventually, one may start to resent the person as they seem to care about nothing but the computer. These are the reasons explaining my opinion on the computer as presented in the newspaper I read."
258	258	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Excessive computer usage is never advisable, whether for work or leisure. I firmly hold this view because extended computer sessions result in reduced physical activity, less in - person interaction with family and friends, and potential damage to eyesight. In today's era of remarkable technological advancements, people are constantly fixated on computer screens. Let's be honest; the computer can be highly addictive due to the numerous engaging activities it offers. Once addicted, individuals lose the motivation to engage in other activities such as exercise. Research indicates that @PERCENT1 of children who use their computers for more than @NUM1 hours daily are obese. The root cause is evident: children's addiction to computers. Since they are so engrossed, they show no inclination to visit the gym or engage in physical pursuits. Another illustration is that in schools, when students have the option to choose electives, many prefer computer programming courses over physical education, further reducing their exercise time. While computers are remarkable inventions, they turn into adversaries when they start to impact health and physical well - being. Although online interaction may seem positive, it has negative implications for real - life social skills. Some people develop a pattern of exclusive online interaction, which makes them socially withdrawn in real life. Moreover, some children who are amiable online become extremely shy in person. This occurs because they feel more at ease communicating through the computer and gradually lose their real - life social abilities. Online interaction is beneficial for staying in touch with overseas friends and family, but it should not be overdone to the point of discomfort in real - life interactions. Eyes are among the most vital organs in the body. Prolonged computer use places strain on the eyes, which can lead to undesirable consequences. For example, those addicted to computers have a high probability of needing glasses. A recent survey revealed that over @PERCENT2 of individuals who use their computers for more than @NUM2 hours a day have required glasses. Over time, the strain accumulates, and even with glasses, vision can deteriorate significantly. Imagine a world where your vision is so poor that it's as if your eyes are almost shut; this is the fate of those who overuse computers. Local newspaper, while you @MONTH1 may consider computers one of the greatest inventions, it's important not to overuse them.
259	259	1	1	"As time progresses, our society has witnessed the proliferation of unnecessary technologies, such as the television. However, the focus of my writing is the computer. Contemporary society has developed an unhealthy addiction to computer use. In the twenty - first century, computer usage is ubiquitous. The world has become so reliant on computers that if all computers were to ""malfunction,"" most people would be at a loss as to how to @CAPS2. Recall the Y2K scare, where there was widespread panic that the world would end because computers were expected to crash and lose all recorded data. Humanity has an excessive dependence on computers. Since many individuals rely on computers to @CAPS2, they often ""neglect"" physical exercise. Our bodies require exercise to function optimally. Exercise is one of the most crucial activities in our daily lives. When one neglects exercise and indulges in junk food and beverages, the likelihood of developing diabetes, the flu, heartburn, or other ailments or disabilities is high. As the saying goes, ""You are what you eat."" Life already presents numerous distractions; there is no need to add another. The computer serves as a distraction from maintaining personal and public health. Initially, the computer was an ""innocent"" invention. Nowadays, people idolize the computer as if it were a @CAPS3. Those who use the computer incessantly become extremely lethargic, as their sole desire is to sit and use it. In my opinion, everyone should participate in some form of physical activity, whether it's basketball, football, baseball, track, tennis, or my personal favorite, skateboarding. Everyone should engage in physical activity at least three times a week. By doing so, the body functions better, one looks better, and feels better. Exercise can be enjoyable if one approaches it with a positive attitude. I hope this essay prompts you to reflect on your lifestyle. Exercise should be an integral part of your daily routine, rather than spending the day sitting and browsing pointless videos on ""youtube."" The choice of how to live your life is yours, and I sincerely hope that you opt for a healthier lifestyle."
260	260	1	1	Over one million individuals use the computer on a daily basis. I contend that excessive computer use is detrimental to health. Many people overindulge in computer time, which is self - abusive. One should establish a time management schedule to ensure sufficient exercise and refrain from using the computer when unnecessary. Obesity is also a prevalent consequence of excessive computer use. In my view, people should engage in alternative activities rather than solely relying on the computer. One prominent issue is that many individuals spend excessive time playing on the computer, leading to weight gain. This problem can be mitigated if we unite. A single person's efforts may be insufficient, but collective action can bring about change. We can be like formidable predators targeting the prey. If there are other activities available, one should pursue them. If one realizes that they have become overweight due to computer use, they can effect change. By consistently engaging in other activities, weight loss can be achieved easily. The key is to make that commitment. A significant problem is that people are reluctant to create a simple chart to manage computer usage. In my opinion, creating such a chart can help us determine when to stop and start using the computer. This is important because some individuals process information more effectively when it is presented visually, which can yield satisfactory results. People use the computer for schoolwork, which is beneficial depending on the duration. In my opinion, individuals should limit their computer use to @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours per day. They should complete their schoolwork and then disengage. I would much prefer to see children playing outdoors. Nature and wildlife are of greater significance. The effects of computer use can vary, ranging from weight gain to reduced family time and potential impacts on schoolwork. It is essential to utilize our time judiciously.
261	261	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I posit that numerous individuals allocate an excessive amount of time to computers. It is acceptable to utilize a computer for a duration ranging from twenty minutes to half an hour. However, an hour or more is an extended period. Individuals may become ensnared by engaging in addictive games. Additionally, online chatting services such as Facebook, MySpace, instant messaging, and others can also captivate them. Another avenue through which someone might spend more time on a computer is working on a report. They might commence it at the last minute. These are merely some of the numerous ways in which someone can be drawn into their computers. Have you ever logged onto the computer and played a game? Then, when you glance at the time, an hour has elapsed? Games are highly addictive. You can play a game for hours without being cognizant of how much time has passed. Games are indeed enjoyable, yet they can impair your cognitive faculties. @PERCENT1 of the global population spends an average of up to two hours on a computer each day. I opine that we should eliminate certain games from the internet so that people can dedicate their days to physical exercise and socializing with friends, rather than indulging in trivial games. Have you ever initiated a conversation with someone and realized that you have been conversing for an hour and a half? And that you have homework pending? @PERCENT3 of teenagers, on average, spend three hours each day chatting with friends on the internet. Facebook, MySpace, and instant messaging are all instances of this. It is acceptable for someone to communicate with their friends, but one must be mindful of the time to avoid getting carried away. I believe that we should curtail our usage of these websites so that children and teenagers can complete their homework. Have you ever been assigned a report and procrastinated until the last minute to commence it? Many teenagers engage in this behavior. They delay and begin their reports the day before they are due. Subsequently, they are compelled to spend hours on the internet attempting to complete it, which results in a lower grade than if they had started earlier. @PERCENT2 of students, on average, wait until the last minute to complete their reports and spend over four hours on the computer. I think we should ensure that students initiate their reports earlier to improve their academic performance. In conclusion, I firmly believe that people have squandered an inordinate amount of time using computers due to games, internet chatting, and last - minute report completion. I am of the view that if we eradicate games from the internet, reduce internet chatting, and start reports earlier, people will begin to engage in physical exercise, socialize with friends and family, complete their homework, and achieve higher grades.
262	262	1	1	Do you contemplate whether the ability to access information on any subject or communicate with individuals at a great distance is advantageous? With a computer, these are among the capabilities at your disposal. The capacity to converse with anyone regardless of geographical distance is indeed beneficial. Some individuals have family members residing in foreign countries whom they have not seen for an extended period, and a computer enables them to establish communication. @CAPS1 the individuals we have dispatched to @ORGANIZATION1 possess families here, and I have learned that they utilize computers to interact with them because they miss their loved ones. Moreover, if you inhabit an area prone to adverse weather conditions that restrict your mobility, a computer can serve as a means to pass the time. @CAPS1 the residents of the @CAPS2 endure substantial snowfall during the winter months and @MONTH1 are confined indoors. Consequently, if they own a computer, they can engage in activities such as playing games or watching videos to alleviate boredom. Another merit of a computer is its ability to facilitate comprehensive searches. You can acquire knowledge about distant locations even if you have never visited them by simply conducting an online search. Some children encounter difficulties with their homework, but a computer can serve as a valuable resource for further learning, enabling them to comprehend how to complete the tasks independently rather than relying on the teacher the following day. These are my perspectives on why computers exert a positive influence on people. They empower users to conduct extensive research, assist children with their academic endeavors, and provide entertainment during idle moments.
263	263	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, every minute of the day, millions of computer users across the globe log onto their laptops or desktops. However, is this always a favorable phenomenon? The query has arisen as to whether excessive computer usage is detrimental. Computers can be deleterious as individuals allocate an inordinate amount of time to them, thereby forfeiting quality time with friends and family. There are also perils associated with online interaction and the risk of personal information being compromised. Countless individuals worldwide grapple with these issues daily, and it is imperative to curtail computer usage. Whether teenagers, children, or adults are engrossed in gaming, browsing websites, or typing essays, people across the globe spend an excessive amount of time on their computers. For instance, among the @PERCENT1 of individuals with online - enabled computers, @PERCENT2 of them spend @NUM1 hours per day on these devices. This amounts to approximately @NUM2 billion hours of global computer usage. Both children and adults have witnessed a decline in face - to - face interaction with others. In the past, children engaged in outdoor activities, running and playing. Presently, less than @PERCENT3 of all children receive at least one hour of outdoor time. Computers are not inherently malevolent; however, when overused, they can have a detrimental impact on children's health. These factors not only contribute to but are almost the root cause of global obesity. To address these problems, computer usage must be reduced. The integration of online chat functionality into computers has not only augmented but doubled computer usage. The invention of @CAPS2 and instant messaging was initially intended to be beneficial, yet it has regrettably devolved into a negative force. Online chat allows individuals to send malicious and vulgar messages to their adversaries without revealing their identities. In some instances, teenagers have been subjected to severe online harassment, leading to tragic suicides. Another concerning aspect of @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 is that dangerous criminals can conceal themselves behind their computers and entice children or teenagers to a pre - arranged meeting place, where they may be kidnapped. Last year, @NUM3 out of @NUM4 online chat users were lured by criminals to a ""meeting place"" and subsequently kidnapped, never to be seen again. Most of these victims remain missing. Although online chat was conceived as a convenient means of communication, it has, in many cases, become a breeding ground for criminal activity. Millions, if not billions, of dollars have been pilfered by internet hackers. These hackers breach security codes and make online purchases using other people's funds. Four out of five individuals admit to having multiple websites containing personal information, and @NUM5 out of those four have had at least one account compromised. This problem continues to escalate as hackers target vulnerable websites. If this trend persists, the global economy could face bankruptcy. These hackers possess detailed knowledge of individuals, including their families, personal information, and residential addresses. Internet usage must be restricted to secure websites. If this issue is not addressed, usage will continue to rise, chat - related problems will persist, and people's finances will remain at risk."
264	264	1	1	Dear editor, @CAPS1, what activities do you engage in throughout the day? The likely answer is that you spend a significant portion of your time seated in front of a computer. My friends assert that this sedentary lifestyle is highly detrimental to one's health, and extensive research has corroborated this claim. My mother also has firsthand experience regarding the perils of excessive computer use. This habit is not only detrimental to personal well - being but also has a negative impact on the environment. @PERCENT1 of my friends contend that computers are a waste of time. Most individuals who spend their entire day interacting with computers lack a balanced diet and a regular exercise routine. They opine that the accumulation of junk food and sedentary behavior in the daily lives of both children and adults is unhealthy and will persist unless they become more active. They also warn that without adequate exercise, our nation will be plagued by an increasing number of overweight individuals. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 has conducted comprehensive research, which has conclusively demonstrated that computers can have adverse effects on health. @PERSON1 has traveled extensively across the country to raise awareness, emphasizing that more people should venture outdoors and appreciate nature. Regrettably, many individuals choose to remain seated in front of their computers, which is detrimental to their physical and mental health. He has educated people that @PERCENT2 of the time, exposing oneself to fresh air can significantly enhance the quality of life. My mother has personal experience with computers and assures me that during her youth, it was unthinkable to remain sedentary and refrain from outdoor activities. She emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong relationships with family and friends through regular interaction. Engaging in conversations with family members keeps them informed about one's life, and spending time with friends enriches one's social experiences outside the home. She believes that any child who spends the entire day in front of a computer should be ashamed of themselves. Editor, you have performed exceptionally well since assuming your position! I believe that if you emphasize the importance of limiting computer use in your next newspaper and advocate for regular exercise, as my friends suggest, and encourage people to appreciate nature, as research has indicated, and to interact with family and friends, as my mother advises, your next article will be a valuable source of information for your readers.
265	265	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers have been the focal point of numerous debates over the years, pitting lawyers against judges and parents against children. Could it be that we are overindulging in a seemingly beneficial technology? Are computers contributing to the growing sense of awkwardness in contemporary society? Undoubtedly, it is not prudent to have one's entire life documented in a public domain accessible to anyone. Moreover, the nature of the content we consume online is a cause for concern. I am eager to delve into this aspect. One of the most extensively debated topics globally is whether people are less inclined towards exercise compared to the @NUM2's. Studies reveal that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 individuals were overweight. As of @DATE1, this figure has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1, which is truly astonishing! Some of these individuals may feel safer remaining indoors. If you have played a video game where the player's health can deplete, you are aware of the consequences when the health bar reaches zero. You restart the game. However, after engaging in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 may be tempted to attempt a daring and perilous stunt. And let me emphasize, there is no second chance in real life. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 records every online activity you undertake? For example, if you are an aspiring guitarist searching for a new Gibson guitar, you will start receiving numerous advertisements from online stores. Why? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your personal information to businesses. By clicking the ""continue with install"" button, you inadvertently grant them permission. Consequently, you are inundated with spam emails. However, an even more severe threat looms. Your bank account details are at risk. That's right. If a virus infiltrates your computer, your funds could vanish. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise responsibility. This leads us to our final topic, a sensitive one. In the past, one had to purchase a magazine or book to encounter the exploitation of young women. Nowadays, it is merely a click away. This is bad enough. Young boys are easily enticed, and their futures are now being shaped by this pernicious influence. Additionally, the risk of a virus attack compounds the problem, placing individuals in a precarious situation. I am not suggesting that computers are entirely malevolent; rather, they may represent an overabundance of a good thing. At times, they can serve as a means of stress relief, such as by engaging in a virtual battle against an alien. However, it is essential to use this technology responsibly."
266	266	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly concur that computers have exerted a highly positive influence on people. As an increasing number of individuals have embraced computer usage, technological advancements have soared, enabling people to access a far greater array of resources. Computers are advantageous due to their convenience and the entertainment they offer. Have you ever pondered the capital of @LOCATION3 or the weather conditions in @LOCATION2? To obtain these answers, all one needs to do is conduct a search on the computer! The computer is so convenient that whenever one has a query about anything, it can be utilized. Take my cousin Courthey, for instance. Every day, her teacher assigns definitions as homework. Thus, she simply looks up the definitions on the computer instead of expending time searching for them in the dictionary. However, Courthey is not the sole individual who perceives the computer as convenient. When surveyed, @PERCENT1 of people voted that when they have a question about something, the computer is the most convenient tool to use. Professor @PERSON2, from @ORGANIZATION2, states, ""@CAPS1, as more people learn to operate the computer, it is becoming increasingly convenient for everyone."" In conclusion, numerous people rely on the computer for information, and one would not wish to deprive them of this, would they? It's a @DATE1 @TIME1, and you're bored. What should you do? How about using the computer! The computer is an excellent source of entertainment. Whether it's listening to music, playing games, or conversing with friends, one will always have a great time on the computer. For example, my neighbor, @PERSON3, returns home from school alone. She is typically extremely bored, so she accesses the computer to play games and chat with friends. @PERSON3 can also communicate with her cousins, @PERSON5 and @PERSON6, who reside in @LOCATION1. But @PERSON3 is not the only one who communicates with relatives online. When surveyed, @PERCENT2 of people agreed that they interact with relatives from other places via the computer. Dr. @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1, remarks, ""The computer is the primary source of entertainment for most teens and adults."" @CAPS2, one would not want to eliminate our main source of entertainment, would they? After school, many teens and adults rush to the computers for various reasons. In conclusion, computers have positively impacted all people with their remarkable convenience and excellent sources of entertainment."
267	267	1	1	To Whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 May Concern, @CAPS1 experience the delight of merely clicking a mouse, and suddenly, you're conversing with a friend you haven't seen in years. Computers render this a reality for us, yet this is not the sole benefit they provide. Computers contribute to society by furnishing us with search engines and educational resources, facilitating seamless connections with friends and family, aiding in the communication of significant matters, and enabling the planning of various activities, among other things. Firstly, computers have become an indispensable component of both education and research. Students from elementary schools through colleges can access a significantly greater amount of information than they could without computers. One can even earn a college degree through the computer! Indeed, online universities are beginning to emerge. This is highly beneficial for mothers who aspire to obtain a degree but need to stay at home with their children. Additionally, computer technology has been applied in scientific research and hospitals. With the assistance of computers, new discoveries have advanced, which will genuinely enhance people's lives! Computers are employed to search for a cure for cancer, address disasters such as earthquakes, and even detect a disease in someone before its symptoms commence! Computers have saved and improved lives in ways that people could never have envisioned sixty years ago. Secondly, computers enable people to connect and reconnect with others across the @CAPS2. Recently, I acquired a Facebook account, and within a few days, I had located and reconnected with three friends who had moved away, a distant cousin who had relocated to @LOCATION1 and whom I hadn't seen since childhood, and even my great - grandmother! The possibilities are boundless. Email has also been extremely advantageous to society, as @CAPS5 facilitates people's communication and event planning, which leads me to my next point. Lastly, computers facilitate communication among members of the @CAPS2. The internet is replete with websites designed to benefit our @CAPS2, one of which is @ORGANIZATION2; @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Without computers, this program would not have achieved the level of success and benefit that @CAPS5 has attained. Moreover, [website name] is an outstanding website that combines education with the aspect of @CAPS2 @CAPS5. It quizzes users on different levels of general knowledge, and for each correct answer, @ORGANIZATION1 donates @NUM1 grains of @ORGANIZATION1. When I'm bored, I sometimes visit it, and so far, I have filled over thirty bowls of @ORGANIZATION1 while learning simultaneously! In conclusion, computers have proven to be beneficial to the @CAPS2 and all within @CAPS5, not only to people but also to the environment. Computers promote research advancement, enable people to reconnect with one another, and facilitate communication within the @CAPS2. Who knows what computers will help us achieve next?
268	268	1	1	Dear, @CAPS1, I wish to convey something. Throughout the ages, humanity has been evolving, from cavemen discovering fire to the discovery of flight. Alongside evolution, we have discovered technology, and in recent years, we have been rapidly developing new technologies. Some contend that certain technologies, such as computers, are detrimental. However, I believe that computers are beneficial as they endow us with the ability to learn about distant places, allow us to communicate with people online, and cultivate hand - eye coordination. Computers enable us to access locations that we would ordinarily be unable to reach. If you were working on a research project about @LOCATION1 and lacked any books, what would you utilize? That's right, a computer. The internet would possess the facts you require, enabling you to attain a good grade. While online, you can communicate with friends and family who reside far away. The computer transcends long distances and connects devices, allowing for almost instantaneous communication. Without computers, you would be unable to contact these individuals. Utilizing computers is beneficial for both the body and the mind. It enhances hand - eye coordination. When you observe something on the screen and click on it, you are actually benefiting your body. Some people claim that when you're on the computer, you're not interacting with friends and family, but they are mistaken. I myself have conversed with my sister in a different room while using the computer, so the computer also enables interaction with friends and family! I adore computers. Don't you?
269	269	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, indeed, I firmly believe that an excessive number of people are 'addicted' to the computer and spend an inordinate amount of time on it each day! Not only teenagers but also children and the youth have fallen into the snare of the computer. During my childhood, I loathed the computer; all I desired was to go outside and play. As I grew older, I used the computer far more frequently than before. I now believe that the computer encroaches on family time, time that could be spent sitting down to read a good book or socializing with friends. Instead of engaging in these enjoyable interactive activities, people opt to visit Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, play addictive games, and explore whatever else they can find. I vehemently oppose being as attached to the computer as a mouse is to cheese. No! If there were one thing in the world that could keep parents and children together, it is not the computer. Computers distract kids and teenagers from engaging in other aspects of life and also impede families from functioning as a cohesive unit. Before the advent of computers, people had only their families. Children would return home from school saying ""@CAPS3 dad, I'm home from school. Can we go play catch?"" Instead, kids now come home from school to check if @CAPS4 has replied to their Facebook message. Computers also curtail the interaction time that families should have. @DATE1 @TIME1, instead of chatting on MySpace, why not gather the family for a board game! Or go to a restaurant, discuss your next vacation, and explore what you'd like to do. Go to the same field for a game or visit your local baseball field and play kickball, rather than sitting there transfixed by the computer screen! Alright, I understand that some people simply do not enjoy going out to play or engaging in physical exercise, and that is entirely understandable. However, that is still no excuse for sitting at the computer instead of reading a book. Reading is not only enjoyable but also intellectually stimulating, even when not in school! As you read, your brain is engaged, and you can expand your vocabulary to impress your friends and family. It is shown that @PERCENT1 of students who read [benefit in a certain way]. This is in contrast to the @PERCENT2 who sit at the computer all day writing replies."
270	270	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 Sun, I find that computers are highly useful. They assist people in numerous ways. They enable people to stay informed about global events, develop hand - eye coordination, and meet new people online. Firstly, people can gain knowledge about what is transpiring around the world. I can discover local happenings by referring to your newspaper. Others can learn about places they might visit. They can ascertain the weather conditions to plan their attire appropriately when traveling. Moreover, if one of your employees intends to go camping, they can search for a suitable camping site and learn about the potential dangers associated with camping to avoid them, as illness could prevent them from working. As evident, computers are of great significance. Secondly, computers foster hand - eye coordination. Many occupations demand proficiency in manual dexterity. Suppose one of your printers malfunctions, and you call a technician to repair it. The technician must be adept at using their hands to fix the printer. Now, assume the wiring in your lights is disrupted. You call an electrician, who must be skilled with their hands to work with small wires. Both these individuals are proficient with their hands, and they may have developed this skill through computer usage. As can be seen, computers are essential in modern life. Lastly, computers facilitate the meeting of new people online. Suppose you are alone after a strenuous day of newspaper production. You can log on to chat rooms or online games to meet new people. Now, assume one of your employees has just broken up with his girlfriend and is feeling sad and lonely, which is affecting his work. He can visit an online dating site to find the ideal partner. When he returns to work, he will be happier and more productive, resulting in increased newspaper production and higher profits for you. As is clear, computers are extremely important. In conclusion, computers are remarkable machines. They allow people to stay informed about global events, teach good hand - eye coordination, and enable the meeting of new people online.
271	271	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I have learned about your concerns regarding computers and wish to express my perspective. I contend that computers offer more educational benefits than they impose limitations. For instance, if you have a research project and need to find information about someone, accessing the computer will swiftly yield the desired results. Moreover, suppose you plan a distant vacation, such as to @LOCATION1. You can utilize the internet to gain insights into the local lifestyle. Another advantage is that computers enable you to interact with family and friends while using them. I mention this first because a few weeks ago, I had a social studies research project. Had I been unable to use a computer, I would have had to rely on books instead of simply searching online. Additionally, if you need pictures to enhance your project, you can search on Google to find suitable images. However, the internet's utility extends beyond this. For example, if you are planning a honeymoon trip to @LOCATION1 but have no prior knowledge of the place and your honeymoon is only a month away, you can use the computer to learn about it. Furthermore, online classes are available, allowing you to learn the local language before your trip. To conclude, I have one more example. Some people assume that spending all day on the computer precludes interaction with others, but this is untrue. For example, there is a website called @ORGANIZATION1 where you can chat with all your friends simultaneously. Video chatting is also available, enabling you to see the person you are speaking with. These are all the points I can think of. I hope that my letter, along with many others, will help you recognize the actual benefits of computers.
272	272	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers exert a positive influence on individuals as they facilitate education, enable communication with family and friends, and enhance hand - eye coordination. Continue reading to discover fascinating details about the positive impacts of computers. Firstly, computers are beneficial for education. Consider this: how many college students do you see without a laptop? Virtually none. Am I correct? A computer is indispensable as it is required for typing assignments and conducting research for extensive essays. Some may argue, ""Well, there's always the library."" However, they are mistaken. The local library closes at @TIME1 pm, while college students often work on homework well past this time. Imagine being at @NUM1 pm, with no access to the library or a computer, and having a substantial essay due the next day. What would you do? It is advisable to acquire a laptop before the next major assignment. Moreover, even if you decide to visit the library, who wants to carry numerous books downstairs, drive to the library, and then realize you've forgotten something? This is a sheer waste of time! Secondly, computers are advantageous because they allow communication with friends and family. For one, it is cost - effective as email is free. I have a @ORGANIZATION1 email account and pay nothing for it. In contrast, owning a cellphone entails purchasing the device and paying a monthly bill. Did you know that the average American spends at least #@NUM2 per month on cellphones? It's excessive. What if you rarely see a particular family member? I know that @CAPS4's cousin recently had a baby, and her father lives in @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. So, she got a webcam, and now they communicate daily, and her father gets to see the baby. They share everything and discuss various matters. After highlighting these numerous benefits, can you honestly claim that computers do not assist people? Finally, computers are beneficial as they improve hand - eye coordination. @CAPS4's brother, @PERSON1, is extremely fond of video games; he is addicted to them. I have no objection because now he can multitask, such as chewing gum, jotting down essay ideas, thinking about lunch, and playing a video game simultaneously. This showcases excellent multitasking ability. Additionally, you will be healthier. Consider the improved reflexes, better hand - eye coordination, and the resulting satisfaction of your doctor. Seriously, playing computer games can be enjoyable while also pleasing your doctor. Who wouldn't want to make their doctor happy? In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on you as they support education, enable communication with friends and family, and enhance hand - eye coordination. Try to deny that computers are helpful; I'm certain you can't because they benefit us in numerous ways."
273	273	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I opine that computers have adverse effects on individuals. The primary reason for this view is that people worldwide are becoming less healthy. Both children and adults should engage in more physical activity. Kids and parents should only spend @NUM1 @CAPS4 on the computer before going outdoors. While computers are useful for information retrieval, they can be harmful if misused. When children play games on computers, it can damage their eyesight and make them lethargic. Instead of chatting with friends on the computer, one should call a friend, invite them over, and play outdoor games. If this practice continues, many children will be fit and active. The second reason computers are detrimental is the issue of online content shared about others. One should never post negative information on the computer because sometimes these are deep - seated secrets, and millions of people may view them. The person involved may be ridiculed and teased. In fact, the computer can cause irreparable harm to relationships. If you and someone are friends, such online content could permanently sever your friendship. The final reason computers are not beneficial is the increasing rate of obesity - related deaths. There are several campaigns on commercials urging kids and adults to get up and be active. If not for these initiatives, many more children would die prematurely. When scientists examine deceased children, they often find large fat deposits around the heart. This is my theory, and I hope everyone will heed my advice: get up, turn off the computer, and engage in physical activity.
274	274	1	1	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1, would you desire to be warmly greeted by the zingbobway tabe @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION2, reconnect with a distant family member, or perhaps enhance your reflexes? You can achieve all these! Computers are a valuable tool for accomplishing these tasks. Imagine a family member or friend serving in the military miles away. Wouldn't you wish to see them at least once? Computers enable interaction via webcams, allowing you to see and converse with them. Not only can you communicate with family, but you can also connect with friends. You can make new friends from across the globe without leaving your home. You could potentially have a new best friend every day! In addition to facilitating communication, computers improve hand - eye coordination and quicken reflexes. Dr. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, states, ""@CAPS2 have demonstrated that individuals who type or use a computer possess better reflexes than those who do not."" Having a computer is also advantageous for schoolwork. I recall once having to write a @NUM1 - page paper for @CAPS4, which was due the next day. After writing the beginning, my hand began to cramp. Since I needed to finish the paper promptly, I turned to my computer and completed it in half the time it would have taken to write by hand. Moreover, I developed good hand - eye coordination. Computers are not only for typing but also for learning. Approximately @NUM2 out of @NUM3 computers are utilized for learning about different places and people. Suppose you have won @NUM1 free tickets to travel anywhere in the world with a celebrity of your choice! With a computer, you can research your destination and make the trip the most memorable of your life. Even if you prefer not to travel physically, you can explore places virtually on a computer. Through computers, you can view the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1, the tropical reef fish @ORGANIZATION1, or the @ORGANIZATION2 at the. Computers place the world at your fingertips. As evident, computers have a positive impact on people. They enable interaction with others, enhance hand - eye coordination, and provide access to global knowledge. So, stop reading and start using a computer!"
275	275	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, Technological advancements in computers are a detriment. When computer companies such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1 introduce appealing updates to their computer systems, people are reluctant to turn off their computers, which is unfavorable. As a child, did you spend all your time indoors and online? Computers detract from time spent outdoors or engaging in exercise. Moreover, they negatively impact crucial family time. Computer advancements are detrimental to our country and town. Nowadays, children prefer to spend time on computers rather than outdoors, which can have severe negative consequences. Firstly, it is essential for students to experience nature firsthand. They cannot replicate this experience on a computer. Children need to observe animals, inhale the fragrance of flowers, and feel the gentle breeze on their faces. Secondly, exposure to the sun is vital for health. Although the sun can be harmful on certain days, it is still necessary for everyone to spend some time in sunlight. Computers deprive people of this natural exposure, which is both unhealthy and dangerous. Computers also rob people of time for exercise. If individuals spend all their time on computers, they are unlikely to exercise. Everyone is recommended to engage in at least @NUM1 minutes of physical activity daily, yet few meet this requirement. Since the invention of personal computers and the internet, obesity rates have risen significantly. Obesity can complicate people's lives and lead to various diseases. The prevalence of computers has resulted in reduced exercise and increased obesity. Another problem is that computers reduce the time people spend with their families. Family is one of the most important aspects of life, and everyone should allocate a few hours each day to be with their family. With family support, many students excel in school and sports, which boosts their self - confidence. Computers divert time from what should be the most important thing to everyone: family. Many individuals are negatively affected by computers. This technology deprives children and adults of valuable time, including time spent outdoors, exercising, and with family. While computers may simplify life in some ways, their negative impacts far outweigh the positive ones.
276	276	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I contend that computers are a detriment. Most adolescents return home from school and log onto instant messaging platforms to converse with their peers. Alarmingly, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 individuals are obese. I firmly believe that engaging in outdoor activities with friends surpasses the sedentary pastime of computer gaming. When children venture outside to play, they not only experience greater enjoyment but also acquire essential social interaction skills. Moreover, they have the opportunity to immerse themselves in nature and gain knowledge about animals. Conversely, when children are glued to their computers, they are essentially idle. Additionally, some children post inappropriate pictures of themselves on social media platforms like Facebook, which can lead to significant trouble. They also utter things they would never dare say in person. In essence, the computer serves as a conduit for children to get into mischief. When you are outside playing baseball, football, or tag with friends, you are exercising and having a great deal of fun. If you engage in regular physical activity, you are less likely to be obese. Some argue that computers enhance hand - eye coordination, yet catching a football or hitting a ball is a more effective alternative. Furthermore, while some claim that computers can provide information about distant places, that is the role of schools. In conclusion, physical exercise and real - world socializing with friends are far superior to virtual conversations or video chats. There are too many overweight individuals in @LOCATION1, and the computer is not aiding the situation.
277	277	1	1	"Dear @LOCATION2 press, I am curious if you are aware that @PERCENT1 of the @NUM1 individuals surveyed by the university in @LOCATION1 concurred that the utilization of laptops and computers had a highly beneficial impact on their lives. I wholeheartedly agree that computers confer advantages upon society and daily existence. With a computer, one can interact with individuals across the globe, it can assist with academic tasks, and simplify everyday life. Five years ago, I had to relocate from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION3, leaving all our family and friends behind. However, thanks to this remarkable technology, we could communicate with them via email, instant messaging, and video chat, obviating the need to spend money on long - distance calls. There are numerous people like me who have friends and family residing far away, whether it be family in different countries, former schoolmates, or camp friends. Employing a computer is an excellent means of maintaining contact. Additionally, using a computer can streamline daily life. A mother taking care of her children may find it challenging to go to @CAPS1 & @CAPS2 when one child is engrossed in video games and the other is watching their favorite @CAPS3 show. Fortunately, she can go online, select the food and its quantity, and arrange for delivery. She may also be unable to go shopping, but with her computer, she can visit her favorite store's website and choose the clothes she desires. During @CAPS4, a computer can be invaluable, eliminating the worry of insufficient time. A computer truly simplifies life. Statistics demonstrate how people benefit from online interactions. ""Computers are remarkable. One can complete homework and access more information on the computer from @CAPS5.com than they could find in their local library. You can find almost anything using search engines on your computer! Some individuals do oppose the use of computers, and some believe that some people abuse the benefits of computers by spending excessive time on them and neglecting exercise and nature. This is true, but as long as you use your computer reasonably, it offers numerous benefits. As I mentioned, it is excellent for maintaining connections, simplifying daily life, and conducting school research."
278	278	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I opine that computers exert a positive influence on people. They augment our knowledge, facilitate communication with friends and family, enhance hand - eye coordination, and expedite access to news. Computers are delightful and remarkable technological devices. Although sitting in front of a computer screen may seem less interactive, computers significantly expand our knowledge. They host countless websites brimming with valuable information. You can search for any topic you wish to learn about and obtain precise results. Visiting the library to find a book for a report would be time - consuming. Instead, you can acquire the necessary facts online. Moreover, computers enable seamless communication with family and friends. Making long - distance calls or sending letters incurs costs, while sending an email is free. Many people have loved ones living far away. Through computers, they can converse with them indefinitely at no expense. You can even see each other via a webcam, which can be attached to your computer if it doesn't have one already. Another advantage of computers is their contribution to hand - eye coordination. Typing, a skill required by most people, is an excellent example. It takes practice to type quickly and accurately without looking at the keyboard, which is a form of hand - eye coordination that will be beneficial throughout life, whether it's typing term papers in high school or college application essays. Additionally, computers help us access news more rapidly. When significant events occur, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1, the news spreads on the internet before traditional media. In conclusion, computers are highly useful as they enhance knowledge, enable communication, improve hand - eye coordination, and provide quick access to news. Most importantly, they are a source of enjoyment.
279	279	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I assert that technological advancements, particularly in the realm of computers, yield numerous positive outcomes. Computers are advantageous for individuals of all ages. They cultivate hand - eye coordination and empower people to acquire information from across the globe. Moreover, they enable seamless communication via the internet. Technological progress enhances society and the overall quality of life worldwide. Technological advancements are truly remarkable, and computers exemplify these advancements. Through the simple operation of a computer, one can develop proficient hand - eye coordination skills, such as typing. Typing is a skill essential for almost everyone. Without computers, these skills would be difficult to acquire. A young child can engage in computer games and learn basic typing and hand - eye coordination skills, which will serve as a foundation for their future development. Additionally, computers allow people to access global information. In academic settings, students are often tasked with writing reports on foreign countries. Without a computer, this would be an arduous task, as they would have to sift through numerous books to find the required information. With the internet, these projects can be completed more efficiently by simply typing in the necessary queries. Consider planning a family vacation. The internet can provide a wealth of options for vacation spots with just a few clicks. This simplifies life significantly. In terms of communication, the internet offers a solution for staying in touch with loved ones. For instance, when a parent is on a business trip, you can communicate with them via @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or both. By connecting your @CAPS2 to the computer, you can instantly greet them or have a conversation. You can also instant - message friends, and it will feel as if they are right beside you. In conclusion, computers and technological advancements are highly beneficial. They teach hand - eye coordination, facilitate the acquisition of global information, and enable instant communication. I urge the writers and editors of the newspaper to recognize the positive impact of these advancements, as they only enhance the quality of life.
280	280	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals. They foster hand - eye coordination, endow people with the ability to learn about distant places and individuals, and enable online communication. Computers are an extremely useful piece of equipment. Regarding hand - eye coordination, in an educational context, students are required to type numerous @CAPS1 prompts, @CAPS2 lab reports, and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 vocabulary entries. Computers assist us in this regard. Mastering fast and accurate typing without looking at the keyboard, which is a form of hand - eye coordination, takes practice. This skill will prove invaluable later in life, whether it's for typing high - school term papers or college application essays. Computers also empower people to learn about far - off places. @NUM1 years ago, I embarked on my first trip to @LOCATION3. Lacking knowledge about its history, I sat at my desk and powered on my computer. Suddenly, it was as if I had transported myself to @LOCATION3. I read about its delicious cuisine and rich culture, took a virtual tour of the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the magnificent @CAPS7, listened to @CAPS8 music, and learned some @CAPS8. In just @NUM2 hour, I experienced @LOCATION3 from the comfort of my home. Moreover, computers facilitate online communication. I have cousins living in @LOCATION2, and due to the @NUM3 - hour time difference, phone conversations can be challenging. Therefore, we use the computer to send emails and sometimes engage in video chats. Social networking sites accessible via computers, such as @CAPS10 or @CAPS11, allow us to interact with people we don't usually see. On @CAPS11, you can even communicate with your favorite stars or musicians. While some experts @MONTH1 claim that people spend excessive time on computers, this may not be true for everyone. We still engage in physical exercise, spend time outdoors, and interact with family and friends in person, while also being able to do so virtually. The increasing use of computers is a positive development.
281	281	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper Writer, I am of the opinion that computers confer substantial benefits upon our society. They enable us to establish connections with others in a more expeditious and effortless manner. Moreover, computers are advantageous for our society as we no longer need to squander excessive time on the phone. This is precisely why I hold the view that computers are beneficial to our society. ""Are computers a boon or a bane?"" Computers are undoubtedly a boon, as you can email your family or friends at any time you desire. However, at times, we should not remain glued to the computer for extended periods. This is why I believe computers are a positive addition. Without computers, the situation would be markedly different, as we would have to communicate with others via phone calls or text messages. In my estimation, I am truly grateful that we have computers at our disposal. Additionally, on computers, we can access a plethora of platforms such as @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and even engage in work. This indicates that without computers, life would be significantly altered. I opine that people are not spending an inordinate amount of time on the computer because a large number of individuals utilize computers for office work. Computers simplify our lives considerably! Nevertheless, sometimes people abuse this convenience. This is why I believe people are not over - indulging in computer usage. In conclusion, this is why I am certain that computers contribute positively to our society."
282	282	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I have learned that you are soliciting opinions regarding whether computers exert a positive influence on people. I am cognizant that numerous individuals oppose such positive viewpoints, yet I firmly believe that computers have a beneficial impact on people. The primary advantage of computers lies in research. Without computers, both children and adults would be deprived of the essential tools for acquiring knowledge. Studies reveal that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students possess computers at home, and a person without computer access attains approximately @PERCENT1 lower grades due to subpar research capabilities on projects. Another reason for the positive nature of computers is their ability to unite the world. Users of Facebook, @CAPS2, and Twitter can converse with individuals across the street, across the country, and even across the ocean! People in the @LOCATION5 can engage in games and chat with those in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and even @LOCATION3! My final reason is that computers are invaluable for businesses. Many individuals have websites for their occupations, which can enhance their visibility and enable others to understand the nature of their businesses. Consider your newspaper, for instance. Without computers, you would be unable to conduct research, type, or print your newspaper. Your website would also fail to persuade people to read your publication. Although some individuals may abuse their computer privileges by spending excessive time on them instead of exercising or interacting with others, this pertains only to @PERCENT2 of computer users. It is their choice to spend their time on the computer, and there is little one can do to change this. In conclusion, I wish to convey that computers are highly beneficial to people! They facilitate research, assist with schoolwork and businesses, and allow us to communicate with individuals worldwide.
283	283	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am penning this letter to express my disagreement with the idea of preventing kids from using computers. Computers offer educational value, are useful for homework, and provide a means of relaxation. Computers impart a wealth of knowledge to children, including hand - eye coordination. If children aspire to work with computers in the future, they can learn how to operate them effectively. There are also websites that demonstrate proper hand movements when using a computer. When children return from school, they often have homework. Given that @CAPS2 requires homework to be completed on the computer, it would be arduous for kids without computer access to fulfill their academic requirements. Imagine the situation where students inform their teacher that they do not have access to computers. Moreover, after a long day at school, I return home, complete my homework, and then relax by listening to music on the computer. If computers were taken away, everyone would be perpetually irritable. Therefore, I advocate for the continued use of computers and believe that the current level of exercise in school, such as carrying heavy books, is sufficient.
284	284	1	1	Dear @STATE1 news, Computers are an outstanding device. They enable people to conduct research, explore any topic or subject, and communicate with friends online. I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They are among the greatest inventions of our time and are extremely useful in our daily lives. When individuals need to write a school paper or undertake a project, they can conduct research on the internet. If they are unfamiliar with a particular topic, they can search for answers to their questions. For instance, if one wishes to plan a family vacation to California, they can arrange the entire trip on their computer, including booking flights, reserving hotel rooms, and discovering local attractions. In essence, one can explore the world from the comfort of their computer. Additionally, if someone desires to learn a new language, they can acquire an entire language on their computer. For those who are too busy to attend college or wish to take an additional course, there are online schools available. The computer is an excellent medium for learning new things. Finally, it allows people to stay connected with friends. Social media platforms like Facebook and MySpace are ideal for maintaining contact with friends. Another advantage is that one can instant - message friends and family, receiving prompt responses. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a positive influence on people. They are beneficial in multiple ways, such as facilitating research, enabling learning, and fostering communication. I hope you share my perspective and recognize that computers are essential for everyone.
285	285	1	1	"I entered my living room and observed my mother intently perusing the computer screen, which was adorned with pictures of caller masters and logos. I realized that the internet had convinced my mother of the idea of going on vacation more effectively than I could have. Every day, an increasing number of people log on to computers. Although those who embrace technological advancements present compelling arguments about the benefits of computers, there are still some who can only perceive the negative aspects. I wholeheartedly support computers and believe they hold great potential. Computers streamline work processes. They enable us to communicate instantaneously with people thousands of miles away. Moreover, they allow us to reconnect with long - lost friends. For example, I used to attend an excellent @DATE1 camp where I made some of my closest friends. However, @DATE1, I was lethargic, lying in my basement, too exhausted to stand up as my sweat clung to me. Then, one day, I heard the familiar sound of my computer's notification when I received an instant @CAPS1. I summoned the energy to crawl to the screen and discovered that @PERSON1, one of my dearest friends from the camp, wanted to go on a bike ride and hang out with other acquaintances. Needless to say, I happily replied, ""@CAPS2 I definitely want to go."" Without computers and @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 and I, along with our other friends, would have drifted apart and never interacted again. A common but exaggerated argument against computers is that computer users do not exercise. I use my computer almost every hour, but I have devised a system to ensure I get exercise. Every time I enter the room where my computer is located, I grab the pull - up bar and do @NUM1 pull - ups. I conceived this system only @NUM2 months ago, and I have already developed my muscles. I can now do @NUM3 pull - ups at a time, whereas I struggled to do @NUM2 at the beginning. If not for the wonderful connectivity that computers provide, I would have given up exercising after about a week. Computers offer easy access to the internet, which is a vast repository of information. Unless it is a well - guarded secret, you can probably find whatever you need on the internet. I have often relied on the internet to gather information for essays when the limited textbooks were insufficient. My country project last @DATE1 year could only obtain @CAPS5 pieces of information from books. Computers also serve as excellent teachers for almost any subject. In fact, my language arts teacher shared a story about a person who had never done water sports before. After spending @NUM2 weeks watching YouTube videos on waterskiing, he was performing tricks on his first attempt. These are just a few reasons why I believe computers are remarkable. They help maintain friendships, encourage exercise, and can teach us anything! I propose that we spread the positive word about computers and let everyone know how amazing they are."
286	286	1	1	Dear Computer Co., computers exert a negative influence. Why venture outdoors when one can engage in lifelike games on the @CAPS1? I opine that the games on the @CAPS1 ought to be removed so that people can relish all the wonderful aspects of life. Were people not glued to @CAPS1s throughout the day, they would take notice of how they are destroying nature.
287	287	1	1	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, your resources, entertainment, and even interpersonal communication may be in decline. You are aware that a substantial portion of the populace believes this @PERSON2 is detrimental to our society. Well, I assert that they fail to comprehend the benefits that computers offer us. Computers function as teachers, instructing us without our conscious awareness. Hand - eye coordination serves as a prime example. Moreover, we utilize computers to explore destinations we might wish to visit or to converse with friends or family residing far away. The computer is an extraordinary technological marvel. Firstly, every physical activity necessitates hand - eye coordination, such as cooking, cycling, or driving. Unfortunately, not all individuals excel in hand - eye coordination. One of @CAPS7 friends, @PERSON1, had abysmal hand - eye coordination. For his birthday, I decided to gift him a computer. After @NUM1 month, when he attempted to hit a baseball at his son's party, he managed to hit the ball @NUM2 out of @NUM3, a significant improvement from his previous rate of @NUM1 or @NUM5 out of @NUM6. This @PERCENT2 increase in just @NUM1 month is remarkable! A simple device like a computer significantly enhanced @CAPS7 friend's hand - eye coordination. Secondly, computers enable us to learn about distant locales like the @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION4. Do you truly wish to endure the frigid cold and piercing winds of the @LOCATION1 merely to gain knowledge about it? While some may desire such an experience, what if financial constraints or flight conditions prevent travel to the @LOCATION1? I aspire to study polar bears and glaciers without concerns. A statistic from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 states that ""@PERCENT2 of people would relish the thrill of the @ORGANIZATION1 lights. However, only @PERCENT3 of them would actually travel to @LOCATION2 to witness them."" Evidently, @PERCENT4 of these individuals would abstain from traveling due to money or the cold. That's why they appreciate computers; they can experience the @ORGANIZATION1 lights without braving the cold. Lastly, what could be better than using a computer to connect with long - lost family members? The editor of the @LOCATION3 Local remarks, ""@CAPS7 parents live over @NUM8 miles away. I rarely have the opportunity to communicate with them because traveling is unaffordable. Thanks to the computer, @CAPS7 parents and I now communicate @PERCENT1 more frequently than before. I cherish the computer as it keeps me close to my loved ones."" As you can discern, the computer has facilitated a @PERCENT1 increase in communication with his parents. In conclusion, the computer is a gracious device that bestows numerous benefits upon people. It teaches hand - eye coordination, allows us to learn about otherwise inaccessible places, and enables us to converse with friends and family we seldom see."
288	288	1	1	Dear newspaper, excessive computer use is deleterious. Some individuals squander an inordinate amount of time online. Many become overly engrossed in the internet, neglecting their normal activities. Additionally, computer overuse disrupts sleep patterns, leaving users exhausted the following day. Excessive internet consumption also leads to a neglect of family relationships. Since internet addicts spend insufficient time with their families, they risk losing connections with loved ones. Physical inactivity is another consequence of this addiction. For instance, my stepbrother is perpetually online, preoccupied with his games and oblivious to others. Another issue associated with internet overuse is excessive focus. When overly fixated on the internet, people forget about the real world and their responsibilities. They often neglect chores and fail to prepare meals for their families. They also forgo outdoor activities they once enjoyed. Internet addicts typically suffer from sleep deprivation and have little time for studying. Consequently, they are fatigued at school or work, and the internet is to blame. Last month, my mother joined Facebook and is constantly logged in. When on the site, she ignores her surroundings. She attends school and laments her lack of study time due to her internet addiction. She has also abandoned her habit of reading the Bible to spend more time online. The internet is a perilous addiction. It erodes relationships with friends and family, promotes physical inactivity, and causes neglect of daily responsibilities. It is an addiction best avoided.
289	289	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, the impact of computers on individuals is far from positive. I contend that people allocate an excessive amount of time to computers. Some information on computers is inaccurate, and there are still telephones and cellphones available for communication. A significant portion of people's time is consumed by computers, whether through gaming, checking @CAPS2 - mail, or working. This valuable time could be better spent on more important activities, such as socializing with friends and family, enjoying nature, or exercising. The substitution of exercise with computer use has had a profound impact on people's health. Some individuals are overweight because they consume food without engaging in physical activity afterward. My sister works on the computer all day and reports that @NUM1 or @NUM2 of her female colleagues are unhealthy, as they spend their time on the computer and consume granola bars, which are typically considered healthy. If people spent at least half an hour outdoors breathing fresh air instead of using the computer, they would likely feel better. My doctor used to advise my brother and me to ""go outside and play for an hour a day."" This advice holds true, and I strongly encourage people to engage in outdoor activities rather than playing on the computer. Computers are frequently used for research. While some information on the computer is useful, it is often difficult to determine its accuracy. When using books or encyclopedias for research, one can generally trust the sources. For example, if one were required to write a report using only the internet, it would be challenging to verify the reliability of the information. Although computers can improve hand - eye coordination through video games, these skills may have limited practical application in real life. Another function of computers is communication. Before the widespread use of computers, people were content to make phone calls. Now, with the advent of @CAPS2 - mail, instant messaging, and Skype, the use of cellphones seems to have diminished."
290	290	1	1	Dear reader, @CAPS1, there has been an ongoing debate regarding whether computers are truly beneficial to society, especially now that the majority of @CAPS2 own these useful devices. Computers assist people with daily tasks and undoubtedly do more good than harm. Envision the difficulty most people would face in performing their jobs without computers; life on this planet would become significantly more arduous. Consider the successful schools in our country and identify those that lack computers. Computers are the most convenient means of accessing information, which is crucial for children's learning. Whenever someone has a question, they can simply search for it on Google. This is particularly useful when researching for important projects. Thanks to computers, people are more knowledgeable than ever before. Computers are not only important in schools but also in the workplace. They serve similar functions in both environments. With the prevalence of computers, people can easily type up documents and submit them to their bosses or teachers, saving time and effort while achieving a more professional result. Computers also play a vital role in communication. Through email or instant messaging, one can communicate with someone on the other side of the world without incurring exorbitant phone bills. Some @MONTH1 view this as a risk, as one may interact with strangers. However, it also provides an opportunity to learn about new cultures. For instance, it is now possible to gain first - hand knowledge of life in @LOCATION1. Without computers, it would be extremely challenging for an ordinary person to interact with someone from another country, leading to a sense of isolation from the world. Many people are interested in learning foreign languages, and there are better ways to do so than sitting in a classroom. As inhabitants of this planet, do we really want to be isolated from others simply because they live far away? One major concern about computers is that people will stop reading books. However, a recent study indicates that the number of readers has increased since the introduction of computers. This shows that the emergence of new and exciting technologies does not render other activities obsolete. People will continue to engage in their traditional pastimes while adding new ones to their repertoire. Moreover, it is an individual's choice whether to spend time on the computer. Those who oppose the use of computers have no right to deprive others of this option. Computers were created to assist humanity, not to control it. If someone does not wish to use a computer, they are free to abstain. In conclusion, when encountering a computer, we should not view it as an obsession that hinders people from engaging in other activities. Instead, we should recognize it as a universal tool that broadens our horizons and enables us to learn about things we might not otherwise discover. Computers do not restrict us but rather propel us forward, benefiting us in various aspects of our lives, including work, school, and home.
291	291	1	1	Have you ever contemplated all the remarkable feats that computers have accomplished for us? Presently, we can acquire knowledge about any subject of our interest, engage in communication with individuals on the opposite side of the globe, and even make progress in other technological domains. Undoubtedly, computers have exerted a positive influence on people. Just envision this... within a single moment, you can be in the scorching deserts of @LOCATION3, and in the next, amidst a lush, humid jungle teeming with wildlife... all without leaving the confines of your room! By utilizing computers, individuals can explore new places and things at their convenience. The countless resources available on the internet render it feasible to learn about other locations and historical periods. Although this information @MONTH1 be accessible in a local library, accessing it via a computer is significantly more convenient. Why endure the hassle of borrowing books from the library when the internet is readily available at any time? There's no need for library card registration, no late fees, and no waiting lists. It is evident that employing your computer for research is an extremely valuable endeavor. @NUM1 out of ten individuals stated that they prefer to send an email rather than engage in a phone conversation. Nowadays, with the aid of computers, people can instantaneously message or email anyone, regardless of their geographical location. Making a call from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 can incur substantial costs, but with email, I can communicate with my @CAPS1 friend, @PERSON1, free of charge. I recall when she relocated to @LOCATION2. It was disheartening, yet we vowed to maintain contact. Thanks to email and instant messaging, it was effortless to converse and exchange the latest news! The ability to communicate seamlessly with others is an incredible privilege that would not exist without the assistance of computers. Lastly, computers have facilitated human progress in other technological fields. Where would we stand in the realms of science and medicine without computers? These machines have enabled scientists to conduct experiments. Through simulated experiments, they can ensure that no extraneous variables will impact the results. Consequently, experiments can now achieve a high level of accuracy. Computers have also contributed to the advancement of medicine. They have been instrumental in uncovering various cures for perilous diseases. Who knows, perhaps in @NUM2 years, a cure for cancer will be discovered. All of these extraordinary achievements have been positively influenced by computers. Although some individuals @MONTH1 believe that computers have a detrimental impact on our daily lives, I @PERCENT1 dissent. People can learn, communicate, and make technological advancements with a single click of a mouse. Computers have positively affected people in numerous ways, so, go ahead and click! Computers eliminate all those inconveniences.
292	292	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 the world four decades ago. Individuals would have to embark on a journey to visit a library for research purposes. Every document, medical records, and architectural plans would have to be penned by hand or typed on an antiquated typewriter. Life would have been far more arduous. Today, computers empower us to interact with one another, access the millions of websites on the internet, and assist with academic pursuits. Almost daily, my mother and father receive friend requests from long-lost schoolmates, relatives, and current acquaintances. Contemporary computers enable the global community to communicate and stay informed about current events. My father often remarks, "" @CAPS2 makes the world go round."" Through social networking platforms, everyone is inundated with a plethora of @CAPS2 about one another. Another mode of communication is video chat. All @CAPS3 computers are equipped with a video camera, and you can purchase one if you own a @CAPS4. This allows you to visualize the person you are conversing with. I have encountered numerous remarkable anecdotes regarding this technology. One such story involves a soldier stationed in @LOCATION1 and his wife back home. The medical staff set up a computer with video chat capabilities in the operating room, enabling the soldier to be, in a sense, present in two places simultaneously. The man was able to witness the birth of his newborn child and see his wife. Computers are truly capable of performing astonishing feats! Another reason computers are exceptional is their accessibility to the internet. There is an interesting website called @CAPS5.Dcotors.Com. If you are experiencing an illness or a symptom, all you need to do is input it on the homepage, and it will enumerate all the potential causes or outcomes. It also provides guidance on treatment methods and the locations where the necessary medication can be obtained. In the past, one would have to travel to a doctor and pay for a consultation to address their health concerns. Additionally, computers are of great assistance with schoolwork and homework. Many educators nowadays require or mandate students to type their assignments as it enhances readability and simplifies the correction process. I also find typing to be more efficient than handwriting. Suppose you need to conduct research on the periodic table and record @NUM1 facts, along with all the elements. There are likely hundreds, if not thousands, of websites dedicated to this topic. All you have to do is enter the query on Google. You can also enhance your work by inserting an image through copy and paste. Computers have proven beneficial to both students and teachers. Lastly, computers (and keyboards) are aiding individuals in improving their hand-eye coordination. Many educational institutions offer typing courses to assist students in this regard. I recently conducted an online search on this topic and discovered a study by @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, which revealed that individuals who practice typing for at least @NUM2 minutes a day can experience a @PERCENT1 improvement in hand-eye coordination. This enhancement can be beneficial for many individuals with limited coordination. Today, computers are making a significant positive impact on the world in various ways. From facilitating communication to providing internet access and assisting with hand-eye coordination, the world would regress if computers were abandoned."
293	293	1	1	Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 perspectives on the impact of computers on individuals suggest that without computers, we would be unable to conduct research on significant figures and events. Moreover, we would be unable to type important documents. Finally, we would lose the ability to communicate with others. @CAPS1 first viewpoint posits that without computers, we would be unable to research important individuals and events. This is one of @CAPS1 reasons because if people were ignorant about an important person, they could look them up. For instance, who is Harry @PERSON1? He was the @NUM1 president. I was unaware of his identity or his contributions until I conducted an online search. @CAPS1 second opinion contends that we would be unable to type important papers. I assert this because individuals with @CAPS3's typically have to type documents. Without computers, everything would have to be handwritten. Additionally, some people have poor penmanship. @CAPS1 final opinion is that we can communicate with individuals who are online or offline. I state this because if you need to convey important information to a family member or a friend, but your phone is out of charge or malfunctioning, you can send them an email. Alternatively, if you have a Facebook account, you can inform them through that platform. Lastly, you can use instant messaging. Now that you are aware of three perspectives on the impact of computers, people can always engage in physical activity around their residence or in their neighborhood.
294	294	1	1	Dear readers of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 individuals today are engaged in a debate regarding whether the presence of computers benefits society. Computers benefit society in @CAPS1 ways, such as aiding children with their academic endeavors. Not all children are extremely extroverted, but if they had access to a computer, it would significantly assist them. Not all children have a clear understanding of their future career paths. I am confident that they may not be concerned at present, but computers can offer valuable guidance. As evident, computers can contribute to the betterment of society. Every child attending school has homework, starting from kindergarten until the completion of their education. Computers can assist them with their mathematics, science, and social studies assignments. As children grow older and enter middle school, they are required to complete reports and projects that demand knowledge and research skills. If you are a parent and are unable to accompany your children to the library to borrow @CAPS1 books that may be lost, and you would have to bear the cost of replacement, computers eliminate such concerns. The computer offers all these advantages to society. Computers can enhance communication in numerous ways. @CAPS1 children enjoy using @CAPS2 to chat, and parents perceive @CAPS2 as their children's virtual world. However, it is possible that they are organizing a group activity. Nowadays, there are more introverted individuals who are hesitant to interact with others and form friendships. Consequently, they may experience feelings of depression. Computers can also be beneficial in situations where you are unable to attend an appointment or a meeting. You can inform the relevant person via electronic means. This is a compelling reason why computers are advantageous to society. In society, not many individuals immediately know what they aspire to become in the future. If they utilize computers and possess proficiency in repairing them when they malfunction, they can pursue a career as a computer @CAPS3. There are numerous @CAPS1 beautiful locations that people capture through photography and upload to their computers. Some individuals may not recognize their talents until they are pointed out. @CAPS1 individuals may have a challenging day and compose a story based on their experiences, which they can share with their friends. Subsequently, their friends can submit it to publishers, potentially leading to the individual achieving @CAPS5. As demonstrated, there are numerous excellent ways to utilize computers to benefit society. Readers, computers can assist you with your academic pursuits. They can also enhance social communication. Moreover, they can help individuals discover their @CAPS6. I firmly believe that computers play a significant role in contributing to the well - being of society.
295	295	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I firmly hold the view that the widespread use of computer technologies by both children and adults has a negative impact on people. I am convinced that computers can lead to addiction, causing individuals to spend less time with their families and friends. Moreover, they result in a decrease in physical activity and a missed opportunity for self - improvement. Clearly, I believe that allowing students and adults unrestricted access to computers can dominate their minds and lead to addiction. This is highly detrimental because once one becomes addicted to something, it is extremely difficult to break free. This implies that they will have little time for other important aspects of life. For example, they may lose sight of the true essence of life and the beauty of the real world. Addiction is a formidable obstacle to overcome, so one should not confine themselves to a virtual existence but rather embrace life to the fullest. Overall, addiction is a pervasive issue, including addiction to computers, and it is a dreadful phenomenon. Undoubtedly, excessive computer use can impair cognitive function and foster laziness. This means that the less physical activity one engages in, the less energetic and active they become. This problem is particularly acute among teenagers. Teenagers are exposed to computers, cell phones, iPods, and various other electronic devices on a weekly basis. Many teenagers become irritable and impatient with their parents as they struggle to balance their virtual and real - life experiences. When people fail to engage in regular physical activity, it can lead to severe consequences such as obesity and cancer. Obesity typically occurs as a result of overeating, but it can also be caused by a sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise. Individuals who lead inactive lives become lethargic and lose the motivation to pursue any meaningful activities, which can have a profound impact on their overall well - being. In summary, computers discourage people from engaging in physical exercise and reduce their level of activity, leading to a variety of health problems. Lastly, computers cause people to spend increasingly less time with their families and treat their computers as if they were their primary companions. In daily life, teenagers are often engrossed in their cell phones, computers, and music. These electronic devices are causing a rift between teenagers and their loved ones. If this trend continues, many teenagers will lose touch with the people who matter most to them. Computers are a waste of time as they can have a detrimental effect on individuals. They have a negative impact on those who use computers and other electronic gadgets.
296	296	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, and I firmly believe that computers are highly advantageous, enabling individuals to acquire a substantial amount of knowledge. Undoubtedly, the computer stands as an exceptionally intelligent and perhaps the most remarkable technological innovation. When one needs to gather information about a particular individual, computers prove to be invaluable. For instance, they assist students with their academic assignments. Another compelling reason for the usefulness of computers is their ability to facilitate communication with family and friends. Firstly, computers are beneficial when seeking facts about a person. Suppose you are a police officer and your superior instructs you to meet someone at @ORGANIZATION1. Once there, you are informed about a suspect, but you lack any information about them. In such a scenario, a computer can be used to determine their criminal convictions and view their record. Similarly, if your teacher assigns a report on "" @PERSON3 lopez,"" and you have no prior knowledge, you can utilize the computer to learn about their life. Additionally, if you wish to explore your country's history and the leaders behind it, the computer is an excellent resource. Secondly, computers are indispensable for students and their homework. For example, if your teacher requests a well - presented essay on @PERSON2, and your handwriting is poor, you can use a word - processing program on the computer. Moreover, if you forget to record your homework in your planner, you can access the school website to find out the assignments. Also, if your teacher asks you to find a book about the @CAPS1, and the library copies are all taken, you can use the computer to locate the nearest place with the book. Lastly, computers are extremely helpful in modern society as they enable us to stay in touch with friends and family. If writing letters is time - consuming, you can use online messaging platforms such as ""@CAPS2,"" ""Facebook,"" or ""MySpace."" In case you send a letter to the wrong address, you can go online to ask a friend or family member for assistance. Additionally, if you want to see and talk to someone, you can use a webcam. I sincerely hope you concur with my view that computers are not only useful but also beneficial for people. They aid in learning about others, support students in their studies, and help us maintain connections with loved ones. Therefore, I trust you will appreciate my letter and find my opinion worthy of consideration."
297	297	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I presume you are aware of the ongoing discourse regarding computers. Personally, I am of the opinion that computers indeed confer benefits upon society. This belief stems from the fact that computers offer advantages through their online capabilities, the internet, and overall assistance in various aspects. My initial rationale for advocating that computers benefit society is their online functionality. Through online platforms such as chat rooms and banking services, individuals can enhance their morale. This is particularly evident in the case of military officers and soldiers, who often cannot be physically present with their families. Online communication can instantaneously bridge this gap. Additionally, online banking allows users to pay bills, eliminating the need for a trip to the bank and saving on fuel. Hence, the online aspect serves as a compelling reason for you, the local newspaper, to align with my perspective. My second reason pertains to the substantial benefits of the internet. The internet, a remarkable creation @NUM1 years ago, offers numerous advantages. It enables users to make purchases on websites like eBay and Amazon, thereby saving time. Moreover, it provides an opportunity to gain insights into foreign nations. Finally, the internet serves as a reliable source of news, allowing people to promptly learn about natural disasters and community issues, rather than relying on traditional media. This is my second argument for why you should agree that computers are helpful. My final reason for the benefits of computers lies in their overall assistance in diverse situations beyond their immediate use. For example, a student can conduct online research on a subject, which can positively impact their project grades. Studies have shown that computer training, such as playing online games like Call of Duty, can enhance soldiers' accuracy. It improves their hand - eye coordination, increasing their target - shooting accuracy by @PERCENT1. Although this may seem insignificant, on the battlefield, it can be a matter of life and death. Computers are not only useful in these scenarios but are also widely available in places like libraries and internet cafes. This concludes my final reason for supporting the use of computers. Some may argue that computers are detrimental as they detract from exercise time. However, this issue can be easily resolved by using the internet to purchase indoor exercise equipment. In conclusion, computers benefit society through their online features, the internet, and overall assistance in future situations. These are the reasons why I believe you should support the cause of computers. Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion.
298	298	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I am of the conviction that computer usage is advantageous as it fosters the development of hand - eye coordination among individuals. Furthermore, it empowers people to gain knowledge about different states and countries. Additionally, it enables interaction with family and friends residing in different towns. These factors collectively contribute to my belief in the positive utility of computers. Firstly, computer usage promotes the cultivation of hand - eye coordination. It equips individuals with the ability to maintain visual focus while simultaneously using their hands effectively. To maintain visual focus, individuals may need to wear glasses to filter out glare. This ensures that when typing, they do not need to constantly look down. When using hands in conjunction with the computer, individuals become familiar with the layout, which is a testament to the computer's usefulness. Secondly, computers are beneficial as they provide individuals with the opportunity to learn about various states and countries. Users can assess the desirability of these places and gain insights into their cultures and religions. In the context of states, one can learn about @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2, appreciating the uniqueness of their own state. This educational aspect makes computers a valuable tool. Finally, computers facilitate online interaction with family and friends. There are numerous websites where one can search for and communicate with loved ones. This interaction allows for in - depth conversations about various topics, such as family life and feelings of missing one another. In conclusion, computers offer multiple benefits. They not only enhance hand - eye coordination, facilitate communication with family and friends, and provide knowledge about different regions but also offer entertainment through games and note - taking capabilities. Additionally, they can be used as a calculator for solving math problems. Therefore, it is evident that people should embrace computer usage.
299	299	1	1	Do you hold the view that computers have a detrimental impact on people? I, on the contrary, believe that @CAPS2 represents a more efficient means of obtaining information rapidly. The three primary reasons I advocate for the positive influence of computers on people are the ability to learn about distant locations, the availability of jobs in the computer industry, and the capacity to communicate with individuals from afar. While there are numerous other reasons, I am only required to discuss three. Firstly, computers enable us to acquire knowledge about far - off places that we may never have the opportunity to visit in person. @CAPS2 offers a quicker way to access news that would otherwise not appear in the newspaper until the following day. If financial constraints prevent travel, one can explore these distant locations through the internet. @CAPS2 serves as a superior source of information. Secondly, the computer industry provides a multitude of job opportunities. Many occupations rely heavily on computers. Without computers, an increasing number of individuals would be unemployed, and businesses would experience a slowdown due to a lack of necessary information. This underscores the necessity of computers in the modern workplace. Lastly, computers allow us to communicate with people from distant locations. Although phone calls are an option, video chatting offers a more immersive experience as it allows us to both see and talk to the person. Video chat is an excellent way to make new friends and stay connected with old ones. We can communicate with relatives, friends, or anyone we choose. Without computers, we would lose touch with those living far away, which would be a regrettable outcome. In conclusion, computers offer an easier avenue for information acquisition. They enable us to learn about far - off places, provide employment opportunities in the computer business, and facilitate communication with distant individuals. I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people.
300	300	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, when you examine a map of your area, all that meets the eye is an abundance of computers. Whether it is the town, the state, the country, or even the world, computers seem to be ubiquitous. We need to power down these computers so that we can engage in physical exercise, appreciate nature, and interact with our families. It is high time we assist the world's soldiers. Men, when you look around, what do you observe? Nothing but an epidemic of obesity. These so - called computers are the root cause. Look over there. There is @CAPS5. He once weighed over @NUM1 pounds. All he did was spend excessive time on that ill - fated electronic device we call a computer. One day, he realized he could no longer continue this way and decided to exercise. After just one year, @CAPS5's weight dropped to @NUM2 pounds. As a doctor, computer expert, and author of books on exercise, nature, and family, @PERSON1 states, ""If people were to turn off their computers and visit the gym, over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1's obesity rate would decline."" We must put an end to this madness, men. Soldiers, do you know what is truly lamentable about the ""enemy"" we are combating? It is causing people to miss out on the splendor of nature. @PERSON1 has pointed out that over @PERCENT2 of people will never venture into nature once they acquire a computer. They have no idea what they are forfeiting. I can envision it now: the plump fruits hanging from the lush, spring - green bushes. The magnificent waterfall that glistens as it cascades into a creek. The rich, dark scenery exudes a majestic aura. Let us not forget the soothing sounds of crickets and owls that lull us into a deep slumber beneath the towering oak trees. This, soldiers, is what we should encourage people to embrace, not time - consuming electronic devices. Men, do you want to know the most tragic aspect of this ""war""? The ""hostages"" of the computer cannot even spend quality time with their families. They are so engrossed in @CAPS9, @CAPS10, and other such devices that the truly important things in life are neglected. My friend @PERSON2 was one of the victims of computer addiction. He managed to break free just in time to prevent one of his children from attending an illegal party. Since then, @PERSON2 has prioritized his family. However, not all families are as fortunate. In fact, as @PERSON1 has noted, @PERCENT3 of families with computers have little to no communication and often end up separating. The influence of computers has gone too far. They have not only disrupted people's lives but also shattered family bonds. This must come to an end. Do you envision our future? It is dominated by computers, and we are their slaves, at their beck and call. They prevent us from getting in shape, experiencing the beauty of nature, and spending time with our families. This is the reason we are fighting. Will you join us?"
301	301	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 Times, do you ponder whether computers confer benefits upon society? Well, I firmly believe they do! There are innumerable reasons why computers are both resourceful and advantageous. A multitude of citizens within our very own community of Watertown perceive computers as an excellent resource for diverse purposes, while others vehemently oppose this view. Computers can contribute to society in multiple ways. Firstly, one can acquire a plethora of new knowledge on the internet. Secondly, it enables interaction with friends and family. Lastly, there are numerous business - related applications available. On both the computer and the internet, there are over @NUM1 million pieces of information one can learn. When grappling with homework, a computer serves as an outstanding resource. One can promptly access @CAPS3.com and search for any topic at any given time. For instance, if one is unaware of a conversion, it can be effortlessly located on the internet. Another area where one can gain knowledge is news. Websites such as nytimes.com and cnn.com offer daily news updates. Personally, I utilize these websites on a weekly basis. On the computer, one can discover vacation spots and sports activities one wishes to explore. When my family was planning our trip to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1, we relied on the computer incessantly. In essence, computers can impart a wealth of knowledge. Secondly, one can engage with others on the internet through various means. These include social networking platforms, web - chat, and email. Social networking websites are an excellent avenue to reconnect with family members and old friends. Websites designed for this purpose include: Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. These free platforms allow users to add friends, send messages, and post pictures. Web - chatting facilitates video communication. One can visually see someone from across the @ORGANIZATION1 via a webcam. Lastly, emailing is an effective way to convey information. One can compose a visual letter to a friend. In conclusion, the computer is an outstanding medium for interaction. Lastly, computers play a crucial role in business. An application named Microsoft Office is employed in countless enterprises, including Microsoft Office Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and @CAPS4. Each of these tools is utilized for planning, selling, presenting, managing, and documenting products. Microsoft Office is a software that one should consider downloading in the near future. Businesses also utilize web - chatting, as previously mentioned, for conference calls. A production company can have a face - to - face meeting with a company from China without being physically present in the same room. This makes it far more convenient than traveling halfway across the @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, computers are indispensable in the manufacturing process within a business. Work sites such as @CAPS5 companies employ computers to control their machinery. I am aware that the @ORGANIZATION2 factory uses computers in their production due to the fact that I watched a show about them on @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In conclusion, computers are a necessary asset in business. In summary, computers have a profound impact on people. They can educate individuals on new and exciting subjects, connect people across the @ORGANIZATION1, and are essential for the smooth operation of businesses. Computers can benefit society by enabling knowledge acquisition on the internet, facilitating interaction with friends and family, and offering numerous business applications. If I were an expert, I would have no concerns regarding computers. They are truly remarkable. Do you share the same perspective as me?
302	302	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, the endeavors of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 revolve entirely around computers. These machines possess the capability to perform a wide array of tasks. However, one must contemplate whether they genuinely contribute to our well - being. Undoubtedly, they assist in research and related activities, yet from a physical perspective, their influence is less than beneficial. Individuals tend to allocate less time to physical exercise, social interaction with family and friends, and we must also consider the long - term impact of computers on @CAPS1 lives. Physical exercise is an essential component of @CAPS1 lives. ""@PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 opines, ""People should engage in activities beyond merely sitting in front of a computer screen."" In fact, an hour of exercise per day is conducive to good health. Regrettably, two - thirds of @CAPS4 individuals fail to meet this requirement. This is precisely why @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 often find themselves characterized as lethargic, inactive, unproductive, and overweight. Consequently, computers bear a significant portion of the blame. Have there been instances where you have not had face - to - face interactions with relatives? This can be attributed to the influence of computers. Computers do offer alternatives such as video - chatting with relatives, using platforms like Facebook, MySpace, or other @CAPS5 @CAPS6 for communication, or sending emails. Nevertheless, the issue lies in the tendency towards laziness. One could physically visit relatives, yet why expend energy on traveling to a travel agency when the internet provides a seemingly more convenient option, as @PERSON2 suggests. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals have not seen their relatives from other states for years. People should reduce their reliance on computers for games and other activities that are predominantly computer - based. It is unnecessary to be overly dependent on the computer for every aspect of life. This situation is unfavorable. People should revert to traditional methods. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 @CAPS4 individuals use the computer on a daily basis. Computers also have a detrimental impact on employment. As everything becomes overly simplified, there is less need to hire secretaries, employees, and other office personnel. Factories, too, require fewer human workers. Computerized @CAPS10 can take over jobs more rapidly, easily, and cost - effectively. Eventually, they may completely supplant human labor, which is not a positive development. In conclusion, although computers initially appeared to be a revolutionary invention when they emerged in @MONTH1, a deeper analysis reveals that their drawbacks outweigh their advantages. Computers impede physical exercise, limit social interaction with friends and family, and can have a negative impact on @CAPS1 lives. I sincerely hope that you can understand my perspective."
303	303	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, the utilization of computers does not confer benefits upon our society. Instead of spending quality time with our loved ones, such as friends and family, a significant portion of our time is consumed by this electronic device that many people rely on: the computer. Having such an electronic device in our daily lives is not advisable for several reasons. It consumes a substantial amount of electricity, is costly to purchase and replace, and exposes our private information to hackers and other malicious individuals. However, the issue of electricity consumption is merely the tip of the iceberg. By using electricity for this seemingly trivial device, we not only waste money but also contribute to environmental degradation. Greenhouse gases and fuel are being wasted, poisoning the air in the process. ""@CAPS3, a local environmentalist, states, ""I do not own a computer at home, and I manage quite well."" This indicates that we can lead fulfilling lives without allowing computers to dominate our existence. In addition to being harmful to the environment, computers are also detrimental to the economy. My father often expresses his aversion to wasting money, yet he still purchases a computer. This computer has crashed not once, but twice! A significant amount of money has been squandered on purchasing it, restoring it once, and now restoring it a second time. Moreover, computers waste our valuable time. I vividly recall my grandfather saying, ""I fail to comprehend why you people squander your precious time and money on these gadgets."" As more people acquire new electronic devices, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of data privacy and security. This is a disastrous situation for ordinary people but a boon for malicious individuals, particularly internet hackers. As time progresses and people become less vigilant about their digital lives, hackers will have greater access to sensitive information. A local resident shared, ""A few months ago, I posted a message on the message board of the @CAPS5 website, stating that I would be on vacation for a week. My address was also included as it was a mobile upload. When I returned from vacation, half of the items in my house were missing."" Burglaries, robberies, and unauthorized internet access can lead to chaos. Weak security measures are never sufficient. It is important to remember that computers consume large amounts of electricity, cause people to waste time and money, and expose us to the risk of having our private information accessed by malicious individuals. I earnestly hope that you can recognize the severity of the problems associated with computers."
304	304	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I firmly oppose the opinion of @CAPS1 @CAPS3, who believes that computers have a positive impact on people. Some individuals fail to get adequate sleep if they stay up late using computers. Additionally, they spend less time on physical exercise and interacting with family and friends. These are the reasons for my disagreement. In this paragraph, I will elucidate why I believe people should engage in other activities rather than spending the entire night on the computer. If someone wakes up in a bad mood, the computer may be to blame for keeping them up late. Would you prefer to have a good night's rest or be extremely tired in the morning due to late - night computer use? Once, I stayed at @CAPS1 friend's house, and she was on the computer all night, getting no sleep. In the morning, she was extremely grumpy because of her exhaustion. ""@PERSON1, @CAPS1 language arts teacher, remarks, ""Staying up late on the computer is unhealthy as it causes dark circles under the eyes and drowsiness. There are numerous side effects."" @NUM1 out of @PERCENT1 parents concur with me and my first reason. In this paragraph, I will discuss my second reason for disagreement: the lack of physical exercise. (@CAPS3 the parents), do you want your children to be lazy and glued to the computer all day, or do you want them to exercise and become healthier? @CAPS1 friend's children are constantly on the computer, which is not healthy, especially considering their young age. A few weeks ago, I talked to them about the importance of being active and the negative effects of excessive computer use. Now, they rarely use the computer and are often outside, playing and running around. ""@PERSON3, @CAPS1 science teacher, states, ""Physical exercise is superior to non - active activities and can also be enjoyable."" @NUM2 out of @PERCENT2 kids agree with @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON2. In this paragraph, I will explain why I think interacting with family and friends in person is better than through a computer. If you were in your family's position, would you think they would prefer you to spend time with them or be on the computer? When I was younger, @CAPS1 family had to scold me to get me off the computer so that I could spend time with them. Eventually, I came to understand their feelings. ""@CAPS1 mom says, ""You should spend more time with your family and friends."" @NUM3 out of @PERCENT3 of @CAPS1 family members and friends agree with @CAPS1 mom. In conclusion, I disagree with the statement that ""Some people support advances in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people."" The reasons are that people do not get enough sleep, spend less time on exercise, and have less interaction with family and friends due to computer use."
305	305	1	1	"Computers are a highly debated topic. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of households in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer? A similar proportion, about @PERCENT2, holds true for @LOCATION2. While some individuals are opposed to this trend, others embrace it. I own a computer, and it offers a multitude of functions. For example, it aids me in writing, allows me to play games, enables social interaction through social networking sites and @CAPS7 messaging, and even facilitates online shopping. I find it particularly useful for writing. At school, in English classes, I rely on my computer to assist me with writing prompts. I also use it to compose conclusions for science labs. Many other students do the same, and it has proven to be an invaluable tool. This is one of the reasons I believe computers are beneficial to society. Another reason is the entertainment and social aspects. There are millions of people who play games on the computer, such as ""World of Warcraft"", ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1"", and classic games like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5"". Social networking sites like @CAPS6 and Twitter, as well as @CAPS7 messaging, provide platforms for social interaction. @CAPS7 messaging, similar to email but almost instantaneous, allows for real - time conversations with friends. Video - chatting is another feature that brings people closer, as it is like a phone call but with visual contact, almost as if meeting face - to - face. A third significant benefit of computers is online shopping. I purchased my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and when the bulb for a @CAPS9 in my house started to wear out, my dad plans to buy a @LOCATION1 bulb on @ORGANIZATION1. This convenience is a blessing for the @CAPS10 @PERSON1, as they can save time and effort by avoiding trips to the store, provided they can wait for the delivery. These are the reasons why I believe computers are beneficial to society. Although these reasons may not be the most profound, they are of great importance to me. The ability to type essays, engage in games and social activities, and shop online is truly remarkable. These are some of the reasons why I and many others love computers. I pose a question to you: what are your thoughts on computers, whether you like or dislike them?"
306	306	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are integral to development. They impart skills such as hand - eye coordination, facilitate online communication, and enable us to explore distant individuals and locations. I firmly believe that they are beneficial to society, despite the contrary view of many. Nine out of @NUM1 schools utilize computers daily, and their communities remain thriving. I understand your concern that it is encroaching on real - world social time, yet it is genuinely enhancing the community. Consider a student in a basketball game; if a teammate passes the ball to him and he fails to catch it due to a lack of hand - eye coordination, this could have been avoided had he spent more time on the computer. There are numerous coordination games on the internet, like pinball of @CAPS1, which help develop this skill. When playing these games, one keeps their hand on the mouse or keyboard and eyes on the screen, training them not to look down. In a basketball game, good coordination allows one to catch and throw the ball effectively. Out of @NUM1 people maintain contact with family or friends online. It is an incredibly heartening feeling to converse with someone you haven't seen in a while, knowing they still remember you. Online conversations help you get to know others better, as they share things they wouldn't disclose otherwise. Moreover, when you meet them in person, you have more topics to discuss. What if you visit a place you thought was wonderful, only to find it the worst ever? It would be dreadful, but an internet search would have revealed the truth. Suppose you want to learn about a famous person; a computer search will provide the information. There are many educational resources on the computer that can assist you in life. I do concur with you on one aspect: society is losing its communication skills. Spending excessive time on the computer is not beneficial. People are no longer picking up the phone to call friends. They are isolating themselves, interacting only with their computers. We don't want our society to remain in this state. Those who spend their days on the computer need to change. I believe computers are an asset to the community. Many think computers are ruining everything, but they aren't. Computers are excellent for learning about people and places. The question is, do you want people to refrain from using computers? Now is the time to decide: do you want us to use computers to further our education?
307	307	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, This world is inundated with electronics. Currently, the computer is the latest sensation. However, despite its popularity, is it truly the most advantageous item to possess? Many children and even adults are addicted to the computer. It is consuming their lives. Four out of five people each year are losing interest in outdoor activities. This is not how one should live. We all desire our children to be active and healthy, not sedentary. Each day, more children are becoming addicted to the computer. Nowadays, when parents need to discipline their children, they confiscate electronic devices. Whatever happened to restricting them from socializing with friends or playing outdoors? Another alarming consequence of the computer is that it is estranging us from our loved ones. Children are more preoccupied with ""@CAPS1"", ""@CAPS2"", or slaying dragons than spending time with their families. They would choose the computer over those who have been in their lives for a long time. The computer is causing family rifts. Now, families only spend time together during dinner. Instead of discussing problems with their parents, children are turning to websites like ""@CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS4.com"". Due to the computer, many people no longer enjoy certain activities. Fewer people appreciate outdoor experiences and nature. Some have lost interest in reading as they prefer playing games. Some people don't even want to call for a pizza. Job - seekers no longer rely on newspapers; they turn to the internet. The world is revolving around electronics. We must put an end to this before our children or grandchildren become out of shape and overly dependent on the computer. Do we really want to destroy this world and lose the bond with our families? I say, improve life and eliminate computers."
308	308	1	1	I opine that computers are advantageous because when one needs to recall information, all one has to do is check their email, and they will remember their tasks. Additionally, if one is lost, a quick glance at a digital map can provide guidance. When it comes to completing a school project, one can utilize the computer to access the relevant website. If one needs to verify a website regarding any important matter, simply typing in the web address will display the page on the computer. Moreover, if a child has nothing to do, they can engage in various games, including math games, @CAPS1 games, and even search for knock - knock jokes.
309	309	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Amidst all the discourse about computers these days, I must concur with those who believe it is consuming a significant amount of our time. I rarely see people engaging in outdoor activities anymore, as computers, apparently, are more entertaining than spending time with friends and family. Have you considered why the obesity rate is so high these days? Well, this is one of the reasons. I recall that when my parents were children, they had no computers and they embraced outdoor activities and nature. Computers have their advantages and disadvantages, but I do not believe they benefit our society. Firstly, computers are displacing the time we should spend with friends and family. I remember the days before Facebook and @CAPS6 were created; those were the times when people truly engaged in enjoyable activities with their loved ones. A recent study indicated that since @DATE1, @PERCENT1 of all Americans use computers for more than @NUM1 @CAPS2 a day for various reasons. I think computers were initially invented to simplify tasks, but nowadays, we primarily use them for social networking. My second major point regarding why computers do not benefit our society is that over the past @NUM2 years, the obesity rate has increased by @PERCENT3. What is the cause? Unhealthy eating habits and excessive time spent sitting in front of computers without exercise. I am almost @PERCENT2 certain that if people reduced their computer usage, our world would be a healthier place. Don't you feel sorry for those who are overweight throughout their lives due to these habits? I believe most people would. My final reason is that we have this magnificent planet, yet no one seems to appreciate it anymore because they squander all their time on computers. If people ventured outside occasionally, they would realize they have been wasting their time. A recent study revealed that @PERCENT4 of people stay indoors idle all day! That's more than half! I hope this situation will change soon because computers have only become a nuisance, and it seems people have no real lives. Computers have permeated various societies, but please, let it not take over this friendly town of @CAPS1.
310	310	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION3, In a poll conducted by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1), @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 people agreed that computers offer an easier way to conduct research than visiting a library. Over the past @DATE1 years, there has been a growing debate about whether computers are beneficial to society. Today, in America, over @PERCENT2 of all @ORGANIZATION1 people own a computer. Computers are undoubtedly beneficial to today's society for several reasons: they facilitate better and easier global communication, make text and information more readily accessible to the public, and enable technological advancements. Communication is a crucial aspect of @ORGANIZATION1 America and the world in this era. It is predominantly powered by computers. @CAPS3 computers provide superior and faster communication, and they are far more reliable. In the @DATE2's, if you wanted to communicate with someone far away, you had to send a letter. Along with this method came the risks of non - delivery, theft in the mail, and the time it took to reach the recipient. All these issues are resolved with today's email and instant messaging (@CAPS2), which are reliable, cannot be stolen, and can reach anywhere in the world within seconds. Computers are not only a means of communication but also one of the most prominent ways to conduct research. Without the internet, people would have to visit the library and face the risk of the desired book being unavailable or the library being closed. Through the internet, all the world's information is accessible @NUM1. Computers are also the driving force behind today's technological advancements. They enable us to have self - operating inventions, eliminating the need for human intervention. This technology saves lives daily and allows us to create even better technology. As you can see, computers are the greatest technological innovation of the @DATE1 era. They enable faster and more reliable communication, serve as the most comprehensive library in the world, and facilitate the creation of even more advanced technologies. Computers are extremely beneficial to society and are essential in this @ORGANIZATION3 era.
311	311	1	1	Dear Newspaper Editor, I opine that computers are advantageous for everyone. Firstly, with a single click, one can explore places across the globe. Moreover, it enables communication with friends and family. Ultimately, it considerably simplifies one's life. Here are several reasons why you should acquire a computer for your family. Firstly, you can instantaneously learn about things you were unaware even existed. You can study ancient civilizations, diverse cultures, and various recipes for tonight's dinner. Additionally, you can obtain assistance with schoolwork. If you need to learn about the [@CAPS1 @CAPS2] of [@LOCATION1], all you need to do is input it. If you need to learn your multiplication table, you type it in, and it will appear within seconds. The internet is excellent for searching up all kinds of things. Secondly, you can converse with your family members and friends online. I've heard numerous individuals stating that people should spend more time with their families. Thus, on the computer, you can communicate with someone in [@LOCATION2] and everywhere else. It's akin to having a pen - pal, but you don't squander money on envelopes and stamps to send a letter. Computers are costly, but they are worthwhile. You can perform almost everything on the computer. Lastly, if you get a computer, it makes your life far easier. Instead of going to the library to retrieve a cookbook, you can type in chicken dinner recipes. Your computer will present hundreds of different ways to prepare a [@CAPS1] chicken for dinner. You can inform a friend that you can't attend their party. Also, it can teach you about the homework you've done. If you purchase a computer, your life will be more relaxing. In conclusion, you should buy a computer. If you do, you will learn a multitude of things. It's like possessing a book containing everything you will ever need or want to know. This is why having and using computers for a reasonable amount of time is beneficial.
312	312	1	1	Dear [@LOCATION1 @CAPS1], I contend that the utilization of computers is advantageous, and here are several reasons to support this claim. My initial reason is that one can discover information online. My second reason is that computers offer entertainment. My final reason is that they facilitate making [@LOCATION1] friends. I will compose [@NUM1] paragraphs elaborating on these reasons. Returning to my introduction, my first reason was the ability to find information online. If you are unable to secure a job, you can search for opportunities on the internet. If you aspire to attend college but lack the time, you can enroll in online courses. These are the details that substantiate my first reason. My second reason was that computers are highly enjoyable. In my view, they are entertaining because when you are bored, you can play games. If you are not inclined towards gaming, you can participate in surveys or uncover facts. This is how I support my second reason. My third reason was the opportunity to meet [@LOCATION1] people. You can locate [@LOCATION1] individuals by searching for them if you are trying to reconnect with an old friend. Alternatively, there are social networking platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, etc., where you can meet [@LOCATION1] people. Most individuals would relish the chance to meet [@LOCATION1] people. To conclude, my first reason was the ability to find information online, my second reason was the entertainment value, and my last reason was the opportunity to meet [@LOCATION1] people.
313	314	1	1	"I am of the opinion that computers are not exerting a positive influence on people during this era. For some individuals, computers have truly dominated their lives. There are numerous health concerns prevalent in a generation saturated with computers. Moreover, when one is addicted to Facebook, there is less time in one's schedule for more significant matters. Additionally, finances are often depleted when computers come into the picture! Computers can pose a real threat to one's health! For instance, excessive typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers over time. Did you know that more seizures are triggered by computers than by epilepsy itself? Dr. [@LOCATION1] asserts, ""People do not cause obesity; computers do."" [@CAPS1] also posits that the majority of obesity cases are attributed to an addiction to computer games. Have you ever felt depressed, taken a long nature walk, and subsequently felt rejuvenated? Well, many people rely solely on their computers when they are down. Computers typically exacerbate the situation. When constantly engaged with Twitter, Facebook, Google, and YouTube, it becomes challenging to find time for even the most crucial aspects of life. For example, if you are a parent, your child may feel neglected if you prioritize the computer over spending quality time with them. Insufficient time spent together could potentially lead them to alcohol or smoking. I doubt you've ever considered a computer in such a light! Computers can be a means of relaxation, but they can also become an addiction. When one is addicted to sitting in front of a computer, they overlook the beauty of nature! Finances can also contribute to this addiction. For example, shopping addictions are an easy way to squander money because it is so effortless. All you need to do is enter a credit card number, creating the illusion that you are not spending money until the bill arrives! Another aspect is that kids' websites like Webkinz require payment, and you also have to pay for internet access and electricity bills. It is evident that computers bring about nothing but health problems, a reduction in daily schedule time, and a drain on finances. In my perspective, computers are merely a source of trouble in our lives."
314	315	1	1	Newspaper Readers, computers constitute a substantial part of our lives and society. Nevertheless, there are still individuals who believe that computers are harmful. In actuality, computers have numerous positive impacts on people. These impacts include facilitating communication, simplifying information gathering, and providing easy access to entertainment. The positive effects of computers far outweigh the negative ones. Computers have streamlined communication for people. There are numerous cost - free communication methods available through computers. For example, instant messaging, [@CAPS1] - mail, video chat, chat rooms, [@CAPS2] (and other social networking platforms) all enable you to communicate with friends and family. The positive impact of this on people is that it allows them to maintain contact with individuals they might otherwise lose touch with due to financial or convenience issues. Being socially active is beneficial for people, and thus, communication facilitated by computers is a positive outcome. Information acquisition is significantly easier when using a computer. For instance, if a child needs to learn about the climate of the [@CAPS3 @CAPS4.S] for a social studies project, instead of having to ask his mother for a ride to the town library, spend time searching for a relevant book, he can simply log on to [@ORGANIZATION1] and commence his research. This has a positive impact on him as it saves time and effort. Furthermore, a vast amount of useful information can be found on the internet, such as flight schedules, prices, restaurants, stocks, weather, news, and virtually any fact one needs to know. All these factors make owning a computer a highly positive asset in someone's life. Computers are an excellent source of entertainment. In the current economic climate, we can all benefit from avoiding movie rental fees and high costs for Xbox or PlayStation games. Internet gaming is highly engaging, and many high - quality games are available for free. Additionally, there are websites that offer free movies and television shows for streaming directly to your computer. These options are an ideal solution to the escalating cost of entertainment. Saving money and enjoying quality entertainment are both positive impacts on people, and both are provided by computers. I hope that the readers of this newspaper will now recognize the benefits of computers. The next time you are faced with a late fee for a library book or movie, remember that the internet and your computer offer viable alternatives.
315	316	1	1	To Whom It May Concern, computers are beneficial to society as they foster learning, enhance coordination, and promote general well - being. It is true that computers can be detrimental to a person's health, reducing the amount of exercise and social interaction one receives. However, the positive effects of computers more than compensate for this drawback. People acquire a significant portion of their knowledge from computers. Among the countless things one can learn from them are the definitions of new words, scientific theories, algebraic equations, history, law, various languages, and much more. When used for educational purposes, computers can teach people concepts that they may not have the opportunity to learn in school, and they allow individuals to learn at their own pace. Computers stimulate the brain and encourage it to think beyond the confines of conventional wisdom. They also teach the brain how to better direct the body to meet its needs. Coordination can be a challenge for some individuals, and this can pose problems. Without coordination, people would be unable to catch a ball, avoid certain hazards, or even maintain balance. To improve coordination, people require practice. They can obtain this practice through activities such as catching a ball, threading a needle, or using a computer. Operating the mouse on a computer can enhance hand - eye coordination as it compels the brain to direct the mouse to a specific location on the screen to achieve a desired task. Initially, this process may be extremely slow, but over time, as the brain gains practice, coordination improves, and the process becomes more efficient. As a result, the person will be able to use the computer more rapidly and effectively, which can assist them in gaming, learning, or helping others in need. Helping others is of utmost importance in today's world. Therefore, it is crucial for people to access news promptly so that they can offer assistance. Computers enable this. For example, on the day of the devastating earthquake in [@LOCATION1], most of the world learned about it within an hour through computers. News websites reported the event, social networking platforms such as [@CAPS2] discussed it, and people engaged in online conversations about it. The rapid dissemination of this news saved numerous lives in [@LOCATION1] as people immediately halted their activities and rushed to provide aid. Computers influence people by spreading news and stories, inspiring them to help others. Many websites are also proficient at facilitating donations while users engage in games. For instance, www.freenke.org is a website that donates [@NUM2] grains of rice for each correctly answered question, and they have donated over [@NUM3 @CAPS3] grains of rice. Evidently, computers and similar websites have a positive impact on the world. Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that computers have a predominantly positive influence on the world. Despite restricting physical exercise, they encourage learning and mental stimulation. Computers also assist people in improving their coordination, which is essential. In summary, computers have a largely positive impact on the world.
316	317	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, the question of whether individuals derive benefits from computer usage is a pertinent one. Some contend that substituting physical activity and outdoor engagement with computer use is detrimental. Personally, I firmly believe that the utilization of computer technology is advantageous. Computers cultivate hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning, and enable individuals to communicate with others. The act of using computers hones hand - eye coordination and reaction time. While some assert that outdoor activities and exercise surpass computer use, numerous computer games contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. As one plays computer games more frequently, the speed at which one reacts to in - game stimuli and clicks the mouse button becomes increasingly crucial. These skills can prove invaluable in daily activities and real - life scenarios. Personally, I am an avid player of @CAPS3 @NUM1, a computer gaming system. @CAPS3 has significantly enhanced my hand - eye coordination, which is evident in the four sports I participate in. Clearly, computers can be highly beneficial in improving hand - eye coordination. Moreover, computers can aid learning in multiple ways. The internet hosts a vast amount of content that is unavailable in traditional school settings. For students, the ability to explore foreign countries is an integral part of the learning process. I utilize the internet almost every night to type my papers and gather the necessary information. It has been a great asset to my academic pursuits. Additionally, typing papers on computers is gradually supplanting hand - writing. Teachers are now increasingly requiring that schoolwork be typed and printed. Digital documents can be saved, eliminating the risk of loss associated with hand - written hard copies. Although many regard computer use as a waste of time, it can also assist in maintaining organization. Many individuals have digital calendars on their computers that send reminders about their schedules. Computers also serve as repositories for data such as music and pictures. Undoubtedly, computers are extremely useful for learning and organizational purposes. We can also communicate with others through computers. People employ computer technology daily to communicate via @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and I - chat. When I need to know about homework or practice schedules, I use my computer to seek answers. Prior to relying on computers for communication, interacting with others was far more challenging. Despite the opposition from some, computers are often the primary means of communicating with foreign countries. When events occur overseas, computers are typically the first source of information. It is essential for us to use computers to communicate with other nations. Clearly, computers are indispensable for communication. We should continue to use computers for a multitude of reasons. Although many oppose computer use, their contributions to hand - eye coordination, communication, and learning are undeniable. Without computer technology, our lives would be vastly different. The decision to continue using computers lies with each individual.
317	318	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you contemplate whether computers contribute to the betterment of society? I firmly hold the view that computers are beneficial to society and are employed for highly worthwhile purposes. They offer assistance to individuals of all age groups. It is more convenient for children to search for information for @CAPS3, which provides them with valuable facts to augment their knowledge. This benefit extends not only to children but also to adults. It is understandable why adults perceive that children do not read sufficiently. However, children engage in a substantial amount of reading on the computer. Some parents assume that because children do not visit the library to borrow books for their reports, they are not acquiring knowledge. In fact, they are amassing knowledge as all the resources available in a library are accessible on the computer. Computers empower children worldwide to locate information rapidly and effortlessly. The computer not only imparts knowledge about historical events but also about contemporary affairs. It can also furnish children with information such as weather updates, which help ensure their safety. Over @PERCENT1 of the materials found in libraries can be retrieved on the computer. Some parents worry that children are not getting enough exercise. Nevertheless, by eschewing computer use, they are also missing out on a wealth of knowledge and important facts. On the computer, one can acquire a plethora of information, including weather updates, details about natural disasters, and ways to assist those in need. Without computers, children would struggle to compensate for the knowledge they miss in school. Computers enable people everywhere to gain knowledge. Not only have computers been beneficial to children, but they also support adults. Adults can conduct work, view properties, cars, and other significant items via the computer. Surely, @CAPS1, you would not advocate for the removal of the knowledge and assistance that computers provide to both children and adults. Computers are particularly helpful for adults in managing their busy lives. They also facilitate changes in lifestyle, such as diet and behavior. These are compelling reasons why people should not oppose computers, as they aid children with @CAPS3, offer important facts, and benefit individuals of all ages. Undoubtedly, some of these facts could bring about positive change.
318	319	1	1	Computers undoubtedly exert a positive influence on society. They assist in organizing one's thoughts, thereby alleviating stress. Moreover, they contain numerous motivational articles that can inspire children to pursue success. Lastly, when all else fails, the computer can serve as an effective means of relaxation and mental rejuvenation. Computers facilitate the organization of thoughts, which in turn helps to reduce stress. Consider a scenario where you are working on a school project. Everyone can contribute to it, and you have the option to selectively incorporate the contributions you desire. Additionally, you can block unwanted programs. This device, known as the computer, has transformed @LOCATION1's society for the better. On average, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 experience stress. If you organize your thoughts on the computer and can review them later, a significant burden is lifted. Instead of fretting about forgotten thoughts, you can be confident that you can access them on your @CAPS2. Reduced stress leads to increased confidence, which has a positive impact on society. Furthermore, the computer features articles that can encourage our children to strive for their goals. A child read an article about @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1's book. As an @NUM3, I also look up to @PERSON1 in school. Through games, I have observed my increasing interest in @CAPS3 since I started regarding @PERSON1 as a role model. I am now making great strides towards achieving a @CAPS4. Where did this inspiration originate? From researching @PERSON1 on the internet. Clearly, the internet has had a positive impact on @CAPS6 society in this instance. Lastly, when faced with overwhelming situations, you can rely on the computer to make them seem more manageable. If you have the ability to solve a problem, there is no reason why you cannot. Often, the problem appears insurmountable due to its complexity. Taking a break to play simple games available on various websites can provide relief. When you return to the problem, you can gradually break it down, and it will seem less overwhelming. Thanks to the computer! In this case, the computer has had a positive impact on @CAPS6 society. As is evident, computers have a profound and positive impact on @CAPS6 society.
319	320	1	1	Dear editor of the @ORGANIZATION1, in my view, people are allocating an excessive amount of time to technology. I know many individuals who are constantly engrossed in technology and neglect their work. Moreover, excessive computer use and engagement with other technological devices often come at the expense of exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Those who are overly reliant on technology may become addicted, which can potentially damage brain cells. Sometimes, people encounter security issues, such as account lock - outs, either due to over - sharing of information or engaging in unauthorized activities. Downloading certain files can also pose risks to computers, such as introducing viruses that can crash the hard drive and system. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using computers. The negative aspects include the threats of stalkers, hackers, seizures, and potential vision problems. On the positive side, computers can enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and cultures, and allow for online communication with friends and family. In my life, computers have been somewhat beneficial. I play many army games, and the tactics I learn from these games are useful when I engage in laser tagging with my cousins and friends at a sports complex. However, excessive computer use can harm one's eyesight, especially when one stares directly at the screen for extended periods. For example, about @NUM1 months ago, when I stayed at my aunt's house, my cousins spent all their time playing games. They only stopped to bathe, clean, and eat, and they didn't go to sleep until eight in the @TIME1. Parents should limit their children's computer game time to at least an hour a day. As for me, I only use the computer for about twenty minutes at a time and then log off, returning later in the day.
320	321	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1, and I will be discussing the remarkable impact that computer technology has had on humanity. Countless significant discoveries and fascinating topics have been unearthed through computers. Studies have shown that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of households in the United States possess at least one computer. Computers offer an excellent means of accessing important information without the need to spend hours in a library searching through books. They also facilitate communication with others, and it is undeniable that they simplify our lives. Imagine this scenario: you are stressed and frustrated after spending @NUM2 hours searching for a topic for your upcoming history essay. You have a throbbing headache and are on the verge of giving up, likely rummaging through hundreds of books in a library. Now, picture yourself at home, comfortably seated, with your computer on your lap. A few keystrokes on the keyboard, and you instantly have access to the information you need. How effortless is that? This is one of the profound impacts that computers have had on us, as human beings. Computers are ideal for rapid learning. Personally, I have leveraged computers to my advantage. By logging on to Google and typing in the subject of interest, it's as if I have a personal tutor at home. A local study was conducted with two groups: Group A, which had access to a library full of books, and Group @CAPS3, which had a @CAPS4 @CAPS5. The scientists assigned the same essays to both groups. In Group @CAPS3, <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of students passed with outstanding grades, while in Group A, only <@PERCENT1@NUM4> achieved a @CAPS9 or higher. This is significant because higher grades translate to better test scores, and better test scores lead to increased funding. I firmly believe that computers are the greatest invention, as they are not impairing humans but rather evolving them. Consider this situation: you are sitting at home, heartbroken because your loved one has moved far away. Computers offer an excellent way to reconnect with that person. There are software applications that allow for instant messaging, emailing, and even video chatting. For some businesspeople, computers provide a means to conduct meetings without the need to travel @NUM5 miles. I have @NUM2 aunts who are an integral part of my life, and I cannot go a day without speaking to them. Without computers, I would be at a loss. Scientists have conducted surveys indicating that @PERCENT1 of the population in the @CAPS10.S.A has family members in other states, countries, or even continents. They need a way to stay in touch. In conclusion, computers are a remarkable invention that has revolutionized our lives. They have enhanced our ability to learn, communicate, and connect with others. There is no denying that computers are an essential part of our modern world, and we should embrace their continued use.
321	322	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I contend that the computer exerts a positive influence on individuals. It aids students in their projects, facilitates people's exploration of other locales, and enables them to acquire information about subjects previously unknown to them. A significant percentage of all teachers assign computer - based projects. Most reading instructors require students to read a book and then type an essay or a review about it. The majority of teachers prefer typed essays over hand - written ones. By assigning such tasks, teachers empower students to venture beyond the realm of mere writing. I am confident that other students would concur with me; it is far superior to type an essay rather than write it! Is there a place you yearn to learn more about and hope to visit someday? The computer can always be employed to gather more information about that place. You can utilize it to determine the optimal times to visit. Moreover, if you've just heard about a tragic accident, like the earthquake in @LOCATION1, and wish to stay informed about the situation there, the computer is your ally. It will keep you updated on the daily developments. I'm certain that almost everyone has encountered a word they didn't know while reading a book, or a student has come across spelling words whose meanings were unclear. The computer can be used to look up these words. It will provide the full definition and the correct pronunciation. Computers can assist you in finding any information you require. In conclusion, computers are not merely devices for kids to play with all day; they are valuable tools that help with various tasks, such as completing work, exploring places, and acquiring knowledge.
322	323	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I opine that computers have beneficial impacts on people. In the subsequent paragraphs, I shall present all my rationales regarding the ways in which computers assist individuals. I will discuss how computers enhance people's typing proficiency, provide them with information, and enable social interaction. Over ninety - four percent of contemporary individuals own a computer and believe they have gleaned numerous insights from it. I doubt you were aware of this! Firstly, I will elucidate how computers aid in typing. The @CAPS2 on a computer does not follow an alphabetical arrangement. This implies that one must practice more to improve typing skills. I recall my initial attempt at using the @CAPS2; it was arduous, but with more practice, I improved. Once I became proficient, I memorized the key positions, and soon I could type without looking at the computer. All its components contribute to teaching skills that are essential in one's professional sphere. Computers are indeed useful devices. Next, I will explain how computers offer valuable information. It is a well - known fact that a child can access a wealth of knowledge through it. It stores information and has websites when connected to the internet. My final reason for the positive effects of computers pertains to socialization. If you wish to communicate with a friend but don't want to make a call, you can simply visit a website and engage in a chat. There are so many options that it's difficult to choose! Did you know there are over one million such websites? @CAPS3 @CAPS4 are just a few examples. This also provides an opportunity for people to interact with individuals from across the globe, thereby enhancing their social skills. Perhaps they will become more amiable and outgoing. All of this is attributable to the computer! As you can see, computers have numerous wonderful effects on people. They help improve typing skills, offer a plethora of information, and enhance social capabilities. I can vividly envision the benefits, and I trust you can too. Thank you for reading and considering my information.
323	324	1	1	I posit that computers have significantly shaped @LOCATION1 into what it is today. Computers facilitate learning, offer pastimes for the idle, and all these can be accomplished within a specific time frame, allowing individuals to still enjoy outdoor activities. Computers are instrumental in everyone's learning process. They simplify essay - writing as typing is faster and making revisions is easier. Additionally, it is more cost - effective to use a computer to access the internet and research foreign countries than to physically travel there. Moreover, a computer hones hand - eye coordination through typing and mouse usage. Finally, by reading articles written by others, computers can impart life lessons. Computers also serve as a source of entertainment for the bored. For instance, one can play computer games on rainy days or when outdoor activities are restricted. Furthermore, one can communicate with friends via platforms like Facebook or AIM. Another example is that one can connect with distant family members in other countries using applications such as Skype. Additionally, online shopping can save gas and time compared to going to the store, and some of the items purchased can be used outdoors. Many people claim that computers keep children indoors, yet they are unaware that there are ways to mitigate this issue. For example, shut - off timers can be used to limit computer usage. Moreover, many individuals learn to manage their computer time effectively. Parents can also establish rules restricting their children's computer game usage on certain days and times. Finally, keeping the computer in the family room prevents children from using it all night in their bedrooms. These are just some of the numerous reasons why computers are beneficial to @CAPS1. They aid in learning, provide entertainment, and all these can be managed within a reasonable time frame. After reading this, I hope you are convinced that computers are advantageous to society.
324	325	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, While computers offer numerous advantages, I do not advocate their extensive use. The advancement of technology has had a detrimental impact on people's lives globally. Examples of this include a lack of physical exercise, excessive time spent indoors, and insufficient quality time with family and friends. Continue reading to explore further why computers do not benefit society. As you are aware, using a computer typically involves sitting in a chair. This sedentary activity does nothing to promote health or physical fitness. I am certain that you aspire to be healthy, and achieving this requires regular exercise throughout the day. Sitting at a computer offers no assistance in this regard. Clearly, thus far, computer usage is not beneficial to society. Read on to discover more drawbacks of excessive computer use. Believe it or not, using a computer is detrimental to health in multiple ways. Not only does it lead to a lack of exercise, but it also reduces the amount of time spent outdoors. You may wonder why staying indoors is unhealthy. It is because one does not receive an adequate amount of fresh air, which is essential for maintaining good health. Imagine the number of sick people if everyone spent the majority of their day using a computer. It would be a daunting task to count them all. Now that you are aware of two ways in which computers are not beneficial to society, there is one more to consider. Maintaining close relationships within a large family is challenging, and excessive computer use does not help in this regard. So, why use them? Trust me, spending quality time with family and friends can be just as enjoyable, if not more so, than playing your favorite computer games. In my opinion, family should be the most precious aspect of your life, so do not sacrifice it for a computer. Now that you have finished reading, I would like to express my gratitude for your time in considering this letter, which highlights how a lack of exercise, excessive indoor time, and insufficient family time due to computer use are not beneficial to society.
325	326	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are among the most valuable assets we possess. Firstly, computers are highly effective for communication. Students can contact their teachers via email if they have queries regarding an assignment. Additionally, computers are invaluable for educational purposes. People utilize the @CAPS2 daily to obtain information about their favorite sports teams or new recipes they've seen on television. Finally, computers streamline the work process. Students and employees rely on @ORGANIZATION1 for a wide range of tasks, from writing papers to creating presentations. Moreover, computers are indispensable in our daily lives as they facilitate communication, learning, and work completion. Each year, thousands of students enroll in college, and numerous families relocate. Computers provide a means of staying in touch with loved ones in distant locations. Parents send emails to their college - bound children, and families communicate through @CAPS3. Computers make all this possible. Not only can we use computers to communicate with our families, but we can also use them to interact with our teachers. When a student is ill but wants to complete their homework, they can visit their teacher's website, where all the class assignments are listed. If a student has a paper due on @DATE1 but their printer malfunctions, they can email the paper to the teacher, ensuring they receive full credit. Email is not only useful for submitting projects but also for clarifying assignment - related questions. If a student has a query, they can consult a friend or the teacher, enabling them to successfully complete the project. Computers are currently one of the most efficient communication tools, but their utility extends beyond communication. The average person accesses the @CAPS2 ten times a @DATE1 to gather information. Computers offer a vast repository of knowledge. Search engines like @ORGANIZATION3 or Yahoo can provide answers in less than a second, far more quickly than spending an hour in the library. Website text is not the only source of information; @CAPS5 also provides pictures to enhance understanding. For example, if someone living in @LOCATION1 reads an article about an animal native to @LOCATION2, they may have difficulty visualizing it. Articles and books may offer descriptions, but an online search can provide a clear picture. Finally, computers stimulate the brain. When searching on a website, one can integrate information from various sources to form a more comprehensive understanding, which helps develop problem - solving skills. Overall, computers are one of the most useful and prevalent learning tools. Many people recognize their utility, stating that work is completed more efficiently and quickly on a computer. On average, computers are fifty times more productive than manual work. This is due to programs such as @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @ORGANIZATION2. These programs allow users to correct spelling and grammatical errors while creating professional - looking presentations. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of individuals with poor spelling or grammar habits can quickly rectify their mistakes using @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6. If people frequently make errors, having them highlighted in @CAPS6 helps them learn the correct way to spell and punctuate.
326	327	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, Computers can exert either a positive or a negative influence on individuals. It entirely hinges on one's perspective and personal disposition. One can assert that computers have an extremely positive impact on people or contend that they have a highly negative effect. In my view, computers have a positive influence on people, yet it cannot be assumed that I am merely a child who spends all their time using it. While that may be true, it can enhance hand - eye coordination. For @CAPS2, what I am currently doing is honing my typing speed. Another @CAPS2 is that some individuals are more proficient at typing than writing, while others write more swiftly than they type. Personally, I type faster than I write. My final rationale is that after a strenuous day at school or work, one can return home, play some music, and unwind. It is advisable to learn to type rapidly, for instance, when writing a school story. If you've just started the story and it's due the next day, what will you do? If you began typing at a young age, by the time you reach middle school, you could type extremely fast. Thus, you could complete your story on time. This implies that one should learn to type more quickly. Some people prefer writing to typing, while others favor typing over writing. I personally prefer typing, but that's just my preference. Suppose a friend of mine prefers writing to typing; that's perfectly fine. We won't stop being friends; we simply have different preferences. This indicates that some people prefer writing to typing. After a taxing day at school or work, one can come home, use the computer to play music, and relax. One can play any music they desire and engage in other activities simultaneously. For @CAPS2, I play music and chat with my friends concurrently. I also @CAPS3 use it to do homework. In conclusion, it is a prudent idea to utilize computers. People can relish both nature and computers simultaneously. Overall, computers have a positive impact on people.
327	328	1	1	My perception regarding the benefits of computers to our community is highly favorable. Technology has advanced significantly over the years, with the computer being the most crucial innovation. Most schools are equipped with computers because they are beneficial to society. They result in a substantial reduction in paper usage. Additionally, they enable us to acquire more knowledge about places @CAPS1 and everything else. These factors support the necessity of having computers. Computers benefit our community by conserving paper and making our work more presentable. We can communicate with friends and family. Moreover, they create more job opportunities for computer technicians as people require more employment, and they also provide news. For example, if the mayor needs to send an important message about water pollution, he can do so via email. The current emphasis in our society is on environmental sustainability, and the only way to achieve this is by transitioning to computers. We have to cut down numerous trees just to provide @NUM1 sheets of paper to each student in a grade. Adults should recognize the need to conserve paper. I anticipate your concern about printing. My response is that you can simply email the information to a teacher, friend, or anyone else. Today's children need to learn more about other cultures and understand their economies. The fastest way to do this is through the internet, which is far more efficient than sifting through thousands of books. All one has to do is type the desired location, and the information is readily available. There are numerous advantages to having a computer. My final point is that it also improves hand - eye coordination, which is essential for athletes. The computer enhances hand - eye coordination through typing and mouse movement. The best approach is to play educational video games. Considering all the facts and statements I've presented, such as the benefits to the community, environmental conservation, and learning about other places, please take these facts into account when writing your article.
328	329	1	1	"Dear town @CAPS1 paper, I firmly advocate for the use of computers. There are several reasons for my stance, including the ability to communicate with friends online, the opportunity to acquire knowledge, and the option to play video games. One reason I support computers is the ability to interact with friends online. If you have a Facebook or MySpace account, you can converse with your friends throughout the day if you wish. Specifically, by typing your message, your friend will receive the exact words and can then respond. For example, if you simply want to say ""hi,"" your friend will view the message and reply accordingly. This ability to communicate with friends online is one reason I am in favor of computers. Another reason I wholeheartedly support computers is the potential for learning. If you want to learn a language, you can visit Google or a similar search engine to find a suitable and efficient website. When you search on Google, numerous websites will appear, and your task is to select the one that best suits your needs. The ability to learn important skills like a language is another compelling reason for my support of computers. The final reason for my preference for computers is the availability of video games. When you are bored and have no one to talk to, you can turn to your computer and play either a mind - stimulating game or an educational game for school. For instance, in science class, we played a game on the computer related to gravity, which was part of our curriculum. This is the last reason why I am an advocate for computers. I support computers because they offer the opportunity to play games. Now you understand why I am fully in favor of computers. I support them because they allow us to communicate with friends online, learn new things, and play video games."
329	330	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am aware that there is an extensive debate regarding whether computers have a positive impact on people. I firmly believe that computers do not have a positive influence on people, primarily because children using computers are at risk, they spend an excessive amount of time on the computer, and the software and internet services for computers are prohibitively expensive. Firstly, computers have a negative impact on people, including children, as they pose significant safety risks. With the advancement of @ORGANIZATION1 technology, child predators can access platforms like Facebook or other websites to gather comprehensive information about individuals. This has occurred to numerous people. A predator accessed my friend @PERSON2's Facebook page and obtained details such as his birthday, residence, and school. The predator then sent @PERSON2 a threatening message. Fortunately, with the assistance of the police, they were able to apprehend the predator before any harm came to @PERSON2. Nowadays, such incidents are occurring frequently. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 disclose all their personal information on these websites, which are then accessed by child predators. @PERSON1 states that ""@CAPS1 this @ORGANIZATION1 technology has had some benefits, but the negative consequences it has brought to society outweigh the positive contributions of computers."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want @CAPS3 to be targeted by child predators who have access to all the necessary information due to computers? Another reason for the negative impact of computers on people is that @CAPS3 are spending an inordinate amount of time on the computer, neglecting their homework and physical exercise. The @ORGANIZATION1 websites that enable @CAPS3 to socialize and play games have made them lethargic and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was young, used to spend hours playing outdoor sports with his neighbors. However, as @PERSON3 has grown older, he spends all his time sitting in front of the computer until his parents have to force him away for dinner. @PERSON3's academic performance has declined significantly, and he has gained a considerable amount of weight compared to his former self. Statistics indicate that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have gained weight due to lack of exercise, and their grades have dropped @NUM1 on a @NUM2 grading scale. Dr. @DR1 Much states that ""@CAPS3 have lost the joy of outdoor activities and the motivation to excel in school. This is all because of these @ORGANIZATION1 computers. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 can now access any website and engage in any activity on it."" @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to become overweight and underperform in school? Lastly, computers have had a negative impact on society from a financial perspective. Many families have spent exorbitant amounts of money on purchasing computers and getting them repaired. These @ORGANIZATION1 computers are extremely costly, ranging from @MONEY3@NUM3 for a @CAPS4 computer. Additionally, families have to purchase software and programs to accompany the computer. A close family friend recently bought a computer. They purchased a @CAPS5 that cost @MONEY2, and on top of that, they spent @MONEY3 on the necessary programs. This family can barely afford the computer, yet they believe it is essential. As a result, they have dipped into their college fund. Now, their child has to attend a less - expensive school. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of families have squandered their college savings on computers because they think they need one. Dr. @DR2 @CAPS6 says, ""Families do not need computers, yet they waste their college money on them. @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer? Computers are not worth sacrificing your children's future for."
330	331	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, A recent scientific study reveals that excessive sedentary behavior, particularly in front of computers, poses a threat to health. This is just one of the reasons why I believe that, despite their usefulness, computers are not entirely beneficial to our society. They impede our ability to exercise, interact with nature, and spend quality time with family and friends. As we all know, exercise is essential for maintaining a healthy and fit body. However, it becomes challenging when some individuals spend their entire workday confined to their offices, glued to their computers. Excessive computer use, even among children, can lead to obesity and weight gain. Scientists have also concluded that prolonged sitting is detrimental to our well - being as it goes against the natural functioning of our bodies. If you've watched ""WALL - E,"" one of @ORGANIZATION1's latest movies, it's evident that after relying on computers for an extended period, the humans in the movie became obese, lacked muscle mass, and lost their physical vitality. While this is an extreme example, milder manifestations of this trend are prevalent worldwide. Engaging in outdoor activities instead of sitting in front of a computer is a surefire way to stay healthy. Another area where computers limit us is our ability to experience nature. Even virtual simulations cannot substitute the real thing. If you want to observe a frog or any other animal, you cannot simply @ORGANIZATION2 it; you need to seek it in the real world. Developing a connection with nature can truly nourish our physical and mental well - being. Instead of exploring the virtual world of a computer, we should explore the real world before it's too late. Learn new skills by doing them yourself rather than hiring someone. Create something with your own hands instead of relying on others. Get up and engage with the world around you instead of sitting in front of a computer website to outsource tasks! As we become more reliant on computers, our dependence on family and friends diminishes. This creates a rift between family members, and they may not be able to support us when we need them. If you're an adult and spend excessive time on the computer for non - work purposes, you're not contributing to your family's well - being, and you're sacrificing your income, your life, and your future. Why would anyone choose to do this to themselves? Imagine a scenario where you have nothing but your laptop. You're isolated and have no meaningful relationships. Nobody wants to be that kind of person, living a solitary and unfulfilled life. Spending too much time on the computer means that everyone around you suffers. In conclusion, while computers have their advantages, every silver lining has a cloud. Computers prevent us from exercising, interacting with nature, and being with our families. So, step outside and embrace the real world."
331	332	1	1	"Imagine a world devoid of computers, a world rife with chaos in warfare and even the disarray on your desk. The chat you're having with your closest friend on AIM would not occur. The report on @LOCATION1 might remain undone because all the relevant books were checked out. In fact, we would not have had any noble endeavors or space programs without computers. I am certain that if this were to happen, I would not be content. Companies almost entirely rely on technology; you cannot simply send a letter and expect @CAPS2 to be at the office within five minutes. Communication via the computer is extremely prevalent. @PERCENT1 of the world utilizes AIM or another chat service. In a study conducted by a @CAPS1 professor, @NUM1 out of every student refrains from communicating with family through the AIM service. A quote from the professor stated, ""@CAPS2 is an excellent means to stay in touch with their families as well as to remain updated on current events."" If computers are removed, information vanishes. It all gets lost amidst a heap of papers. On @DATE1, my computer crashed, and I had a report due, yet all the books were unavailable. That report was completed @DATE1 when the computers were fixed. Now, thanks to the new computer, @CAPS3 is @PERCENT2 more organized, and NASA is operating on Mars. NASA functions entirely through computers. Behold what they have bestowed upon us today. @PERCENT3 of all household appliances originate from NASA's work. A comment from NASA implies @PERSON1, ""@CAPS4 would not exist, nor would cars or phones, without our computers."" If that is true, will they also take away cars and phones? We need you, the people who have shaped this country into what @CAPS2 is, to decide. Do you believe we should not have computers? I do not, and neither should you."
332	333	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, computers exert a multitude of effects on individuals. Some of these effects include the displacement of time spent with family and friends, the erosion of a genuine social life, and a lack of sufficient exercise. Computers detract from the quality time that should be dedicated to friends and family. I conducted an interview yesterday with @PERSON1. I inquired, ""@CAPS1, when you visit your grandmother's house, what activities do you typically engage in?"" @CAPS2 responded, ""I usually use the computer."" @CAPS3, do you truly wish to use the computer while you are there? You are in the company of your family; you are meant to spend quality time with them. Engage in a game such as Monopoly or play @CAPS4. These are enjoyable and effective ways to interact with your family. If your family members do not possess these games, bring them along! Many individuals believe that platforms like Facebook, AIM, email, and MySpace facilitate interaction with friends. However, this is not truly the case. I asked my friend @PERSON3 for their opinion on these platforms, and @CAPS2 replied, ""They are excellent for interaction."" In reality, they are merely websites on the computer. While you are engrossed in the computer, you are not actively maintaining a social life. Your town offers various activities or has appealing places where you can go. Your town @MONTH1 may have a gym, a community center, or a library. Visit these places and socialize with your friends. Attending school, going to the library, and spending time with friends are all excellent ways to interact with others. People often overlook the fact that @CAPS1, when you are seated in your computer chair and @CAPS5. While you are sitting there, you are not exercising. @CAPS1, if you continue @CAPS5, you will gain weight. You might become overweight @CAPS1 if you are stuffing your face with Cheez - Its and not exercising. I posed a question to @PERSON2: ""What do you do while you are on the computer?"" @CAPS2 answered, ""I eat..."" Eating itself is not bad, but @CAPS1, if you are not paying attention, you will consume more than your body requires. Your town has recreational sports leagues, such as @CAPS6, softball, and baseball. Join a team instead of spending your time playing on the computer and @CAPS5. Get active! Computers are not the greatest things in the world. They prevent you from maintaining fitness, hinder your social development, and reduce the time you spend with your family. Computers do not contribute to your growth and maturity for the future."
333	334	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, the utilization of computers per family has witnessed a significant increase over the past @NUM1 years. Concurrently, people are becoming heavier and require more physical activity. If you use a computer, it may malfunction or break down. Computers are a substantial waste of both time and money. In the past @NUM1 years, numerous individuals @MONTH1 have gained a considerable amount of weight. They no longer engage in regular activities such as going to the supermarket because they can shop online. Studies indicate that individuals who visit the supermarket or a physical store are less likely to be overweight compared to those who shop online. Another reason why computers do not promote exercise is the prevalence of Google. If you desire to view a picture of a beautiful mountain, you can simply access Google and type in your query. While this is a convenient way to view scenery, walking to the location can burn up to @NUM3 times more calories than merely looking it up on Google. Additionally, computers can lead to addiction to games. Suppose you have basketball practice at @NUM1:00 pm. If you start using the computer at @NUM5, you may easily become addicted to a game and forget about your practice. You will be glued to your computer, mindlessly typing away at a game that offers no real - world benefits. When you skip practice, you will not perspire, and as a result, you will gain extra weight. Scientists assert that actively participating in a sport can lead to a weight loss of up to @PERCENT1 compared to a sedentary lifestyle. Before the advent of computers, life was simple; no student forgot their homework. However, with the widespread use of computers, numerous issues can arise. Firstly, the printer may malfunction. @CAPS1 year, my printer stopped working @NUM1 times, preventing me from completing my homework. My teacher informed me that forgetting my homework had a detrimental impact on my grade, reducing it by over @PERCENT2. Another advantage of handwriting is its convenience. You are capable of writing during school. @CAPS1 year, with my teacher @PERSON1, I was required to write a prompt. She instructed me to go to the computer lab and type it, but all the computers were occupied. When I returned downstairs, she told me I had to write it. Consequently, I received a @NUM7 because she could not decipher my handwriting. Every other student received a @NUM8 or higher, but my lack of practice in writing affected my grade. Moreover, computers can be inconvenient when conducting research. My parents discarded our books some time ago due to the reliance on computers. One day, when I was home alone, I needed to research euthanizing dogs on the computer, but there was a power outage. I was unable to complete my @ORGANIZATION1 events for science, and as a result, I received a @NUM9. This grade lowered my average from an A+ to an A-. The sole reason for my poor grade was my over - dependence on the computer for research, which ultimately let me down. If I had better handwriting skills, I would have achieved a higher grade. The final reason why computers do not benefit society is that they are a waste of money. Most computers cost up to @MONEY1 for the device and installation. There is no real necessity for them since a library can provide all the resources that computers offer. The library has books, enabling you to conduct research without relying on computers. In my household, all @NUM7 family members own a computer, but @NUM11 of these computers are used only once a week. They are extremely expensive, and there is no justifiable need for them. My father, who works at a computer store, claims that computer companies are overcharging by @PERCENT3. With that additional @MONEY2, you could purchase numerous books and magazines instead of a computer. This is why computers are not useful. People do not get enough exercise, leading to a weight gain of @PERCENT1. They are less convenient than handwriting, and they are a significant waste of money. The decades without computers were far more practical, and people lived happier lives.
334	335	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, the title "" @CAPS2 at @CAPS3 killed in a horrific accident"" flashes across the screen, followed by another and yet another. What is intended to be a @NUM1 - minute glance can stretch into an hour or two, encroaching on precious family time. I understand why this @MONTH1 gives rise to numerous conflicts, as computers can be highly beneficial. However, I firmly believe that more often than not, they have a negative impact on the general public. Firstly, there are numerous websites that disseminate false information. Moreover, computers gradually consume people's lives. When it comes to these technological devices, there are indeed advantages, but the disadvantages can easily outweigh them. To begin with, computers are vulnerable to viruses, scams, and internet predators. It is alarmingly easy for someone to steal credit card information and personal data by presenting offers that seem ""too good to be true."" @CAPS4, if you trust your instincts, you will recognize these as false. Unfortunately, many individuals who are unaware fall victim to these traps. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have been scammed at some point in their lives. I vividly recall when someone I know thought they were purchasing a pair of boots. Later that day, they received a call from the credit card company warning them about the suspicious purchase. In today's digital age, one must exercise extreme caution when using computers. During a computer processing class, when my friends and I were learning how to evaluate websites, we encountered a site that appeared reliable and accurate. We were all astounded to discover that every piece of information on it was fabricated. Computers can put those who @MONTH1 lack knowledge at risk. I am strongly convinced that sites like these and many others have a detrimental effect on the public. Additionally, computers devour a significant portion of people's time, to the extent that family time, homework, and exercise are severely restricted. I can personally attest to the effects of excessive computer use because I witness it daily with my younger brother. Once he starts playing video games, homework is promptly set aside. The only words that escape his mouth are, ""@CAPS5, just one more game!"" It is easy to predict how this scenario unfolds: one game leads to two, and the cycle continues. It is not just children who are affected. Many of my friends spend three hours every night updating their status or uploading pictures on @CAPS6. Is there not a point where we can draw the line between a ten - minute online session and allowing the computer to dominate our lives? When surveyed, the majority of students reported spending at least two hours on the computer every night. When games and instant messaging start to supplant studying and exercise, it becomes a significant problem. Computers rob people of their free time and can have a negative impact on their grades and physical fitness. Therefore, I urge you to consider the benefits of computers but also be aware of their negative effects. You will realize that the drawbacks are far more numerous than you might think. Support me in limiting computer usage and helping the public recognize the dangers that these technological devices @MONTH1 pose. Computers can harm relationships, finances, and personal lives more than one might anticipate."
335	336	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, ""@CAPS2 at @CAPS3 killed in a horrific acident"" is the title that flashes across the screen. Then another, and another. What is supposed to be @NUM1 minutes grows into an hour or two that take away from your family. I can see why this @MONTH1 bring up many conflicts; as computers can be very helpful. However, I feel that more often they negatively impact the general public. For one, there are many sites out there that portray false information. Plus, computers begin to consume the rest of peoples' lives. When it comes to these technological devices there are pros but there the cons can easily outweigh them. To start, computers are loaded with viruses, scams and internet predators. So easily someone can steal credit and information by placing offers that seem ""too good to be true."" @CAPS4 you listen to your instincts, then you'll know that they are. But, many people who don't know any better fall for these traps. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have been scammed some time in their life I can clearly remember when someone. I know thought they were buying a pair of boots. Later That day, they got a call from the credit card company warning them about the purchase. These days you have to be so careful when you're on the computers. When my friends and I were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class we came upon a site that seemed reliable, and accurate. We were all shocked when we learned that everything about it was fake. Computers can put people who @MONTH1 not know any better at risks. I strongly feel that sites like these and many others have a negative impact on the public. in addition, computers steal much of peoples' time to the point where family, 'doing homework and exercising is limited. I can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because I see it everyday with my younger brother. Once he begins his video interactive games, homework is pushed a side. The only words from his mouth are, ""@CAPS5, just one more game!"" I suppose you can infer how this turns out: one game, turns two and so on. It isn't only children either. Many of my own friends are update status or pictures on @CAPS6 for three hours every night. Isn't their a point where we can draw the line. between going on for ten minutes and letting the computer control your life? When surveyed ;the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night. When games and instant messaging starts to take away from studying and exercise there is a huge issue. Computers take away peoples' free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness. So, I ask you to consider the benefits of computers; but also look for the negative effects. You will realize that their are more than you would believe. Support me on this by limiting usage of computers and by helping the public see the dangers that these technological devices @MONTH1 bring. Computers can harm relationships, finances and your personal life more than you would think!"
336	337	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, alongside @CAPS1 and numerous others, I am of the opinion that computers are not merely good but highly advantageous. Computers are progressively advancing our world on a daily basis. We all utilize them for communication, entertainment, and the acquisition of knowledge. Computers are akin to entities brimming with engaging activities and learning opportunities. They are beneficial to individuals across the globe. Computers steadily enhance communication with each passing day. In the past, communication relied on traditional mail, which has now evolved into emails, Twitter, and Facebook. These platforms have revolutionized communication in the present era. Friends at a distance can view photos, information, videos, and engage in conversations from afar. Certain platforms like @ORGANIZATION2 enable instant messaging with friends. Moreover, video chatting has emerged as an innovative way to have a live visual interaction with others. According to @ORGANIZATION1, since the beginning of @DATE1, @NUM1 more users have signed up for web - cams. Communication is positively influenced by computers. I understand that you @MONTH1 enjoy sports or nature, yet there are times when it is delightful to access instant entertainment. Computer games cost approximately @MONEY1 and offer immediate access. Additionally, browsing the web for news or humorous videos can be enjoyable. Almost everyone with a @CAPS2 derives great pleasure from surfing the internet. Have you ever pondered how to listen to your favorite song when it is not on the radio? iTunes stores, organizes, and plays music in a virtual library for permanent access. YouTube also allows free access to music videos and songs. This is precisely why computers are a prime source of entertainment. Finally, computers provide an abundance of knowledge and are highly valuable for education. Specific websites offer access to a vast amount of information. Wikipedia and dictionary.com are excellent resources for learning.
337	338	1	1	Dear, Local Newspaper. @CAPS1, after reading the article, I concur with your stance because in @DATE1, children prefer to stay indoors using the computer. @CAPS1, it is uncertain what they do. Some children spend the entire day on Facebook, while others are on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. Occasionally, children even lack the inclination to engage in physical exercise; instead, they remain on the computer, indulging in continuous eating. I believe that if there were no technology, today's children would not develop such sedentary habits. Some children even show little interest in socializing with their friends or family, stating that they prefer to stay home using the computer. However, we should engage in more physical activity rather than being constantly glued to the computer. If we are always on the computer, we will not acquire knowledge at school because when at school, children may be preoccupied with the thought of going home to use the computer, and they will not focus on their education, @CAPS1. What if children drop out of school or stop attending because they are more interested in chatting with friends or strangers? What if a girl refuses to go to school and instead stays on her computer? What if she is communicating with a stranger? Children should engage in physical exercise instead of being on the computer, and they will no longer develop sedentary habits.
338	339	1	1	Dear @PERSON2, within the confines of your town, all one hears is, “Mom, mom, mom, drive me to the library to get books.” One can observe that numerous residents yearn to visit foreign countries but lack the financial means. Is this the scenario you desire for every household? Computers have a profound impact on people as they facilitate communication and interaction among individuals. One can learn about places one has always aspired to visit, and it is arguably the device that simplifies life the most. For these reasons, computers are the most beneficial asset to society. Firstly, computers enable friends and family to communicate without incurring any expenses. I have relatives who are financially constrained and unable to afford the high phone bills that arise when we need to converse. This indicates that not everyone can afford phone communication, but using a computer is cost - free. Additionally, in the @ORGANIZATION3 issue @NUM1, @DATE1, @NUM2, a recent poll revealed that @PERCENT1 of computer owners use their computers for communication instead of phones. I am aware that some individuals claim that computers are time - consuming, but if such a large proportion of people use computers for communication, there is no need to fret about phone bills. Moreover, @PERSON1, a @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION4, states that fewer people required loans after the advent of instant messaging and video chatting on computers. This demonstrates that friends and families ceased paying exorbitant phone bills and instead engaged in online communication. Furthermore, by using a computer, anyone can access information about distant lands across the @LOCATION1. Moreover, this can be done from the comfort of one's bedroom or any room. A boy named @CAPS3 @PERSON4, who attends @ORGANIZATION1, mentioned that he had always dreamt of visiting @LOCATION2 as a child and was overjoyed when he found facts and pictures about it on the web. Additionally, @PERSON3, a teacher at @ORGANIZATION5 @ORGANIZATION1, conducted a poll asking how many students had completed projects related to foreign countries, and @PERCENT2 of them responded affirmatively. This implies that a significant number of people need to research foreign countries and rely on computers to acquire information. It shows that a large number of people use computers to explore far - off places. Last but not least, computers are extremely convenient. A recent poll conducted by @ORGANIZATION2 indicated that @PERCENT3 of people would rather own a computer than a car, which highlights the significance of computers. Initially, I believed that computers were detrimental, but after receiving one for my @NUM3 birthday, I realized their usefulness. Many people claim that computers are time - consuming because they have not used one. Did you know that millions of people use computers, which is more than half of the population, even in a relatively poor country? This shows how important and convenient computers are. In conclusion, with computers, residents can communicate with friends, learn about the world, and visit foreign lands conveniently. Undoubtedly, computers benefit society, @PERSON2 and readers.
339	340	1	1	An increasing number of individuals are utilizing computers. They are employed for communication, leisure, and various other purposes. However, are computers truly advantageous? Computers can be highly beneficial. Apart from providing virtually unlimited information, one can stay connected with family through @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION2 Word can be used to create documents and PowerPoint presentations to organize ideas effectively. Additionally, @ORGANIZATION2 Excel can be employed to manage finances. Windows Movie Maker allows one to create personal movies if a camera is available. Besides these prominent and useful features, one can play computer games, watch movies, and listen to music on a computer. Like any other technology, computers also have drawbacks. Some are minor, while others can be significant. Computers are costly. On a computer, it is impossible to determine the true identity of the person one is communicating with. Moreover, many individuals store important information on their computers. People's computers have been infected, and their information has been stolen, leaving them vulnerable. Bugs can also severely damage a computer, rendering it inoperable. Furthermore, many individuals can be defamed on the internet. Hate sites promoting terrorism, racial violence, and drug use are prevalent on the web. One must exercise caution when browsing the internet. Sometimes, computers can dominate people's lives. People spend excessive time on Facebook and insufficient time reading or maintaining contact with family. Computers can be remarkable tools. Given their excellent features that keep one informed at all times and programs that are ideal for business management, it is no wonder that almost every @CAPS1 household owns one. Some people dislike computers, claiming that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. I disagree. Although the disadvantages can be irritating and sometimes serious, if one is prudent enough to avoid @CAPS2 - @CAPS3, install anti - virus software, and refrain from sharing information with unknown sources, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. Overall, if one is intelligent enough, a computer can be a fun and convenient addition to life, enabling one to accomplish more than ever imagined.
340	341	1	1	Have you ever needed to acquire information about a different place or wished to see your baby cousin who has grown up? Owning a computer offers substantial benefits to society. It not only enables one to obtain information and communicate with family and friends but also enhances hand - eye coordination. A computer can provide almost any information one requires. This can assist in learning about other cultures, places, or something as simple as what a @LOCATION1 creampie is. The computer possesses an infinite amount of knowledge. This is a significant advantage because a computer is one of the few tools that can facilitate the expansion of knowledge with a simple click. Having a computer also allows for communication with family and friends. Modern computers are equipped with webcams. This feature enables one to see and converse with them without the need for long - distance travel, such as taking a plane or a long car journey. This is undoubtedly a great benefit for those with relatives living far away. Whether it is to improve one's baseball swing or catch a touchdown pass, a computer can be highly beneficial for developing hand - eye coordination. Surprisingly, typing a school paper can significantly enhance hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is beneficial in various aspects of life, including physical activities, schoolwork, and employment. It is evident that owning a computer offers substantial benefits to society, as it allows for increased learning, communication with family and friends, and improved physical skills. Contemporary society would be vastly different without computers.
341	342	1	1	"Dear editor: An increasing number of individuals utilize computers; however, not everyone concurs that this trend benefits society. As the editor of the newspaper, you possess the influence to apprise the public of various situations. In my view, computers are indispensable for the following reasons: they endow people with the capacity to acquire knowledge about distant locations, individuals, and weather conditions; they enable people to engage in online conversations with others; and numerous occupations rely on computers. Do you aspire to a more economically advanced state?  First and foremost, computers empower people to learn about far - off places, individuals, and the weather. I have an uncle named @PERSON1, who has @NUM1 young daughters. Every morning before school, @PERSON1 checks the weather on his computer to ensure it is safe for the children to go to school. However, one day, he forgot to check the weather and took his kids to school. Unbeknownst to him, the roads were extremely icy. Regrettably, @PERSON1 and his daughters were involved in a car accident, and two of the girls suffered several fractures. Evidently, the weather information accessible via the computer could have spared them a trip to the emergency room.  Secondly, computers facilitate online communication with others. Dr. @DR1 from @CAPS1 asserts that ""chatting online with others (@CAPS2) is the optimal way to maintain contact with individuals from your former school, camp, and numerous other places."" I wholeheartedly concur, as adults can stay in touch with friends from middle school. Additionally, @PERCENT1 of students claim that they typically go online to study or obtain materials for homework. I believe that online chatting for test preparation is an excellent idea, as it will assist students in achieving better grades. Some parents contend that it is a waste of time, yet teachers report that since the inception of @CAPS2, students' grades have been soaring.  Finally, the majority of contemporary jobs rely on computers. For instance, my father works for @ORGANIZATION1, and the computer aids him in communicating with clients worldwide. Moreover, the chat function can translate languages, making it far more convenient than phone conversations. Teachers also use computers to record students' grades, which simplifies their work as it automatically calculates the averages. Computers have revolutionized people's jobs.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people as they enable learning about distant places, individuals, and weather, facilitate online communication, and are integral to many jobs. I earnestly urge you to support me by writing a positive article about computers and their contributions to society. Please consider my proposal."
342	343	1	1	Dear editor, my name is @CAPS2, and I am a @NUM1 - year - old girl who is an avid reader of the daily newspaper. While perusing last week's newspapers, I came across an advertisement inviting submissions for an article on either the negative or positive aspects of computers. I am here to convince other readers of the adverse effects computers have on people. As an active user of computers, I am well - acquainted with all the negative factors.  Individuals who spend more than an hour on the computer are often engaged in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing computer games. Many of these children are overly engrossed in their computer games. I saw a segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 about how @PERCENT1 of all teenagers play on the computer at least once when they should be doing their homework. Computer games impede children's learning. Kids perceive @CAPS3 as more important than completing their math homework. Computers do not contribute to children's learning.  Children or even adults who are overly involved in computer use become reluctant to communicate. They feel compelled to focus on winning and outperforming their friends. To achieve victory, they must concentrate solely on the game and refrain from talking. This behavior among children can lead to long - term consequences. Being self - conscious or lacking social skills are the most significant long - term outcomes of excessive computer game involvement. This is how excessive engagement in computer games affects social skills.  Children who are overly absorbed in computer games do not get sufficient exercise, which can lead to obesity. They believe they are getting exercise by playing, but in reality, they are inactive. Kids think they cannot pause their games, but there is always a pause button on the screen. Eventually, they become addicted to playing and no longer consider going outside important. This is how computer games cause long - term effects.  In conclusion, computers offer no benefits to people. They result in a lack of learning, anti - social behavior, and obesity. All these consequences are long - term and can have a detrimental impact on one's life. Don't you desire a happy and successful life? I certainly do!
343	345	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever contemplated the myriad fascinating activities one can undertake on computers, such as making calls, ordering groceries, and accessing school - related books? In today's world, it appears that technology serves as the linchpin, and computers stand at the forefront. ""@CAPS1 When my older sister moved to @CAPS2, it was challenging to stay in touch and see each other. However, we discovered @ORGANIZATION1, a platform where people from all over can add contacts, chat, call, or engage in webcam conversations. Now, we use it daily, and it's as if she never left home,"" @PERSON2 remarks about the internet site @ORGANIZATION1.  Undoubtedly, @PERSON2 and many others cherish their computers. Studies indicate that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are more productive online. @PERSON1 states, ""Every day, my schedule is streamlined because of my @CAPS3. While at work, I can order groceries and have them delivered by four o'clock. @CAPS1 When I return home from work, I can schedule doctor appointments, school meetings, and arrange conferences with just a single click, regardless of my location. This eliminates the need to consult a calendar or pick up the phone."" @PERCENT1 of couples today claim to have met online via Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, or AOL. The internet is an excellent medium for meeting new people as you can interact with each other, get to know one another, and view profile pictures. You can find like - minded individuals online, and over time, friendships are formed. I have some of my closest friends online through a mutual friend's page, and our friendship has thrived.  Even educational institutions have embraced the digital realm, with all course - related books accessible online at home. Students can now check their grades and receive feedback from teachers online. As a result, students are increasingly encouraged to use the web both at home and at school.  I hope I have broadened your perspective to recognize that the internet is not entirely negative. People spend a significant amount of time online because almost everything has migrated to the web, including schools, stores, food delivery, and even television. Personally, I spend about one or two hours on the web chatting, studying, and watching TV. After that, I may go for a walk or play my @CAPS5, but I remain connected to the web as the @CAPS5 supports Wi - Fi connections.  In conclusion, computers enable individuals to connect with others and accomplish various tasks online. I trust that by now, you share my view."
344	346	1	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, As a teenager growing up in this technological era and @MONEY1 society, I firmly believe that computers are more detrimental than beneficial. I contend that books are superior resources, people can find amusement in alternative ways, and computers can pose risks and cause health problems. As a well - respected newspaper, your stance on this issue will influence the opinions of many.  I acknowledge that computers can assist in information retrieval, but in my personal view, books are better resources. Anyone can write and publish an article on the internet, even if the content is entirely false. People can deceive others by claiming to be doctors in their @NUM1's when they are actually @NUM2 - year - olds working at @ORGANIZATION1. On the computer, it is impossible to determine the credibility of information, whereas books offer accurate and reliable content. Any true information available on the computer can also be found in books. Admittedly, the computer may be a quicker or ""easier"" option in some cases, but perhaps what people need is a challenge. With the advancement of technology, each generation seems to be becoming lazier and less interested in books, and it is high time to reverse this trend.  Moreover, people can find enjoyment through various means that do not involve computers. Many individuals use social networking sites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 to connect with friends, but on these platforms, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the users. If you wish to communicate with your friends, why not call or text them? This way, you can be certain of the person you are interacting with. Nowadays, too many teenagers isolate themselves in their rooms, playing computer games and spending less time with their families. What happened to the tradition of playing cards and board games with family members? In my opinion, playing real - life games is far more enjoyable than virtual ones. You can also go outside and breathe fresh air instead of being confined to a stuffy room because you are too preoccupied with the computer to even do the laundry. Additionally, if kids start handwriting their papers, it will improve their penmanship as they will no longer rely on the simplicity of typing. Besides, some children do not have access to computers, and since @ORGANIZATION2's must be handwritten, why not encourage it?  Finally, computers can be dangerous and harmful to health. The use of social networks allows children to disclose all their personal information online, which can lead to serious consequences such as stalking or kidnapping. The internet also contains a plethora of inappropriate images and websites that no one, especially youngsters, should be exposed to. Staring at a computer screen for extended periods is extremely harmful to the eyes and can cause severe vision problems in the long run. Furthermore, it is well - known that typists are more prone to arthritis and other finger - related problems due to the repetitive finger movements during typing. Eliminating excessive computer use will have a positive impact on people's well - being.  Although many people enjoy using computers, there is not an overwhelming need for them. Books are better resources, there are numerous non - computer ways to have fun, and computers can be a threat to health. Why spend hundreds or @MONEY1 on a tool that is not even essential? Do not be deceived by the media's tricks, scams, or gimmicks. The next time you are about to turn on your computer, ask yourself, ""Do I really need this, or is there a better way to achieve my goals?"" More often than not, there will be a better alternative. So, sometimes it is wiser to embrace the traditional ways of doing things rather than relying solely on technology."
345	347	1	1	"Dear local @CAPS1, I understand that you are uncertain about the merits of computers. I am here to convince you that they are indeed beneficial, and I have several compelling reasons to support this claim. Firstly, computer games enhance hand - eye coordination, offer insights into far - off places such as other countries, and facilitate staying in touch with people.  My primary reason is that computers can and do improve hand - eye coordination on a daily basis. When using a computer mouse, one must be highly coordinated to excel at computer games. This enhanced coordination is invaluable in daily life, whether it is playing catch with your son or picking up an object.  Secondly, computers can help you explore different ethnic backgrounds and learn about distant locations. If you are planning a trip, it is essential to gather information about the destination to know what to expect. Even just browsing through pictures of beautiful countries can be awe - inspiring. Considering these few reasons alone, it is worth rethinking your stance on computers.  Finally, I believe the most crucial aspect is that computers enable people to stay connected. My mother, who doesn't have a Facebook account, has been able to reconnect with all her old friends. She describes it as ""nice."" I firmly believe that having friends is of utmost importance to everyone, and computers play a significant role in facilitating these connections.  In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits, including improving hand - eye coordination, providing knowledge about distant places, and enabling social connections. I hope I have convinced you, as I am confident that I would have been swayed if I were in your position. I am certain that you will make the right decision."
346	348	1	1	Dear newspaper, a segment of the @CAPS1 populace contends that computers are a squandering of time and pose a danger. Indeed, computers can be perilous; however, they can also assist in @CAPS1 diverse manners. Such as settling bills online, planning vacations, and even attending college classes. For @CAPS1 individuals, bills present a challenge. They are an inconvenience, and there are @CAPS1 means to address them. When one reflects on it, @CAPS1 people labor throughout the day and sometimes into the night. Would it not be pleasant to return home and find all bills settled? Well, one avenue to achieve this is via a computer. Computers possess @CAPS1 programs that can expedite bill - payment, enabling one to unwind and relish free time upon returning home. Computers are also advantageous for vacation planning. Annually, @CAPS1 people utilize online programs to arrange their vacations and trips. For instance, my family and I planned a journey to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 of @NUM1. Upon reaching the airport, we had first - class tickets, and a ride awaited us upon disembarking the plane. That @DATE1 has been the most memorable thus far. As we transition into a new era, @CAPS1 people are commencing to enroll in online college classes due to their work commitments or having children at home. These @CAPS2 courses are suitable for working individuals as they are concise and offer substantial learning. A computer is indispensable for taking these classes, as its absence would preclude one from participation. A computer is an invaluable asset for all these purposes. Hence, if you are a mother or a worker and aspire to return to school, you should contemplate enrolling in online college classes. And if your family desires a vacation, you should explore one of the @CAPS1 travel programs available on the internet.
347	349	1	1	Dear, to whom @MONTH1 pertains; Local Newspaper. I am of the opinion that you are correct. Computers can be beneficial, facilitating communication with others, yet they lead to a sedentary lifestyle. People neglect their families and, most crucially, their health. Their eyesight deteriorates, they consume more junk food, which can result in elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, and even diabetes. Computers are highly addictive, causing individuals to stay up using them for extended hours. This leads to poor hygiene. Therefore, I believe you should thoroughly examine this issue and publish it in the newspaper. To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 residents, I understand that using a computer can be highly enjoyable. However, the fun will cease once you fall seriously ill. You @MONTH1 should take this matter seriously as it has far - reaching implications. Failing to spend time with loved ones and engage in physical activities is detrimental. You all need to step away from the computer and enrich your lives. A computer is akin to a drug. For the sake of your family, please consider my perspective. I propose that all computers should be restricted for at least one week for work, school, and perhaps even for the sake of your health. This @MONTH1 may seem like an overreaction, but it is not. Do you wish to witness an increase in the prevalence of diabetes and other health issues in the population? I assume not. How would that make you feel? Undoubtedly, it would not feel good. So, get up, go for a jog, or do whatever you enjoy and spend quality time with your family. Please heed my advice and break this harmful habit.
348	350	1	1	Dear local newspaper, can you envision a world devoid of computers? I cannot, as I firmly believe that computers are extraordinary. Firstly, if you own a computer, you can encounter new individuals. Secondly, you can undertake projects or complete homework on them when necessary. Lastly, on a computer, you can essentially uncover any information you seek. Read on to discover the reasons behind my belief that computers are remarkable. Who does not relish meeting new people? I certainly do. If you wish to make new friends or find someone who attends your school but you are unfamiliar with them, you can search for them on your computer. Additionally, if you have no one to converse with, you can turn to the computer to meet new acquaintances. I frequently do so. Moreover, there is no harm in making friends or engaging in online conversations; it can be quite enjoyable once you give it a try. This is why I consider the ability to meet people as one of the reasons computers are great. The second reason computers are excellent is that they can assist when you need to print something or create a project. My science teacher always requires assignments to be printed. How could I achieve this without a computer? Also, if you forget your homework or any assignments, you can ask a friend online or check your school website. Thus, computers are wonderful because printed assignments appear more presentable. My final reason is that on a computer, you can search for almost anything. For example, if you want to find a place to visit but lack an address, you can always consult the computer. Also, if there is an issue with your house, car, bills, or anything else, you can always check the internet for assistance. Lastly, if you want to purchase something but cannot find it in any store, you can simply acquire it online. As I mentioned, you can do virtually anything on a computer. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a profound positive impact on life. Firstly, you can meet new people or make friends. Secondly, you can complete projects or homework. Lastly, you can essentially do anything on a computer. This is why I think computers are great and they can significantly aid in life rather than causing harm.
349	351	1	1	Dear newspaper, some individuals assert that computers do not contribute to society. However, I hold a different view. Computers contribute to society to a greater extent than one might imagine. They facilitate learning and streamline work. They help prevent accidents and save lives. It is a well - established fact that computers assist people in learning and simplify work. One can type, schedule tasks, create presentations, or check emails. All these functions make work more efficient, and there are numerous other things one can do. As previously stated, they can aid in learning. One can acquire trillions of pieces of information on the internet. It is truly astonishing that one can learn about everything on the internet. One could even obtain a medical degree online. The capabilities of computers extend beyond making work easier and helping people learn. Computers can prevent accidents in any moving object. For example, millions of cars on the road today can almost drive themselves, and this is made possible by computers. Similarly, in airplanes, the pilot is present mainly as a backup in case of malfunctions. The same applies to trains. Furthermore, @CAPS1 are entirely computerized; humans merely instruct the computer on what to do. Almost every self - propelled moving object has been computerized at some point, enhancing global safety for everyone. Finally, computers save lives, which is an absolute truth. In hospitals, without computers, people would be dying daily. They are used to maintain records, monitor vital signs, and assist in surgeries. During surgery, computers require only a tiny incision and can be more precise than human surgeons, thus saving lives. Additionally, computers can ensure that an operating room is completely sterile, reducing the risk of infection. As evident, computers contribute significantly to society. They facilitate learning, simplify work, prevent accidents, thereby reducing hospital admissions. And if someone does end up in the hospital, their chances of survival are greatly increased. So, what is your stance on computers now?
350	352	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, experts concur that people should venture outdoors and engage in exercise. There are three primary reasons for this: individuals do not engage in sufficient physical activity, they can socialize with friends and family, and people and children should appreciate the beauty of the outdoors. Allow me to elaborate. Nowadays, people and children do not partake in an adequate amount of exercise. Those who neglect exercise may gain weight. Moreover, parents and children who spend the entire day on their computers or laptops are prone to obesity. Children today struggle to exercise as they become overweight from excessive computer use and playing computer games. Do you not agree that both kids and adults should spend time with their friends and family? Children should refrain from excessive computer use and spend more time outdoors with their friends or family. Parents should also consider spending quality time with their loved ones rather than remaining glued to the computer at home. Do you not think that people should go outside and savor nature? Astonishingly, while people are aware of nature, they may not fully comprehend its true essence. Adults should spend time outdoors rather than staying at home, considering that @PERCENT1 of the world does not have access to computers at all.
351	353	1	1	For individuals, technology, particularly in the realm of computing, is an invaluable asset. Without technological advancements, communication would be severely restricted; one would be unable to contact others. Moreover, the absence of computers would preclude internet access, hindering the ability to interact with family and friends. In professional settings, technology is indispensable. For instance, those in the automotive industry rely on computers to assess the condition of vehicles. This exemplifies the critical role technology plays in modern life, underscoring the necessity for its continued presence and development. Computers, in particular, are of utmost importance as they facilitate online research and testing. Through technology, we can make calls and access platforms like google.com, further highlighting its essential nature.
352	354	1	1	Dear local Newspaper, Over the years, computers have emerged as a remarkable invention. They have enabled individuals to acquire a wealth of information, establish connections with others, and drive technological innovation. This has had a profoundly positive impact on our country. Allow me to elaborate. Computers are beneficial for our nation as they assist in gathering information for educational purposes and determining locations. For example, I, @PERSON1 in @NUM1 grade, find that using a computer to research for my science project is far more efficient than visiting the library and perusing books. Additionally, in the event of getting lost, a computer can guide us to our destination. Another advantage of computers is their role in facilitating communication with friends and family. As @PERSON2 stated, “When I can't reach my mom, I send her an email on my computer.” Parents can also communicate with their children's teachers via email to stay informed about their progress. Lastly, computers contribute to technological advancement. Scientists can leverage computers to develop various technologies with greater ease. As @CAPS4 @CAPS5 mentioned, “The computer has helped us first create a model of our invention and then refine the details.” Over the years, computers have proven to be indispensable in numerous aspects of our lives. In conclusion, computers aid us in information retrieval, communication, and invention, and they have even played a role in warfare. We should embrace the continued presence of computers in @LOCATION1.
353	355	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I contend that while computers may seem like a time - consuming indulgence, they also offer numerous benefits. One should only use a computer when absolutely necessary. Regrettably, many individuals spend excessive hours on computers, often out of boredom or a reluctance to engage in outdoor activities. Technological advancements have rendered computers faster and more efficient, leading to an increasing number of people purchasing them each year. Computers offer a plethora of advantages. They serve as a valuable educational tool, enabling users to acquire knowledge. One can also search for employment opportunities and engage in online shopping. If one is seeking a job, the computer can be used to find a suitable position. It is truly astonishing how much information a computer can provide; users can look up any topic and pose questions. Additionally, when an item cannot be found in physical stores, the computer can be used to locate it, although a credit card is typically required. In summary, computers are both helpful and potentially time - wasting.
354	356	1	1	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1, I admit that I spend a significant amount of time on the computer. However, I believe it is one of the most addictive and time - consuming inventions in contemporary society. While computers do offer benefits such as enabling communication with distant friends and family, facilitating schoolwork, and providing access to information, I am of the opinion that people should curtail their computer usage. Indeed, computers allow for interaction via email, @CAPS2 messaging, and social networking platforms like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. Nevertheless, traditional methods of communication, such as using cell phones or writing letters, are still viable alternatives. Physical exercise is crucial in today's world, yet many individuals fail to engage in sufficient physical activity. Did you know that the obesity rate has increased by @PERCENT1 since last year? This is a substantial increase, and we must prevent it from rising further. If people continue to waste time staring at their computer screens without exercising, the obesity rate will undoubtedly climb. Moreover, computers can lead to various medical issues. For example, a month ago, I experienced severe back pain. My doctor informed me that one likely cause was my habit of leaning forward while using my laptop. As specialist @CAPS5 Oz states, “Computers can also cause vision problems and headaches.” We can mitigate these problems by taking action against excessive computer use. By limiting our computer usage to two or three times a week and using it only for essential tasks, we can prevent these negative effects. I hope this serves as a wake - up call regarding the detrimental impact of computers on our well - being.
355	357	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I am writing to address the multifaceted impact of computers on human lives. While some effects are relatively benign, others can be quite detrimental. A significant number of people now spend their entire days indoors, engrossed in computer games or social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and @CAPS1. This trend is disrupting educational pursuits, work productivity, and physical exercise. Each day, more individuals are failing to meet their exercise requirements or complete their work. We must halt this concerning phenomenon. People who remain indoors constantly are less healthy than before. Their weakened immune systems increase the risk of illness, which can sometimes lead to severe health conditions or even death. If one spends all day in front of a computer screen, the addiction can become overpowering. To maintain good health, one must adopt a balanced diet and engage in physical activities such as cycling. When someone is frequently on the computer, it can be as addictive as watching TV or playing @CAPS3. This addiction can also interfere with family gatherings and sports activities. When using the computer, people often forget about their homework, which can lead to a significant decline in grades, potentially resulting in summer school or grade repetition. Moreover, neglecting sports preparation due to computer use can prevent individuals from performing to their full potential. These are the primary ways in which computers are affecting the daily lives of ordinary people. While there are other impacts, these are the most commonly observed.
356	358	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I personally dissent from the experts who fret that individuals are allocating excessive time to their computers and diminishing time for exercise, nature appreciation, and social interaction with family and friends. The rationale for my disagreement is that it is not the computer's fault that people refrain from outdoor activities and exercise. Purchasing and using a computer is an act of free will; the computer does not compel us to use it—it is our choice. Hence, we cannot attribute people's lack of exercise to computers. Another crucial point to note is that computers are significant as they facilitate education. For instance, there are online computer courses for those seeking degrees in diverse fields. With a mere click, one's future and career can be transformed. The most vital reason is that computers enable people to learn about different cultures and lifestyles. I am fond of learning about @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2, despite the severe storm they endured. Thank you for considering my opinion, and I hope it will alter your perspective on a life without computers.
357	359	1	1	Physical activity knows no bounds, yet technology is finite.
358	360	1	1	Do Computers @CAPS1 Society? This query may remain unanswered indefinitely. I hold an opinion on this matter, and while it may not resonate with everyone globally, I sincerely hope it does. Exercise is an excellent means of maintaining physical fitness; however, if one spends the entire day on the @ORGANIZATION1, they forfeit the opportunity to stay in shape. As others remain fit, one will eventually become overweight. While one sits engrossed in a @ORGANIZATION1 game, others are outdoors, playing in the park, swimming in the pool, or fishing by the lake. Prolonged use of the @ORGANIZATION1 is detrimental to both physical health and social life. Moreover, the @ORGANIZATION1 hinders quality time with friends and family. It also impedes the formation of new friendships, and old friends may seek new companions. Finally, if one spends @NUM1 on the @ORGANIZATION1, they will miss out on the remarkable @CAPS2 life they have awaited since memory. Therefore, the next time a friend suggests going online after school, decline to avoid addiction.
359	361	1	1	Computers exert a highly positive influence on individuals. They assist people in numerous ways, imparting knowledge about history and distant locales. Additionally, they offer an excellent avenue for self - exploration. Computers also serve as an effective means of communication, whether the recipient is just a few houses away or farther. They possess a vast repository of knowledge that expands daily. Every time I access the computer, I acquire new information. Searching for @LOCATION1 instantly presents millions of web pages, each brimming with novel knowledge and fascinating details about @LOCATION1. Computers are far more efficient than visiting a local library to find a book with the required information. Online, one can also discover diverse views and perspectives on a subject. Depending on the website, one can obtain opinions on specific places and events, which are often unavailable in library books. Computers provide immediate access to a wealth of knowledge and some viewpoints. They can also offer entertainment. There are numerous engaging websites to visit when one is bored. One can read books and magazines at any time. If one enjoys reading, online resources may yield a free book of interest. Some individuals prefer playing games. On the computer, one can find almost any game, including board games, video games, strategy games, adventure games, and countless others. I could enumerate the different types for hours. Sports enthusiasts can search the internet for pages about various sports, discover ways to improve their performance, or learn how to play a sport. Those who like to watch @CAPS1 can also do so on a computer. Some @CAPS2.V programs upload different episodes online, allowing easy viewing with a single mouse - click. Computers can benefit anyone who uses them. They educate, entertain, and facilitate communication with friends and family. Many programs enable internet - based communication. One can send emails to a cousin halfway across the world, attaching pictures and text files. There are various communication programs, such as IM (instant messaging), which allows instant message delivery to another user. Now, there are even more communication options. One can make audio calls using the computer, similar to a phone. Webcams enable instant video recording and transmission and video calls. The program connects users with friends or family, allowing face - to - face interaction. Computers are an outstanding communication tool. They contribute positively by providing access to an astonishing amount of information, offering entertainment, and facilitating communication regardless of distance. I firmly assert that computers are a positive asset.
360	362	1	1	"Newspaper, I opine that the use of computers is not a significant concern. It is a convenient method of communication, imparts social and life skills to young and adult users, and is no more addictive than other habits. These three reasons underlie my belief that the @ORGANIZATION1 is undervalued. Firstly, some individuals contend that computer use reduces family time. However, I regularly communicate with family and friends via the @ORGANIZATION1. It is a convenient, rapid, and generally secure means of communication. When I require assistance, I either use fb chat or send an email if the person is unavailable. I typically receive a response within a day. Additionally, the internet, a remarkably intelligent resource, allows me to search for answers online. Unlike phone calls, where one may be unaware of the caller's identity and calls are easier to trace, it is more challenging to trace an @ORGANIZATION1 connection to a specific location. Thus, communication via the @ORGANIZATION1 is faster, safer, and more convenient. Secondly, the @ORGANIZATION1 can effectively teach social and life skills. For example, on average, an adult proficient in fast typing can earn @MONEY1 more. The @ORGANIZATION1 has multiple functions. Facebook, a social network, enables young adults to learn basic social skills. These skills are crucial when seeking a first job. A boss is more likely to like and appreciate an employee with good social skills, potentially leading to a promotion. Computers are extremely useful. Thirdly, I respectfully believe that some people are misguided in their view of computer addiction. It is difficult to become addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. Only about @PERCENT3 of Facebook users are addicted. In contrast, the rates of alcohol addiction (@PERCENT1) and drug addiction (@PERCENT2) are far higher. Computer addiction is negligible and non - deadly. The only commonality between computer use and more severe addictions is that addicts may become irritable when asked to stop. As @PERSON1 at the @NUM3 states, ""Computer addiction can be overcome quickly, and as long as one uses the computer for an hour or less per day, there is no cause for concern."" In conclusion, computer use is not a major issue. It is a convenient communication device, an effective tool for learning social and life skills, and not a significant source of addiction."
361	363	1	1	I concur that computers indeed confer benefits upon society. As nearly everyone either utilizes or owns one, it aids in handling significant matters, rendering tasks facile. In a certain sense, computers offer a form of exercise as they prompt the fingers to move more rapidly. Undoubtedly, the computer stands as one of the most remarkable inventions to grace this world. One can engage in conversations with friends and family, print written materials, and partake in games. What could possibly surpass such capabilities? We can conduct research on renowned individuals, explore information about the deceased, and search for pictures. However, computers can induce lethargy as they create an urge to remain seated indefinitely, and they are addictive to many. Yet, some individuals fail to comprehend the true essence of using or possessing a computer. Were they to own a computer, their perspectives would likely undergo a transformation. Thanks to Tom, one can access MySpace and interact with friends, family, and individuals from different towns and states. Additionally, one can visit platforms such as Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Twitter. The computer and the internet are truly a source of entertainment and also provide a modicum of exercise. Moreover, they assist with schoolwork, homework, and research on countries, places, houses, and vacations. There is a plethora of activities one can undertake. Nevertheless, others hold a valid point in that appreciating nature is beneficial as it promotes physical health and strength, encourages participation in sports, and allows for outdoor enjoyment rather than remaining indoors all day, idle and fixated on the computer screen, neglecting sleep and outdoor activities. In my view, both aspects have their merits, but I align with the initial opinion as computers are truly exceptional!
362	364	1	1	You've received mail! My computer is inundated with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, maintaining communication with these individuals would not be as efficient as it is currently. Over the past few decades, technology has advanced at an astonishing pace, giving rise to remarkable computers. With computers, we can type more swiftly, communicate with distant relatives, and access information like never before. This incredible invention has enabled us to accomplish truly astonishing feats. To commence, we have discarded typewriters and embraced computers. Now, more than ever, we can type at a faster pace, enhance hand - eye coordination, and edit papers without relying on a peer. Firstly, given the extensive typing requirements for college, most occupations, and daily lists, computers have streamlined and expedited this process. I am confident that the majority of the content you need to type is composed using a computer. Secondly, we have developed remarkable hand - eye coordination skills. Furthermore, by typing and reading simultaneously, we have trained our eyes to perform multiple tasks, similar to playing the piano. Lastly, with spell - check functionality, we can edit papers without external assistance. The computer can detect errors instantaneously, which is undoubtedly more effective. Undoubtedly, the document - typing aspect of computers is a compelling reason for their continued presence. Another reason is communication. Thanks to numerous communication applications such as [ORGANIZATION2], [ORGANIZATION3], [CAPS2], and [CAPS3], we can now communicate with a multitude of distant friends and relatives. For instance, with both my sisters at college, it was challenging to communicate with them. However, through [CAPS2], I can view their pictures, send instant messages, and even engage in video chats. Without computers, witnessing their pictures and staying updated on their lives would have been an impossibility. Secondly, email has provided a rapid and convenient means of informing people about schedule changes, ideas, and even store sales and specials. Traditional mail has become obsolete with this highly efficient communication method. Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an obvious reason for their necessity in our lives. Last but not least, computers have granted us unparalleled access to information. We can now find facts and figures more rapidly, easily, and with a wider range of opinions within seconds. Thanks to [ORGANIZATION1] and other search engines, we can obtain the information we need. Moreover, there are numerous options and websites to choose from. For example, when searching for a particular animal, a vast number of relevant pages will appear. Undoubtedly, computers have made information retrieval faster and easier, which is precisely why we need them in our daily lives. In conclusion, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened numerous doors for modern society. Without computers, typing documents, communicating, and accessing information would not be as seamless. Thanks to this invention, we can achieve incredible things. People across the country are experiencing the efficiency of using computers, and we can too. It is evident that computers are effective and are driving technological advancement in our society.
363	365	1	1	"Can you envision a world populated by lifeless individuals overly fixated on technology such as computers, televisions, and cellular phones? Our world, as we know it, will come to an abrupt halt if we do not put an end to this excessive reliance. Computers can contribute to obesity, a lack of social interaction, and a waste of time on these unproductive devices. Our world cannot afford to allocate time to such activities. Our planet is governed by humans, and if we neglect its essential needs, we, along with our beloved planet [LOCATION1], will perish. Computers do not offer benefits to our society today. Firstly, computers can be a significant factor in the development of obesity, as they already have been. Obesity is one of the most prevalent health issues globally. While many factors contribute to obesity, technology, particularly computers, plays a substantial role. Instead of spending all day sitting in front of a computer, individuals can engage in more productive activities such as taking a walk, starting a club (for adults and children alike!), or assisting neighbors. Even if computers teach hand - eye coordination, they do not teach us how to maintain physical fitness. Computers have a considerable impact on the obesity problem. As adults, we should recognize the significance of obesity. Children represent the future, and no one desires for future leaders to be associated with widespread obesity. Nevertheless, computers detract from the ""bonding"" time between family and friends. Both adults and children are lacking in social interaction. They do not engage in verbal and physical communication with their ""online friends."" It is no wonder that families today are facing challenges; the root cause is computers. Moreover, people spend an excessive amount of time on computers. If individuals did not squander so much time on computers, they would not be losing jobs at such an alarming rate. The high unemployment rate is attributed to the claim that they ""do not have enough time,"" when in reality, all their time is dedicated to computers. If they eliminated computers from their lives, they would have an abundance of time to pursue other activities. No one wishes to be an unemployed ""stay - at - home"" individual. In conclusion, computers do not benefit our poorly managed society. They contribute to obesity, undermine social needs, and consume people's time. Although some may think that computers allow for ""chatting"" with ""online friends,"" they do not fulfill our physical and verbal social requirements, which can lead to low self - esteem. If newspapers continue to publish articles about the ""benefits of computers,"" people will eventually stop believing such nonsense and cease purchasing these newspapers. After all, nobody wants to read false information, do they?"
364	366	1	1	Computers seem to be the omnipresent topic of today. There are new websites, chatrooms, games, and a plethora of other features. I concur with experts who advocate for spending more time outdoors with friends and family. Computers have encroached upon people's lives. One never knows who might be searching for them on Facebook or [CAPS4], and the capabilities of computers seem boundless. Whether it's during lunch or at other times, computers are gradually taking over our lives. Believe it or not, some people carry computers everywhere they go. Once one logs onto [CAPS3], there is a high probability of remaining engaged for an extended period as there is always new content to discover. Admittedly, computers are a fascinating device, but there must be a limit. We cannot be constantly on [CAPS3], delving into what [PERSON1] said to [PERSON2]. We need to return to reality and spend quality time with our families. Although [CAPS3] is an interesting device, it is not necessarily safe to post personal information on it. Facebook and [CAPS4] are potentially two of the most perilous platforms. Anyone could simply type in [PERSON1] and obtain numerous matches, potentially finding you even if you are unaware of them. People are not always as they present themselves. Someone might claim to be a [NUM3] - year - old just graduating from college, when in fact, they could be a [NUM4] - year - old [CAPS6] on the verge of entering a senior center. One should exercise caution and not trust everyone. Nowadays, one doesn't even need to leave home. One can shop, communicate, file taxes, pay bills, and lead a virtual life on [CAPS3]. Eventually, human interaction might become entirely virtual through [CAPS3]. Some computers may even possess a more intelligent system than certain humans. In essence, one should limit their time on [CAPS3] or risk spending all their time there. It is evident that I believe computers should be used less frequently in our daily lives. They are taking over our lives, pose risks, and eliminate the need to leave home for livelihood. I hope you will consider my viewpoints. Thank you.
365	367	1	1	There are numerous positive aspects associated with technology, particularly computers. Computers offer the opportunity to communicate with individuals from across the globe. Additionally, they provide access to educational websites and simplify the processes of bill payment and shopping. Engaging in conversations with people from different parts of the world can be highly intriguing. Computers facilitate this through the internet. One can learn about diverse individuals and their cultural backgrounds, or communicate with friends and family residing in other cities, states, or even countries. While some may argue that computers are expensive, it is a one - time investment. Computers are extremely beneficial for both students and teachers. For students, educational websites offer homework assistance. For teachers, they can post students' grades online, eliminating the need to deal with constant inquiries about class averages. Although there are inappropriate websites, there are numerous methods to block them. For example, I was struggling in [CAPS3] during [CAPS2] and my teacher recommended a website called Study Island. Regularly using this website significantly improved my grade to a [CAPS4]. Computers also enable us to pay bills and shop at more affordable prices. Although there may be occasional delays in receiving online purchases, the time and money saved by shopping online rather than visiting physical stores are substantial. Moreover, computers are particularly helpful for individuals with disabilities. In conclusion, computers offer a multitude of advantages. They allow for global communication, provide access to educational resources, and simplify bill payment and shopping. As the local newspaper has noted, computers are a significant asset to society, and many aspects of modern life would be unfeasible without them.
366	368	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1, Computers have assisted us in numerous ways. They have facilitated learning for both children and adults, augmented the number of jobs, and lent support to law enforcement as well. Indeed, I concur that some individuals devote excessive time to these machines, yet this does not imply that they have not been beneficial to us. Computers enable children and adults to acquire a vast amount of knowledge. Children can utilize their computers to conduct research on their homework or simply explore topics for amusement. Most adults have completed their schooling and are educated, but computers aid them in making discoveries about space, the human body, and so forth. Thus, computers not only educate children but also contribute to the process of making new discoveries that need to be imparted to them. Presently, our economy is not performing optimally. A significant number of people are unemployed and unable to support their families. However, envision how many more individuals would be jobless if we did not have computers. @PERCENT1 of our society is engaged in computer-related work. This means that @PERCENT1 of the population would be without employment. Computers not only provide us with knowledge but also assist law enforcement in apprehending a substantial portion of the wrongdoers in society. Computers have been of assistance to law enforcement for slightly over @NUM1 years. Although crime has increased in recent years, computers have helped us in capturing criminals. Computers store vast amounts of data, which means we can archive the fingerprints, photographs, @CAPS2, criminal records, etc., of previously arrested individuals to aid in the apprehension of criminals. Therefore, computers have benefited us in multiple ways. They have facilitated learning for children and adults, increased the number of jobs, and supported law enforcement. Even if people spend too much time on these machines, it is their choice, and considering how much computers have helped us, we should make the right decision and allow our technology to continue advancing.
367	369	1	1	Are you a computer user? Is there a computer in your household? On average, each household owns two computers; however, this may not be entirely favorable. @CAPS2 computers are encroaching on valuable time that could be spent on hobbies, enjoying nature, and engaging in real - life experiences. Firstly, computers detract time from hobbies and social interactions. Some of my friends spend @NUM1 hours a day on the computer, which could be better spent participating in sports or socializing. Moreover, computers often become the focal point of their lives. People often ask me, “@CAPS1 weren't you online @TIME1?” and I reply, “@CAPS2 I have a life that does not revolve around @CAPS3.” Secondly, computers deprive us of the opportunity to appreciate nature. People often fail to recognize the beauty of the outdoors. In an increasingly ordered world, we need the wilderness more than ever. It helps us develop self - appreciation and a deeper understanding of the uniqueness of our planet, yet computers rob us of these experiences. Thirdly, computers distance us from real - life interactions. Some individuals struggle to engage in face - to - face conversations and are only proficient in communicating via email or @CAPS5. I acknowledge that escaping from real life can be relaxing, but some people are so disconnected that they may not even know basic etiquette, such as which side the stamp goes on a letter. It may seem old - fashioned, but I believe that in real - life interactions, people can express their true feelings, something that cannot be fully achieved through email. In conclusion, computers consume time that could be dedicated to real - life, nature, and hobbies. Additionally, excessive typing can lead to arthritis in the hands.
368	370	1	1	Computers are becoming ubiquitous in households across @LOCATION1 and the globe. Nevertheless, there is an issue, as some individuals contend that computers do not contribute positively to society. In my view, computers are an invaluable asset in our daily lives. The internet enables us to communicate with friends, family, and countless others worldwide! Its diverse programs help maintain the organization and currency of files and related materials. Moreover, computers are an indispensable resource when conducting research for projects, reports, homework, or any task that requires information. The world is a vast expanse with numerous people, places, regions, and countries. Families often relocate far from their loved ones and wish to stay in touch. Traditional postal services are slow and costly, whereas the internet offers a more affordable and efficient alternative. Instant messaging services, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2, provide a rapid and economical means of communication. They allow users to send and receive messages at any time, on any day, and from any location with minimal inconvenience. Another option is to utilize social media platforms like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, which allow users to update their “status” on their profile walls, enabling friends to view and comment. The most immersive method is using a webcam, which allows users to see and hear the person on the other end of the call. In my opinion, this is the best approach as it allows for unconstrained and personal communication. Many have observed that the world lacks organization. Computers help bring order through various applications and programs, including @ORGANIZATION1 apps, @CAPS5, and document folders. @ORGANIZATION1 offers a suite of applications for tasks ranging from document writing to spreadsheet creation, presentation design, and flyer production for special events. These apps are fundamental for starting a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 focuses on storing and organizing information in files according to user preferences and is highly suitable for quick access. My parents and other adults often say, “organization is the key to success,” and @CAPS5 undoubtedly aids in achieving this. The most basic yet practical way computers assist with organization is through document folders. These are useful when quickly saving and organizing files. All one needs to do is name the file, click save, and the task is complete. In conclusion, computers are not merely beneficial for society; they are essential for civilization. From facilitating global communication to organizing our lives and aiding in research, the internet and computers are invaluable resources that enhance our daily experiences. Don't you agree?
369	371	1	1	Approximately @PERCENT1 of the global population currently uses computers. Although you may spend a considerable amount of time on the computer, it offers several advantages, including the ability to stay in touch with family, stimulate your intellect, and still have time to appreciate nature. Are you familiar with email? It is a convenient communication tool that allows you to connect with family and friends. There are also other digital platforms, such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter, that serve the same purpose. Even when using the computer, you can maintain contact with others without relying solely on phone calls. I recall a time when I used my cell phone to call my aunt, which depleted my minutes. A simple message like that could have been sent via email. Thus, computers do have their merits. Did you know that you can exercise your brain online? You can achieve this by acquiring new knowledge. For example, if my sister needed assistance with science, she could search online to learn more about the subject. Some experts argue that excessive computer use is detrimental, but for others, it is a valuable source of learning. Computers can also provide access to online tutoring, further enhancing intellectual development. Did you know that you can enjoy nature at any time? Around @PERCENT2 of the world's population appreciates nature. However, can't this wait? Some people prefer to stay indoors due to adverse weather conditions, such as snow. While I believe that nature is wonderful, I understand that not everyone wants to be outdoors all the time. Although we are part of nature and it is an integral part of our society, the changing seasons often bring unfavorable weather. In conclusion, the computer offers several benefits. Despite the time spent on it, you can communicate with family, exercise your brain, and still find time to enjoy nature.
370	372	1	1	Dear newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals. They are highly beneficial to a large number of people, providing education and facilitating interaction. Computers can significantly enhance hand - eye coordination. Dr. @PERSON4 stated, “In recent surveys and tests, I have observed a substantial improvement in the hand - eye coordination of @PERCENT1 of individuals, all thanks to computers.” Moreover, computers are an effective means for people to learn typing. A recent survey at @ORGANIZATION1 revealed that @NUM1 more students have mastered typing skills due to computer use. Computers are also invaluable to business professionals when creating presentations. Instead of laboriously making a large poster board for a @CAPS2 @CAPS1 project, one can easily create a PowerPoint presentation. In educational institutions, computers are widely used to teach students about new and interesting things. For instance, students can explore unfamiliar places around the world. @PERSON5 said, “@CAPS2 friend is moving to @LOCATION1, and she had no idea about the place. We looked it up on the internet and discovered a wealth of fascinating information.” Computers can also educate students about different cultures. At @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT2 of students learned about @NUM2 new cultures within a year, thanks to computers. Additionally, computers can introduce people to interesting historical figures. For example, I was unaware that President @PERSON2 had @NUM3 brothers and grew up in @LOCATION2. Computers also serve as a platform for social interaction. Using computers to communicate with friends is convenient and cost - effective. Instant messaging is free, eliminating the need for parents to pay hefty phone bills. A survey in the town of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 found that @PERCENT3 of residents considered using computers to communicate with friends to be much easier. Computers also enable people to meet new individuals online. Take dating sites as an example. @PERSON1 said, “It's wonderful! My husband and I met online and have been together for @NUM4 years.” Communicating with distant relatives online is also free. @PERSON3 remarked, “It's so much easier to talk to people online.” In conclusion, computers have a profound positive impact on people. They are useful tools for education and social interaction, and their benefits are undeniable.
371	373	1	1	"To Whom It May Concern, I have recently become aware of your discourse regarding the impacts that contemporary computers exert on society. Some individuals contend that computers yield positive effects, such as facilitating the acquisition of new knowledge and enabling interaction or communication with others. Conversely, some believe that society is allocating an excessive amount of time to computers. They assert that these individuals are devoting less time to physical activity, appreciating nature, and spending time with their families. I am of the opinion that people are overly engrossed in computers. Many assume that all information on the internet is accurate, which is far from the truth. @PERCENT1 of teenagers nationwide are addicted to computers. Firstly, content posted on the internet is not always reliable. It can be uploaded by anyone, regardless of its veracity. My friend discovered a website with highly detailed information for an essay. She submitted it, but the teacher returned it the next day. In large red letters, it read ""false information."" Had she sourced the information from a book, she likely would have received an ""A+"". Secondly, @PERCENT1 of teens in @LOCATION1 have developed an addiction to computer use. My friend was fixated on Facebook from @NUM1 to @NUM2 and was on it daily. She began failing her classes. She neglected her homework and did not study for tests! She failed the @NUM3 grade. All of this occurred because she was addicted to a website. This is why I concur with the experts' concern that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. If you wish to maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid excessive computer addiction, set limits for yourself. Make a prudent choice."
372	374	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am of the view that individuals who extensively utilize technology, such as computers, may not be making a positive choice. Technology can have a significant impact on adults, and its effects are even more pronounced on children. Children who frequent chatting websites like Facebook are starting to experience a decline in their academic performance. I have observed that children who use Facebook are increasingly neglecting their homework, and their grades are plummeting. I once heard a student say that after he started using Facebook, he stopped doing his homework and reading. His grade dropped from a @CAPS1 to a @CAPS2 average because he was more focused on the computer than on his studies and reading. I believe that computers can be highly addictive. Once you start using a website, your usage can quickly escalate from once a day to twice a day, and it can seem as if the computer has become an extension of yourself, making it difficult to disengage. Allowing oneself to chat online can also be perilous. Young females and males may find it exciting to chat with someone from a different state or city, but in reality, it is extremely dangerous. Online chatting is fraught with risk because the person you are communicating with could have a criminal history, such as murder, kidnapping, or being wanted by the authorities. We often have no way of knowing because on chat lines, users can provide false names, upload fake pictures, and provide inaccurate ages. This is why, in some cases, people go missing because they fail to exercise caution before engaging in online conversations. Another reason why excessive computer use can be detrimental is that it can serve as a major distraction from one's family. Instead of sitting down and inquiring about your family members' days, you may be in a hurry to log on to the computer. Computers can also have a negative impact on your test and quiz scores. You may spend hours on the computer when you should be studying for an important exam the next day. When you fail, you have no one to blame but yourself due to your addiction to computer usage. In conclusion, @PERCENT1 of people have been affected by computers, and this is not a positive development. You may miss a day of work or feel tired and exhausted because all your energy is being wasted. It is advisable to stay off computers unless they are being used for educational purposes.
373	375	1	1	I do not concur with the idea that people should spend excessive time on the computer, and I will explain the reasons. My first reason is that if you are a @NUM1 - year - old man, you will not be able to spend quality time with your children, and you may also develop eye problems. Hence, you should not spend too much time on the computer. My second reason is that you may encounter problems with your wife if she discovers that you are chatting with another woman online. Many people find it unacceptable for their spouses to interact with other women in such a manner. My third reason is that if you are a child like me, you will not have a fulfilling childhood. You will miss out on having fun and making friends because the allure of the computer will prevent you from spending time with your family and playing with your little sister outdoors. Therefore, you should limit your computer usage.
374	376	1	1	@ORGANIZATION2. My name is @PERSON1, and I am @NUM1 years old. I attend @ORGANIZATION1. I am going to discuss the view of experts who claim that computers are having an impact on society. However, proponents of technology believe that computers have a positive influence on people. An increasing number of people are using computers, but not everyone agrees that this is beneficial to society. Some people argue that computers benefit society. In fact, computers not only enable people to acquire more knowledge but also allow them to communicate with others online if they do not have a cell phone. Additionally, one can research vacation destinations and visualize what they look like. Computers are one of the most remarkable inventions, but they can be a challenge for some people. Those who do not have access to a computer may find it difficult to search for directions and vacation spots, suggesting that computers do not benefit everyone in society. Supporters of technological advancements believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals. A computer is extremely important in my life. If I am falling behind in some classes, I can conduct research and study at home. I lost my cell phone, but now I can chat with my friends online. When my parents do not want to take me shopping, I can shop online, which makes it easier to find what I need. People can learn a great deal from computers. Computers have truly transformed the world. You can explore the Earth, space, cities, and stay informed about what is happening on the internet. Computers do not have a negative impact on society; instead, they make life more convenient. They provide people with the opportunity to learn about distant places and individuals and even allow for online communication. I knew nothing about @LOCATION1 except that it was hot, but after researching it, I found that it is like a cool park with many interesting things to do. So, I decided to go there on vacation, and it lived up to my expectations. The internet is an excellent platform for staying in touch with friends and family. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on computers instead of exercising. While it is true that some people spend a significant amount of time on computers, they still engage in physical activity when they go out with their families, play sports, or walk while shopping. I spend @NUM2 on the computer, but I still play basketball from morning to afternoon because I value my health. As you can see, experts may think that computers are having a negative impact on us, but in reality, they make it easier to find directions, plan wonderful vacations, and assist us in our studies for @ORGANIZATION1. We can also apply for jobs and @ORGANIZATION1 online. Computers are truly beneficial to us.
375	377	1	1	Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Can you envision life without your computer? If not, then that is precisely what I aim to change. Millions of individuals spend countless hours with their eyes fixed on @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, and various monitor screens. Spending such an excessive amount of time sitting in one place is not conducive to health. Not only do people fail to get sufficient exercise, but they also miss out on the opportunity to appreciate the ever - changing natural world around them. Teens and even young children become immersed in the cyberworld and do not utilize their after - school time effectively for studying or completing homework. Moreover, the increasing use of computers exacerbates the problem of the internet being a dangerous place. Firstly, the obesity rate in @LOCATION1 is rising at an alarming rate. A recent study conducted by the @LOCATION2 government reveals that @NUM1 people are overweight, and @NUM2 are on the verge of obesity. We could potentially reduce the obesity rate and lead healthier, happier lives by engaging in more physical activity and spending more time outdoors. Spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only heighten your risk of becoming overweight. Secondly, the more time you spend confined indoors, the less time you have to enjoy nature. The natural world is in a constant state of flux, and you will miss out on numerous incredible opportunities if you rarely step outside your front door. Excessive computer use will cause your computer to wear out more quickly than normal. When you replace your old computer with a new @ORGANIZATION2, where does the old one go? To a landfill! The more you use your computer, the sooner you will discard it. If every @CAPS5 were to dispose of one computer a year, there would be over @NUM3 million discarded Dell, Gateway, and Mac computers. We would essentially be living in a sea of trash. Excessive computer use not only ruins the environment but also poses a threat to your health! So, what are you waiting for? Go for a run outside! Ride a bike! Give your computer a break. Finally, the growing use of computers increases the number of internet predators, and the likelihood that you or your child could be targeted skyrockets. As more and more children use the computer each day, the level of internet safety decreases. Not only can these children be exposed to inappropriate videos on YouTube or engage in cyberbullying on @CAPS6, but they may also unknowingly disclose personal information to strangers on MySpace and Facebook. @PERCENT1 of kidnappings are potentially linked to information found on the computer. Do you want such a thing to happen to you or your family? I doubt it. Get up from your comfortable computer chair and take a walk. Limit your internet and computer use, as it only causes harm and offers no real benefits. Thank you for reading, and do not support the rapid advancement of computer technology.
376	378	1	1	I firmly believe that computers wield a profound influence on individuals. People across the globe utilize computers to engage in online conversations with others, enabling them to gain insights into distant individuals and locations, and facilitating exploration of the internet. Computers exert a substantial impact on our lifestyle. They empower people from around the world to interact with friends and family. Several websites that facilitate such interactions are MySpace, Facebook, and @ORGANIZATION1. On Facebook, one can capture a self - portrait and post it on their web page, which is remarkably straightforward. Additionally, on @ORGANIZATION1, users can chat with their closest friends and even observe their activities, though this requires a webcam. I have an account on @ORGANIZATION1 and consider it an excellent resource. I have relatives in @LOCATION1 whom I only get to see once a year. However, with the assistance of my computer, I can maintain interaction with them throughout the year.  Computers enable individuals from far - flung places to learn about the culture and lifestyle of others. Have you ever witnessed the commercial where a young boy is conversing with his father on the computer? In this commercial, the boy is lying down and consuming an @CAPS1 cookie while chatting with his father, who is doing the same. Simultaneously, both the father and son dip their cookies into a glass of milk, consume them, and share a laugh. I perceived that moment as truly wonderful because, despite being in opposite locations, they were having a great time. It was all made possible by a single computer.  Exploring the internet is another feat that computers can achieve. On a rainy day when one is bored, they can play some highly entertaining games. One can also look up the details of one's favorite basketball games, such as the number of points @PERSON1 scored for their fantasy team. Moreover, at my school, students can check their grades to ascertain their performance on the last math test or quiz. For instance, if I had all A's except for a @CAPS2 in math, I would know that I need to devote significant study time to the next test to secure an A. With the aid of the internet, I can accomplish these tasks.  So, now you understand why computers are an integral part of our society. They allow us to communicate online with others, provide people with the opportunity to learn about distant individuals and places, and enable everyone to explore the internet. As is evident, computers have a great influence on our lifestyle.
377	379	1	1	"@CAPS1 - that resembled the illumination of a light bulb in your mind, signifying that you've acquired new knowledge! Hooray! In the absence of computers, one would be confined to perusing those tedious textbooks. Computers exert a positive influence on people as they impart a wealth of valuable information, can respond to your queries within @NUM1 seconds, and offer global communication capabilities.  Envision a scenario where you need to determine the identity of the third president of the @CAPS2.S. Will you opt to use the computer and conserve a substantial amount of time, or will you trudge over to those arduous books? Consider this: the capital of @LOCATION2 is @LOCATION1, the constitution of the @ORGANIZATION1 stipulates that a person possesses certain rights, and @PERSON1, one of @CAPS3's most prominent figures, was assassinated in his vehicle. Had it not been for the internet, I would have remained oblivious to these facts.  @PERSON2, a technology major at @CAPS4, recently stated that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 websites on the internet serve educational purposes. He remarked, ""The internet constitutes a significant portion of education. Without computers, our current knowledge would be severely limited."" The internet is brimming with knowledge, highly useful, and inundates users with a vast amount of information.  Lila, another technology major, reported, ""@PERCENT1 of people communicate via computers, @PERCENT2 through phones, and @PERCENT3 through mail."" @NUM4 out of @NUM5 individuals over the age of nine possess an email account. An astonishing volume of emails is dispatched daily. Can you fathom a world without computers? Reflect on the statistics you've just encountered; aren't they remarkable?  Computers have a beneficial impact on people because they disseminate a large quantity of valuable information, can address your questions promptly, and facilitate global communication. If you take a step back and reflect, you'll recognize the true value of computers to you."
378	380	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, an increasing number of individuals are becoming engrossed in computers. I am here to assert that computers are not the optimal means of benefiting our society. Firstly, a significant number of @CAPS1 are allocating less time to interactions with friends and family and more time fixated on computer screens. Moreover, it would be far more advantageous for our physical and mental well - being to venture outdoors and appreciate nature. Lastly, one can develop an addiction to computers. Here are my justifications for why computers do not contribute positively to our society.  My initial reason pertains to the neglect of friends and family. A growing number of people are forsaking quality time with their loved ones in pursuit of advancing to the next level in '@CAPS2 wars.' Is this truly the environment in which we desire future generations to grow up, blankly staring at computer screens? I certainly do not wish for such an outcome. I speak from personal experience. During my childhood, I visited my cousin @PERSON1. All I would receive was a brief '@CAPS4' greeting before he retreated to his room to continue his frenzied computer clicking. The point is that one cannot substitute human relationships with a computer screen; it is morally wrong.  My subsequent argument against computers concerns our physical and mental health. Nature offers the optimal approach to nurturing these aspects. Regrettably, due to computers, most @CAPS1 are not engaging in sufficient outdoor exercise. In fact, nearly @NUM1 @CAPS1 claim to spend more time on the computer than anywhere else. This is not a prudent way to spend one's time. We must address this issue before more @CAPS1 abandon nature for computers. The fresh air, trees, and birds are far more appealing than a screen, a few clicks, and the hum of a machine.  My third and final reason revolves around addiction. A large number of people are becoming addicted to the content they discover on their computers. Addiction is a very serious matter that demands our attention. All of this also points to a growing laziness resulting from a lack of interest in other activities. I have personal experience of this. When my brother first obtained his computer, he literally secluded himself in his room for days. For almost a week, all he did was socialize and strive to beat his personal best score in a game. This is not the appropriate way to use a device.  So, as is evident, computers do not have a positive impact on our society. Firstly, computers are supplanting family and friends. Secondly, nature is gradually losing its significance in the face of computer usage. Finally, computer addiction is becoming a global phenomenon. Thank you for carefully considering all the arguments I have presented. I am aware that computers significantly assist people in maintaining global connections, but there are alternative methods, such as mail.
379	381	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1's computers confer substantial benefits upon society. They aid us in acquiring knowledge about distant locales, assist us with our academic endeavors, and enable us to communicate with others online. We are in need of computers.  Computers enable us to learn about other countries, people, @CAPS1, and so forth. How else would we gain knowledge about places we might wish to visit on vacation? Or how would we learn about the places we desire to explore and those we should avoid? Computers are indispensable for this purpose. There are some countries that we would remain unaware of without the use of computers.  Next, computers simplify our schoolwork. Often, we are assigned projects, most of which involve research. Computers make this process significantly easier. Instead of carrying heavy textbooks back and forth between school and home, we can utilize online textbooks. Why subject ourselves to unnecessary extra work? It is a waste of everyone's time. Instead of squandering minutes on phone calls, we can engage in online chats. Wasting minutes equates to wasting money. Who would choose to do that? Moreover, using the keyboard to chat with friends will prove beneficial in the future. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students state that they prefer online communication over making phone calls. Computers offer easy access to information, making them far more effective than textbooks in assisting with schoolwork.  Lastly, computers facilitate online communication with others. Without computers, our lives would be considerably more challenging. In conclusion, computers are an essential part of our society as they offer multiple benefits in learning, education, and communication.
380	382	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1's benefit society imensely. They help us learn about far away places, they help us with our school work and the let us communicate with other people online. We need computers. Computers allow us to learn about other countries, people, @CAPS1 etc... How would we learn about places we might want to go on vacation? Or how would we learn about the places we want to see, and the places we want to stay away from? We need computers to do this. We would never even know of some countries if it werent for computers. Next computers help us with our school work. Sometimes we get project spend most of them involve research! Computers make this a whole lot easier on us. Also instead of lugging your text books from school to home and back, we can use online textbooks. Why give us extra work, it's a waste of everyones time. Instead of wasting your minutes talking on a phone, you can chat online. Wasting minutes is wasting money. Who wants to do that? Besides using the keyboard to chat with friends will help you in the future. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 studens, say they prefer to talk online then to call someone. Computers benefit us by easy aces to info. Computers are a lot easier to help us with school work, than textbooks are. Lastly computers let us talk to other people online. Without computers everything would be so much harder.
381	383	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you opine that computers offer beneficial effects on individuals? I am certain that I concur with you. Computers are advantageous for multiple reasons: Firstly, individuals can acquire knowledge about distant locations; Secondly, they can engage in conversations with others and gain insights into diverse cultures; Thirdly, they can enhance hand - eye coordination. To begin with, if you are planning a trip, you would want to learn about your destination. Computers can be of great assistance in this regard. Moreover, if you are seeking suitable hotels, you can utilize the computer for this purpose. If you require transportation, simply log on to Google and input your query. Now, if you are working on a school project or researching a different part of the world, you can log on to your Skype, Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or any other relevant website. You can achieve numerous things while interacting with friends online, such as obtaining school assignments, learning about due dates, scheduling meetings, and many other remarkable things. Hand - eye coordination is highly significant. Computers can contribute to its development. Drivers need excellent hand - eye coordination; otherwise, they may face substantial insurance costs. If one lacks good hand - eye coordination, they will encounter difficulties in numerous aspects. Hence, this is why computers are valuable assets in our society. You can learn about your travel destinations, complete necessary tasks, and even become a more proficient driver.
382	384	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you consider that computers are advantageous in furnishing us with valuable information? I concur with you, @CAPS2. This is merely one of the reasons for my endorsement of computer usage. The reasons are as follows: They supply us with learning materials, facilitate communication with others, and offer entertainment. Nevertheless, I comprehend why someone might oppose this. Allow me to elucidate my perspective. Whenever I need to acquire knowledge about something unknown to me, I turn to my computer for research. Numerous search engines, such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3, and @LOCATION1, enable us to input a question or phrase and provide links to other websites containing information on the topic we aim to explore. Another way computers aid our learning is by allowing us to download and install software that assists in activities like learning a foreign language or practicing mathematics. For instance, my grandfather desired to learn to speak @CAPS4 but lacked the time to attend classes. Thus, he ordered a program that teaches @CAPS4 while he is at home. Another rationale for my belief in the benefits of computers to society is their ability to facilitate communication. One method is through social platforms where you have a profile and can ""chat"" with friends by typing your messages. Another approach is video chat, which enables you to see and converse with others via a webcam. I deem this highly important as @PERCENT1 of people assume that computers lead to social isolation. It also helps you reconnect with old school friends and distant relatives. This can actually enhance the social skills of shy individuals. Do you enjoy music, movies, etc.? You can access them through your computer. This is yet another way computers can benefit us. If you are traveling and anticipate your children getting bored, all you need to do (if you have a laptop) is play a movie for them. Another form of entertainment provided by computers is music playback. If you have an iPod or @NUM1 player, you can download music from the computer. It also offers entertainment for video - game enthusiasts. There is entertainment for everyone. Although I support computer usage, I am aware of their negative impacts on many people. Some of these include reduced physical activity leading to obesity, decreased social interaction, and less time spent outdoors. In conclusion, I believe that computers can bring benefits to our society. The reasons are: they offer information, enable communication, and provide entertainment."
383	385	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, computers exert a positive influence on individuals as they cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow people with the capacity to learn about remote places and individuals, and enable online communication. The invention of computers stands as the most pivotal event of the @DATE1. @PERSON1, a professor at @ORGANIZATION3, asserts that ""the invention of computers has spurred hundreds, even thousands, of novel discoveries. Just this week, @CAPS3 have uncovered @NUM1 new drugs that could potentially eradicate cancer."" A report in @ORGANIZATION1 indicated that @PERCENT1 of Fortune @NUM2 companies are solely operated by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also reported that the remaining @PERCENT2 of Fortune @NUM2 companies intend to transition to computer - based operations by the end of @DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to collaborate with peers on school projects. Computers generally simplify life and can assist in overcoming all life's challenges. Firstly, computers teach hand - eye coordination and can enhance reflexes and reaction time. Computer - based video games can prepare you for real - life tasks and challenges by improving your physical capabilities. A multitude of flight simulators and driving simulators are available in the consumer market. In contemporary times, flight schools mandate their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulations. Some driving schools even require students to learn driving in a simulator before taking to the road. Other games, such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, demand quick thinking and can improve reflexes. This @CAPS2 game requires you to dodge bricks and can significantly enhance reaction time as well. All the programs accessible via the computer can help you surmount real - life obstacles and stimulate creative thinking. Secondly, computers enable you to learn about remote places and people. This is particularly fascinating as you can explore a country's culture without physically visiting it. This opportunity allows you to immerse yourself in diverse cultures and religions, making it easier to relate to people in far - off lands. @CAPS4 once stated, ""@CAPS3 fear only what is different from us; therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" @CAPS4 meant that if @CAPS3 are knowledgeable about people and places different from us, @CAPS3 need not fear anything. Computers allow us to observe people worldwide and learn about them. Exposure to different things enriches our lives and can make us better individuals. Lastly, the invention of computers enables us to communicate with people globally. With the advent of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can communicate with friends who have moved away. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that among its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million have friends residing in different countries. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 moved to @LOCATION1. We missed each other until I turned @NUM7 and @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. One day, we were both online, and I searched for his name to check if he had an account. He did, and we immediately began weekly video chats. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends and reconnect with old ones. In summary, the advent of computers has brought about substantial improvements in society as a whole. Individuals can converse with friends in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businesspeople can conduct meetings via programs like @CAPS8. Government officials can communicate with leaders from around the world. Despite some who believe that the advent of computers has affected communication, I believe it is an effective tool that everyone should have access to."
384	386	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals. I hold this view because we can communicate with people in different countries within a fraction of a second, send emails to others, and pose a question on @LOCATION1 and receive an immediate response. Firstly, we can engage in conversations with individuals in distant countries. Have you ever had a relative go on vacation to a foreign country, and they left their cell phones behind? In such a scenario, the only means of contacting them is via email. Even if you are simply staying in touch, email can be a reliable option. You can even use a computer for video chatting, eliminating the need to wait for a response. Secondly, we can send emails to others. Have you ever sent a letter by post and had to wait two to three days for a reply? Sometimes, the letter gets lost, and there is no way to trace it. However, with email, the waiting time for a reply depends on the typing speed of the recipient, and most people I know can type a response within @NUM1 to @NUM2 seconds. I consider this a significant improvement compared to the traditional mail system. There is an 83% chance that your email will reach its destination. If, for some reason, it gets lost, you will receive a notification informing you to resend the message. But in most cases, your message will be successfully delivered. Thirdly, we can visit @LOCATION1, pose a question, and obtain an instant answer. Have you ever been on the verge of recalling something but just couldn't? In such situations, it would be wise to visit @LOCATION1. You can ask any question, ranging from the price of an item in @LOCATION2 to the meaning of a term. You can even ask math questions, such as the square root of pi or the value of @NUM3. From @LOCATION1 to MySpace, the internet is replete with information that can positively influence people. This is why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people, as they enable us to communicate with people in different countries, send emails, and seek answers to various questions.
385	387	1	1	Dear Editor @CAPS1, are you aware that @PERCENT1 of children who spend the majority of their time on computers and are physically inactive may develop weight issues and blood disorders? This is just one of the ways in which advancements in computer technology have affected people. If these advancements continue, this number will rise, and other problems may emerge. Some of the existing problems that could worsen include the development of a weak immune system and emotional detachment from family members. Firstly, let's discuss obesity. Witnessing someone endure obesity due to something as seemingly trivial as computer addiction is truly disheartening. Obesity not only restricts the proper functioning of vital organs but can also lead to blood disorders. Blood disorders, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, can trigger heart attacks, cutting off oxygen supply to vital parts of the body and ultimately leading to death. Dealing with obesity is already challenging, but seeing someone suffer from a weak immune system is even more distressing. In my experience, people who frequently use computers generally have poor immune systems. For example, a friend of mine, who spends a significant amount of time on the computer, has developed a weak immune system. As a result, he misses at least @NUM1 day of school per week. Due to his frequent absences, he usually maintains poor grades. This is yet another reason why advancements in computer technology are a bad idea. Isn't it quite evident that technological advancements are detrimental? Especially considering that children are increasingly becoming obese, and the development of a weak immune system can have controllable impacts on one's life. Therefore, I earnestly urge you to write an article about this to address the growing health problems associated with technology.
386	388	1	1	Almost everyone is affected by computers in some manner. Some individuals opine that computers are detrimental as certain people squander excessive time on them. However, computers assist us in our daily lives. If we wish to communicate with individuals from across the globe and send donations to places in need, such as @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1, we can utilize computers to achieve this. We can transform the lives of people in third - world countries with the aid of computers. Computers can also be of great help in school. When a student has to compose a report and has poor handwriting, they can simply type it and print it. Or if a student has to conduct research for an essay, they can readily find the information on the computer. Perhaps a child forgets their homework; they can visit their school website and locate it. My final point is that computers are an enormous asset to businesses. When files are lost or mislaid, the worker(s) can use the computer to retrieve the backup file. When they need to order supplies, most often they will visit a website and place an online order. Or when updates are posted regarding upcoming events in the company, an email is sent and can be accessed using a computer. Many people believe that people overuse their computers, but that is the user's fault, not ours. We should determine how long we use a computer. Many jobs would be unfeasible without computers. It's not about overusing them; it's about proper usage. Overall, I assert that computers are beneficial and highly useful when employed correctly.
387	389	1	1	Dear newspaper, I have perused your article concerning people's opinions on the effects of computers. I firmly believe that possessing computers is an extremely advantageous thing. With them, we can communicate with others from afar rapidly. One can also acquire a great deal of knowledge. It also fosters hand - eye coordination. My primary reason for their being beneficial is that one can interact with others. Without computers, it would be nearly impossible to encounter people from distant locations and converse with them so effortlessly. They even come equipped with webcams, enabling us to see each other. One can utilize @CAPS1, @CAPS2, webcams, or even a simple comment on Facebook or MySpace. @CAPS2 or webcams are the quickest and perhaps the most exciting way. Secondly, one can learn. Computers host numerous websites that offer a vast amount of up - to - date information. It is far easier to access the internet, type in a query, than to rummage through a multitude of books. The internet provides dictionaries, news stations, weather forecasts, historical data, and locations of various things. With all this, one doesn't even require books. They even have maps and one can print out directions. My final reason is that it teaches hand - eye coordination. When one initially begins using computers, they are typically quite young and may not type very swiftly. Computers have advanced to the point where there are even touch - screen and wireless mice. So when one starts, they usually look down to see what they are typing. Later, adults encourage them to look at the screen. When that becomes effortless, one knows that their hand - eye coordination has improved significantly compared to when they started. In conclusion, I hold the view that computers are an integral part of daily life and are not detrimental. They facilitate easy communication between people, aid in learning, and cultivate good and rapid hand - eye coordination in children.
388	390	1	1	I contend that computers indeed confer benefits upon us. They enable us to engage with people, converse with distant family members, assist us in our studies, provide us with facile access to information, and much more. People often have family and friends residing apart from one another, and the computer allows us to interact with them. The computer enables us to send emails and instant messages, play games against them, and befriend them on websites like Facebook, allowing us to view their recent pictures. It is arduous to interact with family and friends who live far away, and the internet empowers us to do so. The computer not only allows us to communicate with family and friends but also enables us to meet new people and interact with individuals from all corners of the world. It allows us to forge new friendships, play games, and chat. The computer truly helps us maintain contact with others, and it is a highly convenient means of doing so. The next aspect in which the computer aids us is in providing entertainment. Children are often hyperactive, and after completing their homework, they have nothing to do. The computer allows them to play games, chat with friends, watch movies and videos, upload pictures, etc. It offers a great deal to us. Kids could hang out after school, but if they can use the computer, they are inclined to go home, where their parents know they are safe and away from drugs, alcohol, and other perils. Just because kids like the computer doesn't mean it's their sole activity. Kids are very athletic, constantly participating in sports and being hyperactive, but the computer provides a respite. They spend hours at school, then attend basketball or football practice; sometimes, they just need a break. The computer isn't always a source of fun but is highly useful. The computer assists us in our studies. It allows us to type essays and projects. It also provides us with easy access to information to aid in writing essays. Websites like Google and Bing are convenient platforms to obtain accurate information on any topic. The computer is extremely useful when it comes to schoolwork. As is evident, the computer is of great significance in our lives, making it much easier. It is your choice how much time you spend using it. But regardless, the computer definitely benefits us.
389	391	1	1	"People ought to utilize computers as they confer benefits upon society. An increasing number of individuals are using them as of @DATE1 and concur that these virtual portals of information and communication are extremely advantageous. Consider this: paper is derived from trees, and of course, to obtain paper, trees must first be felled and then undergo a wasteful process. If everyone used computers, we would not have to cut down those lush and beautiful trees. Moreover, have you ever needed to obtain information rapidly? Instead of perusing a book and potentially spending hours searching, finding information on the internet would be far quicker! Ultimately, in the future, everything will eventually be operated by computers; they are the past, present, and future! They will never become obsolete! Computers are extremely helpful, offering endless information. Many people as of @DATE1 are highly sensitive about our environment and how we are treating the Earth. They are seeking new ways to make the world as environmentally friendly as possible. An easy alternative to paper is the computer. Once, for a school assignment, I was tasked with writing a paper; I effortlessly looked up the information on the computer, typed it up, and sent it to my teacher via email. Not a single piece of paper was used! I understand that computers consume a significant amount of energy, but in truth, they need not. Many people around the world use solar panels to harness energy from the sun to power their lights, computers, etc.! The use of computers is extremely eco - friendly and, as I mentioned earlier, is an excellent alternative to our daily wasteful use of paper and pencil. Do you want to look up information quickly? On the computer, you can! All you need to do is type what you need into a search engine, and @CAPS1! You have the information you require! Instead of using a book (which depletes trees) to slowly find your information, you can use a simple computer to do the job. A poll was conducted and reveals that @PERCENT1 of students at @CAPS2 @CAPS3 school who use the computer to look up information obtain faster and more accurate results! Do you prefer that or slow information found in a boring book? The future is not distant. It is already @DATE2, and we are using the computer for numerous purposes. Admittedly, the computer can cause distractions and headaches if used for extended periods, but it is a remarkable invention of the future. Instead of going to a restaurant and ordering from a menu, we will order from computers/touch screens. More and more people are developing better and faster computers. Everyone is using computers and loves them, and they will definitely be used in the future. I hope you recognize how remarkable computers can be. They are environmentally useful and an excellent alternative to paper, they help you find the information you need quickly, and Professor Grant states, ""I do all my work on the computer; without it, I would be lost."" And finally, they are the future of our world! They are the past, present, and future of the technological world."
390	392	1	1	Numerous individuals have a fondness for computers and utilize them for a variety of reasons. Some people employ them to pursue online education. Others use them to communicate with family and friends who are geographically distant. Additionally, students utilize them to conduct research for school. These are the reasons why computers can be considered excellent devices. There are many people who now have the opportunity to obtain an online education due to certain limitations. For example, individuals who are unable to walk and prefer not to attend traditional schools. Computers can help them find websites where they can receive a free education. The computer can assess their level, similar to a regular teacher. It makes it significantly easier and more convenient for those who lack the ability to walk; they can even prepare for exams on the computer. This is one reason why many people use computers. Many families use computers to search for friends they haven't seen in a long time or family members who are far away. They contact them by chatting on websites. They also search for addresses and phone numbers. Many people are able to locate their family through the internet. They arrange meetings or even visit each other's homes. The computer makes their dreams come true by helping them find their families. This would be an exhilarating event for them, which is why they need computers. This is a very important reason why students use computers to research projects. Without computers, students would be unable to access the information they need. The computer can educate students about historical figures they were unaware of or never had the chance to meet. It can inspire them to learn more about fascinating history. Children need computers to enhance their intelligence. These are some of the reasons why I believe we all need computers. We need them for individuals with mobility issues, for those with family and friends far away, and for students who wish to expand their knowledge. These are all activities that people enjoy doing on a computer. If there were no computers, it would shatter everyone's dreams and futures. So, these are some of the reasons why many people choose to use computers.
391	393	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, as technology advances significantly and more inventions emerge, are you not concerned that people spend excessive time on technology? I am aware that @CAPS1 is worried. Take computers, for example. Computers possess the technology to access the internet and converse with diverse individuals worldwide. This is when my concern arises. In this essay, I will elucidate why it is detrimental to spend an inordinate amount of time on computers. It is harmful because people neglect to exercise, fail to appreciate nature, and cease interacting with family and friends. Firstly, people are forgetting the importance of exercise. It is crucial as it maintains physical fitness and health. With the prevalence of computer use, people become less fit and healthy. They start to gain weight, their blood pressure rises, and they experience more stress. Secondly, they do not appreciate nature. When people begin using computers, they discontinue numerous activities. For instance, they stop going outdoors to breathe fresh air. They become confined in a small bubble, and all they care about is the computer. They do not go camping or play outside; they do nothing. They are on the computer every day. Finally, a significant problem is that they stop interacting with family and friends. When parents are using the computer, they do not pay attention to their children and are constantly engrossed in it. When teenagers are on the computer, they do not communicate with their parents, ignore their friends, and those who care about them the most. They only care about themselves. @CAPS2, there you have it; that is why I believe we should reduce computer usage. For the following reasons: People stop exercising and maintaining fitness. They stop appreciating nature, and they stop interacting with family and friends. @CAPS2, what is your opinion?
392	394	1	1	I opine that computers are a valuable asset as the majority are portable, offer entertainment, and facilitate extensive research. Laptops are mobile computers. They are highly convenient to own. One can carry them anywhere desired. Many individuals possess laptops either at home or with them. They are enjoyable because one can engage in various games during leisure time. Additionally, one can create videos. Last but not least, one can simply relish the experience. One can conduct comprehensive research on them. The internet is a highly successful innovation. This implies that it can be utilized for academic assistance when needed. Moreover, one can type essays required for work or school. I believe that computers are beneficial to have because most are portable, offer entertainment, and enable extensive research.
393	395	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that individuals should prioritize exercise over computer usage. Computers are among the primary factors contributing to our nation's high obesity rate, along with junk food such as McDonald's. I am an avid fan of computers myself, but I do not wish to neglect my physical health. I retire to bed at @NUM1. I typically spend one or two hours on the computer, depending on whether I am working on a project. Furthermore, reducing computer usage can enhance the quality of life. Instead of remaining indoors, one can venture outside to participate in sports such as football, socialize with friends, or have a gathering with family. Engage in activities other than computer use. In conclusion, if people limit their computer usage to an hour and a half, the obesity rate will decline. It can also contribute to environmental conservation by reducing energy consumption.
394	396	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I contend that it is acceptable for people worldwide to utilize computers. The rationale behind my stance is that numerous individuals employ computers for a multitude of purposes. People across the globe utilize computers for significant matters, in emergency situations, and more. As students in @ORGANIZATION1, we use computers to access social media platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, and chat rooms to communicate with our friends or even interact with individuals from around the world. We also use them to converse with family members residing in distant locations. Many of us visit MySpace to communicate with friends, family, strangers, individuals from all corners of the world, and those we have not seen in years. However, it is important to note that some individuals use computers to engage in illegal activities such as drug trafficking, which is extremely detrimental to our society. This is one of the reasons why people can become so dependent and addicted to their computers, as criminals and drug dealers conduct illegal transactions online. As far as I am aware, many people engage in such activities online, while those offline would not. I know this because they are my friends. They are intelligent and would not engage in such illegal behavior. I reiterate to my local newspaper that it is acceptable for people worldwide to use computers, laptops, or any device with internet connectivity. However, it is up to criminals and drug dealers to decide whether they wish to continue their illegal activities, as they will eventually be apprehended and face legal consequences. Computers are intended for entertainment and useful purposes, not for illegal activities such as drug trafficking.
395	397	1	1	"Nowadays, the technological industries are dominating modern society and captivating users, leading to virtual addiction. What benefit does this bring? Those immersed in the online world are less sociable and exhibit more signs of depression, as recent studies have shown. Additionally, spending excessive time sitting in front of a computer prevents calorie burning, resulting in unnecessary weight gain that could easily be avoided. Visiting the library is equally, if not more, beneficial than using the internet. Lastly, have you considered the detrimental effects, such as trojans, cyberbullying, and violence? In other words, computers are a waste of money. Families are becoming increasingly disconnected, and who is to blame? It is that technological device on your desk. Instead of socializing and spending time with loved ones, computer addicts choose to sit idly, chatting and gaming. They are tearing families apart. ""@CAPS1,"" a @LOCATION1 resident remarked about her two teenage children's computer addiction. ""I swear they're on that thing for hours on end,"" she claimed. In an article I read recently, it stated that most people suffering from depression admitted to spending at least @NUM1 hours online per day. What does this indicate? Computers are being misused. Remove them from your child's life or, at the very least, limit their usage. Studies prove that @PERCENT1 of individuals who spend the majority of their day surfing the web are either overweight or on the verge of becoming so. Instead of experiencing the real world firsthand, they rely on online information and the opinions of others. Does this matter to you? Overweight individuals are at a higher risk of premature aging and may develop various health problems. All because they choose not to engage in physical activity. In a library environment, people tend to be more focused. You may wonder why, and the answer is simple: the internet is too distracting and expensive. In the library, you are less likely to get into trouble, play online games, or view inappropriate content. Libraries offer more reliable sources and credible information for study. Moreover, you can visit the library with family or friends or receive tutoring. Computers do not provide such benefits. Going to the library is a far superior option. I must admit that I was once a computer addict, and I can attest to the detrimental effects it has on people. Now that I have overcome this addiction, I can honestly say that the allure of computers is strong. However, I also know firsthand the rewards of a computer - free life. I am more sociable, better able to handle issues, and in the best shape of my life. I even made the school's cheer team. I often visit the library to study, and I am proud of the person I have become. I used to spend around @NUM3 hours online and get little sleep. If I can do it, so can you. My name is @CAPS2, and I am a computer addiction survivor."
396	398	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, when contemplating the technological advancements over the years, one can discern the profound influence they have exerted on the contemporary era and its inhabitants. The query arises: Are these advancements for the betterment of society, or will they take an adverse turn? Today, I shall discuss technology and expound upon why I believe it is detrimentally impacting society. As individuals allocate less time to physical exercise and the appreciation of nature, neglecting their social lives by being incessantly engrossed in computers, they fail to recognize the extent of self - harm. The prevalence of obesity, particularly among children, escalates daily. This is attributable to a dearth of physical activity, as some individuals are preoccupied with responding to texts, engaging in phone conversations, and playing superfluous video games. Not only are they inflicting physical harm upon themselves, but they are also undeniably missing out on the splendid aspects of nature! Why not venture outdoors, breaking free from the technological confinement into which you have all been lured? The @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most aesthetically pleasing countries globally; seize this opportunity! Now, without adequate exercise, you are exposing your heart to grave risks. Even performing minor activities such as jumping jacks or sit - ups can contribute to your physical well - being and cardiac health! Your parents and grandparents are the ones who brought you into this world, stood by you in times of need, and would do anything to safeguard you. What would you say if I informed you that technology is driving them away? Texting during dinner while they attempt to engage in conversation, remaining in your room perpetually due to “entertaining” games, and hiding behind the veil of technology are actions that a multitude of people choose over socializing with those who matter most: family and friends. Although your friends may be more lenient, they still notice that you are too preoccupied with your computer to meet up with them. No individual can exist without friends, and your friends need you! Allocate time for those who hold a special place in your heart before they vanish. In summary, technology is corrupting the minds of humanity, and this trend must cease! As I mentioned, strive for health and happiness, and spend sufficient time with those you cherish. Who knows, perhaps they can bring you greater joy than your electronic companion. So, fellow citizens, rise from your desk chairs, power off your electronic devices, and re - immerse yourselves in the real world.
397	399	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have become aware that some individuals are speculating about the negative impacts of computers on people, yet I dissent from this view. Computers offer substantial assistance to people in educational institutions, workplaces, and domestic settings. The absence of computers would have a more detrimental effect on individuals than their presence. For students, computers are an absolute necessity for conducting research, typing essays, letters, and numerous other written materials, and this holds true for society as a whole. In nearly every school across the country, students utilize computers on a daily basis. Personally, I am required to log onto a computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week, and some @ORGANIZATION1 even more frequently. For instance, my @CAPS1 teacher assigns our class a significant number of essays or letters. She has repeatedly emphasized that if our handwriting is illegible, she will not grade our work. The availability of computers for typing eliminates the issue of unreadable handwriting preventing grading. I acknowledge that some may argue that computers reduce the need for hand - writing, potentially causing people to lose this skill. However, with the advanced technology available on computers, allowing for precise typing, handwriting may soon become obsolete. Any individual can effortlessly conduct research on a computer, regardless of the topic. Teachers assign research projects to students at all grade levels and in various classes. Traditional research methods, such as using books, are slow and inefficient. Accessing a computer to search for information is rapid, straightforward, and yields superior results compared to using books. The same principle applies to the workplace. For example, an individual may need to create a PowerPoint presentation. Not only does the computer have the PowerPoint application, which is an effective tool for project creation, but it also enables the user to conduct research in one place. This simplifies the process of gathering a large amount of information without the need to search for books or consult experts. I recognize that computers can potentially “dominate” people's lives, leading to excessive usage. However, most individuals learn to manage their time effectively. Overall, the retention of computers would confer numerous benefits. Writing essays, letters, typing for projects, and conducting research would be expedited and streamlined.
398	400	1	1	Dear Newspaper Readers, @CAPS1 computers have truly transformed the manner in which people utilize technology, bringing about significant changes to our society. With this device, individuals can access information at a pace unparalleled in history. Moreover, people can communicate with friends, particularly on popular websites. Computers are also extensively employed in educational institutions, especially in colleges. The integration of computers in schools offers substantial advantages for individuals and their educational pursuits, and it has indelibly altered the human race. When my grandparents attended school, they had no concept of what a computer was. Their sources of knowledge were prior learning, guidance from teachers, or dictionaries. We are extremely fortunate today to have computers in our schools, as my grandparents would have greatly appreciated having such a rapid and straightforward tool. @CAPS1 access to a computer can significantly assist people in numerous ways, particularly in expanding their knowledge of the world. When seeking to communicate with others online, where is the first place you would turn? @CAPS2. Remarkably, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have @CAPS2 accounts. The reason for its popularity is that people desire to interact with friends they enjoy conversing with. From my experience, individuals outside of Canada also have @CAPS2 accounts, which is quite astonishing. Communicating with people from different countries is truly remarkable. It presents an opportunity for individuals to forge new friendships. This can also influence people's lifestyles. When teenagers enter high school, they have the option to enroll in specific classes, which can be beneficial. This is particularly relevant in college, where students are required to cover a vast amount of material in a short period. I know individuals who stay up late working on their papers. @CAPS1 these classes offer advantages for daily life, especially in college, as they provide an opportunity for individuals to enhance their typing skills. Computer classes can be instrumental in helping someone learn to type quickly, allowing them to obtain more sleep! In conclusion, I firmly believe that @CAPS1 computers have a positive impact on our society. Thank you for reading this letter, and I hope you will take these points into consideration. @CAPS1 computers have dramatically and permanently changed our lives.
399	401	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 paper editor, we should take action because people are becoming increasingly sedentary, remaining at home and using computers. This is deteriorating their quality of life. We should establish a “computer - free day” when everyone ventures outdoors to engage in physical activity. By exercising more, we can better understand the world around us. The more one exercises, the stronger they become. People are overly reliant on computers as they use them to communicate with friends and play games. However, we must also make time to go outside. Although I sometimes enjoy using the computer, excessive usage has led to a lack of physical activity. I aspire to curtail my computer use and spend more time outdoors. We can still possess computers, but we should limit our usage and allocate more time to outdoor activities. We should restrict children to only two or three hours of computer use per day. Currently, when children use computers, they often exceed this recommended time, which is detrimental to their health. This is precisely why they should go outside.
400	402	1	1	Dear local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers confer excellent benefits upon people. Firstly, they enable family and friends to communicate effectively over long distances. Secondly, typing on a computer enhances hand - eye coordination. Thirdly, computers provide individuals with the opportunity to learn about distant locations. Lastly, they offer students a means to research topics they are studying. Well, @CAPS1, what is your opinion? Researcher @PERSON1 has stated that nearly @PERCENT1 of families live apart from one another. Computers facilitate communication among family members, whether through instant messaging or webcam chats. Moreover, @PERCENT2 of these geographically separated families utilize computers for communication. Regarding hand - eye coordination, some individuals can type without looking, while others are rather slow. Typing on a computer significantly improves this skill. Good hand - eye coordination has numerous applications, such as in sports or even simple tasks like throwing something into the trash. Lastly, have you ever wished to learn about a far - off place or conducted research for school? I certainly have. Computers empower people to gain knowledge about distant locations. For example, in the third grade, I had to research hammerhead sharks. Don't teachers often instruct their students to look up words or topics on the computer? As I have previously mentioned, I am convinced that computers are beneficial to people. I hope that my three points regarding family communication, hand - eye coordination, and research have persuaded you of their advantages. Thank you for taking the time to read what I have to say, and I hope you will consider my perspective.
401	403	1	1	Dear Local @CAPS1, I contend that computers exert a beneficial influence on individuals. There exist numerous ways in which computers can yield positive effects on humans. Firstly, computers foster social cohesion and enable individuals to engage in reciprocal interaction. They facilitate communication among people. Moreover, computers empower individuals to acquire knowledge about novel subjects. The internet harbors an abundance of information. Additionally, computers enable individuals to accomplish tasks that would be otherwise unattainable without their assistance. Hence, computers have a positive impact on people. They allow individuals to interact with one another and bring people together. People can utilize the internet to exchange emails. When one needs to send a letter to someone, it may take days for the recipient to receive it. However, with email, the message is delivered instantaneously upon sending. There are also websites such as Facebook that enable users to communicate with their friends. Such platforms connect people. When one is unable to converse with a friend in person, all they need to do is access their computer. Computers are also equipped with webcams, which allow people to engage in face-to-face communication and observe each other's facial expressions and hear their voices, which is superior to a phone call or letter. This is why computers have a positive effect on people. Furthermore, computers enable individuals to learn about new things at any time. Whenever one wishes to find something out or has a question, they can turn to the internet. If they consult someone else, that person may not possess the answer. Computers allow people to view pictures and videos. If one desires to see a picture of @CAPS2, they can simply access a computer and input the relevant query. Computers enable people to view images that would be inaccessible in real life. Videos offer the opportunity to watch entertaining content that can brighten one's day. If one misses a favorite show, they can find it on the computer. This is why computers benefit people positively. Additionally, computers enable individuals to perform tasks that would be impossible without them. When a teacher assigns a paper, I always complete it on the computer. In the absence of computers, I would have to use a typewriter, and if I made a mistake, I would have to retype the entire document. Computers also allow users to play music. One can insert a CD into the computer, and it will play the music. Computers enable individuals to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be unfeasible. They benefit society and have a positive impact on people. They facilitate interaction among individuals, bring people together, enable learning about new things, and allow for the execution of tasks that would be impossible without them. Computers have numerous positive effects on people, so I hope you concur that they benefit society.
402	404	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I assert that the influence of computers on people is positive. I hold this view because, for instance, when one is in a hurry and uncertain whether they need rain boots, they can simply consult the computer. Moreover, without computers, it would be extremely challenging for most offices to conduct their business. Maintaining records on physical files is a cumbersome task. This is particularly true in schools, where teachers no longer store students' grades in filing cabinets; instead, they rely on computers. Otherwise, they would require an enormous filing cabinet. I can understand why some individuals believe that computers have a detrimental effect on people. They may argue that computers detract from time spent in nature, with friends, and with family. However, many people take their laptops to local parks on warm days, sit under trees, and use the computer there. This is especially common among students, who complete their homework under the foliage to relax. Additionally, for those whose family members or friends reside in other states, if they do not have the recipient's house number or lack the time for a lengthy conversation, they can send an email or use social networking platforms such as Facebook or MySpace to check their profiles and send a quick greeting, like ""@CAPS2, how are you doing?"" Local shop owner @PERSON1 remarks, ""I scarcely have time for myself. So, when I want to say hello to my sister in @LOCATION1, I usually use Facebook because I know she loves to chat."" I recall one morning when I was in a rush before school and had no idea what to wear. I checked the local news website for the weather forecast, and I'm grateful I did. Otherwise, I would have been caught in a downpour without an umbrella. Computers are also useful for keeping up with the news or simply relaxing by playing games. Therefore, if you're wondering about the weather to determine whether it's a good day to sit in the park, catch up on a report with a partner, go ahead. But don't forget to email your partner first, as you've lost their phone number."
403	405	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals surveyed in @LOCATION1 concur that the utilization of computers is advantageous to society. I personally align with these @NUM1 people, believing that computers have a positive impact on individuals. There are several reasons why I believe the use of computers significantly benefits society. Firstly, computers can cultivate good hand - eye coordination. Secondly, they endow people with the ability to learn about distant places and individuals. Lastly, they enable people to communicate online with others. Once again, I firmly believe that computers can have a positive effect on people. To begin with, it is a well - established fact that most sports involve a certain degree of hand - eye coordination. Computers can help individuals, even from a young age, develop this essential skill. When using a computer, one must keep their eyes on the screen while simultaneously operating the mouse or keyboard. This requires a high level of coordination. Consider the fact that proficient typists do not even need to look at the keyboard; they instinctively know the location of each key. Some individuals who oppose my view often claim that excessive computer use leads to insufficient physical exercise. However, I firmly believe this is untrue. The hand - eye coordination acquired through computer use can enhance one's skills and performance in sports. For example, in baseball, a player must watch the ball while moving their arm to catch it, which is where hand - eye coordination proves invaluable. This demonstrates that computers can benefit society by teaching hand - eye coordination. In addition, @PERCENT1 of teachers at @ORGANIZATION2 believe that computers are an excellent tool for facilitating student learning. Computers grant people access to information about far - off places and individuals. They provide access to details about foreign locations and people that may not be readily available through other resources. With a computer, one can visit a search engine, type in the name of any place in the world, and within moments, obtain a wealth of information and pictures. In our technologically advancing society, people can acquire knowledge with just the click of a button. Computers are also an indispensable tool in schools. Teachers can assign projects about different countries or people, and students can easily gather the necessary information on the computer. Computers benefit society by enabling people to learn about diverse locations and individuals. They can pique people's interest in these topics and may even inspire some to visit these far - off places or interact with different people. Finally, @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people surveyed had some form of online communication method, whether it was email or Facebook. Computers allow people to communicate with others online. In our modern society, having friends is crucial, and maintaining connections with them is essential. If friends or family members live far away or if one has not had the opportunity to speak with them in a while, using the computer to stay in touch is an excellent option. Those who disagree with me believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends. I believe the opposite is true. In our modern era, families understand that when a child goes to college, they may move far away or even across the country. Having a computer allows families to communicate easily and stay connected. Online communication is yet another way in which computers benefit society. The time to recognize the benefits of computers is now! Computers can benefit society in multiple ways. They teach hand - eye coordination, which is useful throughout life. Most importantly, they enable people to learn about distant places and individuals. Lastly, they allow people to communicate online with others. We are living in a modern age where society is advancing daily, and computers play a significant role in this progress. They are having a positive impact on people.
404	406	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I respectfully disagree with the notion that computers have an overall positive impact. I believe people should prioritize spending quality time with their families rather than idly sitting in front of a computer. Do you concur with me so far? Firstly, if one squanders all their time on the computer, they will achieve little. I have observed that many children immediately turn to the computer after school, merely wasting their time. For instance, my cousin spends every day on the computer, accomplishing nothing productive. Are you still following my argument? Secondly, children should utilize the computer for studying purposes rather than playing video games or accessing inappropriate websites. More than @NUM1 students and children are often found on the internet playing games and engaging in mundane activities on a daily basis. I have witnessed numerous kids engrossed in computer games. Thirdly, students will never acquire knowledge if they waste their time on the computer. The computer is a tool for learning, yet many students do not use it effectively. A significant number of students should only use the computer occasionally, not every day. I have noticed that a large proportion of students do not learn from the computer because they are not using it for studying. In fact, more than @PERCENT1 of students fail their classes due to excessive computer use. Moreover, people should invest time in their relationships with friends and family, as they are the most important individuals in our lives, not computers. Are you still with me? Friends are invaluable; they care about and love us as if we were family. However, if one squanders their time on the computer, how can they maintain relationships with their friends? For example, my acquaintance is always on the computer and never visits her friends. As a result, her friends rarely come to see her because she shows no interest in them, only in the computer. Do you understand my point? Thirdly, family is also of utmost importance. One should at least spend some time with their family. Many families have stopped spending time together because they prioritize the computer. Lastly, contributing to the community is a worthy goal. It helps to keep our cities clean and orderly. Unfortunately, many people have stopped participating in community service. For example, I have seen trash on the ground, and people seem not to care. Finally, engaging in sports and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is crucial. Playing sports is both enjoyable and beneficial for one's health, yet many people have stopped participating in sports because of the computer. For example, @NUM2 people have given up sports. Additionally, going outdoors is important as it is beneficial for one's well - being.
405	407	1	1	I firmly believe that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow people with the ability to learn about distant places and individuals, and facilitate online communication among people. Given these numerous advantages, it is evident that computers are indispensable. Do you believe that computers have a positive or negative impact? After considering the following points, you may be inclined to agree that computers have a positive effect. Computers offer benefits in various aspects, such as education, work, social interaction, and information acquisition. In the absence of computers, we would likely rely on books for information, but the quantity and accessibility of information would be significantly limited. Without computers, our knowledge would be far more restricted. When using a computer, one exercises both their eyes and hands simultaneously. Typing on the keyboard requires the coordination of visual perception and manual dexterity, which is a clear demonstration of hand - eye coordination. Moreover, computers enable us to learn about places we have never visited. For example, if there has been an earthquake in a particular area, we can access relevant websites to learn about the situation. We can also gather information about potential vacation destinations, gaining insights into what it is like in those places. Additionally, we can learn about famous people we are unfamiliar with by simply searching for them on the computer. Computers serve as a means of communication and help people stay connected. Nowadays, we have platforms such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and others, which allow us to communicate with friends and family. For those whose loved ones live far away, the computer provides a convenient way to stay in touch. In a professional setting, email is commonly used by teachers and colleagues to handle business matters. At school, students can receive assignments and engage in various learning activities through the computer. Furthermore, computers offer entertainment options, such as playing games or exploring virtual nature. I believe that computers are an excellent tool for learning and social interaction. Do you wish for your child to learn and have fun? I invite you to share your thoughts. Undoubtedly, computers have a positive impact.
406	408	1	1	I am convinced that computers exert a detrimental impact on individuals. The utilization of computers encroaches upon a person's time, as they may spend hours engrossed in online games. Moreover, it undermines their health, as they fail to breathe in fresh air or spend quality time with their family. Lastly, it impairs their education, as the time that could be dedicated to homework is squandered on the computer. Firstly, the use of computers disrupts a person's time management. By idly sitting in front of the screen for hours, one forgoes the opportunity to engage in outdoor activities or complete household chores. Instead of assisting family or friends, they are preoccupied with computer games, thus squandering precious time that could have been put to good use. Secondly, computers pose a threat to one's health. Being confined indoors in a room, individuals are deprived of fresh air and physical exercise, which can have a negative impact on their emotional well - being. When glued to the computer, they miss out on social interactions, which may lead to the deterioration of relationships with friends and family. As these connections fade, the reliance on the computer intensifies, exacerbating the problem. My final point is that computers have an adverse effect on education. While one could be diligently working on homework or studying for an important test, they are instead on the computer, learning nothing. This may result in academic failure and potentially ruin one's future. I have personally experienced this, as I once postponed my homework to use the computer, and my grades suffered significantly. In conclusion, these are the reasons why computers have a negative impact on education, health, and time. I understand that one might argue that computers can be used for educational purposes, but humans generally prioritize entertainment over other things. I hope this analysis has helped you recognize the true impact of computers.
407	409	1	1	Esteemed editor of the local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years of age and attend an institution in @LOCATION1 known as @ORGANIZATION1. I consider myself an intellectually gifted child. In my view, the use of computers benefits people. You should continue reading this essay as I will present @NUM2 compelling reasons to support my stance. The first reason is that computers cultivate hand - eye coordination and endow individuals with the ability to explore distant places and unfamiliar people. For instance, when I conduct research on the computer, I am constantly exposed to new knowledge about different locations and individuals. Additionally, according to @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3, @PERCENT1 of the time, people learn about far - off places and people through the internet. The second reason is that computers facilitate online communication. For example, when I log into my Facebook account daily, I have the opportunity to interact with my friends and other individuals online. Furthermore, a search on computers.org reveals that @PERCENT2 of the time, people use computers to communicate with others remotely. The @NUM4 reason is that computers enable students to access information during projects. When I utilize the @ORGANIZATION1 computers, I can gather data, such as information about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina. This is why I believe that the use of computers benefits people. A magazine on computers also indicates that @PERCENT2 of the time, children acquire a substantial amount of information during their projects. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers benefit people because they enhance hand - eye coordination, enable the exploration of distant places and people, facilitate online communication, and provide students with access to information during projects. These are the @NUM2 reasons supporting my view. I earnestly request the local newspaper to convey the credibility of this perspective.
408	410	1	1	"Dear editor, I firmly contend that computers are a prodigious waste of time. Upon returning home from school, children often abandon their schoolwork and immediately immerse themselves in the virtual world of computers. The excessive use of computers not only corrodes the minds of young children but also deters them from engaging with the real world. When there is only one computer in a household without any time restrictions, it can trigger conflicts between siblings or adults. For example, if one sibling has monopolized the computer for an extended period, and the other wishes to use it, a heated argument or even a physical altercation may ensue. Moreover, if someone inadvertently causes damage to the computer by performing unauthorized actions, the person responsible for fixing it may become extremely irate. Parents often encourage their children to ""enjoy a pleasant day outdoors,"" yet many individuals squander the day sitting in front of the computer, accompanied by their favorite snacks. Most people are simply too indolent to rise from their seats, take a stroll outside, or partake in outdoor activities such as playing in the snow. My twin little brothers, who are only @NUM1 @NUM2 years old, are fond of playing shooting games on the computer. They seem to derive pleasure from the virtual act of killing people. I am certain that many boys of their age share the same inclination. However, these games impart no valuable lessons to children. Instead, they teach them how to commit violence, harm animals, or engage in dangerous activities that may cause self - injury. In conclusion, I hope this letter has effectively conveyed the message that computers can cause harm to others and waste one's precious life. Instead of spending quality time with family at the park, people are engrossed in the computer. More often than not, computers have a negative impact on individuals, which is far from desirable."
409	411	1	1	Dear editor of my local newspaper, the proliferation of computer usage has sparked a debate regarding its impact on society. While computers have become ubiquitous, not everyone concurs that they bring about positive change. In fact, these technological devices can be detrimental to users' eyesight, reduce face - to - face interaction, and contribute to an unhealthy lifestyle. First and foremost, computers pose a significant threat to our eyes. Between @DATE1 @DATE2 and @DATE3, medical professionals witnessed a nearly @PERCENT1 surge in eye - related problems that necessitated surgical intervention, the use of glasses, or contact lenses. This alarming increase can be directly attributed to the overuse of personal computers. Studies have shown that individuals who spend more than four hours a day on computers often experience a severe deterioration of their vision by the age of @NUM1. Additionally, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 reported that excessive computer use has had a profoundly negative impact on the eyesight of their employees. Although computers may enhance work efficiency, the cost of medical treatment far outweighs the marginal increase in profit achieved through modernization. Secondly, computers lead to a decline in real - world social interaction. Research indicates that communicating through a screen does not provide the same depth of understanding as face - to - face communication. According to a study by the @ORGANIZATION1, there has been a @PERCENT2 reduction in conversations at social gatherings since @DATE1. This trend is concerning, as it may lead to a world where people struggle to build meaningful relationships, and society becomes overly reliant on electronic communication. Social relations expert @PERSON1 has pointed out that without the ability to sense a person's emotions during a conversation, individuals may develop a lack of empathy and understanding. Even video chat fails to fully convey the emotional nuances present in in - person interactions. Finally, computers contribute to an unhealthy lifestyle. Prolonged periods of sitting indoors in front of a computer deprive individuals of fresh air, which can have a detrimental effect on lung health and lead to premature respiratory problems. Moreover, according to @CAPS4ís @CAPS5, the average person engages in @PERCENT3 fewer workouts, which is likely related to excessive computer use. The obesity rate has skyrocketed from negligible levels to over @NUM2 in the past ten @DATE1. Research has shown that the majority of obese patients spend an inordinate amount of time on their computers. Although other factors may contribute to this trend, computers are undoubtedly a major culprit. In conclusion, personal computers have a detrimental impact on contemporary society. They have resulted in poor eyesight among the general public, reduced social interaction, and forced people into an unhealthy lifestyle. I urge you to spread awareness about the negative effects of computers and strive to create a better world.
410	412	1	1	Respected @CAPS1, I firmly believe that the use of computers is advantageous. They serve as a valuable tool for learning about subjects and places that pique our interest but are otherwise unfamiliar. Additionally, they can contribute to environmental conservation and facilitate societal progress. Firstly, computers are an unparalleled source of knowledge. They allow us to explore any subject at any time. For example, if you are tasked with writing a report on the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2, a simple Google search can provide you with an abundance of information. You can delve into the details of these remarkable entities and expand your understanding. Moreover, you can even explore the history and intricacies of computers themselves. Secondly, computers play a crucial role in environmental protection. The widespread use of paper, which is derived from trees, has a detrimental impact on the environment. Deforestation not only reduces the oxygen supply but also destroys the habitats of countless animals and insects. By promoting the use of computers, we can significantly reduce paper consumption. We can use computers to send documents, attend tax appointments, and complete schoolwork. For instance, teachers can assign homework via email, and students can submit their completed assignments electronically. Although paper may still be necessary for certain tasks, the overall consumption will be substantially reduced. Additionally, computers can help us reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. We can communicate with others via the internet, such as through Skype, thereby minimizing the need for travel and reducing carbon emissions. Thirdly, computers are instrumental in driving societal progress. They can assist us in finding innovative solutions to various challenges, including medical treatments, transportation, and daily life. With the help of computers, we can develop more effective medical treatments for serious conditions such as cancer and the common cold. We can also explore more efficient modes of transportation and even develop revolutionary technologies like teleportation devices. Moreover, computers can help us explore the vast expanse of space and discover new planets and galaxies. In our daily lives, computers can streamline our routines. Imagine waking up in the @TIME1 and being able to access all the necessary information and have your shower, breakfast, and work equipment ready within five minutes. This is the future that computers can offer. In conclusion, these are the numerous reasons why computers are indispensable, from academic research to space exploration and beyond.
411	413	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In @CAPS2's view, computers are remarkable! Thus, I contend that computers exert a profound influence on people's lives. Three rationales to substantiate @CAPS2's stance are that numerous occupations rely on computers, instead of consulting a dictionary or thesaurus, one can simply conduct a search, and it proves highly beneficial at home. @CAPS2's first rationale is that many jobs within the state or nation utilize a computer. Statistically speaking, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 jobs in the state employ a computer or technology related to computer hardware. If one genuinely reflects on it, were one a teacher, a factory worker, etc., one would scarcely be able to perform one's job without it. We have gleaned a great deal from the novel inventions that have emerged in the past decade or two. If we have learned anything in the past @NUM3 years, it would be to ""@CAPS1 the time spent on the computer, but persevere as you will acquire knowledge you previously lacked."" @CAPS2's second rationale is that we possess far more useful search engines than @NUM3 years ago. Around the @NUM5's, if one sought information, the sole recourse was... books. Indeed, I acknowledge that reading is excellent, yet having a computer now is swifter and more convenient. All one needs to do is visit @ORGANIZATION2 and enter what one wishes to find. Then, it appears in approximately @NUM6 seconds with around @NUM7 links to websites to assist one. Just envision, there is no longer a table of contents, merely a link and a click! @CAPS2's third rationale is that it is of great assistance at home. In the state of @LOCATION1, approximately @PERCENT1 of individuals own a laptop or a computer in their residence. Nevertheless, this is not a negative aspect, as it can facilitate numerous tasks. This includes aiding with children, cooking, organizing, and more! Suppose one is unaware of the start time of ""@CAPS3's"" friend's birthday party; there is no need to worry, simply inquire with his mother on @CAPS4! Or if one requires a recipe for dinner, find it on cooks.com. This renders life significantly easier and has an extraordinary impact on one's life! In conclusion, having a computer in one's life is splendid, as so many jobs rely on computers, there are abundant search resources, and it is helpful at home. Hence, computers have an outstanding influence on people's lives!"
412	414	1	1	Dear local newspaper, Do you concur that computers impact people? I firmly believe I concur that computers affect people. I concur with this assertion because individuals fail to adapt to engaging in activities other than remaining on the computer. One illustration is that those who persistently stay on the computer will not derive much enjoyment from interacting with others. They will not relish themselves as much by remaining on the internet. My final example is that doctors sometimes assert that it is not beneficial to remain on the computer. Firstly, individuals who stay on the computer will not have much fun with others. I am acquainted with a friend who adores using the computer and spends an extended period on it. One consideration is that there is not much to do on a computer for some individuals. People do not venture out and have fun, such as going to the mall with friends. Some individuals attempt to concentrate on the computer when there is something significant they must accomplish. Thirdly, people will not enjoy themselves. When @CAPS2 is on the computer, I truly do not enjoy myself by merely sitting there on the internet. One crucial fact is that one will not desire to relish a beautiful day with one's family when they are going to the beach. People will consult maps for a while and not want to return to sleep, and one will have nothing else to do for the remainder of the day. Sometimes, one will not lead a fulfilling life without savoring it. Lastly, doctors claim that it is not good to always stay on the computer. One important fact is that one always needs to exercise instead of lounging around. Sometimes, issues may arise with one's eyes because one is constantly staring at the computer. One needs to engage in healthy activities to benefit one's body. In conclusion, I concur with the statement, and my reasons are that one will not have fun, one will not enjoy oneself, and doctors assert that it is not good for one. I hope you appreciate my submission so that it can be featured in the newspaper.
413	415	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are ubiquitous wherever one goes. One can acquire knowledge from them or engage in games. Although computers are omnipresent, they do not have a positive impact on people because malicious individuals could discover one's residence, and they are overly addictive. Wherever one looks, a computer can be found. At home, in school, in one's car, at work, and in hotels. Being exposed to these computers is advantageous. Nowadays, everything we encounter is either operated by or incorporates a computer. In the future, we will witness an increasing number of computers. Businesses essentially rely on computers; soon, they will operate autonomously. Moreover, the proliferation of computers creates employment opportunities. One can manufacture computers, program them, repair them, and even supervise their operation. Despite everyone claiming to be safe on the computer, they are not. While on a chatting website, one may encounter someone who could be a child molester or other dangerous individual. They can ascertain one's residence and determine when no one is home or when one is alone. With one's address, they can even view one's house on a website or potentially obtain the house's blueprints. Then, they can arrive and leave one emotionally scarred for life. There are numerous activities one can undertake on a computer. For instance, one can play games. There are games with virtual worlds or games that are entertaining but lack substance. In any case, computer games are excessively addictive. One may intend to play for @NUM1 minutes, but they are so captivating that one ends up playing for @NUM2 hours. The games ensnare one, and one becomes trapped. Although computers are everywhere, they do not have a positive impact on people because harmful individuals can discover one's residence, and they are overly addictive. Computers possess both positive and negative aspects. People need to recognize when to cease using them, or it can significantly alter one's life.
414	416	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I firmly advocate that we should refrain from excessive computer usage rather than constantly relying on it. I hold this view because it can cause severe harm to the eyes. In my opinion, we should limit our computer use as it leads to insufficient physical activity. One would simply sit there, fixated on the computer all day. Over the course of a year, one would likely become overweight. One would resemble a couch potato. My next concern is that we would be unable to venture outdoors and appreciate the beautiful natural world. This includes all the trees, flowers, and wildlife. If one does not go outside, there will be no fresh air. My final point is that if we are overly reliant on computers, we will be unable to socialize with friends and family. One will not be able to observe how one's family has grown or changed. Well, these are my perspectives on computer usage.
415	417	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am penning this letter to express my perspective on the effects of computers on people. I believe that the impact is positive because every establishment requires them. They store information systematically, ensuring that when one revisits it, it remains organized and preserved. Every venue utilizes computers; they are indispensable. Hotels employ them to record guests in each room and activate room keys. Restaurants use them to generate bills. Hospitals utilize them to store files, enabling them to be printed so that doctors can review and comprehend them. Schools rely on them to neatly store grades or for students to type up papers and submit them. Students can leave their work for the day and resume it the next day. The computer can also serve as a profession, such as repairing them or installing a @ORGANIZATION1 program or app. One can also conduct work on it, such as developing a website or writing a report. Even the largest companies in @MONTH1 require a computer. The @ORGANIZATION1 also depends on them; they are integral to the company. So, even if people do not spend enough time outdoors, the computer aids in generating income or achieving success in life. Once one has acquired wealth, one can then venture outside and enjoy it. Therefore, computers have a significant impact on schools, the community, stores, and many other places, as well as people's lives.
416	418	1	1	The local periodical has expressed interest in my perspective on the impacts that computers exert on individuals. Undoubtedly, computers do have an influence on people. They enable individuals to encounter new acquaintances, acquire knowledge about novel locations, and engage in conversations with friends. Continue reading to gain insights into how computers affect people's lives. Firstly, computers facilitate the meeting of new people. One can connect with individuals from across the globe and maintain communication with them via @CAPS1 or email. It presents a more expeditious and innovative means of making new connections. Secondly, computers offer a platform to learn about new places. With a simple click on a webpage, one can access information about various destinations. They serve as a more efficient avenue for learning, providing all the necessary details about the new places one wishes to explore. Thirdly, computers allow for seamless communication with friends. There are numerous social networking platforms available, enabling individuals to interact with others without having to wait until the next school day. Thanks to these modern conveniences, one can communicate with friends at any time. In conclusion, it is evident how computers affect people. They empower us to meet new people, learn about new places, and communicate with friends. Computers have become indispensable in fulfilling these functions. I hope you have enjoyed reading about their impact on people.
417	419	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 individuals, you have been informed that using a @CAPS1 imparts no knowledge. However, I contend that it enhances hand - eye coordination. A @CAPS1 is the most invaluable tool in the world. Firstly, computers are replete with advanced technological features that assist people on a daily basis. I wish to discuss the aspect of interacting with family and friends. One can utilize platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, and even Twitter to communicate with friends. It has become the most prevalent way to engage with others. Approximately @PERCENT1 of teens and adults use MySpace and Facebook, while around @PERCENT2 of younger children use @CAPS2 to interact with their peers. This technology is truly unparalleled. Secondly, people need to acquire proficiency in using a @CAPS1 and develop hand - eye coordination. For educational purposes, one can learn typing, write stories using @ORGANIZATION1 Word, and explore the vast resources available on the internet. In terms of hand - eye coordination, understanding the functions of each key on the keyboard can enhance one's skills. Thirdly, learning how to search on Google or the @LOCATION1 is essential. Google is the most commonly used search engine, facilitating the retrieval of pictures for projects, labs, and various other tasks. Additionally, the dictionary available on the internet is a valuable resource for learning and completing homework. In conclusion, all these reasons hold true, and computers are the most remarkable sources of information on the planet. Everyone should ask themselves whether they desire education. Computers are beneficial to all, and they truly deserve our appreciation.
418	420	1	1	An increasing number of individuals are incorporating computers into their daily lives; however, not everyone concurs that this trend is beneficial to society. I, for one, share this reservation. While I acknowledge that spending a reasonable amount of time on the computer can yield certain benefits, I firmly believe that computers have become an overly dominant presence in people's lives. I advocate that individuals should reduce their computer usage and engage in physical exercise. If more people were to allocate the time they spend on the computer to physical activity, they would experience significant improvements in their health. On the computer, one can explore different places through pictures of landscapes, nature, and people. Nevertheless, if individuals were to step away from their screens and embark on real - life adventures, they would be able to immerse themselves in these experiences rather than merely viewing them through a digital lens. Moreover, excessive computer use often leads to a decrease in face - to - face interactions with family and friends. When one spends an inordinate amount of time on the computer, it can seem as though they are gradually drifting apart from their loved ones, as if they are too “occupied” to maintain meaningful relationships. In conclusion, I strongly oppose the excessive use of computers.
419	421	1	1	Dear Whomsoever It May Concern, Some individuals have developed an excessive obsession with computers. They frequently stay awake throughout the night, engrossed in online games or browsing @CAPS1. Those who are overly fond of computers often prefer solitude and rarely interact with others. They seem to relish being left alone, free from any form of interruption. Moreover, those who conduct online research may be at risk of being deceived, as there is a possibility that the information they encounter is false or misleading. If one's love for computers leads to sleep deprivation, causing them to miss work and feel fatigued, it is a clear indication of a problem that needs to be addressed. Staying up all night is not advisable, as it may cause one to miss important events, such as a child's party. Imagine if your spouse fails to wake you up, and you miss the party, resulting in your child losing trust in you. When individuals stop interacting with others, it becomes evident that they have a serious issue. They may only leave their homes to purchase junk food and soda, showing a lack of interest in social activities. Constant use of computers is detrimental to one's well - being. One may become irritable when the computer is taken away, which is a sign that they need to reevaluate their behavior and engage in physical exercise. Otherwise, they risk becoming unhealthy and should strive to break this habit and adopt a more positive one. When writing a report, people often turn to the internet for information. While the internet can be a useful source, it is not always reliable. One may copy and paste information, only to submit a subpar report. Instead, a good book should be used as a more trustworthy reference. The internet can be all - consuming, and it is crucial not to rely on it excessively. Perhaps the manufacturers of computers should shut down all computers worldwide for a week to allow people to experience life without the internet.
420	422	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I am @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. I believe it would be advantageous for your assessment of the effects of @ORGANIZATION1's computer usage across @LOCATION1 if you heard from a young adolescent. This is particularly relevant because, at our age, individuals are highly reliant on computers. They serve as a source of entertainment through online games, a means of communication with friends and family, and a platform for staying informed about global events. Although some individuals may not always benefit from computer ownership, the majority of the time, people find satisfaction and gain value from using computers. Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people as they offer diverse forms of entertainment, such as playing online games or participating in fantasy sports leagues. Beyond these non - educational examples, the internet hosts numerous educational websites that provide learning opportunities for children. In my personal life, I can cite numerous instances of computer - based entertainment. I frequent @CAPS2, an online gaming site, and participate in fantasy football teams. Another example is my younger brother, Parker, who spends hours on various websites. Despite seemingly being engrossed in front of the computer screen, he is actually learning. Experts assert that children worldwide acquire more knowledge from computers than from textbooks or classroom instruction, as computer screens capture and hold people's attention. Since learning is of utmost importance, if allowing a child to use a computer for an hour can enhance their learning, then it is a worthwhile endeavor. Secondly, computers facilitate communication with friends and family. My brother is attending college at @ORGANIZATION1, and due to our limited in - person interactions, our family uses a program called @ORGANIZATION4 to video - chat with him. This program enables us to maintain regular contact. An online poll conducted on @DATE1 asked respondents about their primary means of communicating with friends and family. Sixty - three percent of the votes indicated that people predominantly communicate via computers, thirty - two percent through phone calls, and approximately sixteen percent in person. This data highlights the widespread use of computers for communication, including platforms such as Facebook, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. Clearly, when used in this manner, computers have a positive impact on people. Lastly, computers are invaluable for staying informed about global events. At my home, every time I access the internet, I am presented with breaking news about the war in @LOCATION6, the devastation in @LOCATION5, and other significant events. A few months ago, a class at @ORGANIZATION3 created a pie - chart to determine how their classmates obtained world news. Fifty - six percent reported using computers as their primary source. This trend is not limited to @ORGANIZATION3 students; the majority of people rely on the internet for news. Just the other night, our waiter from @LOCATION4 mentioned that he receives all his hometown news from the internet. In conclusion, based on the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the impact of computers on people is predominantly positive. They offer entertainment, facilitate communication, and provide access to global news. As I mentioned earlier, not all computer - related effects are positive, but the majority are.
421	423	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers exert a highly positive influence on individuals. There are three reasons: they can educate the public, simplify tasks, and offer entertainment. Below, I will elaborate on each rationale. Firstly, computers are highly educational. They serve as an extensive repository of information. Many educators in January direct their students online for learning purposes. Moreover, numerous individuals access the internet to research information for their school, job, or a project. Renowned websites brimming with knowledge, such as @ORGANIZATION1, can only be accessed via a computer. For example, envision conducting research solely using books while residing far from a library. The internet renders such research effortless, as you have access at any time! Secondly, computers streamline various tasks. They provide individuals with numerous convenient methods to accomplish diverse tasks. Were there no computers in the world, wouldn't you consider interacting with people globally to be arduous? Almost all of the stores/restaurants in @LOCATION2, like @PERSON1's, @ORGANIZATION2, or @PERSON2's, possess an online website to assist shoppers, and they even facilitate online purchases, which is far more convenient than traveling by car. I recall a time when I desired to purchase something from a store in @LOCATION1. I accessed the internet at home and made the purchase there! Additionally, the internet simplifies activities like ordering food, obtaining plane tickets, and seeking assistance, and it saves time! Thirdly, computers are highly enjoyable! They offer a plethora of engaging activities! For instance, if you are bored, you can access a computer and search for a game you relish. There is invariably a game you will like. Moreover, you can enjoy yourself by conversing with your friends and family. You maintain contact while savoring their company. Another appealing aspect people appreciate about computers is the ability to send items to one another instantaneously via email. Imagine lacking a phone and wanting to inform your husband, who is away on a business trip, that your son is severely ill. If you were to send the message by mail, it would take at least @NUM1 days. Via email, it takes only a few minutes. Thus, you can recognize that computers also provide a sense of security for everyone! In conclusion, computers have a highly positive impact on people. They are educational and aid the public in learning. They simplify tasks such as ordering food, obtaining tickets, or contacting help. They are also highly enjoyable, from playing engaging games to staying in touch with friends and family. Don't you think that without computers, we would likely face difficulties? I firmly believe that computers have a remarkable influence on people.
422	424	1	1	To Whom This Concerns in January, computers are an excellent technological resource; however, numerous individuals allocate excessive time to using them. People fail to experience the external world because they are overly “occupied” with their computers, utilizing them to engage in activities that could be pursued outdoors in the fresh air, such as finding information or playing games. People spend an inordinate amount of time on computers instead of having outdoor experiences, exercising, and interacting and bonding with their family and friends. Firstly, individuals do not appreciate nature as much as they do their computers. When confined within school or work, one does not have the opportunity to venture outside and behold the natural beauty. Therefore, upon leaving, it is advisable to take approximately @NUM1 minutes to relish the wilderness. It is not necessary to go outside daily, but occasionally, it is invigorating to explore the world. Especially when one desires a brief respite and solitude in nature, it provides an opportunity to alleviate stress. Some individuals claim that one can appreciate nature and explore new places online. However, why wouldn't one prefer to experience it firsthand? Merely viewing pictures does not offer the genuine experience. One must be present and explore independently. In nature, there is always something novel. Secondly, when using a computer, one is not engaging in physical activity. One needs to exercise. Fresh air is beneficial for one's health. Spending the majority of one's time on a computer means less time spent with family and friends. Family is the most crucial aspect of one's life, and as one ages, the time spent with family diminishes. One may see friends at school or work daily, but there is limited opportunity to sit down and “catch up.” Although there are online programs for chatting with friends and family, wouldn't one prefer to meet them in person, especially if they are not seen weekly? It is a more fulfilling experience and creates more memorable moments. Simply going for a walk or a run can provide quality time with loved ones. In conclusion, people spend excessive time on their computers. They miss out on experiencing the external world and the wonders of nature. The more time spent on computers, the less exercise and fresh air one gets. Family and friends are among the most precious aspects of life, yet people do not have the opportunity to bond with them. Computers are useful for creating spreadsheets and typing essays, but they are not suitable for spending all one's time on, as it results in missing out on the adventures life has to offer.
423	425	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that many individuals are debating whether computers benefit our society. Some believe that computers are integral to people's lives, but I must disagree with this view. I contend that computers benefit our society in three ways: they foster social connections, provide extensive research resources, and enable online shopping. Firstly, computers facilitate social interaction through the internet. Many families are geographically separated, making it challenging to maintain regular contact. However, the internet allows people to use social networking platforms such as Facebook or MySpace to stay connected. Distant relatives can communicate and share photos to keep abreast of each other's lives. Additionally, the internet can bring couples together and potentially lead to marriages. How often have you seen those @CAPS3 harmony commercials claiming to have united two singles into a happy couple? Secondly, computers offer a wealth of resources for conducting research on specific topics. The internet hosts numerous search engines that direct users to a vast array of websites, providing comprehensive information. Researching on a computer is significantly more convenient than visiting a library and perusing books. When using books for research, one must locate the appropriate volume, read a substantial portion, and then extract the relevant information. In contrast, with the internet, one simply types in the query, clicks, and accesses the information. Lastly, computers enhance the shopping experience by enabling online purchases. Online shopping eliminates the need to endure long queues at retail stores, saving time and effort. For instance, many people rush to stores early on @TIME1 for the massive sales on “@CAPS4 @DATE1.” Instead of waiting in line for hours, one can purchase the desired item from the comfort of home and have it delivered directly. Moreover, many online retailers offer exclusive deals, allowing shoppers to save money. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers benefit our society in three significant ways: they strengthen social bonds, offer extensive research opportunities, and provide a convenient shopping experience. A world without computers would be vastly different from the one we inhabit today.
424	426	1	1	To Whom This Concerns in January, computers, while being a significant technological advancement, are often over - utilized by many individuals. People are neglecting the real world as they are overly engrossed in their computers, using them for activities that could be done outdoors. This excessive computer use comes at the cost of outdoor experiences, physical exercise, and quality time with family and friends. First and foremost, the appreciation for nature has diminished due to the allure of computers. When confined to school or work, people miss out on the natural beauty outside. After work or school, taking about @NUM1 minutes to explore the wilderness can be incredibly refreshing. It's not necessary to go out every day, but occasional outdoor exploration can relieve stress, especially when one wants some alone time in nature. Some argue that nature can be explored online, but this is no substitute for the real - life experience. Looking at pictures online doesn't compare to being physically present and discovering new things in nature. Secondly, being glued to a computer screen means a lack of physical activity. Fresh air and exercise are essential for good health. Spending too much time on the computer also means less time with family and friends. Family is of utmost importance, and as we grow older, the time we have with them becomes scarce. Although there are online platforms for chatting with friends and family, face - to - face interactions are far more rewarding. Going for a walk or a run with loved ones can create lasting memories. In conclusion, the over - use of computers is a real problem. People are missing out on the joys of the outdoors, getting less exercise, and spending less time with those who matter most. While computers are useful for tasks like creating spreadsheets and writing essays, they should not replace real - life experiences. We need to limit our computer use and embrace the adventures that life outside the screen has to offer.
425	427	1	1	To: The @ORGANIZATION1, computers, while being a prominent part of modern life, have several negative impacts that are often overlooked. Firstly, prolonged exposure to computer screens is detrimental to physical health. Secondly, the information available on the internet may be inaccurate as anyone can post content. Lastly, people have become overly reliant on computers, which can lead to significant problems. Clearly, computers are having a negative influence on our society. The first reason computers are not beneficial is their adverse health effects. For example, spending hours playing computer games can strain the eyes, leading to fatigue and drowsiness. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. This could be a contributing factor to the obesity problem in @LOCATION1, as computers may discourage people from going outside and exercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. It is evident that computers are not conducive to physical well - being in many ways. The accuracy of online information is also a major concern. Any individual with computer access can post content on blogs, websites, or social media platforms. Not all content creators are experts in the topics they write about, so the information may be false. More and more @CAPS1 rely on computers for information, which could ultimately harm them. In contrast, books are more reliable as they are edited by professionals and written by experts. Therefore, the spread of false information via computers is undoubtedly harming our nation. Finally, our over - reliance on computers is a significant issue. Suppose you are writing a paper on a computer that is due the next day. You save it and then close the computer to have dinner. When you return, the paper has disappeared. Technical glitches are common in computers, and there may not be enough time to seek technical help. If the paper had been written by hand, this problem would not have occurred. Since people depend on computers so much, it can backfire and cause serious problems. My sixth - grade teacher once shared that when she was in college, she had a major French paper due. After working hard all night, the paper was erased when she went to print it, and she had to rewrite the entire thing. In conclusion, computers are harming our society. They are unhealthy for our bodies, the information on the internet may be inaccurate, and our over - reliance on them leads to various problems. I strongly advocate for reducing our dependence on computers to mitigate these negative impacts.
426	428	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, the act of individuals spending time on the @CAPS1 serves as an excellent means for people to establish connections with one another. However, it can also become a conduit for individuals to encounter trouble online, such as viewing inappropriate content, engaging in conversations with strangers they should avoid, or even falling prey to online predators. @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 kids and adults access the computer either after leaving @ORGANIZATION1 school for the day, finishing @ORGANIZATION1 work for the day, or concluding @ORGANIZATION1 work for the night. They are simply on the computer to check on various matters, and for kids, it's either for entertainment, like chatting with friends on some @ORGANIZATION1 program, or even playing an online game. Three - fourths of @ORGANIZATION1 kids under age @NUM1 go online more frequently than adults age @NUM2 due to their interest in what the computer offers. People sometimes claim, ""oh, I only use the computer to check on things. It only takes me a few minutes."" Nevertheless, they are being untruthful. Most people don't just use it for a couple of minutes; they spend several hours, which impacts their relationships with family and friends. @PERSON1 at the @ORGANIZATION1 states, ""People spend hours on the computer looking at whatever they desire, and most do so, and this must cease for the sake of the person's family and friends."" @PERSON1 also remarked, ""@CAPS2 is akin to an addiction."" Do you genuinely wish to have an addiction? I think not. So, instead of sitting there staring at a screen for hours each day, go outside and have a great time with your friends or family. Visit the @CAPS3, the beach, or even take a stroll in the park. Nothing can rival the feeling of being with friends or family and simply having fun."
427	429	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, computers are remarkable tools and a significant aspect of modern technology. Nearly every family owns one. Approximately @PERCENT1 of my class has computers. A multitude of people possess them because they are beneficial and represent a contemporary learning resource. Moreover, it is an outstanding way to maintain contact with friends. Although they can be time - consuming, they prove worthwhile in the long run. First, they are advantageous as it is swift and effortless to navigate from one page to another. This is particularly useful for work, as instead of telephoning numerous clients, one can send them all emails within a few minutes. They also assist with schoolwork or vacation planning. One can discover excellent low prices from travel agencies on the computer. This is invaluable because our country is experiencing an economic downturn, and we need to save every penny. These are some of the reasons why this modern technology is so helpful. Next, it is an outstanding contemporary learning resource. One can find articles on any event occurring at that moment or a few days prior. Sometimes, the articles in books are outdated and lack accurate, well - researched information. However, computers do provide such content, enabling one to compare information. Additionally, there are affordable online schools. So, if one wishes to pursue further education while also working, this is extremely beneficial. A computer can be utilized for numerous purposes, such as learning. Computers are undoubtedly the optimal way to stay in touch with friends and family whom one cannot see frequently. I understand what you might be thinking: isn't that what phones are for? No, because what if that family member or friend doesn't have a phone? Then they can use their computer to stay connected. They can use email, Facebook, AIM, and many other platforms. A computer helps me stay in touch with people I haven't seen in a while. Now that I have presented all my reasons why computers are a great resource, I simply want to remind you that they are helpful, an excellent learning resource, and a wonderful way to stay in touch. Computers are now an integral part of society. They represent a new frontier and should remain so.
428	430	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, computers and other forms of technology are the most remarkable advancements that have ever occurred in the world! I've heard that computers have an impact on people, yet I disagree with this assertion. Here are my @NUM1 reasons why. Computers and other technology simplify life. One can communicate with family and friends without incurring expenses. If one controls the amount of time spent on a computer, everything will be fine. Please continue reading to explore my insightful ideas. To commence, computers and other technology make life more convenient. Consider this: we have access to our bank accounts, stores, research materials, educational resources, etc. Instead of going out to shop for groceries, one can simply place an order online without any hassle. We can now purchase @CAPS4 clothing and other household items. It is so effortless to peruse a list and select what one wants rather than waiting in a long queue. For example, I went to @CAPS1 to pick up a few items for a party. There was a long line, so I simply logged on, selected what I needed, and had it shipped to me in less than @NUM2 hours! It's amazing not to have to even get up to obtain what one desires. I'm sure you've had moments when you don't want to get up, but you still have to go shopping. Don't computers make life so much easier? Secondly, one can communicate with family and friends without spending money. This is fantastic because one can text, video - chat, and email for free. Computers offer numerous websites for communicating with family and friends, such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, MySpace, Yahoo, and even OhVoo. For the most part, on all these platforms, one can video - chat and voice - chat for free. On all those sites, one can text for free and connect with others. For instance, one day I didn't want to spend money to talk to my friend. So, I simply video - chatted with them, and it was @NUM3 times better, free, and more enjoyable. Even for long - distance communication, making phone calls can be extremely costly. So, why not just video - chat? I'm certain you wouldn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a phone bill! Please keep reading. Thirdly, if one monitors the amount of time spent on the computer or other technology devices, everything will be well. If one limits and sets a time for computer usage, everything will be wonderful. One can train one's body to get off the computer and engage in a workout or talk to friends. There's no way one could become addicted to something if there is a limit on its use. If you're the type of person who has a tendency to overindulge in something, then perhaps you shouldn't own a computer. Like my mom restricts my computer use; on school nights, my laptop has to be turned off, and on weekends, it has to be off by @NUM3:00 pm. There are always ways to avoid addiction. One just has to know when to stop. It's not the computer's fault; one just has to exercise self - control. To conclude, I'd like to express my gratitude for taking the time to read my letter. My reasons are that computers make life easier, allow free communication with family and friends, and as long as one controls the usage time, everything will be okay. Thank you again.
429	431	1	1	"Dear officials at the @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever experienced such extreme boredom that you spent an entire day on the computer conversing with friends and relatives? Some experts contend that computers are having a detrimental impact on individuals in our society, while others argue that they are highly beneficial. However, the use of computers has reached an excessive level and is negatively affecting the community. Some reasons for my stance are the social limitations computers impose on people and the substantial amount of time people spend on them. My final reason is that computers are influencing the general health of people today. People should be educated about the negative effects that computers bring! Firstly, computers are significantly altering the way people communicate. Instead of engaging in face - to - face conversations, teenagers and adults find themselves ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" with their friends and colleagues. This is leading to the formation of many bad habits. People are becoming less inclined to communicate physically and might even use terms like ""@CAPS3"" and ""@CAPS4"" instead of proper words. This issue is creating a significant gap in human social interactions, and the consequences are more evident than ever! Secondly, the amount of time squandered on the computer is astonishing! If someone logs onto the computer to search for a fact or ""@CAPS5"" something, they might get distracted by other programs and spend hours on the computer. This time could have been utilized for more productive activities. A recent poll indicates that the average person aged between @NUM1 spends over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite remarkable, as these people could have accomplished more during this time. The excessive time wasted on computers is a major problem that requires a solution! Lastly, human health is being severely affected by the use of computers. As the obesity rate continues to rise, these individuals are simply sitting in front of their computers, watching the rate increase. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors but find themselves too occupied with their computers to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on Facebook or OhVoo instead of being outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep climbing if these people don't realize that spending all day on computers is part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has reached a point where it is harming society rather than benefiting it. I hold this view because of the poor social skills it promotes and the large amount of time wasted on computers. Another significant reason is the severe health issues associated with computer use. If the average person attempts to limit their computer usage, they will notice a positive change in their lifestyle."
430	432	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, experts assert that ""@PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 spend @NUM1 hours or more on the computer daily."" The recommended time limit is @NUM2 hour. By spending excessive time on computers, people are not engaging in physical exercise. Secondly, they are missing out on the enjoyment of life and nature. Lastly, the use of computers places a strain on social skills among friends and family. Undoubtedly, the effects of computers cannot be positive. First of all, people in this area are not exercising as much as they should. Obesity and diabetes affect <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of @CAPS4. Both of these diseases are life - threatening. If people spent fewer hours on the computer, the spread of these diseases would be significantly slower. When will you step away from the computer for an hour and go outside or to the gym to exercise so that these diseases do not affect you? Secondly, nature is a magnificent phenomenon. Granted, camping in a tent and catching one's own dinner may not appeal to everyone. However, there are numerous ways to experience nature without ""roughing it."" One can visit the zoo or the aquarium. Sit by a backyard pond and engage in bird - watching. All of these are excellent alternatives to sitting in front of a computer screen, looking at pictures of nature. Lastly, people are not spending sufficient time with family and friends. Yes, one can email, instant - message, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6 with family and friends, but it is not the same. People are becoming less sociable and friendly than before, mainly due to a decline in social skills. We need to restore social interactions without relying on computers. In conclusion, computers do have a negative impact on people in the long term. People are not exercising, they are not appreciating nature, and finally, the bonds between friends and family are weakening. This is a growing problem that must be resolved. Thank you for your time."
431	433	1	1	"The amount of computer utilization has witnessed a substantial increase over the years. Both adults and children are allocating significant portions of their time to computers. Although these devices appear entertaining and beneficial, that is not entirely accurate. Computers are employed for purposes beyond mere work; they seem to have become the new mode of communication for people. Communicating with others has always been an integral part of our lives. There is no individual in the world who has not engaged in some form of communication with others. However, computers seem to abuse the privilege of communication. Engaging in online chat is easier and more convenient for people. The individuals in those chats are not always who they claim to be. This poses a significant danger on those platforms, especially as children of all ages are now using them. These children do not always know with whom they are conversing, and since it is online, they say whatever comes to mind. The way people communicate with others in person differs from that online. When corresponding with others on the computer, the writer tends to abbreviate things. For instance, the word ""you"" is often spelled ""u"". These rapid changes occur unconsciously and become a natural habit. These alterations quickly become part of our communication and writing. Hence, instead of seeing the sentence ""@CAPS1 did you think about her project"", one will see ""wat did u tink bout her pro."" As a result, many children's grades could be affected. Their spelling will soon deteriorate, and their vocabulary will be filled with slang. This vocabulary change could be averted if computers were not utilized as extensively. Nowadays, people are spending less time outdoors. No one needs to go anywhere if all their communication can be accomplished at home. This not only harms ourselves but also the environment. The less time people spend outside, the more energy is wasted. The times people do go outside are for simple tasks such as taking out the trash. This is detrimental to our environment! There are not as many people taking care of our planet. People are not taking the time to cultivate a garden, plant some trees, or simply pick up some trash on the side of the road. If everyone would just take the time, perhaps only ten minutes a day, to assist our environment, it would benefit our bodies and also help our planet. This would reduce the number of people using computers and transform the way we perceive our civilization today. So, please help yourselves and the earth by ceasing to chat on the computers and going out to do something productive. The computer will always be there, but we only have one of ourselves and one planet. We don't want to destroy these over a simple piece of technology."
432	434	1	1	I opine that we require our computers. If we do not possess computers, we will be unable to connect with our family members who may reside in another state or country. I am aware that texting exists now, but some individuals do not even own phones. How can you connect with them? You cannot call as it might not be free with the phone plan you have. If a family member comes to visit, they would likely email you about it. However, if there are no computers, they cannot inform you when they are coming. Will they arrive unexpectedly? You might not even be at home, and if they show up without prior notice, they will be out of luck. Moreover, we can exercise at our convenience. We choose the time and engage in it. If we play a sport, we are also enjoying nature. Some people may have jobs that take place outdoors. There are individuals who spend all day on computers, but I am certain they appreciate nature. I am not sure about exercising, but they have a car and can drive around. Additionally, everyone must exercise to maintain good health. I am quite certain that people do not want to be overweight throughout their lives; they desire to look and feel good about themselves. If it is a holiday or something, and people want to send their wishes to others, they will not be able to see them in person if they live far away unless they plan to meet. Even if they do, they will likely prefer to email rather than call, as calling incurs costs and texting is only available with certain phone plans. So, emailing is the only option left. Sometimes, people may comment that you are always on the computer. If you are not, do not worry; at least you can email your family whom you rarely see. These reasons represent my opinion that we should not discard computers and other related devices.
433	435	1	1	Most adults believe that computers are merely a waste of time and can sometimes be addictive or detrimental to health. While it is true that they can have negative effects, it depends on how one uses them. One remarkable aspect of the computer is the ability to socialize with friends, family, or even strangers. You know how your parents always say never to talk to strangers. Well, you can do this safely and harmlessly via the computer. Moreover, you can learn a great deal about life or other people's lives outside your small town. Another advantage of computers is the ability to stay in touch with family or friends who live far away. My sister went to @LOCATION1 for six months, but it felt like only two weeks because I was able to communicate with her and see pictures of her @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The last, but perhaps the most crucial, aspect is the ability to reach out to people you actually need to talk to, such as friends, teachers, or even individuals you rarely interact with at school. With these three advanced means of socialization, you will always feel as if you are never alone, which is an excellent thing. There are numerous other uses of the computer apart from socializing, and these are actually important applications, things you need to know or wish to discover. For example, everyone has forgotten their work at school or in the office at least once in their life. Well, it is easy to retrieve all the papers online. Simply visit your teacher's homepage and print your homework. It is that simple; just one click, and you save a twenty - minute journey to school. What about when you are up at night wondering what the weather will be like, whether it will be sunny, cold, or perhaps a glorious snow day? Instead of waiting to find out, you can visit weather.com and view everything, including maps, forecasts, or what will happen hour by hour. Just like with the weather, people always want to know the breaking news. Why watch a two - hour show when you can get straight to the point of what is happening in the world we live in? I mean, parents should open their eyes and recognize this as a wonderful thing. We should be proud that humans have created something so complex and interesting. There is one more topic that I know you will absolutely love. I mean, right now you are grading this in your office, but you could be grading it at home on your comfortable couch, with a fire crackling and complete peace and quiet. People work from home all the time. You can run a business from your very own living room. My father owns a company and works from home most days. It is absolutely @CAPS1 that he is able to take me out, spend time with the family, and most importantly, do the things he loves. And guess what, you can do this too. As I keep saying, it is just a click away. Here is another topic, online banking. Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that boring accountant and spend hours there? Well, now you don't have to waste your time. You can type in a few keys, and boom, you can access your information. I am guessing that was faster than two hours. Yes, I believe that computers are a @CAPS1 use of time and will also be of great help in the future. So, the next time you log on to your computer, try some of these things, and trust me, you will think exactly as I do.
434	436	1	1	Dear Readers of the Local Newspaper, An increasing number of people are utilizing computers, yet not everyone concurs that this is beneficial to society. Those who support technological advancements believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and individuals, and even allow people to communicate online with others. However, others hold different views. Some experts are concerned that people are spending excessive time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I concur with these experts as many people take computer usage seriously and are constantly on their computers. Although heavy computer users believe there is nothing negative about using computers, this is not the case. For instance, they cause an increase in the electricity bill. Heavy computer users cause an increase in the electricity bill because if the users are constantly on, the computer must constantly be powered on. When the computer is constantly on, it leads to an increase in the electricity bill. I can relate to this as I used to be a heavy computer user, and my guardian would scold me because of it. Ever since I reduced my computer usage, my guardian has noted that the electricity bill has decreased. Another reason why heavy computer users should curtail their habit is due to obesity. Obesity refers to a condition where a man or woman is overweight. My imaginary friend is a heavy computer user in my imagination. Similar to many others, he never exercises with his friends because he is constantly on the computer. Last but not least, heavy computer users begin to neglect interacting with friends and family. As I mentioned in the second paragraph, I used to be a heavy computer user. I myself would decline invitations to go to the movies with friends and would not assist around the house. These were the three main things I refrained from doing. Then I learned not to abuse the computer, not to waste my time on it, but also to be responsible with its use. I believe many heavy computer users should do the same. In conclusion, being a constant computer user is unhealthy as it may cause obesity. Additionally, a heavy computer user increases the electricity bill and fails to spend time interacting with others.
435	437	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, In my view, the effects of computers are unfavorable. A significant number of people spend an inordinate amount of time on their computers and insufficient time exercising. People are so engrossed in their computers that they no longer appreciate nature. Moreover, they are not interacting with their family and friends as much. I believe that computers are becoming a problem. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in my school agree that they hardly exercise anymore because they are constantly on their computers. For example, a @NUM3 - year - old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym every day before getting her own computer. Now, every afternoon, she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it were not for computers, I am certain that kids would be outside getting exercise. Computers pose a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer, I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be advisable if you unplugged your computers for a day and went outside to breathe some fresh air! If everyone persists in the habit of staying on their computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of sedentary individuals. I am certain you do not desire that. Lastly, I recall multiple instances when I promised to do something with my dad but did not because I was on the computer. Many people can empathize with me. Instead of going out to interact with friends, many are simply instant - messaging them. The internet is remarkable, but I believe everyone has forgotten the joy of going out with friends and family. So, get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are negative. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time for exercise. They are so preoccupied that they no longer enjoy nature. Also, they are not interacting with friends and family. After reading this, I hope you can recognize that computers are not beneficial.
436	438	1	1	What I am about to disclose could potentially transform your general perception of computers. Some individuals may assert that computers are excellent, offering rapid access to information. However, I contend that computers are detrimental. They can become addictive, cause exorbitant bills, lead children to spend less time with family, and pose significant risks to teens and children of all ages.  I assert that computers are addictive, and this is a well - established fact. @PERCENT1 of students allocate the majority of their time to using computers. Why are computers so addictive? They feature instant messaging, enabling users to communicate with people globally. While this may not seem harmful at first glance, it can have a negative impact on one's finances. @PERSON1, an expert dealing with electricity bills, indicates that due to children spending more time on computers, household bills have increased by nearly @PERCENT2, making it more challenging for people to settle their expenses.  Computers are currently one of the primary reasons children spend less time with their families. This holds true in many households, including mine. Owing to computers, my sisters and I spend more time on the computer than interacting with each other, which can lead to arguments and conflicts within the family. Statistics reveal that @NUM1 individuals would rather spend more time on the computer chatting or listening to music than spending time with their own children or parents. Is this the kind of separation between you and your children that you desire?  Computers are not always safe for teens and children. There are numerous reasons for this. We often worry about our kids' safety, and when they are on the computer, we have no knowledge of whom they are conversing with or what they are discussing. Teens are more likely to meet others online, and there are stalkers, posers, and individuals pretending to be someone they are not. Your child could be one of those who fall for such deceptions, which may result in dangerous encounters, such as being kidnapped or raped. Children can also be subjected to verbal abuse and threats, causing emotional damage. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor your child's computer usage.  These are just a few of the issues associated with computers, demonstrating that they do not truly benefit society.
437	439	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that excessive computer use is detrimental to individuals as it can lead to obsession, cause trouble, and have a negative impact on education.  One reason excessive computer use is harmful is the potential for obsession. For instance, on a pleasant day, if you were playing outside and called a friend to come over, and they declined, stating that they were @CAPS3 on the computer. When you mentioned that it was a nice day, they replied that they were @CAPS3 playing games. This is a clear example of computer obsession.  Another reason is the risk of getting into trouble. Engaging in improper behavior online can have serious consequences. One could face legal action, and website owners may remove the site from the user's computer. Moreover, if parents discover such behavior, the individual would be in even greater trouble, possibly facing grounding and being prohibited from using the computer for an extended period.  The final reason is the impact on education. If someone spends too much time on the computer instead of doing their homework, it can significantly affect their grades. In @CAPS5 @CAPS6, this could prevent a student from graduating and attending college, which is a major setback for those aiming to enter a reputable institution. Although computers are important in @CAPS5 @CAPS6, one should not overuse them.  In conclusion, all the points I have presented regarding the negative effects of excessive computer use clearly demonstrate that too much time on the computer is harmful to people.
438	440	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper: Computers have emerged as a significant component of people's lives. However, the effects of computers on individuals are entirely negative, with no positive outcomes resulting from their use. This is because computers are time - consuming, unreliable, and detrimental to health.  I understand that you face a challenging decision, but after considering my arguments, there will be no doubt that you will concur. Computer usage is extremely time - consuming. People often underestimate the amount of time they spend on computers. Once they start using them, they become engrossed, and it is difficult to disengage. A poll of @NUM1 kids revealed that @NUM2 of them reported feeling groggy and experiencing headaches after using a computer for two hours. While using a computer can be entertaining, such as chatting with friends on @CAPS1, the source of happiness is the person, not the computer. One might as well meet the person in person. Therefore, computers are a waste of time and should be used sparingly.  Computers are unreliable and seem to have a mind of their own. Many people rely on their computers, and when they malfunction, it causes frustration and anger. Computers have a profound impact on people, but this should not be the case. Dr. @PERSON2 at @ORGANIZATION1 states that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2's frustration and anger is caused by non - functioning computers. Reducing computer use would also reduce people's anger and lead to other positive outcomes.  Finally, computers contribute to health problems and encourage laziness. The obesity rate is at an all - time high, and excessive computer use is exacerbating the situation. @PERCENT2 of obesity cases are attributed to computer usage. @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION2 reports that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 non - computer users are significantly healthier as they engage in physical exercise instead of sitting in front of a computer.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people because they are time - consuming, unreliable, and harmful to health.
439	441	1	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, envision a day when one can communicate with anyone worldwide by simply pressing a button. This has become a reality with the advent of computers. I advocate for technological advancements because computers enhance hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning about distant places and people, and enable instant global communication.  Firstly, computers benefit society by promoting hand - eye coordination. It is a well - known fact that nine out of ten computer users experience improved hand - eye coordination. Bill @CAPS2, the creator of @ORGANIZATION1, once said, ""The keyboard is the most crucial part of the computer as it develops hand - eye coordination."" This statement reminds me of my own experience. When I first got a computer, I had poor hand - eye coordination, but now I can type with my eyes closed. I understand that some may argue that computers reduce physical activity, but the improvement in hand - eye coordination is undeniable. This is why I support the use of computers.  Secondly, computers support our society by enabling us to learn about far - off places and people. Nineteen out of twenty students utilize computers when studying a particular place or person. @PERSON3 noted, ""The way students study has changed significantly; nowadays, students rely on computers."" I recently had a report on @PERSON1, and all I needed was my computer. I recognize that enjoying nature is important, but intellectual development is even more so. This is why computers are valuable to our society.  Finally, I support computers because they allow for instant global communication. Ninety - nine out of a hundred students use touch - screen devices to talk online. @PERSON2, the creator of @CAPS4, an instant messaging website, stated, ""There is no doubt that @CAPS4 is the easiest way to stay in touch."" I recall going on vacation and still keeping in touch with my friends through @CAPS4. Although exercise is vital for the body, maintaining social connections is also essential.  In conclusion, I support the computer because it enhances hand - eye coordination, helps us learn about distant places and people, and enables us to communicate with the world instantly. Now that you understand my reasons, there should be no doubt that you will also support the use of computers."
440	442	1	1	Dear Newspaper, individuals are expending an excessive amount of time on their computers. They remain engrossed in their computers when they ought to be engaging in physical exercise. People should relish the beauty of nature and allocate quality time with their family and friends. Allow me to elaborate further.  Firstly, those who are constantly @CAPS1, engaging in social media activities such as Facebooking or using MySpace, are neglecting physical exercise. Currently, more than ever before, individuals are becoming severely obese, which is extremely detrimental to health. In my family, those who are always on Facebook fail to exercise and are gradually becoming overweight. Eight out of ten @CAPS2 are not getting sufficient exercise. We must encourage people to become more active and engage in physical activities.  Secondly, people need to appreciate nature. Everyone is so preoccupied with their computers that they fail to relax and soak in the beauty of nature. People often overlook the fact that the earth is polluted. Once animals become extinct, they will never return. If they were to step away from their computers for a moment, they could observe these animals before they vanish forever. Computers act as a barrier between the indoors and the outside world.  Finally, computers are impeding people from spending time with their family and friends. Everyone is so absorbed in the latest computer technology that they neglect their loved ones. I know some individuals who, during dinner time, go to the kitchen, grab their food, and bring it back to their computers so as not to miss out on anything. Family and friends are of utmost importance. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 only see their friends and family during holidays.  Computers are interfering with every aspect of people's lives! People are not getting the necessary exercise, they are not going outside to enjoy nature, and they are not spending time with their friends and family. We need to motivate people to get up and move away from the computer. Why do people have to sit in front of the computer all the time?
441	443	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I advocate the notion that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. This is because there is a plethora of activities and knowledge available on the computer. One can access a wide range of information, such as sports, the animal kingdom, history, and much more. The reason for my support lies in my interest in researching the history of @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 pioneers who have transformed humanity. Another reason computers impact people is that they teach efficient typing skills and how to navigate the computer. For instance, if your mother asks you how to access a specific website to purchase new furniture, you can easily assist. A third aspect of how computers affect people is in academic projects. Suppose you need to complete a project on what transpired during the @CAPS2 revolution, and you have spent considerable time researching it on the computer. The project should then be relatively straightforward. Additionally, computers enhance communication skills on platforms like Facebook and @CAPS5. In school, children often encourage each other to log on to Facebook after school. I also believe computers influence people as they allow you to explore information about your idols. For example, I am a fan of football and basketball, and my idols are @PERSON1 Peterson and @PERSON2 Iverson. Whenever I use the computer, I look up information about them. Lastly, computers promote reading skills as there is always something to read on the computer, regardless of the topic.
442	444	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, ""@CAPS1 a computer @CAPS15?"" @CAPS2 is a perpetual subject, and numerous controversies and ideas have emerged. As senior scientist @PERSON2 states, ""I believe that computers can facilitate people's connections with friends and long - distance relatives."" @PERSON2 is indeed correct; computers unite people, whether they are friends, family members, or relatives from distant countries. @CAPS2 also caters to daily requirements, including homework. Firstly, individuals can perform a multitude of tasks on a computer, such as completing homework, locating a store, and checking traffic and weather conditions. One can play games, connect with friends, learn recipes, and even follow the football game. By establishing a global link, people can acquire information about one another and understand their characteristics. @PERCENT1 of large corporations find the @CAPS3 and computer highly useful. ""@CAPS4 using the @CAPS3, I can identify a willing participant in charities,"" says @PERSON4, a charity fundraiser in @LOCATION1. Secondly, @CAPS4 using the @CAPS3, people can showcase their products on various sites, including @CAPS6 and @CAPS7. People also create websites to market their goods. @PERSON1, the co - owner of The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, a duct @CAPS8 wallet company that also raises funds for @LOCATION2, has initiated the creation of a website, aiming to raise awareness of the tragic event that occurred. Entrepreneurs like @PERSON1 utilize the @CAPS3 to expand their businesses. ""@CAPS12 remain in the past when the door to the future @CAPS1 opens?"" remarks @CAPS13 @PERSON3, the successful owner of @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS4 using computers, people can gather data from others and develop new inventions for the betterment of the world. People can create @NUM1 - @CAPS14 diagrams on a computer and transmit the data to a company, with the hope of creating @CAPS2. Computers are not mere playthings; they are serious tools that can benefit the world. Although some may identify drawbacks to computers, they can always recognize the positive aspects. I hope this article can demonstrate that computers are not all @CAPS15."
443	445	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, in my view, we ought to utilize computers. The rationale behind my stance is that when we encounter difficulties and need assistance, we can find solutions on the computer. Moreover, sometimes it is the sole means of contacting someone. Additionally, there are times when people in @MONTH1 must access the computer to check instant mail. Firstly, I advocate for computer use because when we need help with something, the computer can provide the necessary information. For example, if a student requires assistance with homework, they can search on Google. They can also visit a website called http.historywork.com, which can offer further support. Another reason for using computers is that they are often the only way to connect with others. By having an account on platforms like Gmail, Facebook, Yahoo, or MySpace, one can communicate with friends. I engage in such communication regularly. The final reason for using computers is that in @MONTH1, there may be important messages awaiting us on the website. I do this, so why can't others? Therefore, I firmly believe in the use of computers.
444	446	1	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I firmly contend that people should curtail their computer usage. Envision a scenario where more individuals are outdoors, leading healthy lifestyles. There would be less ""cyberspace"" bullying and reduced electricity consumption. My first reason for advocating less computer time and more outdoor activity is that @PERCENT1 of individuals who use the computer for over two hours a day are either at risk of obesity or already overweight. As @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 asserts, ""@CAPS2 people assume that using the computer offers benefits, but in fact, it increases the likelihood of being overweight or developing diseases such as diabetes. It is crucial that the community takes action to prevent this."" Additionally, my neighbor, @PERSON2, conducted a study interviewing overweight adults and teenagers. @CAPS3 informed me that @PERCENT2 of the @NUM1 people @CAPS3 interviewed stated that they rarely go outside and use the computer for approximately @NUM2 hours a day! I earnestly urge the citizens of the @LOCATION1 area to reduce their internet usage and embrace nature outdoors. My second reason is that fewer people on the computer equates to less cyberspace bullying. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 users of socializing websites have experienced more than @NUM2 instances of cyberbullying. For example, my sister's friend, @PERSON3, overdosed on Advil and attempted suicide due to cyberbullying. Someone had insulted @CAPS3, saying @CAPS3 was ugly, smelled bad, and should ""go die in a hole."" @CAPS3 kept this to @CAPS3self. Fortunately, her mother rushed her to @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1 in time, and she was placed on life support for @NUM6 hours. Furthermore, if people reduce their time on internet socializing websites, fewer individuals will be at risk of cyberbullying. It is extremely essential for people to limit their computer use to @NUM7 or @NUM8 hours a day. My final reason is that less computer usage means less money wasted on electricity bills and more time for family vacations. Dr. @DR1 from the Peabody Museum in @LOCATION2 implores people to reduce their electricity and internet power consumption so that the environment can gradually recover to its pre - technology state. Moreover, @PERCENT3 of the power used in modern homes is consumed by computers. My grandmother is shocked by the impact of today's technology on the environment and the people involved. @CAPS3 believes that less computer time means more quality time with family and friends on vacations. Lastly, it is of utmost importance that people decrease their computer usage to safeguard their health, self - esteem, and the environment. I urge everyone to take action and reduce computer use by @NUM9. Thank you for reading my paper."
445	447	1	1	"Dear newspaper, in my opinion, computers undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on people. Those who frequently use computers tend to spend less time engaging in physical exercise. After all, who would sacrifice their time in chatrooms and gaming to maintain physical fitness? I recall when I was around @NUM1 years old, I was constantly drawn to the computer. Subsequently, I gained weight, approximately @NUM2 lbs! I quickly realized that the computer should only be used when necessary as it reduces the time available for physical activity. A survey conducted by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) revealed that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS4 aged between @NUM3 are either at risk of being overweight or already overweight due to their computer usage. The famous singer @PERSON2 remarks, ""I keep fluctuating in weight because of computers! I gain weight and then try to lose it by running and ignoring the computer for a week."" One might assume that using the computer sparingly does not lead to obesity, but research has shown that more than @NUM4 minutes of daily use can cause weight gain. Evidently, computers are a significant factor contributing to our society's weight problem. Have you ever truly appreciated the beauty of nature? Computer users often fail to do so. People are so engrossed in web searches that they cannot fully appreciate the outside world. Last week, when I watched the movie @CAPS2, I thought, ""@CAPS3, nature is magnificent, why didn't I notice before?"" I already know the answer: the computer. A survey by @NUM5 grade @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, indicated that @NUM6 out of @NUM7 @CAPS4 have never noticed the blooming flowers or the scent of fresh rain. The famous physician @PERSON4 states, ""@CAPS4 that do not perceive nature in its true splendor often struggle to develop normally. Humans were meant to be in close contact with nature, but over time, technology has weakened this connection."" One might assume that @CAPS4 still experience enough of nature even with computer use, but more often than not, they are too preoccupied with computers to pay attention to nature. Clearly, society neglects nature due to computers. Families become increasingly disconnected every time a child or adult uses a computer. Every time one turns on the computer, they become absorbed in it and lose focus on the people around them. I remember when my sister @PERSON5 was in @NUM5 grade, she was constantly glued to the computer, playing solitaire and instant - messaging her friends, and she completely distanced herself from the family. A test by @ORGANIZATION3 showed that teens are @NUM9 times more likely to rebel with the help of a computer. The famous talk - show host @PERSON3 says, ""@CAPS4 should avoid using computers as they will become detached from friends and family."" One might think that @CAPS4 do not become detached, but they do. Clearly, @CAPS4 separate from their friends and family because of computers. In conclusion, any rational person can recognize that computers have a negative impact on people as they reduce exercise time, make @CAPS4 forget about nature, and cause a rift between family and friends. Therefore, I strongly urge you to limit your computer use."
446	448	1	1	"Computers are highly sophisticated pieces of equipment. Alongside this high - tech device comes access to knowledge about numerous locations and global events. Moreover, typing is a ubiquitous form of writing that is significantly swifter than handwritten compositions. Lastly, online gaming is a convenient and enjoyable means of alleviating stress through interaction with users worldwide. There are thousands of news snippets daily that ultimately remain uncovered due to limited airtime on news channels. To rapidly and effortlessly obtain global news, one can visit a website and view hundreds of stories at the click of a button. Additionally, more in - depth news is available as there are no restrictions on space on the website. There will even be sections on the website for donating to those in need. Patrick @PERSON3, the founder of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, stated, ""@CAPS4 brings in billions of dollars in aid to those who would otherwise be in dire straits, and the primary source of this funding is internet websites."" Without the internet, millions of people would remain unaware of those desperately seeking assistance. Typing is a rapid and relatively straightforward method of writing that saves individuals valuable time. Teachers frequently assign writing homework, which takes approximately twice as long to complete by hand as it does to type. Utilizing typing would save this time and enable one to proceed with other essential tasks. Furthermore, typing is a compulsory course for many freshmen, and prior experience is highly beneficial to both teachers and students. ""@CAPS4 has had numerous students,"" says typing instructor @PERSON2, ""and those who excel not only receive an 'A' but also halve their homework time."" Stress is a prevalent issue across all age groups, and a computer is the optimal way to relieve it. Interactive games with people globally will expand your understanding of other cultures. You can employ your typing skills to converse with others and share your viewpoints. ""@CAPS5 @MONTH1 may seem astonishing,"" says @PERSON1 at @CAPS6 @CAPS7, ""but individuals who use computers for an hour daily are far more culturally advanced than others."" Additionally, you can use video chat to communicate with people in foreign regions. Friends, family, and exchange students can converse and see you via video chat. This significantly alleviates parents' concerns about their children living abroad. Many people."
447	449	1	1	Computers are advantageous as individuals can discover what they require, engage in enjoyable pursuits, locate places, and acquire items at favorable prices.
448	450	1	1	Dear Readers, I am of the opinion that allocating time to use the computer presents both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, individuals can conduct research, communicate with friends and family, and the computer serves as a valuable resource for learning about any topic. However, I also recognize some drawbacks. People often become overly engrossed in computer use, leading to distraction. They may unknowingly neglect their families, and prolonged staring at a computer screen can cause permanent eye damage. I will commence by elaborating on the benefits of computers on people. The computer is an excellent tool for research. When in need of information on any subject, one can perform a search. For instance, when conducting research on a specific project or topic, the computer offers the quickest means of obtaining the necessary data. Another advantage is the ability to communicate with friends and family, which I consider highly significant and I am certain you share this view. These are the positive aspects I believe computers possess. Now, I will discuss the negative aspects. I firmly assert that people are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer without being aware of the passage of time. Staring at the screen is detrimental to the eyes and can cause permanent harm. One final point I wish to mention is that when using the computer, people tend to ignore their friends and family, which can be a substantial problem. These are just a few examples of how the computer impacts people.
449	451	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I contend that individuals should be permitted to utilize computers for valid reasons. One such reason is communicating with distant relatives. Additionally, if one requires @ORGANIZATION1 workout routines or healthy eating advice, they can simply print the information. My final reason is that when embarking on a long - distance journey without knowledge of the route, one can print out directions (@ORGANIZATION2). Suppose you have a relative residing in @CAPS1, but due to your location in the @LOCATION1, calling them would cost approximately @MONEY1 per minute. Instead, you can communicate with them via the computer (webcam), which is far superior as you can actually see them. Alternatively, if you are on a business trip, you can keep tabs on your family. My second reason is that the computer can assist in maintaining physical fitness. You can search for @ORGANIZATION1 ""yoga"" poses or participate in fitness lessons by watching them on your computer. If you are on a diet, you can look up @ORGANIZATION1 healthy recipes. You can also acquire @ORGANIZATION1 workout equipment to help you stay in shape. My last reason is that when going on a long journey, if you are unsure of the way, you can access the internet to find directions. This is a superior option as it saves money compared to purchasing a @MONEY2 @ORGANIZATION3. It is also faster. The best part is that you can print out the computer - generated maps and keep them. These are all the reasons why people should make use of computers. A computer offers numerous beneficial functions, such as facilitating communication with relatives, aiding in maintaining health and fitness, and providing maps. I hope this broadens people's perspectives and perhaps changes a few scientists' opinions."
450	452	1	1	Should computers be incorporated into our society? Undoubtedly, they should. Computers are valuable assets and offer significant assistance. I can provide @NUM1 compelling reasons for this. These include bill payment, social networking on platforms like Facebook, and research. Firstly, computers are beneficial because paying bills online is more convenient than dealing with paperwork. It streamlines the process for individuals, which is why we need computers. Secondly, platforms like Facebook are popular. It serves as an excellent medium for interacting with friends, making new ones, and having fun. This is another reason why computers are valuable in society. Thirdly, computers are indispensable for research. They are highly effective in retrieving information on specific topics. In conclusion, having computers is extremely advantageous due to their utility in bill payment, social interaction, and research. People clearly need computers. I have presented all the positive aspects of computers. Can you share yours?
451	453	1	1	Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that computers exert both positive and negative influences on individuals. In the past, the negative impacts on people have been more pronounced. A survey conducted in @CAPS2 magazines indicated that @PERCENT1 of individuals experience negative effects from computers. In my opinion, computers have a detrimental effect on people. Firstly, individuals are not engaging in interactions with family and friends. It is highly crucial to have social interactions with others. When using a computer, one is not truly interacting. One simply sits there, fixated on a screen. A survey carried out at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 revealed that @PERCENT2 of people are on the computer and not interacting with those around them. Parents do not see their children as frequently because the children are constantly on the computer. Parents would greatly appreciate seeing their children active. Interacting with family and friends is beneficial for one's well - being. Computers detract from the time spent socializing with family and friends. Secondly, people fail to appreciate nature. Individuals engrossed in the computer may not venture outside as they are preoccupied with it. Staying in one room, engaged in activities such as reading books for a @CAPS5, people need fresh air. Moreover, learning about nature is more enriching. If one does not appreciate nature, one is unaware of what is happening around. Nature surrounds us, so why miss out on it? A survey in a local magazine showed that @PERCENT2 of people are on the computer. While people enjoy using the computer, they neglect nature. Lastly, people are allocating excessive time to their computers and insufficient time to exercise. Exercise is vital for both the mind and the body. Our bodies need to remain healthy and fit. The lack of exercise is increasing rapidly. The more people acquire computers, the less they exercise. America already has a high obesity rate. People who spend most of their time on the computer are more likely to become overweight. People prefer to play on the computer rather than exercise for a healthy body. Dr. @DR1, a local physician, has observed more people becoming overweight and exercising less than before. He states that computers do not provide opportunities for exercise. He recommends that people reduce their computer usage as computers are causing more harm. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a negative impact on people. My three reasons are that people are not interacting with friends and family, not appreciating nature, and getting less exercise. I urge you to be aware of the negative effects on people. The important decision lies with you.
452	454	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, initially, I wish to express my perspective on excessive computer usage. Although I utilize a computer frequently, I still enjoy spending time with friends and participating in sports. However, excessive time spent on the computer can lead to a lack of motivation to exercise or an increased susceptibility to illness. Prolonged computer use can cause a child to become introverted in social situations. Exercise is highly beneficial for both children and adults. There are an excessive number of individuals spending hours on computers, engaged in various activities. Staring at a computer screen for an extended period will not maintain physical fitness. People should limit their computer time to a minimum of @NUM1 minutes per day and then engage in some form of exercise. In this way, one can have time for online activities while still doing what is beneficial for oneself. I should not feel pity for those who squander all their time on the computer, yet I do. Witnessing them becoming unkempt and gaining weight due to lack of exercise makes me want to assist them. @CAPS4, no one should put themselves in such a situation. I have noticed that individuals who spend a significant amount of time online are more prone to illness. By sitting idly like sloths, they do not get fresh air. Insufficient fresh air intake can lead to a cold or, for some with underlying health issues, severe illness. They need to carefully consider the consequences of their actions. I would rather have fun and breathe in fresh air than sit on the computer on the verge of getting sick. The situation may be different if one is sick at home from work or school and uses the computer. However, getting sick because of computer use is unappealing. It is often said that people who frequently use the computer are shy in person. If someone has an argument online, it can cause them so much distress that they become mute. Interacting with others is a pleasant and fulfilling experience. However, being shy and lonely due to an online argument or excessive computer use is something to be ashamed of. One should not be in such a state because of a single factor. Go out into the world and do not let such things affect you. To conclude, it would be advisable for people to take care of themselves and not spend excessive time on the internet. Remind yourself to have at least @NUM1 minutes for personal activities and also engage in exercise. Do not forget to maintain a healthy lifestyle and go for a jog occasionally. One should not center one's life around the computer. Thank you and have a great day.
453	455	1	1	Individuals are likely using computers to chat, check their emails, create a website, or browse YouTube. Perhaps some people do not enjoy going outdoors to appreciate nature or spending time with their families. They are probably exploring new websites, playing games, or using the computer to book vacations or check for sales at Walmart. They might be looking at or purchasing a new truck, or researching the history of wars and their origins.
454	456	1	1	I believe that computers are effective as they assist individuals with their work. However, computers can also make people addicted as one can essentially do anything on them. Primarily, computers are used as aids for work, accessing maps, finding friends, and solving problems, such as in school for math, science, social studies, and numerous other subjects. Nevertheless, people abuse this technology. There are @CAPS2 games, and some individuals do not even go outside. They do not communicate with or see their friends, essentially leading a non - existent social life. Moreover, some people are reluctant to go to school because they are exhausted and simply want to use the computer continuously. I think that people are overly addicted to computers and do not use them for the right reasons. When people become overly reliant on computers, they may experience headaches or feel nauseous. They also miss out on many experiences, such as attending @CAPS1 events, watching @CAPS2 football, soccer, @CAPS3, volleyball games, or even taking their dogs for a walk at the @CAPS1. Some people purchase computers for games, while more mature individuals buy them for work and to locate places. Thus, computers are helpful to many, but they also addict numerous people. Additionally, computers can malfunction because people may download a game or something else that infects the computer with a virus. As a result, one may spend approximately @NUM1 $ or @NUM2$ to repair it. New computers are available at prices ranging from @NUM3$ to @NUM4$, and they differ in brand and operate at a faster speed. When people's computers break down, some become agitated and may engage in irrational behavior. They may feel as if they have no friends and only stay in their rooms all the time. If they do leave their rooms, they may immediately show disrespect to their parents and do as they please, often getting into trouble. So, while computers can be helpful at times, they also have their drawbacks, and perhaps some changes should be made.
455	457	1	1	Welcome to the @DATE1. In this era, numerous technological advancements are being made daily. Among these, the invention of the computer has emerged as the most prominent. Despite being a single invention, the computer possesses numerous capabilities: providing @CAPS1 access for educational purposes, enabling people to stay connected, and exposing people to new aspects of life. The computer has facilitated mankind in making various discoveries about our world. As far as many can observe, this technological device has positive impacts on people worldwide on a daily basis. The new trend in schools across the globe is the incorporation of computers or computer labs. The rationale behind this is that this technology elevates learning to unprecedented levels. Whether a student needs to write an essay about the presidency of @PERSON1 or obtain background information for a science experiment on paper towels, a computer can assist them in finding the necessary information. Programs like @ORGANIZATION1 enable @CAPS1 to present their work in a novel and efficient manner. For children who do not attend school or adults seeking a college education, computers allow them to learn what they need through online schools. It is also significant for @CAPS1 to maintain contact with friends after school hours. Computers can help with this. How often has it been said that communication is the cornerstone of a healthy relationship? Believe it or not, computers are a convenient way to stay in touch with distant individuals. Some friends and family solely communicate via computer because they do not live close enough for daily visits. If one is cautious and employs internet safety measures, one can make new friends with shared interests through computers. This interaction with new people is just one way that computers broaden one's horizons. Computers are like keys that unlock doors to new places and ideas. The utilization of this technology can assist people in discovering numerous new things they were previously unaware of. Computers can introduce people to unique music genres they have never heard before. On the internet, there are numerous video tutorials that teach different skills for free. In one's leisure time, one can use a computer to research the people of @LOCATION1 or the pyramids of @LOCATION2. Any use of a computer has the potential to have a positive influence on someone. In the @DATE1, computers are indispensable in daily life. It is crucial that you decide whether you support this remarkable technological device or oppose it. It is astonishing what one can learn simply by using a computer. Keep in mind that computers are not just for entertainment; they are also for education. So, what are you waiting for? Discover the profound impact computers can have on your life with just a click of the mouse.
456	458	1	1	"Dear editor, I am cognizant that numerous children and adults are fond of using the computer, yet they remain oblivious to its adverse effects. During one's youth, any eventuality can transpire; when using the computer, even more dire circumstances may occur. One might engage in improper activities online, neglect physical exercise, or fail to allocate time for family. Firstly, by ""bad things,"" I refer to a child's potential access to inappropriate websites, interaction with strangers, or experience of harassment. For instance, when a child initially acquires a Facebook account, in most cases, those who send friend requests are unregistered child molesters or sex offenders. They may feign friendliness to make the child at ease and ultimately abduct them. Additionally, one could harass others or be the victim of harassment oneself, and access inappropriate websites. Secondly, today's younger generation rarely ventures outdoors. Lastly, a child will lack quality family time. With the emergence of new technologies such as cellphones and laptops, children prefer to socialize with friends rather than spend time with family. I can understand the allure of cellphones, but one must dedicate more time to family. I believe that excessive computer usage is detrimental because it exposes one to risks such as interacting with strangers, experiencing harassment, and accessing inappropriate content. Moreover, it leads to insufficient exercise, potentially resulting in diabetes, high blood pressure, and childhood obesity. Lastly, due to the advent of new technologies like cellphones and laptops, individuals have less family time."
457	459	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my view, computers are highly beneficial to society in numerous aspects. They can preserve memories that we cannot retain indefinitely, such as @CAPS3, @CAPS1's, and facilitate letter - writing. Computers also offer dieting advice from local experts. Most importantly, they enable long - distance communication with family members for extended periods without incurring phone bills. To commence, computers can provide @CAPS2 insights on subjects previously unknown, thus serving as a learning hub. For example, if one is extremely stressed due to an impending paper with insufficient facts, there are countless websites available to find answers. Subsequently, one may receive an A on the paper. Another @CAPS2 advantage of computers is the ability to communicate with family members residing in different cities, towns, states, or even continents. Even if one misses them deeply, one can see, speak, or type to them, alleviating the feeling of sadness temporarily. Every @NUM1 in @NUM2 Americans assert that missing or not seeing a family member is akin to losing a part of one's heart. Everyone is familiar with unforgettable memories, but what about those fleeting ones that @CAPS3, websites, and written records seem to fade from our minds? Computers store all such memories, as @PERSON1 exclaimed, ""It's like losing a part of the life one has lived."" This precisely elucidates the significance of computers in various ways. I hope you appreciate the intellectual stimulation, tips, and family - connection capabilities that computers offer."
458	460	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever witnessed someone with a @CAPS1 device emailing a colleague or an individual using a laptop at a coffee shop? Well, I can attest that I have, and I understand their necessity and the benefits they derive. People utilize computers daily for their work. Moreover, computers facilitate staying in touch with friends and family. Additionally, they mark the dawn of a new, improved future! Whether employed for obtaining the latest gossip or for professional purposes, computers have become an integral part of people's lives. My mother uses the computer daily at her job. Although it may not seem significant to you, it is crucial for my family, as we rely on the income for food and bills. Half of @LOCATION1 uses computers for work to earn money, similar to my family. Recently, @ORGANIZATION3, a computer company, conducted a survey to determine the number of people using computers for work. A staggering @PERCENT1 of respondents use computers for work, and these individuals reap the benefits. They depend on email to communicate with their bosses or to save the layouts of statewide meetings, aiming to secure well - deserved raises. You, @ORGANIZATION1, even use computers to write articles for the paper. More than half of @CAPS2 or @ORGANIZATION2 benefit from working on computers. Everyone agrees that family is of utmost importance. What can one do if family members live far away? Well, one can use email, @CAPS5, @LOCATION2M, or @CAPS3, of course. Some experts claim, ""People are spending excessive time on computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family."" However, @CAPS5 was originally invented to maintain family connections. Thus, experts have no valid reason to make such claims, as people use computers to stay in touch with family. Even military personnel use computers for communication. Using computers is not as detrimental as some believe. Be vigilant! The future is approaching! New technologies beyond our current knowledge are emerging. Computers were the starting point, and the progress has been continuous. Admittedly, computers have some drawbacks, but what invention does not? No one can halt the march of progress; one must learn to adapt and move forward. Computers are the beginning of something promising, so do not impede a development that could yield even greater benefits! The next time you are outdoors, smile at the person in a business suit emailing on a @CAPS1 or the girl in the coffee shop, knowing they are benefiting from it, whether for work or to stay connected with relatives. Perhaps they hold the next great idea for the future. Embrace the computer, dispel negativity, and a pleasant surprise awaits."
459	461	1	1	Dear The Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers impact people, albeit in diverse ways, which also depend on the duration of use. In my opinion, computers are advantageous for multiple reasons. I will elaborate on some of these reasons. Hopefully, after reading this, you will contemplate the matter more deeply. One reason computers are beneficial is the enhanced communication. There are numerous websites where one can interact with friends and family. If a family member lives far away, this provides an excellent means of communication. Additionally, with the latest technology, video - chatting allows one to see and hear friends via a small camera, which is an effective way to maintain contact. Another reason is the wealth of information available on computers. There are countless websites that offer answers to all sorts of questions. Websites like @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 recommend other research sites. One can acquire a great deal of knowledge from computers, and the information provided can educate everyone. Lastly, computers are useful in many areas, such as online courses, matchmaking, job - hunting, and more. One can find activities by simply typing into the computer. In the current poor economic climate, one can search for jobs, and once a suitable one is found, the computer can notify the user. It is a convenient and helpful tool, and extremely straightforward to use. Computers are an amazing and innovative technology, with continuous advancements. So, why not utilize them? They can educate and assist, as well as help maintain relationships with family and friends. Do not take this technology for granted; instead, use it effectively. It only takes a click of a button. I hope this makes you realize the true value of computers and perhaps changes your perspective or offers a new way of thinking about them.
460	462	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has been advancing at a breakneck pace for many years, significantly simplifying the lives of ordinary people. It offers assistance in various ways, such as enabling communication with relatives, facilitating the acquisition of new knowledge, and ensuring safety and up - to - date information. Computers are indispensable in daily life. A primary function of computers is to facilitate communication. With new applications like ""@CAPS2,"" ""@CAPS3,"" and ""@CAPS4,"" they present a plethora of opportunities to stay connected and have fun with friends, which were previously unavailable. Email is also an excellent tool for communicating with distant family members, unlike traditional letters that may take weeks to arrive. Another crucial reason for our reliance on computers today is the ability to research foreign destinations and learn facts that would otherwise remain unknown. With computers, one can easily go online, search for @ORGANIZATION1, conduct research, and plan a flight there within a week. It is also a powerful educational tool, enabling the acquisition of new knowledge and representing a significant advancement in the educational process. Computers also enhance our safety and security and provide breaking news. Imagine the convenience of checking the best route home from the comfort of one's home, rather than being stuck in traffic. Thanks to modern technology, this is entirely possible. They offer enhanced safety and protection to ordinary people like us. In conclusion, I hope this has changed your view on computers, or if you were already a proponent, that is equally great. Now, I encourage you to spread the word about the importance of computers and their role in ensuring a better future. I understand that some individuals are not fond of electronics, but it is up to you to correct their perception. Computers are excellent tools for progress, and we should embrace, not disparage, them."
461	463	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I have learned that some individuals opine that computers do not contribute positively to society. However, I am convinced that they do. Computers facilitate our acquisition of all types of information. They serve as an excellent source of entertainment. Moreover, computers do not significantly alter the time we allocate to exercising, appreciating nature, and interacting with family and friends. Computers are an invaluable resource in our daily lives; thus, why not utilize what we have been given? Google, Yahoo, @CAPS1, and @LOCATION1. How would we manage without them? They assist us in resolving minor issues, such as discovering a quick and effortless remedy for a stomachache or a humorous joke to share at the office the following day while in the staff room sipping coffee. They also come in handy when we are unsure how to handle a newborn's cough and sneeze, the challenging situations we encounter. These are the types of information we need, and not everyone can visit the library every time a question arises. The information available on computers is limitless. From learning a new language for an upcoming vacation to @LOCATION2 to seeking assistance with that perplexing geometry homework, the computer can accomplish it all. Entertainment on computers is boundless, from the hilarious skateboarding dog on YouTube that has you in stitches to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on addictinggames.com. There will never be a dull moment. YouTube hosts millions of videos and movies. The @ORGANIZATION1 alone offers @CAPS4 games, from Pac - Man to Scrabble; there is no way we will be left without something to do. I frequently visit @ORGANIZATION2 to communicate with family members living too far away to visit. Computers are among the finest sources of entertainment and undoubtedly benefit society. Computers certainly do not change the way we exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. There are computer - based videos that demonstrate new yoga moves and other methods to shed those extra pounds gained over time. There are also websites to help us find ideal camping spots and plan that long - awaited family vacation. And we always make time to visit our family and friends. Computers do not hold us in a hypnotic state. Without a doubt, computers benefit everyone in society. They are informative, they entertain us all, and they do not transform us into mindless zombies unable to interact with others. Computers are one of the most helpful tools we possess, and no one should think otherwise after reading this essay.
462	464	1	1	Dr. @DR1, the impact of computers on individuals and the reasons why some people do not concur that computers are beneficial to society are worthy of exploration. Some individuals utilize computers to communicate with friends and family online. The question remains as to why some people are reluctant to embrace computer usage. Firstly, computers can be employed for a multitude of purposes, such as virtually visiting places one desires to explore. Moreover, for activities like @CAPS1, whether it involves work or enrolling in a new school, computers often become indispensable. Given these advantages, it is reasonable to consider using computers. Although computers can be costly, there are times when @NUM1, it is worthwhile to own one. Admittedly, some people spend an excessive amount of time on their computers, resulting in less time dedicated to physical exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. For instance, when family and friends are geographically separated and lack access to cell phones or landlines, computers offer a means of communication. Additionally, when individuals wish to explore new natural environments but are unsure where to go, computers can provide valuable guidance. Thirdly, computers can serve as a medium for physical exercise. It does not matter if people spend a significant amount of time on computers because they can engage in a wide range of activities. Students, for example, often complete numerous projects on computers and conduct extensive research. Hence, many people find computers enjoyable. Finally, those who remain unconvinced should give computers a try. These are the effects of computers on people and the reasons for the differing opinions regarding computer usage and online time.
463	465	1	1	Computers, ubiquitous in modern life, are a topic of much discussion. Who does not own a computer these days? They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable individuals to learn about distant places and cultures, and yet, astonishingly, some people hold a contrary view. I find such opinions utterly baseless. Contemporary computers are integral to our daily tools, including cars, cellphones, and televisions. They also streamline work processes and facilitate social interaction. In my view, computers bring significant benefits to society, and those who think otherwise should delve deeper into the matter. Cellphones, cars, and telephones, all products of human ingenuity, are enhanced by technological advancements. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars are equipped with built - in computers? With the simple press of a button, all doors unlock; a flick of a switch lowers the windows—all thanks to computer technology. Now, you may wonder how computers simplify life. Continue reading to discover the answer. Everyday items such as toothpaste, baseball bats, and pencils are manufactured by machines programmed with computer chips. I recall my history teacher sharing that it once took @NUM1 hours for a human to craft a baseball bat from scratch. Today, with the assistance of computers, the same task can be completed in approximately @NUM2 minutes. If this does not convince you of the benefits of computers, then what will? Some experts claim that frequent computer users do not engage in sufficient outdoor activities to interact with family, but I firmly refute this claim. Cellphones are a staple in our daily lives, enabling long - distance communication. And for those who prefer, online chatting on a personal laptop is a convenient alternative. I sincerely hope that you now recognize the substantial benefits that computers bring to our lives. From the everyday items we use, to the ease of work they provide, and the facilitation of social interaction, computers are an indispensable part of our daily routine. We rely on them daily, and it is our hope that they will continue to serve us for a long time to come.
464	466	1	1	Computers exert a positive influence on individuals as they can impart hand - eye coordination skills, offer insights into historical events, and provide knowledge about diverse cultures. Additionally, they serve as an excellent means of relaxation and entertainment. Computers enhance hand - eye coordination by training the hands to follow the brain's instructions and the eyes' cues. This skill is of utmost importance as it aids in driving, reduces reaction time, and enables neater handwriting. For example, it can assist a driver in quickly turning the steering wheel or applying the brakes, potentially preventing an accident. Consider a climber attempting to grasp a hold on a mountain; with improved hand - eye coordination, they can see, grab, and pull themselves up more rapidly. Many people are unaware of historical facts, such as the number of soldiers at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or the total number of countries in the world. The internet is a vast repository of information, allowing users to explore history and other topics of interest. A significant number of Americans are unfamiliar with @LOCATION2's history, let alone world history. Through search engines, one can find answers to a wide range of questions, from the end of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to the collapse of @LOCATION1 in @DATE1. Moreover, the internet offers both interesting and practical knowledge, such as food recipes and the composition of paints. One can also stay updated with the latest news on platforms like yahoo.com. Computers are a source of great enjoyment. Users can communicate with friends, listen to music, play games, or engage in all these activities simultaneously. If you miss your favorite show at @TIME1, there are numerous websites that allow free viewing. Similarly, if you wish to listen to your favorite band's new album, you can do so legally and for free on websites like youtube.com and playlist.com. Whether it is learning about other cultures or simply having fun, computers are an excellent tool for interacting with friends and family, improving hand - eye coordination, and acquiring new knowledge.
465	467	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, computers have numerous positive impacts on society in contemporary times. I firmly believe this because computers enhance our communication abilities, provide us with access to information, and improve our technological proficiency. Allow me to elaborate on my rationale. Firstly, computers play a crucial role in developing communication skills. I personally find computers to be extremely useful as they grant us access to various websites that facilitate interaction with both new and old friends. It offers a swift and convenient means of communication, regardless of whether one is at home or on the move with a laptop. One can connect with people across the globe. Secondly, computers are a valuable source of information for writing papers, newspaper articles, and other forms of content. When a teacher assigns a paper on a specific topic, students can simply return home, access a search engine, and type in the topic. Instantly, they are presented with thousands of different information sources. It is estimated that @PERCENT1 of the population in @LOCATION1 prefers computer - based sources over traditional book sources due to the ease of finding specific information on computers. Lastly, computers contribute to the enhancement of our technological skills. Although some computers may initially seem straightforward to operate, companies are constantly striving to increase their complexity and introduce new software. By making computers and software more advanced, the current generation is becoming more technologically savvy compared to many other countries. Overall, computers have a profound impact on our country's technical capabilities. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers have a positive influence on society. They enhance our communication skills, provide us with information, and improve our technological proficiency. I sincerely hope that this explanation has helped you see the situation from the same perspective as I do.
466	468	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I have encountered reports from both the news on @CAPS2.V. and your esteemed publication indicating that an increasing number of individuals are becoming overly reliant on their computers. I am not suggesting that this is an entirely negative phenomenon; after all, the computer provides access to the internet, which enables users to explore various websites and engage in online conversations. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that people should allocate more time to outdoor activities, such as football, basketball, or baseball. For adults, pursuing a profession that does not necessitate computer usage, such as constructing houses for the homeless, building shelters for animals, working as a maintenance technician, a pool lifeguard, or any other hotel position that does not involve computers, would be highly beneficial. One could also consider employment at a restaurant offering either regular or fast - food services. These are activities that do not rely on computers. In the event that one is unable to leave the house, engaging in video games can be a viable alternative to computer - based activities. Although video games share some similarities with computers, they offer a different form of entertainment that can be enjoyed on the @CAPS2.v., which is a more engaging option than spending excessive time on the computer.
467	469	1	1	Computers are increasingly integrating into our daily lives. These technological marvels have streamlined various aspects of our world, facilitating work, bill payments, and entertainment. However, these advantages are offset by several negative consequences, including online hazards, a growing disconnection from reality, and the escalating obesity crisis. With technological advancements, people are spending more time sedentary and less time outdoors, exacerbating the obesity problem. Today's children and teenagers are more inclined to be on their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 accounts than to engage in physical activities like running or playing basketball. Moreover, the internet is inundated with advertisements for unhealthy foods, making it more likely for these young individuals to consume junk food. Additionally, the internet misleads people into believing that they can effortlessly achieve weight loss through simple diets without any concerns. As the number of computers and users continues to rise, so do the associated risks and threats. Viruses can infiltrate computers, steal personal information, and cause irreparable damage to the system. Users may even face substantial bills for purchases they never made. Cyberbullying has emerged as a new and perilous threat. These individuals harass and intimidate innocent people. I recall a tragic incident where a young girl took her own life after being bullied by another girl and her mother. Online predators also pose a significant threat to teenagers. These individuals manipulate and deceive their victims, luring them into meetings where they may be subjected to violence or even death. Lastly, the interaction between modern computers and young minds contributes to increased ignorance through misleading advertisements and a neglect of education and reading. Many children, including myself, prefer to be online rather than read books or complete homework. In conclusion, while computers have contributed to the progress of the world and our understanding of it, certain aspects can lead to ignorance and endangerment for people of all ages.
468	470	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, this letter is intended to address the impact of computers on individuals. I am deeply concerned about the extensive computer usage in our society, as individuals who spend excessive time on computers tend to allocate less time to outdoor activities, physical exercise, and social interactions with family and friends. Allow me to elaborate further. As previously mentioned, one of my primary concerns regarding computer usage is the reduction in outdoor time. As @PERSON2 aptly stated, ""Everyone, regardless of age, should spend at least @NUM1 minutes outdoors daily to enjoy fresh air."" Prolonged computer use can curtail this essential outdoor time, which may not be conducive to one's health. A second reason for my concern about excessive computer use is closely related to the first. Spending too much time on the computer limits the amount of daily exercise. According to health expert @PERSON1, ""People should engage in one hour of exercise per day to maintain good health."" However, @PERCENT1 of individuals fail to meet this requirement due to computer usage. This is particularly evident when individuals are engrossed in a captivating game. They may initially plan to play for @NUM2 minutes, but this often extends to @NUM4 minutes and may even stretch to an hour. I understand that it may still be challenging to comprehend the basis of my concerns. Therefore, I present one more reason. My final point in this letter regarding my opposition to excessive computer use is that it restricts the time available for meaningful interactions with family and friends. Although it is possible to communicate with loved ones via webcam on the computer, it does not substitute for quality face - to - face time. As therapist @PERSON3 remarked, ""Friends come and go, and neither you nor your family will live forever. Make the most of the time you have."" If one's attention is constantly fixated on the computer screen, these precious opportunities for social interaction will be lost. In conclusion, these are the reasons for my concern about people's computer usage. It results in less time for exercise, enjoyment of nature, and social interaction with family and friends. I sincerely hope that you will take these issues into consideration."
469	471	1	1	I firmly contend that computers confer numerous benefits upon society. They have revolutionized our lives by simplifying various tasks. Computers have facilitated novel forms of communication among friends. Moreover, they serve as a valuable source of knowledge, enabling users to acquire new information. One of the primary advantages of computers is their ability to streamline daily activities. They offer a more efficient means of accessing information compared to traditional methods such as consulting a person or referring to a book. For instance, typing reports has become significantly easier with the use of computers. Unlike typewriters, which required re - typing in the event of errors, computers allow users to save their work and identify potential mistakes. Computers also play a crucial role in social interaction. Through social networking platforms such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, individuals can communicate with friends, regardless of geographical distance. These platforms not only enable users to stay connected with existing friends but also provide opportunities to make new ones. In addition to social interaction, computers are an excellent source of education. They can provide information about unfamiliar places and answer a wide range of questions. The internet serves as a vast repository of knowledge, offering answers to queries that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. Furthermore, computers can enhance hand - eye coordination. Online games and those played with @CAPS3's require players to have good hand - eye coordination, thereby providing a form of cognitive and physical training. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on individuals of all ages. Their technological capabilities simplify our lives, facilitate social communication, and impart valuable knowledge and skills. These factors, among others, underscore my belief that computers are a boon to society.
470	472	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, technology experts assert that the use of computers has a positive impact on individuals, and I wholeheartedly concur. I believe that computers are indispensable for social interaction, homework, research, and entertainment, especially on inclement days. After a long day at school, the majority of teenagers head straight from the bus to their homes and then to their computer chairs. In fact, @PERCENT1 of teenagers follow this pattern. Chances are, they are logging into social media platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, Formspring, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, and other interactive websites. With proper time management, I find these platforms to be of great significance. I believe that Facebook, email, and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (@CAPS5) are excellent means of social interaction. They also provide an effective way to maintain contact with distant family members and friends. I attend @DATE1 camp and have made friends who are like family to me. Some of them reside overseas in @LOCATION2. Since making long - distance calls would be prohibitively expensive, Facebook offers a practical alternative for staying in touch. Many of my family members also live far away. For example, my aunt, uncle, and cousin live in @LOCATION1. My aunt recently had a baby, and although I have not yet had the opportunity to meet my new cousin in person, seeing pictures on Facebook is a cost - effective and convenient option compared to sending envelopes, stamps, and printed pictures. In addition to social interaction, computers are essential for schoolwork. Three out of five homework assignments require the use of a computer. Whether it is taking a twenty - question test or defining a word, the computer has become a necessity for academic success. In school, many projects now rely on computers and the internet. We use PowerPoint and other Microsoft applications for tasks such as writing essays and creating presentations. The internet is also crucial for research, providing the information we need to excel in our studies. Beyond social interaction and academic pursuits, the computer offers a wealth of other benefits. While some people believe that individuals are spending too much time on computers, this is not the case for everyone. Many are concerned that children are becoming lazy, but in a recent poll, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 mothers indicated that they would prefer to see their children engaged in computer - based activities rather than being sedentary and watching @CAPS6. On rainy days, the computer can be an excellent alternative. One can watch a movie, play a game, or conduct research. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 @CAPS8 households have at least two computers for a reason: they are an integral part of daily life. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in maintaining social connections, facilitating education, and providing entertainment. I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people.
471	473	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, I opine that it has both merits and demerits. The advantage lies in its ability to educate individuals about @CAPS1 locales and the societal lifestyles of others, including their means of procuring food and rearing children. It also aids professionals such as law enforcement officers. They have an individual on - site for surveillance and can utilize computers for information retrieval. Regarding speeders, it enables officers to determine if the individual has a prior record. It assists educators in formulating lessons or providing typing assistance. Indeed, it exerts a positive influence on certain individuals. Some individuals perform better when using a computer or produce their most excellent work online, like when writing a high - school paper. One can engage with others online and make @CAPS1 acquaintances. Conversely, computers can be problematic as one may encounter strangers online without knowing their identity or origin. They might have a lengthy criminal history. Some may attempt to involve you in trouble due to their personal family issues. Some individuals spend excessive time on computers because they meet someone they genuinely like, disregarding their family's plans. People who used to exercise daily now converse with friends day and night, ceasing their exercise routine and never resuming. Some individuals remain indoors, glued to the computer, foregoing activities like playing baseball or football or attending family reunions.
472	474	1	1	Are you fond of using the computer? After perusing this, I doubt you'll retain that inclination. I am aware that a significant portion of @ORGANIZATION1's population utilizes computers. Spending @NUM1 hour on the computer can damage your eyesight, necessitating the use of glasses, which is an undesirable outcome. At times, it is challenging to abstain from computer use. The internet serves multiple purposes, such as facilitating communication with friends and family and providing a platform for gaming. Computers also offer opportunities for learning about diverse subjects, including historical presidents and family genealogy. Now that you understand the potential effects of computer use, limit your sessions to @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes. This is the approach I would adopt.
473	475	1	1	As @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 technology undergoes continuous advancement, the proportion of Americans using computers has also increased. @PERCENT1 of these Americans are children aged between @NUM1 and @NUM2. Most adolescents utilize computers to interact with peers on social media platforms or spend a substantial amount of their leisure time playing online games. However, what about the other teens who are constantly subjected to cyberbullying or exposed to risks by interacting with strangers? To mitigate these issues, I propose imposing restrictions on technology usage. Social media platforms such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and Facebook have witnessed exponential growth. Many teens prefer computer use to outdoor activities like playing tag or using a swingset. I, too, have accounts on @CAPS2, Facebook, and @CAPS3, and this has impeded my physical activity as I often prioritize chatting with friends over jogging. This concerns me deeply, yet I frequently grapple with the question of how to curtail my usage. I have attempted to address this by going for runs, dedicating more time to studying, and spending quality time with my family. There are numerous ways and compelling reasons to reduce our dependence on technology; we simply struggle to disseminate this message effectively. In addition to the impact on social interaction and physical activity, online gaming also poses a significant problem. Many children, especially boys as I've observed at school, are utterly engrossed in online games. However, the only beneficiaries in the long run are the website proprietors. These games lack educational value and are a poor use of time. Instead, this time could be devoted to more productive activities such as studying or completing homework. One could even socialize with friends in person rather than through a screen. Although gaming is a major attraction for children, cyberbullying and the risk of interacting with strangers on chat platforms are equally significant concerns. If you're a victim of school bullying, the computer may initially seem like a refuge, but cyberbullying can shatter this illusion. It can lead to self - harm, school fights, or even more severe consequences such as suicide. Implementing limitations on computer use or parental controls could effectively prevent these issues. While computer usage has its advantages, my primary concern is the safety, health, and education of individuals, which are significantly impacted by modern technology. I hope my letter to your newspaper receives due attention. Please share your thoughts on this matter via email within the next three days.
474	476	1	1	I believe that computers exert a positive influence on people globally. One can engage in a plethora of activities on computers, including academic work, online communication, and researching facts about beloved celebrities. I am of the view that computers can benefit society as they assist with academic tasks and enable online interaction with friends. For me, one way to reap the benefits of computer use is by typing school assignments. When not engaged in schoolwork, I enjoy chatting with friends online. However, the most rewarding aspect is gathering information about famous personalities like @PERSON1. I recall a project on which I scored a @NUM1 because I utilized the computer. This serves as evidence of the computer's utility. Have you ever contemplated how a computer can enhance your daily life? If not, let me elucidate. You can learn about various destinations and cuisines. For instance, if you wish to make pizza but lack the knowledge, you can consult the computer for guidance. A professor from Virgin New York Tech School posited that the world would be incomplete without computers. @PERCENT1 of the individuals at New York Tech School concurred, while @PERCENT2 disagreed. Can you envision a world devoid of computers? If so, we would lack cell phones and televisions. People might not even be aware of these technological marvels. As the professor from New York Tech stated, the world would be adrift without computers. Teenagers would also experience boredom as most prefer not to venture outdoors. Adults would struggle to complete work and might have to resort to hand - writing, which, let's be honest, can be illegible for some. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are invaluable to everyone worldwide. The entire world should retain computers, for without them, we would regress to a bygone era of paper - based systems.
475	477	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the current @CAPS1 perspective seems to be veering out of control. There are individuals who have become addicted to @CAPS2 elements such as games, websites, communication platforms, and email services. Consequently, there are those who are utterly dependent on computers, like @CAPS3 users. I know people addicted to @CAPS3 as they become fixated on interacting with others and observing profiles. This addiction leads to a decline in academic performance as they fail to cooperate effectively with schoolwork, resulting in poor grades. It also causes them to lose touch with family and friends, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. Eventually, the computer becomes their sole companion. Another adverse effect of computer addiction is the deterioration of physical health. If one is addicted to a website in general, they tend to neglect exercise. In @LOCATION1, there is already a significant obesity problem, and this addiction exacerbates the situation. I read online that a large percentage of people in @LOCATION1 are obese. Clearly, computers present a potential addiction risk. Therefore, individuals should allocate more time to socializing with friends and engaging in physical activity while reducing their computer usage.
476	478	1	1	Computers are ubiquitous, serving thousands of diverse purposes. A significant number of us in @LOCATION1 spend hours engrossed in our computer screens daily. Excessive reliance on computers is not always salutary. Regrettably, numerous individuals squander countless hours on their computers instead of engaging in other activities. Consequently, computers are not the optimal way to spend one's time, as they lead to reduced physical activity, potential declines in academic performance, and weakened communication skills. Firstly, when one spends extended periods at the keyboard, there is less time available for running or socializing with friends. In @LOCATION1 as of @DATE1, an increasing number of people are becoming obese, potentially perpetuating unhealthy genetic traits. One possible explanation is that many individuals now prefer to utilize their laptops for shopping, watching movies, and even pursuing a college education. Fewer people take walks as they would rather be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Without the constant use of computers, individuals would have more free time to venture outdoors or participate in sports. Secondly, many children and adolescents are overly attached to their laptops and carry them everywhere. Instead of studying for exams, they may be using @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. A considerable number choose to engage with these platforms rather than open their textbooks. Moreover, spending excessive hours on the computer leaves insufficient time for homework, leading to a neglect of academic responsibilities. Computers consume time that could be better spent on obtaining a college education. Why waste such valuable time? Lastly, why engage in phone conversations or face - to - face interactions when one can simply send an email or chat online? Many people as of @DATE1 prefer to stay indoors and communicate with others via their laptops rather than having in - person conversations. This can result in a deficiency in communication skills. What may seem appropriate online could sound inappropriate in real - world interactions. This loss of skill may lead to a generation more inclined towards cyber communication rather than @CAPS3. In conclusion, why spend so many hours on the computer when one could be outdoors or socializing with friends? Personally, I would rather engage in other activities than be confined to a computer indoors.
477	479	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether technological advancements, such as computers, are advantageous to our daily lives. I firmly believe that computers are a valuable addition to life for several reasons. Firstly, information and knowledge are readily accessible. It takes only seconds to acquire any information one desires or requires. Although platforms like email, @CAPS2, and @CAPS1 are sometimes regarded as time - consuming or perilous, they also offer the opportunity to make new friends daily. Additionally, time limits can be set to mitigate concerns about excessive computer usage. One of the primary benefits of computers in our daily lives is the wealth of knowledge they provide. Information is just seconds away. Any topic of interest can be explored on the web. Homework, school projects, and work often demand information that may not be available elsewhere. While libraries are excellent sources of information, when in a hurry, online encyclopedias and resources like World Book offer quick solutions. Technology has become an integral part of our lives today, and opinions about it vary widely. However, one aspect that everyone can agree on is its speed and its ability to simplify daily tasks. Ordering clothes, books, movies, and travel tickets can all be accomplished online. Computers offer more than just convenience. Friends and family are essential, but they may not always be geographically close. They may reside on the other side of the state, country, or even the world. Platforms such as @CAPS2, @CAPS1, and email enable us to connect with anyone globally at any time. Email has been around longer than other websites like @CAPS2 and MySpace, which allow us to keep in touch regularly. @CAPS1 or iChat provides instant communication. Although these platforms cannot replace in - person interactions, they facilitate staying connected in the meantime. Concerns about excessive screen time can be addressed. Prolonged computer use indoors can lead to health issues such as insufficient exercise and limited outdoor time. Time limits can resolve this problem. A specific duration can be set, and a warning will be issued when @NUM1 minutes remain. This way, more time can be spent outdoors, and less time is wasted staring at the screen. There are diverse opinions about the role of computers in our lives. I am convinced that they are a beneficial component. They offer instant access to information, connect us with friends and family, and can be managed with time limits. In today's era, computers have become indispensable.
478	480	1	1	Do you truly believe that computers have a positive impact? Don't you think an excessive number of people spend too much time on their computers? You have requested that I write to my local newspaper about my views on the effects computers have on people. I contend that they have a detrimental impact. When people are engaged with the computer, it can cause headaches and eye strain. In contrast, if they were outside, they would be engaging in physical activity. One of the reasons I believe computers have a negative effect is addiction. There are numerous things to which people can become addicted, such as Facebook, MySpace, and Formspring. For instance, when my sister gets home, the first thing she does is log on to Facebook, Formspring, and YouTube. My second reason for believing that computers have a terrible impact is eye damage. When you stare at a computer screen for extended periods, you may not notice, but your eyes are being damaged. When I was in sixth grade, I needed glasses because I was addicted to the computer, and my eyes suffered as a result. My third reason for thinking that computers have a negative impact is that it is a waste of time. When you are at home on the computer while the weather is nice outside, you should be outdoors with friends or family or simply taking a walk. It is also a waste of time because when you are on the computer, you could be doing something more productive. You may think that computers have some positive effects, but they also harm your body. These are the reasons why I believe computers have a bad effect on people. Instead of being on the computer, one should join a sports club. Now is the time to take action by establishing more clubs and activities for people. The problem is that people spend too much time on the computer. These are my reasons for believing that computers have a terrible effect on people.
479	481	1	1	"Dear newspaper, I understand that you are preparing an article on whether computers are beneficial or detrimental to society. I regard computers as a remarkable addition to society because they play a crucial role in jobs across the country and provide accessible information to the @CAPS1 @CAPS8. Consider how computers have contributed to the development of the @ORGANIZATION1. Would you really want to forgo this advantage? Computers have proven to be indispensable in job profiles worldwide. Take, for example, a salesperson. Salespeople rely on their computers to store data, such as on @ORGANIZATION3. A study conducted by the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 revealed that @PERCENT1 of jobs in @LOCATION1 require the use of computers. Dr. @DR1, a computer programmer at To Go Industries, stated in an interview on the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that ""computers are inevitable in everyone's life, especially in the workplace."" When you think about it, individuals who work with computers face fewer challenges in calculating or storing data compared to those without computer access. You can view computers as a supportive tool for those who work diligently. Students appreciate having access to global information. I am confident that @PERCENT2 of people would concur with me. For example, students around the world often need to research information for class topics. A @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2 in @CAPS6 mentioned that ""I prefer using the internet for research at @ORGANIZATION2. It is much faster than searching through books, and people from around the world share their opinions online, unlike a book with a limited number of authors."" One day, @PERSON1 was in the library with his class, tasked with researching a topic in a book. He read five books but only managed to gather half a page of notes for his assignment. The next day, when he was allowed to use the @ORGANIZATION2 computer, he obtained three pages of notes. @PERSON1 reported, ""I was so relieved to access the internet."" A survey by the @CAPS8 Foundation indicated that @PERCENT3 of students prefer computers over books. Do you want students of all ages to engage in research using the medium they prefer? I sincerely hope your answer is in the best interests of the children in @LOCATION1. From young students to adults, computers have become a favored device in modern - day technology. Computers are an outstanding part of society. I remind you that computers benefit numerous jobs in @LOCATION1 and assist students by providing information on a wide range of topics. I sincerely hope you share my perspective on this matter. What is your view on computers today?"
480	482	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 of Newspaper, there has been a concern raised suggesting that computers are a menace to society. However, I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial. If one needs directions to a place or instructions on how to perform a task, computers can provide the necessary guidance. They can also enhance skills such as reading speed and hand - eye coordination. Additionally, computers serve as an excellent source of entertainment. These are some of the reasons why computers are valuable. Firstly, computers are useful for obtaining information on how to do things. When traveling to a distant location or navigating through winding roads, one can rely on the computer. There are detailed maps available on the computer that offer comprehensive descriptions of routes. Specialists claim that over @PERCENT1 of users reach their destinations successfully, which may otherwise be difficult due to lack of driving skills. Computers also offer instructions on how to create various items. For example, if one wants to bake a cake, the computer can provide recipes. It can also assist in project - making. For instance, it can offer information about @CAPS3 mythology for creating a @CAPS3 pat. Moreover, computers can aid in language learning. There is software available that can teach languages, similar to books but with the added advantage of animated teachers to facilitate language learning. Reading in different languages can also improve one's general reading ability. Another significant benefit of computers is their ability to assist with reading. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 Americans struggle with reading? This issue could be alleviated with the use of computers. Since almost all content on the computer requires reading, it provides ample practice. Computers can also improve hand - eye coordination. When using a computer, one focuses on the screen rather than one's hands. For example, when typing an essay on Microsoft Word, one watches the screen instead of the fingers. There are also numerous games on the computer designed to enhance hand - eye coordination. Finally, computers are a great source of entertainment. The internet offers a wide variety of fun games suitable for all ages. One can also watch videos on YouTube, where there are many humorous clips. As is evident, computers are beneficial in multiple ways. They can provide directions, assist with reading, and offer entertainment.
481	483	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, The influence of computers on society encompasses a blend of beneficial and detrimental aspects. Fatigue and indolence are among the negative consequences of computer usage. When one spends more than @NUM1 minutes on the computer, lethargy sets in, and the inclination to remain sedentary increases. This phenomenon affected numerous individuals on @DATE1, as many engage with computers for work purposes and have no alternative. Children are particularly vulnerable, as after school, they often prefer to remain glued to the computer rather than engage in other activities due to exhaustion. Implementing time limits on computer use would be advantageous for children, adults, and cognitive health. When adults devote excessive time to computers for work or email checking, they frequently neglect social interactions with family and peers. I can relate to this issue, as @CAPS4's father is constantly engrossed in his computer at the office and rarely communicates with us. At times, I wish computers had never been invented, as they can be extremely frustrating. However, we also allocate quality family time, and it is essential to disconnect from computers, as they are a source of income. Email, chat, @CAPS3, AIM, and @CAPS2 are all forms of technological communication. These platforms are useful when individuals are unable to send text messages or do not possess mobile phones. @CAPS4's father frequently uses emails to communicate with my soccer coach regarding my game attendance, and the coach always responds promptly. It is a straightforward process. @CAPS3 is an excellent means for children to interact, especially when they do not have access to phones or do not see each other during the school day. Without @CAPS3 or email, communication would be severely impaired. Thus, it is evident that computers have both positive and negative impacts, including inducing laziness, reducing social time, and facilitating communication.
482	484	1	1	Although the majority of individuals would contend that the invention of the computer is a positive development, I hold a contrary view. The advent of computers has introduced numerous drawbacks, primarily due to their access to the internet. The internet contains inappropriate imagery, text, ambiguous user identities, and games. The most concerning aspect is the lack of reliable identification online. On social media platforms such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, a profile may claim to belong to a fourteen - year - old, but in reality, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 could be a forty - year - old individual recently released from prison. There is no foolproof method to determine the safety of online interactions. Internet games are also highly problematic. They contribute to the obesity epidemic in America and cause children to become detached from their families. Additionally, individuals can become addicted to these games, leading to prolonged screen time and subsequent eye strain. The internet also hosts inappropriate content, including bomb - making websites and illegal music - downloading platforms. Overall, while computers are valuable for research, they are unreliable in terms of safety and contribute to obesity and family disputes.
483	485	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am of the opinion that computers exert a negative influence on individuals. Computers have created a situation where children abstain from physical activity, thereby depriving them of the necessary daily exercise. Moreover, children spend excessive time on computers, forfeiting opportunities to enjoy the outdoors. Another adverse effect of computers on children is that @CAPS6 prevents them from spending quality time with family and friends. I am perplexed as to how individuals can remain sedentary in front of a computer all day. Firstly, children fail to engage in sufficient exercise because they allocate excessive time to computer use. It is well - known that nearly everyone owns a computer, including myself. However, the possession of @CAPS6 does not necessitate its constant use. As an athlete, I appreciate the utility of the computer but do not utilize it incessantly. Medical professionals consistently recommend that individuals engage in at least one hour of exercise daily. Regrettably, many individuals neglect this advice, opting instead to spend excessive time on computers or other electronic devices. This behavior is a significant contributor to childhood obesity. If one remains seated in front of a computer all day, obesity is inevitable. Individuals should disengage from computers and participate in physical activities such as sports or games. Failure to exercise will result in a lack of appreciation for the outdoors. Secondly, people are failing to enjoy outdoor activities. Those with an interest in sports should not spend three hours on @CAPS4; instead, they should invite friends to play basketball. Even walking home from school with a friend is a beneficial way to be outdoors. During the winter, some individuals assume there is nothing to do outdoors. However, engaging in a snowball fight with friends can be a fun and rewarding experience. No one should feel self - conscious about playing games such as tag, regardless of their age. There are countless outdoor activities that do not involve computers. Childhood is a fleeting period, and individuals should seize the opportunity to enjoy themselves before assuming adult responsibilities. Lastly, when individuals are not outdoors, they are not spending quality time with friends or family. People are allocating too much time to computers and insufficient time to social interactions. Chatting on @CAPS4 does not substitute for in - person socializing. It takes only a few seconds to invite a friend to one's home. I am puzzled as to why some individuals find it embarrassing to spend time with family. My father and I enjoy playing basketball and ping - pong together. We prioritize having fun and do not care about societal norms. Individuals should identify activities that their parents enjoy and participate in them. It is not difficult to extend an invitation to a friend or family member to engage in an activity.
484	486	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, To what extent do computers impact our lives? This is a question that has intrigued me for some time. Technology has advanced significantly, simplifying our lives. However, have we considered the possibility that technology may supplant human labor? In our daily lives, we are constantly exposed to new technological innovations that serve as convenient tools. Yet, what about the impact on us? Since the advent of technology, human behavior has undergone a transformation. For instance, the widespread use of cars has led to a decrease in physical activity, as people no longer walk or exercise regularly. Additionally, individuals spend less time with family and friends and miss out on numerous outdoor experiences. I believe that technology, particularly computers, consumes a significant portion of our lives by performing tasks on our behalf. Firstly, have you noticed the alarming increase in obesity rates? I can provide an explanation for this phenomenon. Obesity in @LOCATION1 is reaching epidemic proportions, as people spend excessive time sitting in front of computers, consuming food, and engaging in sedentary activities. Instead of participating in sports such as soccer, volleyball, baseball, or running, @CAPS3, they are engrossed in computer games that offer no health benefits. I have conducted surveys on this topic, and a woman once remarked, ""I believe that people prioritize convenience over their health."" I concur with her assessment. Obesity can lead to serious health complications and hospitalization, which should be avoided. Secondly, have you ever reflected on the amount of time you spend with friends and family? It is a question worth considering. Perhaps you acquired a computer because you were spending too much time outdoors and neglecting your family. However, since purchasing a computer, you may find yourself spending more time at home, but not necessarily with your family. Spending quality time with family is crucial, as it allows us to cherish memorable moments such as family parties or watching television together. I firmly believe that family time should be prioritized. Lastly, if you are a parent and spend excessive time on the computer, would you feel remorse if something were to happen to your child? In many instances, we miss out on significant events due to our preoccupation with technology. As parents, we have a responsibility to be present for our children. We should allocate time for our families and avoid missing out on precious moments. In conclusion, many individuals have become addicted to computers, which has led to a range of negative consequences, including obesity, social isolation, and missed opportunities. We should recognize that technology is not a substitute for human interaction and that we should strive to maintain a healthy balance between the virtual and real worlds."
485	487	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that some individuals are overreacting; the use of computers is not likely to be life - threatening. I am not advocating for excessive computer use. My final point is that in contemporary society, computer ownership is ubiquitous. Continue reading to explore my three key points: Firstly, an excessive number of people are overreacting. They claim that prolonged computer use causes individuals to miss out on life. However, individuals are still interacting with family and friends, albeit through typing rather than verbal communication. I am perplexed as to why people are so opposed to computers. It is similar to the issue of global warming, where numerous warnings are issued, yet few people take action. Similarly, people are unlikely to heed warnings about the potential health risks associated with excessive computer use. This is merely my perspective on the matter. Secondly, I will explain why computers are not likely to cause death. Computers are inanimate objects and do not pose a direct threat to human life. However, excessive computer use can lead to obesity and boredom. I personally find it difficult to remain on a computer for more than an hour, as it causes headaches. This is another opinion that I wish to share. Finally, I will discuss the prevalence of computer ownership. Computers are not the sole cause of obesity. In today's society, almost everyone owns a computer, as social media platforms such as Facebook have become extremely popular. Even my mother has a Facebook account. There are also other types of websites, including those related to sexuality, games, and social networking. I believe that Facebook is the most widely used website, as it has a large user base. In conclusion, this essay has presented my views on three topics: the overreaction of some individuals, the non - lethal nature of computers, and the widespread ownership of computers.
486	488	1	1	Computers exert negligible to no impact on individuals. In actuality, computers offer substantial assistance to us. They aid us in scientific, medical, and research endeavors, and can even determine whether one has cancer. The computers that people typically envision are machines that sit idle in a room and are frequently used, yet not for their intended purpose. People sometimes utilize them for entertainment rather than research. However, these are not the only types of computers. There exist larger, more advanced computers that scientists employ daily. Undoubtedly, computers do have an influence on us, but in a positive manner. Most of the time, those who play games or listen to music on computers are bored kids. They use it a bit too often. I only engage with it on rainy days when I cannot go outside to play. Humans primarily use computers because they simplify and ease our lives. Indeed, it does make life more straightforward. For example, instead of handwriting a report, one can type it; or instead of searching extensively through a book, one can directly access the information. One final example is that when one wishes to stay updated on their favorite sports team, they do not need to attend the game; they simply need to visit the team's website. In my opinion, I assert that, indeed, computers do have an impact on us, but for a beneficial reason. I am a sports enthusiast, so I participate in numerous sports. I use the computer occasionally for entertainment and research. It has no impact on me. It does not affect me at all because I still exercise and play with my friends very frequently, almost every day. There is no valid reason why people cannot use computers quite often. Computers do not always have a positive impact, but neither do they always have a negative impact. I exercise, appreciate nature, and interact with friends and family. I also use the computer regularly. Experts should not be overly concerned about people using computers excessively.
487	489	1	1	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 I am able to comprehend both perspectives of your argument regarding the significance of computers. Nevertheless, computers have revolutionized the way we lead our lives. For a moment, contemplate what the world would be like without computers. I believe that computers are an indispensable aspect of our lives. Computers are particularly crucial for students and teachers. For instance, if a student needs to conduct a report on @LOCATION1, they can search for facts and other relevant information about @LOCATION1. Subsequently, they can condense these facts into a paragraph in a word document. If they have a question, they can email their teachers. Finally, they can print out the completed report. All of this can be accomplished without having to trouble their parents to go to the bookstore and spend @NUM1 on a book that they will likely read only once. Additionally, without computers, there would be no means of communication outside of school. Another example of students using computers is online textbooks, which spare them from carrying heavy textbooks home. As I am aware, computers have facilitated my schoolwork and made it significantly easier. Secondly, @PERCENT1 of businesses claim that they use computers on a daily basis, and some concur that without computers, their businesses would fail. Computers streamline business operations, especially with the available business management and file - keeping programs. On a computer, businesses can store customer information, compare income, and maintain inventory records without having a disorganized pile or a cluttered filing cabinet. Computers can also save businesses money as they can eliminate jobs such as record - keepers. Moreover, businesses can save time by holding meetings via webcams instead of having employees travel from state to state for a single meeting, and then repeating the process in subsequent months. They can also email important items such as sales projections. Computers are also valuable and helpful in the home. People can do grocery shopping from home, order pizza online, and shop online. Additionally, people can pay their bills online, which conserves paper. Suppose a mother has a sick child. She wants to know how to heal the child, what to feed the child, and what medicine to administer. She can look up all this information on the computer and bookmark the websites for future reference. Then, if her other child is hungry, she can find a healthy snack, which she can do online. Next, if she wants to make chicken fried rice but does not know how, she can look up the recipe online. Finally, after dinner, if she needs to clean a stain on the carpet but cannot remove it, she can purchase a carpet cleaner from the web. Computers have truly made a mother's day much easier. Without computers, our lives would be far more arduous. If we did not have computers, the student doing a report on @LOCATION1 might have failed, the sick child might not have received proper care, the hungry child might have been fed unhealthy food, and @MONTH1 would have faced difficulties. Computers are an essential part of our lives.
488	490	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 Have you ever known someone who resides far away from you? Or have you ever utilized @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3? These are merely a few of the capabilities that a computer possesses. Computers have significantly benefited society. They enable people to engage in various activities, such as communicating with one another, acquiring skills through playing games, and providing visual content, making things more convenient. As previously mentioned, computers facilitate our communication with others. In this way, we are not required to interact with people in person. Without computers, if we wanted to talk to someone, three inconvenient scenarios would occur: getting in trouble at school, memorizing and dialing a phone number, or having a face - to - face conversation. Evidently, computers simplify the process of communicating with people. Moreover, computers allow us to communicate with friends or family who are located at a distance. One can write an email or engage in a chat with them. This has been beneficial to me as I communicate with a friend in @LOCATION1 and recently sent an email to my aunt. Undoubtedly, computers make it effortless for us to communicate with others, regardless of the distance. Secondly, every computer I have encountered is capable of playing some form of game, whether it is via a disk or on a website. These games can impart numerous skills. The first skill we can acquire is typing. Just a few days ago, I was playing a game where one has @NUM1 seconds to type as many words as possible, as quickly as possible. If a mistake is made, one second is deducted from the time remaining. The game also becomes more challenging as it progresses, starting from three - letter words and advancing to five - letter, seven - letter words, and so on. Additionally, a course at @CAPS4, information processing, is centered around computers. Once we completed our assignments, we could play ""Type to Learn @NUM2,"" which is also a typing game. As can be seen, some games can teach us how to type. Another type of game requires strategic thinking to win. This trains us to be prepared for almost any situation. It also teaches us to process our surroundings and make decisions promptly. In real - life situations, we @MONTH1 often have only a few seconds to react. Games of this nature are beneficial in real - life scenarios. The last type of game is tower defense. This game teaches teenagers to think as if their lives depend on it. If we were to join the army and become a captain, we would be able to organize our troops in the most effective manner. These tower defense games also train us to think and plan ahead. In these games, it costs money to buy upgrades and build @LOCATION1 towers. One must decide whether to purchase a weaker upgrade immediately or save for a stronger one later. Tower defense games help us make better decisions. Games @MONTH1 can be enjoyable, but they also teach us valuable skills. Lastly, computers simplify tasks and present visual content on @ORGANIZATION2. One aspect that computers make easier..."
489	491	1	1	"Dear, @CAPS1 Undoubtedly, an increasing number of people are using computers. The issue at hand is whether this is detrimental or beneficial. In my opinion, I concur that excessive computer use is harmful, as people are spending an inordinate amount of time on computers. I hold this view because people are spending more time on computers and less time engaging in physical exercise, appreciating nature, and interacting with family and friends. A clear example of the negative effects of excessive computer use can be seen in my acquaintance. I recall a time when he would spend most of his time on the computer, not for schoolwork. He would bring food upstairs, throw the plates on the floor, and simply keep eating and then go to sleep without doing anything productive. He would repeat this routine day after day. When I visited his house, it was always dirty. Despite our efforts to encourage him to clean up, he refused. After eating, when I invited him for a walk, I could @PERSON1 the lack of physical activity and the excessive calorie intake, yet he would say no, claiming he could ""walk"" on the computer. @CAPS3 Eventually, he became extremely overweight, and the doctor diagnosed him as obese. However, he did not seem to care. We continuously tried to persuade him to exercise, but it was in vain. Now, he has diabetes. We repeatedly told him that spending too much time on the computer is harmful. Another reason why excessive computer use is bad is that one needs to learn how to enjoy nature and go outside. I remember a time when my friend would stay in his house for days on end, glued to the computer. Whenever I invited him to come outside, he would always decline. @CAPS3 One day, he had to go outside to get new computer software. When he opened the door, he was frightened by the light and quickly ran back inside. This incident clearly demonstrates why spending too much time on computers is detrimental. It proves that we should get outside, play, and be active."
490	492	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I have taken note of your discussion regarding whether computers are a boon or a bane. Personally, I believe that computers are more of a negative influence. There are three primary reasons for this view: children do not engage in sufficient physical exercise, some individuals use computers for inappropriate activities, and excessive information sharing on computers can lead to harm or even death. The first reason is that the time spent on computers could be better utilized outdoors, enjoying the pleasant weather, provided it is a nice day. It is undeniable that one of the main factors contributing to the increasing obesity rate is the over - reliance on technology, particularly computers. The second reason is that some people use computers for inappropriate purposes. One might wonder why computer manufacturers do not block such content. It is truly astonishing that there are individuals who create such inappropriate websites. From my knowledge gained in computer class, computers can be misused in ways I never even imagined. The @CAPS1 and final reason is that some people have disclosed excessive personal information on computers, which has resulted in harm. The online world @MONTH1 may seem like a fun and harmless place until someone gets hurt, as my mother often says. In conclusion, it is evident that I am not a proponent of computers. The reasons for my dislike are that children do not exercise enough, some engage in inappropriate activities on computers, and computers have been associated with injury and, in some cases, death. These are the reasons why I believe computers can be a negative force. Therefore, I encourage you to keep these points in mind and consider the implications of this article.
491	493	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am convinced that computers confer substantial benefits upon society as they offer a more expeditious and efficient means of accomplishing various tasks. For instance, in the realm of communication, email serves as an invaluable tool, enabling individuals to interact with others when time constraints prevent phone conversations during work or when one wishes to avoid lengthy phone calls. It circumvents the inconvenience of waiting for the recipient to answer the phone, which might be unavailable due to a depleted battery, or the frustration of non - response when urgent information needs to be conveyed.  Moreover, computers are an unparalleled resource for information retrieval. When planning a trip, one can effortlessly explore hotel options, obtain maps, and book plane tickets, while also getting a visual preview of the destination. Similarly, for school projects, when time is scarce, the internet provides a wealth of knowledge. Whether it's researching a country, a president, an animal, or seeking relevant pictures, the internet has it all. Even for construction projects, such as plastering a wall, purchasing a window, or building a shed, one can find detailed instructions and source the necessary supplies online.  In the professional sphere, computers are indispensable. An architect, for example, can utilize computers to create a @NUM1 - scale sketch of a building. Additionally, in data storage, institutions like doctor's offices rely on computers to maintain patient @CAPS1, and the government stores sensitive @CAPS1 in computer systems. Furthermore, the computer industry generates employment opportunities in areas such as computer repair and manufacturing.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are integral to society. Without them, many individuals would be unemployed, and the execution of numerous tasks would become far more arduous and limited, particularly in terms of rapid communication and work guidance.
492	494	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, the @CAPS1 generation has grown up amidst the sophisticated technology of computers. Through years of personal experience, I have come to realize that computers are not as beneficial as they initially appear. They can lead to addiction and create a multitude of distractions.  Firstly, numerous medical professionals assert that computers contribute to ""the new depression,"" with the internet being the primary arena for this phenomenon. For a significant number of teenagers, having accounts on platforms like Facebook, MySpace, or Formspring is commonplace. From personal encounters, I am aware that some individuals misuse these social networks as a means to bully others. Consequently, people not only face ridicule in the physical world but also in the digital realm, which is a major contributor to social depression. Escaping this form of harassment is extremely challenging, and the resulting anxiety can take a toll on individuals.  Addiction to computers is another detrimental aspect. Many individuals become so engrossed in the internet that they spend a substantial portion of their leisure time online. Approximately @PERCENT1 of people admit to being addicted. Based on my @CAPS1 - based experience, there is always something on the internet that lures users back. One can be considered addicted if they spend more than an hour a day on the computer. While parents often attribute this to a lack of self - control, many adults also grapple with the same issue. As they are relatively new to using computers, they frequently go through a phase of addiction. This addiction problem could be completely eradicated if we ceased using computers.  Finally, computers pose numerous distractions for students. When students sit down to write papers, they often have multiple windows open simultaneously, resulting in minimal work being accomplished. Social networks exacerbate this problem by causing individuals to lose track of time through constant chatting. Attempting to multitask on the internet can lead to lower grades and missed homework deadlines.  In conclusion, computers do not offer any real assistance. They induce social depression, which gives rise to anxiety problems; they cause addiction, which can consume people's lives; and they create distractions that impede concentration. I firmly believe that computers have negative impacts and should be eliminated entirely."
493	495	1	1	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1, are you aware that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 obese children spend @NUM3 or more hours daily on a computer? While computers may be fast and convenient, their widespread use has contributed to our country's status as one of the most obese nations globally.  Computers are detrimental to humans for several reasons. Firstly, they prevent people from appreciating nature. As forests are being deforested and pollution is ravaging our planet, it is crucial for people to witness the beauty of the world firsthand if we are to preserve it. Secondly, computer usage encourages individuals to stay indoors. Depending on one's occupation or educational status, people may spend at least 6 - @NUM2 hours a day inside.  Moreover, computers detract from the time that should be spent with friends and family. Prolonged computer use can lead to individuals becoming anti - social, as they forget how to interact with others. With a large number of such people, our society may descend into chaos. Additionally, some individuals become so obsessed with computers that their families may abandon them, leading to depression.  Furthermore, computers are a waste of time, money, and effort. They also reduce the time available for exercise and maintaining good health. With less time for physical activity, people are unable to burn calories, leading to obesity. Moreover, a lack of exercise makes the body more susceptible to diseases and injuries. Finally, individuals without healthcare may struggle to pay medical bills and may even become homeless.  In conclusion, these factors clearly demonstrate why computers have a negative impact on our lives.
494	496	1	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, would you be content if your children were constantly engrossed in the computer? I certainly would not. When children or even adults spend excessive time on the computer, they neglect their families, compromise their health, and can become addicted to computer use and computer - specific language.  To begin with, a significant proportion of people, approximately @PERCENT2, spend the entire day on the computer, showing little concern for their children. I recall reading on Facebook about a man who was so absorbed in a game that he ignored the phone call informing him that his son had been hit by a car. @CAPS2, would you want your child to endure such a traumatic experience? I doubt it.  Secondly, excessive computer use leads to poor health and a lack of exercise. A study indicates that @PERCENT3 of internet users do not engage in physical activity. Among this group, @PERCENT4 suffer from obesity. My cousin, who is constantly on the computer, was advised by his doctor to reduce his screen time due to his obesity. He weighs @NUM1 pounds as a result of his sedentary lifestyle. @CAPS2, would you want your children to face similar health issues?  Lastly, in today's society, many children are ""obsessed"" with computers. @PERCENT1 of computer users incorporate computer - specific language in school. Moreover, a portion of this group installs internet access on their phones to access social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook. @CAPS2, what would happen if you used computer language in your newspaper article? You would likely be fired.  In conclusion, I earnestly hope that you will take this letter into consideration. Excessive computer use leads to poor health, addiction, and a breakdown in family relationships."
495	497	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers are having a profound impact on the lives of many individuals. An increasing number of people are becoming enthralled by the capabilities of computers and are neglecting other more significant aspects of life. People should be engaging in physical exercise and spending quality time with friends and family. In reality, computers do not offer as much educational value as one might assume.  One of the most significant drawbacks of computers is their impact on physical health. People are not getting enough exercise, which is evident in the fact that this generation has a higher prevalence of overweight and obese children compared to any other. Individuals become so preoccupied with their computer activities that they forget to exercise regularly. Computers simply add to the list of excuses for inactivity, similar to the way excessive television watching does. Studies have shown that both television and computers reduce people's awareness and connection to the world and the people around them. One may intend to spend only a short time on the computer but end up losing track of time, with @NUM1 hours passing in an instant. While computers may stimulate the brain to some extent, they do not promote physical well - being, which is of utmost importance.  Even when using computers for academic research, there are significant issues. Many people turn to computers because they lack the time to visit the library. However, a large proportion of websites do not provide accurate information. One may read information that seems plausible but is actually incorrect, leading to poor grades on assignments. Moreover, many individuals are unsure where to find reliable information. They simply enter their query into a search engine and click on the first link, often using information without verifying its authenticity. This can lead to a maze of pop - up windows and confusion, causing people to give up and waste time on the computer.  If people were to visit the library and conduct research in the traditional manner, they would become more aware of the many aspects of life that they are currently missing. Instead of focusing on computer games, people should prioritize their relationships with family and friends. While it is possible to communicate with others on the computer, it is not the same as building a deep connection and understanding their emotions. It is far more beneficial to spend time with loved ones in person, engaging in activities such as board games or meaningful conversations.  In conclusion, computers are not as helpful as they seem. They contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, provide false information, and distract people from the important relationships in their lives. It is evident that the presence of computers is not as advantageous as it is often portrayed.
496	498	1	1	"To the individuals at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, envision a world bereft of @CAPS7 computers. In such a scenario, drivers would be struggling, having difficulty maintaining control of the wheel and navigating the road. Phone bills would soar as the entire world would have limited means of communication. Moreover, students would be extremely anxious at home, lacking books for study. Computers exert influence over all these aspects of our lives. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, enable us to communicate with others in numerous ways, and allow students to learn and stay informed from the comfort of their homes. Computers must remain an indispensable part of our daily existence.  To commence, computers should persist in our community as they even instruct young children in hand - eye coordination. A recent report by the @ORGANIZATION2 indicates that in the past five years, the number of driving students who pass on their first attempt has nearly doubled. Video games, computer mice, and even typing train the brain at a young age to function in harmony with the body's arms, fingers, and other appendages. ""@CAPS5's not solely on the road where hand - eye coordination matters,"" remarks @PERSON1, the head of surgery at @ORGANIZATION1 hospital. ""@CAPS6 observes that younger doctors, those who grew up with video and computer games, can perform robotic surgery with far greater precision than our senior attendings."" Without the coordination we acquire from computers, many jobs would be unattainable. When queried, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 managers of local businesses stated that they would prefer someone with typing skills over someone without. Thus, although one might think computers do not teach coordination, they actually do so for the entirety of a person's life.  Secondly, computers should be an integral part of homes as they facilitate people to communicate with others globally. In a @DATE1 poll, only @PERCENT1 of @NUM3 - year - olds had e - pals, yet a recent poll reveals that @PERCENT2 now possess them. Computers have opened up avenues for communication such as e - mail, @CAPS8, and social networking sites, to name a few. Parenting @CAPS9 asserts that parents prefer their teens to use e - mail or @CAPS8 rather than talk on the phone as it keeps the house quiet, frees up the phone lines for others, and keeps phone bills low. My friend once only communicated online for a month, and her parents encouraged her as the phone bill decreased by a third. It is evident that even though one might feel that computers consume time that could be spent with others, they are actually a means to communicate with people everywhere.  Finally, computers can aid students in learning. In today's schools, students rely on homework being posted online and obtaining their books via the web. Once, my brother forgot to take his book - bag home for a week and was able to access all the necessary materials online. We were grateful for the relief from the physical burden. When asked, @PERCENT3 of @NUM4 graders stated that they use e - books at least twice a week. The internet is also a valuable research tool. @NUM5 out of @NUM2 high - schoolers claim that they use a book for research less than once a month. As can be seen, the internet is a valuable learning resource.  In conclusion, computers assist us with coordination, communication, and education. They have only positive impacts on people and society as a whole."
497	499	1	1	In contemporary times, a substantial number of individuals utilize computers. These devices enable family members and friends to interact, conduct research on various places and concepts, and allow for the creation of neatly formatted documents. Conversely, computer technology can impede people from engaging in physical activity, exploring nature, and having in - person conversations with family and friends. I intend to convey my personal stance on computers.  I can sincerely state that I am fond of computers. I dedicate a significant amount of time to @CAPS3 as it enables me to converse with friends whom I do not always have the opportunity to meet in person. I can even keep abreast of my cousin's well - being in @LOCATION1. Computers also prove beneficial for my homework. When working on projects related to a subject that I do not fully comprehend, I can simply access my laptop, search for the required information, and @CAPS1!, I have the data I need. Subsequently, I can type up my report and select a few pictures for printing. Clearly, computers are excellent!  However, I can appreciate the opposing view. Computers can be time - consuming. I admit that I have spent hours at a stretch on the computer, which has become an issue. Experts contend that people are starting to allocate excessive time to computers and less time to the real world. A prime example is my brother. He is enamored with the @CAPS2. My mother will call him down for dinner, but he becomes so engrossed in what he is doing that he skips the meal. His friends will call him, and he disregards them until he finishes his game.  I concur that individuals should not spend an inordinate amount of time on computers. You may have read this and wondered about my stance. I can honestly say that although I was supposed to choose one side, the reality is that I am attached to my laptop and addicted to @CAPS3. Nevertheless, I still participate in sports, communicate with my family, and enjoy taking walks in the woods or on the beach. I hold a neutral position, similar to @CAPS4 from @CAPS5. Scientists assert that computers have a positive impact on people, while some experts express concerns about their negative effects. @PERSON1 claims that both perspectives are valid. Computers are remarkable and are among the most rapidly evolving technologies in our world. However, we need not spend @CAPS6 of our time on them. I hope you understand my viewpoint on this matter.
498	500	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I concur that technology exerts a positive influence on people. Similar to other electronic devices, computers can enhance hand - eye coordination. Additionally, some individuals, such as teachers, aim to harness the internet to facilitate students' learning about people and places. Others simply desire to communicate with family or friends residing in different towns, states, countries, or continents. After reading this letter, you will understand my rationale.  Firstly, these technology - enhanced dictionaries contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. Prior to the advent of computers, people had limited success in writing rapidly. They resorted to making short notes or using shorthand notations like w/ or. Presently, people can write more quickly and form complete words and sentences. They can express their thoughts clearly when they put them into full sentences. When engaging in computer games, one can further improve hand - eye coordination. These are just the initial three reasons.  Secondly, teachers utilize computers to handle a substantial amount of schoolwork and gather information about history and geography. Similar to an online schoolbook, a computer can provide information on virtually any topic. It can determine when @PERSON1 was born, when the dinosaurs became extinct, and even what the government is currently doing. A computer can also store the knowledge one acquires. Moreover, it is equipped with search engines like @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2 that assist in locating information. Statistics reveal that more than @PERCENT1 of the world's population employs search engines to find something on the computer. Search engines offer access to websites, pictures, movies, maps, and more. This is why people use computers for research.  Have you ever felt reluctant to travel across the @LOCATION2 just to visit your relatives? Well, I have a solution. Computers offer a plethora of means to interact with others. The primary mode of communication is e - mail, which is akin to a letter but transmitted electronically. There is also @CAPS1, which functions in a similar manner. If you purchase a special camera that connects to your computer, you can have a personal conversation with your relatives. You no longer need to travel to see your relatives in @LOCATION1. This is the final reason why computers have positive effects on people.  Most people use computers effectively. They develop hand - eye coordination, learn important facts about places and people, and can communicate with others. As you can see, computers are valuable and a positive component of society.
499	501	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, do you concur with my assertion that people are spending more time on computers than engaging in exercise? Firstly, an increasing number of people are using computers, but what benefits do they actually derive from this? Secondly, they are allocating excessive time to their computers at the expense of physical exercise. Finally, they are spending less and less time with their families and being physically active.  To begin with, an escalating number of people are using computers, yet it is questionable how this benefits them. Computers are an addictive technology that can render one lethargic and sluggish. Can using the computer @CAPS6 resolve the problems one has with their family? @CAPS11! I speak from personal experience. My mother is constantly on Facebook, and I detest it. I feel that she loves the computer more than @CAPS7. Do you want your kids to have such thoughts about you? As days pass, her time on the computer increases, and @CAPS1 sits there, in need of @CAPS6 for homework, while I'm thinking @CAPS2 @CAPS3 YOU @CAPS4""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS9. I think this way because @CAPS3. I know it might seem harsh, but @CAPS1 is merely stating that computers, in this way, offer no benefit to anyone.  Secondly, I wish to inform the @CAPS12 @CAPS13 paper that people are spending more time on computers than exercising. The obesity rate has reached an all - time high. I believe it has increased by @PERCENT1! This is unacceptable! People return home with @CAPS15.K and other fast - food items, @NUM1, and then proceed to use the computer while eating. Over time, one gains weight, and their appearance deteriorates. They start to look unkempt, and no one wants to be around them. Looking back, they will regret their actions.  Finally, spending less and less time with family causes a rift to develop. Children pick up bad habits and act contrary to what their parents desire. This indicates that computers are of no use in this regard.  In conclusion, I have informed you of my reasons for disliking computers. They do not benefit you, make you lazy, and keep you away from your kids. So, does the local @CAPS13 paper concur?"
500	502	1	1	Dear local newspaper, some individuals are beginning to believe that computers are having a detrimental impact on people. @CAPS1 is also of this opinion as some people spend the entire day on computers, become addicted to them, and lose all motivation to do anything else.  The first reason why computers are affecting people is that some individuals study on them all day. After school or work, they immediately turn to the computer. They remain on it from @NUM1 to @NUM2 at night and repeat the same behavior the next day. Another reason is that people become addicted to computers because they are surrounded by virtual friends. Additionally, when people focus on the computer, they lose touch with reality. The final reason is that people just sit in front of the computer all day.  These are the reasons why people become overly reliant on computers and lose the ability to function effectively in the real world.
501	503	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I contend that there is no impropriety in utilizing the computer. In my view, the computer facilitates learning about novel technological aspects, such as educational games or innovative websites. Moreover, employing the computer enables communication with acquaintances whom one may not have contacted in a while and whose contact numbers are unknown. I opine that possessing a computer enhances intellectual capabilities, as individuals engage in other activities beyond being perpetually glued to the screen. When not using the computer, one may socialize with friends or family, partake in meals, rest, exercise, or complete tasks like homework. I firmly believe that computer usage is a component of a healthy lifestyle, offering a wealth of knowledge beyond one's expectations. The educational value derived from using a computer parallels that of traditional schooling. Additionally, computer use can be beneficial for hand health, as continuous hand movement strengthens muscles in the hands and forearms. In conclusion, I assert that computers are conducive to well - being and do not encroach upon time allocated for exercise, socializing with loved ones, participating in sports, sleeping, or eating. Computers are unequivocally advantageous. Therefore, individuals should continue using their computers while ensuring a balanced daily routine.
502	504	1	1	"Click, click, click, ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2, alas, your computer has frozen. What course of action will you pursue now? Computers exert a positive influence on individuals as they impart knowledge, foster social interaction, and enhance skills. Without a computer, one would be at a disadvantage. Have you ever faced the predicament of needing to conduct a research project but lacking access to your local library? Fear not, @CAPS3, for having a computer at home suffices. One can simply sit down, input a few queries, and acquire all the requisite information and more! The computer allows for comprehensive research on virtually any subject, as it encompasses a vast repository of data. Perhaps one wishes to explore a new topic for which limited printed resources exist; in such a scenario, the computer emerges as a reliable ally. Many individuals erroneously assume that computers serve solely for entertainment purposes, such as gaming during leisure time. What they fail to recognize are the numerous research engines like Google, Netrekker, @LOCATION1, etc., brimming with erudite information. Some individuals engage in reading to augment their knowledge, right? The same can be achieved using a computer, which might even prove more engaging than a mundane library book. Have you ever mused, ""The computer is merely a means for people to isolate themselves and have solitary time""? @CAPS3, if you harbored such thoughts, you were mistaken! There are numerous avenues for socializing via the computer, including email, instant messaging, and video chatting. The computer offers diverse communication channels. It is an astonishing technology, as one can communicate with someone in a different country at the click of a button. Have you heard of social networking? The term is self - explanatory. Through a network, one can interact with people worldwide. For instance, there are platforms like MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc. This is an enjoyable way to connect with relatives one has never met, distant friends, or friends of friends. One can even be sociable and meet new people, provided safety precautions are observed. You @MONTH1 might be thinking at this juncture that a computer is solely for research and socializing. Once again, you are incorrect. Computers are an effective tool for skill development. For example, they enhance hand - eye coordination. One looks at the screen, types, glances at the screen again, and clicks the mouse, which significantly improves coordination. Additionally, hand movement becomes more proficient. When typing, fingers move across the keyboard, building hand muscles. Computers not only aid in physical skill development but also enhance research abilities. There are specific methods for effective information retrieval, which can be beneficial for future research and academic pursuits. Without these benefits, would one not be lacking? Computers play a pivotal role in everyone's lives, regardless of age. Undoubtedly, computers have a positive impact on individuals."
503	505	1	1	"Do you own a computer? I wager that @PERCENT2 of you do! You @MONTH1 may spend @NUM1 hours or even @NUM2 hours on the computer. In fact, computers present several drawbacks. One may become so engrossed that they never venture outdoors or engage in physical activity. Moreover, sitting @NUM2 inches from the computer screen is detrimental to eyesight. Lastly, the internet hosts numerous inappropriate websites that children should not access. Are you a child who spends @NUM4 to @NUM2 hours consecutively on the computer? If so, it is time to vacate the swiveling computer chair and breathe in some fresh air. Most children spend the majority of their time on the computer @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. While it may be beneficial for children to interact with peers outside of school, some take it to an extreme. They never go outside to exercise, which is detrimental to a growing adolescent. They need to be active. Therefore, limit the time spent on the computer. Undoubtedly, computers have a negative impact on eyesight. Unlike @CAPS4 or video games that can be played from a distance, a computer is used @NUM2 - 7 inches away. Over time, the eyes become accustomed to this proximity, making it difficult to read when one moves back. I know of a child who played video games from about @NUM8 feet away for extended periods each day. Unfortunately, that child is now blind. Had that child been aware of the consequences of sitting so close to a @CAPS4 screen, they would have reconsidered. Think twice about your proximity to the computer screen. If I were to inquire what one could find on the internet, @PERCENT1 of you would reply, ""anything."" Can there truly be an overabundance of information? Indeed, there can. One may be researching a topic, and inappropriate content unrelated to the subject may appear. Children should not be exposed to such inappropriate sites. It is harmful to them, so put an end to it! After reading this essay, I hope you have recognized that computers are detrimental in various ways, physically, mentally, and socially. Therefore, the next time you use a computer, consider the broader implications rather than just the immediate experience."
504	506	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I am writing to express my stance on the matter of computer usage. I am aware that opinions on computers are divided; some believe they are highly useful, while others think they are a waste of time due to excessive usage. In my view, computers offer numerous advantages. They provide a means to stay in touch with friends and conduct research on topics of interest without the need to visit a library and search for specific books. Computers are also valuable as they grant access to online resources that may not be available in physical form or are difficult to obtain. For instance, when one is young and has lost touch with friends, the computer can be used to search for them online or exchange emails. Additionally, if a family member lives far away and phone calls are costly, instant messaging can be used to communicate without incurring expenses. Moreover, in cases where accessing a library is problematic, the computer allows one to search for information online. It is available around the clock. Computers are also beneficial for completing homework. If one encounters difficulties, the computer can offer assistance. Furthermore, if one needs to purchase something but cannot afford it, online shopping often provides more affordable options, and some online - only items may not have a physical counterpart. However, it is important to note that while computers are useful, excessive use should be avoided. They are helpful for maintaining social connections, academic pursuits, and various other aspects of life, but a balanced approach is essential.
505	507	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that a significant number of individuals are not reaping the benefits of computer usage. There are numerous alternative activities that people can engage in rather than spending excessive time on the computer. By devoting too much time to the computer, people are reducing their physical activity, missing out on the beauty of nature, and neglecting social interaction with family and friends. Consequently, they are not deriving many advantages from computer use. As previously mentioned, individuals who overuse computers tend to exercise less. This lack of physical activity can have a profound impact on their health. According to recent studies by @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of heavy computer users are overweight. This is an alarmingly high statistic! The fact that computers are affecting so many people's lives in this negative way is absurd. So many people should not be overweight. Moreover, those who do not exercise regularly may become addicted to the computer. Once addicted, they @MONTH1 may start engaging in inappropriate behavior on the computer, such as publishing offensive content, visiting absurd websites, and viewing disturbing material. Watching such inappropriate content is perhaps the most harmful, as it can have a negative influence on others. Additionally, excessive computer use can damage eyesight. Staring at the computer screen all day can make the eyes unaccustomed to seeing other things, making it difficult for them to adjust from one visual stimulus to another. Clearly, excessive computer use is detrimental to health. Another drawback of excessive computer use is the failure to appreciate nature. As you @MONTH1 may know, breathing fresh air is beneficial for everyone. It is always pleasant to inhale the fresh @DATE1 air after a long day at school. However, many people do not take advantage of this because they rush to the computer as soon as they get home. These individuals are missing out on a great deal of rejuvenation. I recently interviewed @PERSON1, who stated that ""many people are unaware of what is happening in the world because of computers."" They never take the time to observe their surroundings. Staying informed about nature can be beneficial, as one never knows what topics may arise in school. Additionally, there are always animals in need of help. Have you ever encountered a situation where a stray dog needs a home? I have, and by assisting these animals, one can save a life. Many people miss this opportunity because they are glued to the computer. Evidently, many people are missing out on the wonders of nature. My final point is that excessive computer use hinders social interaction with family and friends. In some cases, it is the parents who are addicted to the computer. As a parent, one has a responsibility to assist the family with daily chores. Although these tasks may be tedious, they are essential for the well - being of the family. Moreover, parents are needed to help their children. Some children are too young to find information for a project on their own, and that is where parents come in. However, if the parent is on the computer, they cannot fulfill this role. I know that my younger brother is always seeking help. Additionally, family parties and computer use do not mix. From personal experience, when family members visit, my brother sits on the computer without even greeting anyone. I find this extremely rude and hope that family members are not offended. Clearly, computer use takes time away from family. In conclusion, people should limit their computer usage. Excessive computer use leads to insufficient exercise, a lack of appreciation for nature, and less time spent with family. Thank you for considering my opinion."
506	508	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, since the invention of electricity, technology has advanced at a breakneck pace. Computers have evolved from room - sized behemoths to twelve - inch flat - screen monitors. In contemporary society, computers are indispensable tools that facilitate file organization, research, and enjoyable online networking. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow individuals with the ability to explore distant locales, and enable people to socialize online. Would life not be arduous without computers? While routinely performing our daily computer tasks, we rarely recognize that writing often overworks the nerves in the hand, leading to tendonitis or arthritis; typing on computers is faster and less detrimental to the hands. ""Hand - eye coordination aids in enhancing balance and athleticism,"" stated @PERSON1, the chief orthopedic surgeon of @ORGANIZATION1. Some individuals hold a contrary view, believing that excessive computer use can contribute to a lack of physical activity. There are several portable computer devices, such as a @CAPS3, that can be taken outdoors for use while walking. Ever since I was ten years old, I have dreamed of visiting @LOCATION1. Although I could not afford a plane ticket to @LOCATION1, I was able to utilize the internet to take virtual tours of the vibrant landscapes and ancient historical sites across the country. With the assistance of the internet, I was able to behold a far - off place and experience the country as if I were physically present. @PERSON2, the creator of an online webcom named @ORGANIZATION2, developed this computer system to enable people worldwide to connect by providing them with the opportunity to see and converse with whomever they choose. I frequently employ this program to communicate with my sister at college. Through this program, we can socialize as if she were at home and learn about her college experiences."
507	509	1	1	Dear editor of the local newspaper, @CAPS1, are you aware that the average individual spends three or more hours daily on the computer? The time squandered staring at a blank screen could be devoted to community service, exercise, or simply enjoying the company of others. All this precious time is wasted due to computers. Prolonged computer use diminishes the time spent with family and friends, poses health risks, and, in some cases, @MONTH1, becomes addictive. Firstly, computers @MONTH1 impede the time one can spend with family and friends. Often, after a long day at work or school, people seek solace in the digital world. However, more relaxing alternatives include engaging in a family game or going out with friends. After all, human relationships are transient, and each moment spent together is invaluable. This precious time is usurped by computer technology, which outlasts humans and offers no comfort during difficult times. For instance, a teenager being bullied online would find no respite on the computer. In contrast, if they were to interact with their family or friends, they could share laughter and uplift everyone's spirits. @CAPS2, time allocated to the computer is time subtracted from family and friends. Secondly, computers can be detrimental to health. Staring at the screen strains the eyes, especially for those with visual impairments. Excessive typing and the need to spend more time on the computer reduce opportunities for physical activity. Moreover, if someone discovers a captivating website, they may be compelled to visit it frequently, perhaps multiple times a day. Alongside websites, @CAPS3 games and social networks are also highly addictive. Computer addiction can lead to health issues, as previously discussed, and withdrawal symptoms when one attempts to quit. It is crucial that individuals curtail their computer usage to prevent addiction before it takes hold. In conclusion, computer technology is harming humanity and may be hindering the realization of greater potential in individuals' lives. There is less time for meaningful interactions with loved ones, more negative health impacts, and a growing number of computer addicts due to modern technology. However, all these issues could be mitigated if people simply reduced their computer time.
508	510	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, although computers do yield positive effects, their negative impacts far outweigh the positive ones. @CAPS2 bullying occurs daily. Moreover, when computers are present, children are less likely to engage in physical exercise. These devices also impair human eyesight. @CAPS2 bullying is the most pernicious consequence of computers. It has affected numerous individuals, and we have lost many to its devastating effects. @CAPS2 bullying afflicts @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 children. It is a scourge that must be eradicated, as it has driven some children to commit suicide. Not only that, but it has also threatened and taken the lives of children. Without computers, this blight would be eliminated. Childhood obesity is a significant problem in @LOCATION1, and computers are partly to blame. Children should be outdoors, playing with their friends, rather than being glued to the computer. Computers are an addiction that children struggle to overcome. However, computers are not only harmful to children; they also pose risks to adults. Staring at a computer screen for an extended period can damage eyesight. Vision is, in most cases, the most crucial sense for human existence. Now, you can understand why computers do not contribute positively to society. Online, people are subjected to extreme harassment. The bright computer screens are harmful to the delicate human eyes. Children should be exercising outdoors instead of sitting at home in front of the computer. Everyone should disconnect their computers permanently and refrain from using them again.
509	511	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I contend that a computer is not inherently detrimental. A computer can assist in a multitude of tasks. @CAPS1 can facilitate learning, enable communication with friends, and provide entertainment. It can pave the way for success in life. @CAPS1 can help one acquire knowledge in fields such as computer engineering. Computer engineering is a lucrative profession that involves computer repair. Initially, @CAPS1 may present challenges, but by consulting search websites, one can find solutions to all queries. Chatting is a popular activity among children, adults, and teenagers. @CAPS1 has both advantages and disadvantages. It is beneficial as it helps reduce phone bills, thereby saving money. However, it can be harmful as it may damage eyesight if one gets too close to the screen. The computer offers a wealth of entertainment options, with millions of websites to explore. For example, @CAPS2.com, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS3.com are three of my favorite sites, offering numerous games for both children and adults. I have demonstrated that computers are not harmful, as they aid in learning, reduce phone expenses, and provide entertainment. Although they may encroach on exercise time or harm eyesight, one can set time limits to mitigate these issues. Just ensure not to sit too close to the screen, as @CAPS1 can be detrimental to eyesight.
510	512	1	1	Dear People, computers are not entirely beneficial. @CAPS1, when one contemplates it, they often find themselves reluctant to disengage from continuous chatting or social networking. There is always something to do on the computer, yet this time is often wasted. One can engage in various activities, but excessive computer use is a waste of time. @CAPS1, if you have children, you should spend quality time with them. You can assist them with their homework, have meals together, watch TV, and simply relax. However, some individuals, such as mothers with children, spend excessive time online and neglect their family. It is essential to allocate time for children to prevent them from developing不良 habits and staying out late. One also needs to make time for personal activities, such as house cleaning, cooking for one's spouse, going shopping, taking children to the mall, and enjoying life. Computers offer little of value and only make us lazy. @CAPS1, if you are employed, you should focus on your work and perhaps socialize with friends. Avoid spending @NUM1 on the computer. You can engage in other activities, such as inviting friends over, going shopping, or cleaning your house. Computers offer nothing of real worth and are merely a waste of time, especially when used for excessive social networking. There are indeed positive aspects of computers. They allow us to find information, view various content, and communicate with distant family members. @CAPS1, when used appropriately, computers are useful, but if one is constantly logged into Facebook or other platforms, it is not advisable. One can go to the beach or the gym instead of sitting online for hours. Try to limit online time and go out to enjoy other activities.
511	513	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am penning this letter on behalf of all the industrious individuals in our nation. We have reached the conclusion that we do not merely desire, but rather necessitate computers in our lives. Firstly, we require them to communicate with others. Secondly, we need computers to conduct research for academic and professional purposes. Lastly, we children need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. Communication holds great significance in daily life. For instance, I have a grandmother who resides in @LOCATION1. I only have the opportunity to see her in person once or twice a year. Throughout the entire year, I engage in video chats with her via the @CAPS3 computer because it is far more convenient than traveling there. Without computers to enable video chats with @CAPS3 grandmother, I would have no communication with her except for those one or two times a year. Utilizing a computer for communication is extremely beneficial as it allows you to accomplish numerous tasks without the need for travel, such as video chatting. Another reason why computers are indispensable in our lives is that they simplify and expedite research. Many children nowadays have a substantial amount of homework and spend a considerable amount of time on the internet. For example, I myself have found that the internet is a rapid means of obtaining research. Moreover, the research I have discovered is just as accurate as that found in a library book. Computers are absolutely essential when children have a heavy load of homework and projects that require research. Consider the situation when it comes time to type up essays and prompts; it is almost unimaginable. Just on @DATE1, I had to type an English essay and a fluent paragraph. Fortunately, I was able to do so on a computer. Typing on the computer is also prevalent outside of school. For instance, @CAPS3's father frequently types up documents and essays for his company. Nowadays, in order to achieve perfection, many things must be written on the computer; otherwise, you will not obtain the desired results. In conclusion, computers are modern devices, and we must learn to live with them. Computers facilitate excellent communication with people both near and far. Additionally, they enhance the efficiency of academic research. Finally, computers enable us to type papers and essays more rapidly. Computers are a necessity for modern living.
512	514	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, People are allocating an excessive amount of @ORGANIZATION1 their time to the computer. Instead of experiencing the @ORGANIZATION1 firsthand, they are observing it through videos or @CAPS2 on the internet. It is not natural for individuals to become internet enthusiasts. Earth is a magnificent planet, boasting trees, mountains, seas, and humans. We created the internet, yet people seem to cherish it more than the very planet they inhabit. The planet should be explored physically, not virtually through the web. People should witness the @ORGANIZATION1 before nature's beauty is obscured by cities and factories. People rely on the internet excessively for planning, business, entertainment, and social interaction! All of these activities were achievable with relative ease even before the invention of the light bulb. Life is a precious gift, yet people squander it on a virtual existence. For example, @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most popular and addictive games ever created. In this game, you create a character in a medieval - like planet and engage in battles with monsters alongside other players. Some people believe that this game is more enjoyable than real life (personally, I concur), but it is not their actual life. It is merely a fantasy for people to escape their mundane lives. I write this in the hope that someday people will recognize that this is the true essence of life. So, embrace it.
513	515	1	1	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, it is indeed true that technology is blinding everyone. An increasing number of people are becoming engrossed in electronics, while fewer are concerned about our planet. There are numerous remarkable aspects of the world that could be jeopardized. Some people in @MONTH1 claim that spending a great deal of time on the computer will enable them to discover cures for diseases. These are merely false pretexts to remain idle and waste their lives in front of the computer. What will become of all the sports in the world? Athletes will age and retire, and if no one steps up to replace them, the games will be canceled. I am an avid fan of football and do not wish to see it discontinued. Some of my friends admit to being addicted to the computer, and I constantly hope they break this habit. Consider what will happen when they grow older; they will need a @CAPS2. If they remain addicted, they will lack the motivation to obtain a @CAPS2, which means they will have no income, be unable to pay bills, and may even lose their homes. Why do people assert that they can find cures by simply searching on the computer? We all know this is untrue. They need to acquire in - depth knowledge first, not just rely on online searches. They may not want to, but they must consult books and engage in profound thinking before they can find the cures. I sincerely hope that the way people live changes rapidly because the situation could deteriorate significantly. If we halt this lifestyle, things could improve, our planet @CAPS3 will endure longer, and we can make it a better place.
514	516	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have recently become aware of the debate regarding whether computers are over - utilized. While computers can have adverse health effects, I generally believe they are beneficial. They offer numerous opportunities that would otherwise be unattainable. I will elaborate on my perspective in the following letter. First, I will expound on one of the advantages of computers: their role in education and academic work. Computers provide individuals with means to conduct research. For students, it might involve researching for a project or an essay. For adults, it could be gathering information about starting a business. In both cases, computers enable us to obtain information more conveniently than, for example, visiting a library. Personally, I am familiar with a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can administer online tests to students. This would not be feasible without computers. Computer - based online courses can also be taken, allowing students to receive instruction via the internet rather than in person. This can be advantageous for those who are unable to attend classes regularly. I would also like to highlight that computers offer a prevalent form of communication, such as email and I @CAPS3. These communication methods have gained immense popularity recently, and I utilize both. I recognize that for some individuals, it can be detrimental as it hinders their interaction with the real world. However, overall, I believe it is beneficial. It also provides parents and teachers with an additional means of communication. These are just a few of the many ways in which computers are useful. Lastly, I would like to discuss how computers can specifically benefit adults. I am aware that many people pay their bills online. This is because, when you consider it, isn't it cumbersome to mail your bills every month? Computers significantly reduce this inconvenience. They also simplify the process of purchasing necessary items, searching for jobs, and performing many other tasks. Without computers, activities like job - hunting would require far more effort than they do with them. These, once again, are only a fraction of the hundreds, if not thousands, of ways in which computers are helpful. In conclusion, I believe I have clearly conveyed my point. Anything in moderation is acceptable. Those who argue that computers are unhealthy are referring to individuals who overuse them. Generally, this is not the norm. Usually, computers do more good than harm and can greatly enhance a person's life. They are extremely beneficial for education, and this alone should be sufficient to convince you that computers are valuable. I hope I have made my stance clear and that you concur with me.
515	517	1	1	Dear local newspaper, Computers are relatively new inventions, and almost everyone owns one and desires to have one! There are numerous excellent applications for them. However, are they being overused? As a student and a teenager, I am acutely aware that I am using my computer far more than necessary. Admittedly, they are entertaining and highly useful, but they are also time - consuming. You may be engaged in work or chatting with a friend, but you are simply sitting there. Spending time on the computer detracts from opportunities for exercise and other activities. I am definitely not suggesting that you completely abandon using your computer because it is a remarkable invention. However, why sit at a computer chatting with a friend who lives just down the street when you could be outdoors playing a game of kickball or engaging in other enjoyable activities? It would be prudent to use online communication primarily for friends and family who live far away, such as in other states. Another appropriate time to use your computer is when you are working on projects, homework, or conducting research for your job. Computers are an excellent tool in these situations. However, many people abuse this privilege by visiting websites that are unrelated to their research. Therefore, if you need a computer for school or work, stay focused! By doing so, you will accomplish your tasks efficiently. If you are a student or have a job, which is the case for most people, it is difficult not to use the computer. There are numerous useful functions for it. However, this does not mean you should be on it all day and night. Set aside approximately @NUM1 minutes to an hour each day to communicate with those you rarely see and conduct your research. Then, get up and enjoy the beauty of nature. You do not need more than an hour. I strongly concur with the experts that people are spending an excessive amount of time on their computers. Use it to your advantage and for productive purposes, not just to avoid boredom. Do not abuse your access to the internet. If you need to conduct research, complete the task and stay on track. Remember, an hour a day is more than sufficient! So, step away from your computers, go outside, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
516	518	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, In contemporary times, an increasing number of individuals are incorporating computers into their daily lives. Some individuals contend that computers represent an enhancement to society. Conversely, others express concerns that people allocate an excessive amount of time to computers, thereby neglecting physical activity and quality time with friends and family. I am of the conviction that computers can have detrimental effects. I hold this view because some individuals spend an inordinate amount of time on them, which is one of the primary causes of obesity, and it disrupts people's social lives. According to recent studies, approximately @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals spend the majority of their time on their computers. Many of these individuals devote their time to online games and social networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace. Others utilize it for shopping or learning. Some of the online games include World of Warcraft, RuneScape, and numerous @CAPS1's @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 games. Many individuals who spend the majority of their time on the computer are or @MONTH1 have become obese. According to @PERSON1, spending a significant amount of time on the computer is one of the principal reasons for obesity. Many experts concur that computers are the leading cause of obesity. Between @DATE1 and @DATE2, more people have been using their computers more frequently. The obesity rate has also increased during this period. Most individuals who spend a substantial amount of time on the computer do not interact extensively with their friends and family. This can result in damaged relationships, the loss of friends, and the potential for estrangement from family. Many experts, such as @PERSON2, assert that an individual can become depressed from a lack of interaction with friends and family. He also states that some of the individuals who become depressed begin to contemplate suicide. Spending an excessive amount of time on the computer is detrimental. Would you still choose to spend excessive time on the computer after being aware of its drawbacks? I firmly believe that spending an excessive amount of time on the computer is harmful to everyone.
517	519	1	1	"Dear Readers, In today's world, computers have a significant presence. The majority of individuals in the @LOCATION1 possess at least one computer, and the number continues to rise. These computers are detrimental to people. They incur substantial costs, cause individuals to cease exercising and become unhealthy, and instill in children the notion that things in life come easily. Computers entail a considerable financial burden. When considering the purchase of a computer, the acquisition of hardware and protection, and the payment for maintenance, they are extremely expensive. Dr. @PERSON2, a computer science expert, asserts, ""The average computer costs @MONEY1. Subsequently, there is a need to purchase and replace hardware, along with antivirus programs and other protective measures. At the very least, we could be looking at @MONEY2. With annual maintenance costing approximately @MONEY3 per year, one can clearly perceive the high cost of these machines."" @CAPS1 out of every ten computer owners in a recent survey indicated that they had to service their computers within the last three months. That represents a substantial amount of money being allocated towards computer repairs. However, computers do not solely give rise to financial problems; there are also health issues. Computers consume a significant amount of people's time. When using a computer, the user remains sedentary and does not engage in physical activity. Computers are contributing to people's poor health. The obesity rate in the @LOCATION1 has soared, and it is not solely attributable to diet. Some experts are now attributing computer use to a lack of exercise and, consequently, obesity. Dr. @DR1 @CAPS2 states, ""Regardless of what one is doing on a computer, whether it be playing games or engaging in educational activities, it would be more beneficial to be outside, moving around, and getting exercise. A recent study reveals that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families who purchased a computer in the past year have reduced their exercise and playtime by half. In addition to the health problems caused by computers, they also teach the next generation that things are easily attainable. Computers are an excellent source of knowledge, but this can pose a problem. It is extremely easy to obtain information or conduct research on a topic using a computer. Prior to the widespread popularity of computers, people had to exert effort and search for @CAPS4. Now that it has become so effortless, children @MONTH1 start to believe that things in life come easily. @PERSON1, a pediatric psychologist, remarks, ""The mind of a child operates in such a manner that most things they encounter are absorbed and become the norm. If a child becomes accustomed to the ease of searching for an item on a computer, they will expect all things to be equally simple. If they are not, they @MONTH1 become frustrated and unable to perform the necessary tasks."" @NUM3 out of @NUM4 poll respondents agree that finding @CAPS4 on the computer is quite straightforward. What message are we imparting to the children of the world? That life is easy, which is a falsehood. The use of computers is an escalating problem. It incurs exorbitant costs, causes health problems, and distorts the minds of children into believing that life is effortless. Computers are detrimental to the people of the world; they deplete our finances, compromise our health, and corrupt the minds of our children."
518	520	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers are advantageous as they facilitate online communication, enhance hand - eye coordination, and offer various other benefits. Firstly, computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. For example, they teach users how to type proficiently, which requires the synchronization of visual perception and manual dexterity. If we fail to develop hand - eye coordination, we will struggle to perform other tasks that demand this skill. Secondly, if one has a webcam, it becomes a valuable tool for maintaining connections. For instance, when a family member resides in a different state, a webcam enables us to see their face and engage in face - to - face conversations, replicating the experience of in - person interactions. Lastly, the internet is an excellent resource for obtaining @CAPS4 tickets. Researchers claim that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people consider online ticketing the optimal method. This is because it allows us to view departure times, the schedule of the next @CAPS4, and the return time. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a positive addition. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable us to connect with family members from afar through webcams, and provide a convenient means of obtaining @CAPS4 tickets. Researchers have attested to the superiority of online ticketing. One should ponder whether they would prefer to have access to the web for such purposes.
519	521	1	1	I firmly advocate that individuals should immerse themselves in nature rather than succumbing to the allure of computers. This stance is rooted in the fact that computers can be highly addictive. Those who become addicted often confine their knowledge to the virtual realm of the internet. Moreover, people require physical exercise, which is unattainable when one spends the entire day seated in front of a computer. Computer addiction is a prevalent issue. Those who devote the majority of their time to computers are often ensnared by addiction. Once addicted, they are likely to experience academic failure as they neglect their homework. Do you not detest the feeling of weakness and fatigue? This is precisely how individuals who spend excessive time on computers often feel. If people aspire to maintain good health, they should engage in daily exercise instead of remaining sedentary in front of a computer. Many individuals become frustrated when they are uninformed about real - world events. Most of these individuals are heavy computer users, as they only acquire knowledge from the digital world. Therefore, I firmly believe that people squander an excessive amount of time on computers. This is primarily due to the addictive nature of computers, the necessity for exercise to maintain health, and the fact that relying solely on computers limits one's understanding of the world.
520	522	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I have learned that you are deliberating whether computers have a negative or positive impact on society. In my view, I firmly believe that computers have a highly negative impact, not only on adults but also, predominantly, on students. Generally speaking, computers can be distracting, extremely dangerous, and reduce people's time for exercise. Although some may claim that computers do not have an overall negative impact on people, I beg to differ. Some individuals assert that computers are not distracting, yet I contend that they are. Computers host a variety of websites, such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, which can divert people's attention from studying or completing their homework. @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are platforms where users can chat with friends and view others' pictures. These websites can be highly disruptive when one is attempting to engage in important tasks. For example, I am notorious for being a slacker when it comes to homework or studying. If given the choice between doing homework and chatting on @CAPS1, I would undoubtedly choose @CAPS1. However, upon reflection, one must question whether these websites are truly beneficial. Homework and studying can significantly enhance one's academic performance and have long - term benefits for one's life. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a major distraction. When people use the computer, they often do so without fully considering the potential dangers. There are online predators lurking on these digital platforms. These predators spend the majority of their time on computers, seeking to harm others. One website in particular, MySpace, is known to be extremely harmful. It is even more dangerous than @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. While MySpace shares some similarities with @CAPS1, it poses a far greater threat. For instance, my mother once told me about a friend's daughter who had a MySpace account and befriended an unknown man. She was initially unconcerned as he seemed like a nice person, so she shared her phone number with him. Fortunately, her mother intervened; otherwise, a potentially disastrous situation could have occurred. It turned out that the man was an online predator. Lastly, computers can lead to poor health. People who spend excessive time staring at computer screens are less likely to engage in physical activity, such as playing sports like soccer, volleyball, and tennis. This lack of exercise is detrimental to the health of individuals in our society, as it can lead to obesity and other health problems. In conclusion, computers can have a profoundly negative impact on people. They are distracting, dangerous, and contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, which is harmful to one's health. Despite some claims to the contrary, computers do indeed have a significant negative impact on people.
521	523	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, akin to numerous individuals of my age, I relish sitting before a computer and delving into its marvels. Nevertheless, this does not imply that I squander my entire life on it like some others. Thus, I can discern the consequences of excessive computer usage. It has rendered kids my age more belligerent, prone to health issues, and even less concerned about the environment. An increasing number of children are succumbing to these pitfalls. Excessive computer time can transform even the most amiable person into an extremely irascible individual. From past experience, I know that when you interrupt people engrossed in their obsession, they will snap at you, shout, or even resort to swearing or violence. If someone stays up too late on the computer, the following day may find them irritable due to lack of sleep. This aggression, @MONTH1, can prompt others to respond aggressively, which @MONTH1 may lead to a verbal or physical altercation, an outcome that (hopefully) no one desires. Another problem excessive computer time can cause, @CAPS1, is a plethora of health issues. Staying indoors all day prevents people from obtaining the requisite amount of vitamin @CAPS3, a vital nutritious vitamin derived from the sun. Insufficient intake of vitamin @CAPS3 during childhood can result in a condition called @CAPS5 later in life, which never truly abates and impedes people from engaging in activities they love. Excessive computer time also means people are not getting enough exercise, and combined with our current eating habits, these two factors can contribute to obesity. Others who do not wish to exercise adequately or eat healthily and simultaneously avoid obesity @MONTH1 develop anorexia. Neither of these weight problems is beneficial for you, reinforcing my point about the health hazards of excessive computer time. The issue I wish you to consider, @CAPS1, is how people become even more indifferent to the environment. Some major technology companies circumvent environmental protection laws to find cost - effective ways to manufacture their products, and the sad truth is, no one cares! As long as they acquire the latest and greatest piece of technology, everyone remains complacent. People will continue to support these companies to satisfy their craving for more computers. Now, I am not suggesting that any computer usage is detrimental. I am merely endeavoring to demonstrate that excessive use is harmful. With excessive computer time, people can become more aggressive, suffer from health problems, and become even less environmentally conscious. Therefore, I earnestly urge you, @CAPS1, to pen an article in the newspaper about the effects of excessive computer time, to make this known to everyone in the city. It might contribute to a better future.
522	524	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, the prevalence of computer usage has been on the rise. While some individuals dispute the merits of computers, I firmly believe they offer numerous advantages. They facilitate learning, serving as a @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and provide entertainment when one is idle. In contemporary society, people are becoming increasingly intelligent, and the internet is one of the driving forces behind this trend. The internet can be likened to a vast compendium, housing an abundance of valuable information. There is likely information on the internet that remains undiscovered until someone stumbles upon it. Moreover, the internet is characterized by its speed and convenience. Additionally, it keeps users abreast of global events. Without the internet, we would be at a significant disadvantage. Surveys indicate that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students utilize the internet for academic research or project work. Furthermore, the internet offers access to products that may not be available in physical stores. Visiting a library can be a cumbersome task. One has to incur fuel costs and venture outside the comfort of home to reach the library. What if there is no library in close proximity? In such a scenario, the internet serves as a viable alternative. Moreover, with @CAPS2, one might spend an entire day searching for a book, only to discover that it is already borrowed by someone else. This can be extremely frustrating. There are individuals, such as college students, who do not own cars. How are they supposed to reach the library? Studies reveal that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 lack personal vehicles. When boredom strikes, what options do we have? Indulging in food, sleeping, or lying on the floor staring at the ceiling? No. We turn to the computer. The internet offers a diverse range of engaging games and websites. It also provides opportunities to forge new friendships. Additionally, it serves as an effective means of maintaining contact with close friends and relatives. If you are a photographer, you can sell and share your photographs online, and even promote your company or business. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 @CAPS3 either lack a backyard or have nothing better to do. In my opinion, the internet is truly remarkable. It enables us to acquire a wide range of knowledge without the need to visit a library, and it offers entertainment when we are bored. Is the internet not a wonderful invention?
523	525	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers confer substantial benefits upon our society. They prove invaluable when it comes to homework, enable seamless online communication, and facilitate the making of plans without the need to leave one's abode. Firstly, computers play a pivotal role in assisting with homework. Although many children may be reluctant at first, the presence of a computer can significantly enhance their motivation to complete assignments. For instance, when faced with a challenging science or social studies assignment, I can conduct in - depth research on the computer. Moreover, @CAPS1, if an exam is approaching and I have left my textbook at school, I can conveniently study on my computer. Consequently, computers are highly beneficial for both homework and studying. Secondly, computers simplify the process of communicating with others. For example, making phone calls incurs costs, whereas text messaging, chatting, or voice - calling can be done free of charge. Additionally, email is a popular choice due to its simplicity and the ability to send documents to others. Suppose I have a work document regarding yearly company profits that needs to be sent to my boss. With just a few clicks, I can attach it to an email and avoid the hassle of driving. Finally, computers make it effortless to make plans or establish connections. I am aware that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people enjoy traveling, but obtaining plane tickets is a breeze with online booking. It is fast, convenient, and secure. Also, @CAPS1, if you need to make reservations for a hotel or other accommodation, all you have to do is go online, select a date, and your room will be ready upon arrival. This is particularly advantageous for traveling business professionals who may require a room at short notice. In conclusion, computers occupy a prominent position in the world as they assist with homework, facilitate communication, and enable the making of reservations without leaving home. The best part is that they are both enjoyable and user - friendly.
524	526	1	1	Dear Local newspaper, according to this article, an increasing number of people are using computers, and proponents of technological advancements believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals. However, I beg to differ. I firmly believe that computers can ruin one's life and even cause blindness. Firstly, excessive computer usage can have a detrimental effect on one's life. A computer is a versatile device that allows users to perform a multitude of tasks. It enables you to find out where your friends live, play numerous games, and so on. I recall a news report on channel @NUM1 about a @NUM2 - year - old child who fainted after spending too much time playing computer games. This clearly illustrates how computers can ruin lives; all it takes is a few hours of excessive use for one to become addicted. Secondly, computers can cause blindness because the screen is often too close. Although computers are designed to facilitate various tasks, unfortunately, the screen is positioned in such a way that users often have to bring their faces very close to it to see clearly. I remember when my dad bought a @ORGANIZATION1; he spent the whole day on it, and when he finished, his eyes were bloodshot. A month later, he had to get glasses. This shows that getting too close to a computer screen can damage your eyes. In conclusion, computers can ruin your life and cause blindness. They are not beneficial for you, so I urge you to reflect on the points I have made in this persuasive letter.
525	527	1	1	@DATE1 @CAPS1 The @CAPS2, I am convinced that computers in contemporary society exert a positive influence on people. I hold this view because when used for educational purposes, such as chatting, emailing, or researching, computers can significantly enhance people's lives. If utilized for educational games, one can acquire a wealth of knowledge. For example, I assist my sister with multiplication through a math game. Additionally, I learned to type using type - to - learn @CAPS3 on my home desktop computer. Many others also employ computers for similar reasons. They may use them for typing projects or creating presentations. Some individuals use computers solely for chatting and emailing. These activities can still contribute to the betterment of our society. Using the computer for chatting on platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter can also be advantageous. These websites allow us to meet new people, reconnect with old friends, or communicate with current friends. Moreover, on @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1, or @ORGANIZATION3, we can send emails instead of instant messages. For instance, if you have something important to convey, you might prefer to write an email. If you simply want to say hello, you can use Facebook, MySpace, or Twitter if you have an account. Computers undeniably benefit our society today. All the reasons presented in this letter substantiate my stance on the positive impact of computers on our society.
526	528	1	1	Dear newspaper editor, I opine that computers are advantageous to everyone. My primary rationale for believing that computers are beneficial is that when one lacks knowledge about a particular subject and desires to acquire more information, one can simply access the computer and conduct research on it. The most remarkable aspect is that one can research any topic, regardless of its remoteness. The internet encompasses information on every conceivable matter. My secondary reason is that if one possesses a webcam and some relatives reside at a great distance, one can interact with them at any time. It is not limited to webcams; one can also utilize platforms such as Facebook and other similar sites to communicate with family and friends and view each other's pictures. My final and conclusive reason is that one can perform nearly any task on a computer. There is software available for writing, undertaking projects, and planning activities. Moreover, the majority of contemporary society employs computers in stores and businesses for record - keeping purposes. Thus, this is why I believe computers are beneficial to us. I have elucidated the reasons and the ways in which they are advantageous.
527	529	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I concur that the impacts of computers on individuals can be highly detrimental. However, people should recognize the consequences of their actions and the situations they may entangle themselves in. Firstly, individuals spend more time on computers than on the phone. This has an adverse effect on their domestic responsibilities, as they neglect household cleaning and maintenance while being engrossed in laptops or desktops. Secondly, parents and children spend a significant amount of time on websites, such as those facilitating webcam conversations and instant messaging, to communicate with friends. This behavior is counterproductive, as they could opt to use the phone or meet in person. In conclusion, individuals, particularly teenagers and to a lesser extent adults aged between @NUM1 and @NUM2, are inclined to visit various websites like myspace.com, facebook.com, formspring.com, and others. These online activities often give rise to rumors and can culminate in either favorable or unfavorable circumstances, which can be extremely distressing for those who engage in such behavior frequently. There is often a ""he - said - she - said"" scenario, especially among teenagers. This is precisely why people should immediately log off. Most importantly, individuals should be vigilant about themselves and those around them, as engaging in such online behavior can place them in precarious situations and cause harm."
528	530	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that both children and adults are allocating an excessive amount of time to the computer. Please consider the following points highlighting the negative effects of computers on people. Furthermore, @PERCENT1 of parents concur with experts that @CAPS3 spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer and insufficient time with friends. When I was young, I seldom used the computer. However, currently, my parents have to remind me multiple times to disengage from the computer. Ever since teenagers joined @CAPS7, MySpace, and Twitter, they have become addicted and are unable to refrain from checking what their friends are posting. Psychologist @PERSON2 asserts, ""@CAPS3 who spend multiple hours a day on the internet struggle to concentrate in school because their minds are preoccupied with what they will post on @CAPS11 upon returning home."" Wake up, @CAPS5, check @CAPS7, head to school, return home, and check @CAPS7 again. This has become the daily routine of a teenager in the @DATE1. Secondly, excessive computer use can lead to health issues. @NUM1 percent of teenagers who use the computer incessantly require glasses or contact lenses due to overexposure. When I use the computer continuously for several hours, I experience severe headaches as my eyes can no longer tolerate the strain. ""@CAPS11 When @CAPS3 stay up late on the computer, they experience fatigue the next morning,"" states pediatrician @PERSON1. Middle - schoolers are among the most frequent internet users and are often fatigued at school. People who stay up late develop dark, saggy under - eye circles, indicating excessive internet use. Most @CAPS3 who are sedentary due to continuous internet use rarely venture outside. Lastly, children are missing out on the beauty of nature. @CAPS3 who do not get sufficient exercise cannot think clearly as their brains lack oxygen. Obesity is becoming a significant concern among children who merely sit indoors and consume junk food. @PERCENT2 of children in Stratford rarely engage in outdoor activities and exercise. During my elementary - school years, we had recess, but in middle school, it no longer exists. The only opportunity to go outside is in the @DATE3 and @DATE2 when the weather is warm."
529	531	1	1	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, one's perspective on computers may either align with or differ from others'. I firmly believe that computers contribute significantly to our society. They provide us with in - depth knowledge on any subject of interest, facilitate connections with family members in distant locations, and offer a comprehensive understanding of places we cannot visit in person. Some individuals contend that computers distract children, causing them to neglect family time. However, consider a scenario where a family member resides on the other side of the globe. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, and the only means of communication is through a computer. Similarly, if a young child's parents are away on extended business trips, the computer becomes a vital tool for communication. Not everyone is always physically present, and in such cases, computers serve as an effective means of connection. Critics argue that computers discourage exercise. However, if one's preferred form of exercise is hiking, a computer can still enhance the experience by allowing exploration of different hiking destinations. Moreover, for a child who has always been eager to visit @LOCATION1 but cannot, a computer provides the opportunity to explore it with a simple click. In school, we study historical figures who passed away thousands of years ago. A computer offers a wealth of information about these individuals, enabling us to expand our knowledge. While one could visit a library and borrow a book, there is no guarantee that the book will contain the desired information, potentially resulting in hours of fruitless reading. A computer, on the other hand, can provide the necessary information within seconds. In an era of technological advancement, it is unwise to waste time on less efficient methods. So, what are you waiting for? Start learning what you desire right now! If you haven't seen your cousin in a long time, fire up your computer and initiate a conversation. The time to embrace the benefits of computers is now.
530	532	1	1	Dear Local newspaper editor, I believe that computers have a positive impact on our lives. Whether they assist children in conducting research for homework, projects, and essays or contribute to the growth of online businesses, computers have become an integral and beneficial part of our daily lives. They enable us to stay informed about global events and learn new things every day. However, some individuals focus on the perceived negative effects of computers rather than their numerous advantages. One common argument is that computers discourage exercise. I find this claim baseless, as not everyone is interested in or willing to exercise. It is a personal choice, and computers do not force people to remain indoors. In fact, computers offer an excellent way to stay in touch with friends and family through online chatting and photo - sharing. It is illogical to assume that people stop seeing their families because of computers. Opponents of computers often present absurd notions, such as people being confined to chairs or controlled by computers, which is simply ridiculous. If people take the time to reflect, they will realize how computers have contributed to the growth of our nation. They have become indispensable tools, replacing the labor - intensive process of searching through numerous books for information. Over the years, it has become evident that computers play a crucial role in various aspects of our lives, and their influence on our country has been, in my opinion, highly positive. One can only speculate about the state of our nation without the advent of computers. Given the significant positive impact computers have already made, I can only anticipate that their influence will continue to grow in the coming years as they become more advanced. As you have read, I have presented my reasons for believing that computers have a profound impact on our lives and that this impact will only intensify in the future. While I cannot persuade you to be either for or against computers, I encourage you to envision a world without them, especially if you have grown up in a digital age.
531	533	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers are integral to our sophisticated technology. They exert a beneficial influence on individuals as computers render nearly every task more facile. They can instruct people through tutorials or educational websites and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and they afford entertainment during people's leisure time. Computers are advancing at an accelerating pace daily, which is why I surmise people are so addicted to them; nonetheless, they do yield positive impacts. Computers streamline numerous aspects of life for a multitude of individuals. Upon reflection, many items we utilize daily, such as books, refined clothing, and radio music, would not exist without computers. We would be compelled to pen those books by hand and sew our garments manually. Regarding music, we would merely stomp our feet and clap our hands to create melodies. Had ancient Egyptians possessed computers, they would have constructed millions of @CAPS4. Our computers are equipped with programs like Microsoft to assist me in completing a significant school assignment neatly. In this regard, computers have positive effects. Each day after I finish my homework and log onto the computer, most adults assume that all teenagers do on computers is use Facebook and MySpace. I do concede that I visit those websites, but if I notice that my grades are subpar, I visit websites that can aid me in comprehending what eludes me. Ninety percent of the time, when I do this, my grades improve, and I achieve a satisfactory score. I have also taught my young cousins how to add and subtract using the computer in preschool. Computers are facilitating schools in educating students. Beyond education, computers can also amuse us with games like virtual solitaire. When I access the computer, I may need to research a topic that piques my interest. Perhaps I want to know when @LOCATION1 was invented or if the universe has an end. Maybe I do not wish to watch @CAPS5 all day for entertainment. Computers will rescue me from boredom. When I use a computer, I am not addicted. In fact, it has a highly positive impact on me. Yes, I may stay up countless hours chatting with my friends on Facebook, but to me, that is part of being a child. The next day, I may learn something in school that I desire to explore further. That is the purpose of the computer. Without computers, we would not possess some of the knowledge we have @CAPS1. In my opinion, their influence on people is the most positive ever.
532	534	1	1	"Dear Readers' @ORGANIZATION1 of the Local Newspaper, I am nearly certain that you interact with computers on a daily basis. You employ computers for writing, gaming, viewing pictures, and printing documents. There are numerous practical applications for computers; however, in contemporary times, many individuals, particularly children, are utilizing computers excessively. This superfluous utilization of computers can lead to obesity, expose children to inappropriate content, and disrupt family time. Readers, heed my argument, and by the conclusion of this article, you will undoubtedly concur with me that computers are detrimental to society. Have you ever set a @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to shed weight? It is not uncommon for individuals to establish such goals. According to the @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of adults set their @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to attain fitness, exercise more, or simply lose weight. We have all witnessed the commercials on @CAPS4 that encourage you to ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" Promising that you too can ""lose weight in just one week""! There are also numerous entrepreneurs who aim to persuade you to purchase their exercise products, claiming that you can develop remarkably large muscles ""in no time at all."" But do all these exercise plans truly yield results? According to a study conducted by the @ORGANIZATION1, the primary cause of obesity is, in fact, computers! The students at @LOCATION1 assigned one group of individuals to follow a regular commercial diet plan, while another group continued their normal routines, with the exception of computer usage. They discovered that the group that abstained from computer use lost nearly @PERCENT2 more weight on average than the group on the commercial diet! Nothing contributes more to obesity in @LOCATION2 than computers. A typical day for an average child in @LOCATION2 unfolds as follows: attend school, return home on the bus, use the computer, have dinner, complete homework, and go to bed. Unfortunately, this routine occurs @NUM1 days a week, and computer time is encroaching upon exercise time. Readers, I implore you, attempt to avoid using your computers for just one week, and you can disregard those lofty goals. Another adverse aspect of computers is that it not only affects individuals but potentially entire families! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down and conversing with their parents. My friend @PERSON1 often returns from school and immediately retreats to his room to use his laptop without even greeting his parents. Computers have become almost addictive for most teenagers. @PERCENT3 of teens in @LOCATION2 claim to use computers daily, and @PERCENT4 state that they encounter difficulties communicating with their parents. There is a direct correlation between the lack of communication at home among teens and computer usage. Teens become engrossed in their virtual lives and overly attached to their computers. What they fail to recognize is that they are completely neglecting their families! I admit that I have made the mistake of becoming overly reliant on social networking and forgetting about my family, but fortunately, I have a stable family environment. Some teens do not have this privilege. Computers have the potential to destroy parent - child relationships; do not let this happen to you. Undoubtedly, your children are the ones most affected by this technological revolution. From a young age, your children have likely had a keyboard at their fingertips. However, do parents ever consider what they are exposing their children to when they teach them to use a computer? Children as young as @NUM2 or @NUM3 years old are exposed to pornographic, vulgar, and inappropriate pictures on the web, even on supposedly ""safe sites."" Do you even know who your child is communicating with on the computer? With all the @CAPS8's and emails circulating, you could be conversing with a complete stranger without even realizing it. A substantial portion of who your child becomes and the values they uphold is a result of what they are exposed to at a young age. Introduce a computer to your kindergartener, and you can probably anticipate the consequences. No matter how much you believe in the safety of computers, you cannot dispute the fact that computers expose children to adult content at an early stage of their lives. Do you now view your computer differently? Confronted with the issues of lack of exercise, family estrangement, and inappropriate exposure of children, do you truly want your children, or even yourself, using a computer daily? Consider the situation @NUM4 years from now. Will you say, ""I wish I used my computer more"" or ""I wish I spent more time with my family""? Ultimately, the choice is yours."
533	535	1	1	In my view, possessing a computer is highly advantageous. I firmly believe that having computers is a valuable asset because, in the contemporary era, computers are extremely useful. Moreover, a significant number of individuals utilize them for their businesses. My reasons for advocating the use of computers are three - fold: accessing information, completing homework, and communicating with friends and family online. Firstly, computers serve as an excellent tool for information retrieval. If you have multiple reports to prepare, it is advisable to use a computer to gather information as it is both more convenient and time - efficient. For instance, using the internet to search for information is far quicker than referring to books. It may take only @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to find relevant information online, whereas searching the same information in books could take @NUM3 to @NUM4 minutes. Secondly, computers facilitate communication with friends and family, especially those living at a distance. If a relative resides in @LOCATION2, making a long - distance call via telephone or cellphone can result in exorbitant bills. Instead, communicating online allows you to interact with them without incurring high costs. You can also seek assistance from your friends regarding homework. For example, if you are in @LOCATION1 and need to discuss an assignment with a friend, you can easily connect with them online. Thirdly, computers are ideal for completing homework. If you have a history assignment, you can access an online book instead of carrying a heavy textbook to and from school. This not only saves time but also eliminates the need to worry about misplacing the book. Using the internet for research typically takes @NUM5 to @NUM2 minutes, while using a book can take @NUM5 to @NUM8 minutes. In conclusion, the use of computers is both highly useful and crucial in today's world. My three key reasons for this assertion are information access, homework completion, and online communication. Even though some individuals may not favor computers or be reluctant to use them, their benefits are undeniable.
534	536	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, although computers have positive effects on individuals, there are also numerous negative impacts. Some of the major adverse effects of computers on people include a lack of exercise, the risk of interacting with strangers, and a decrease in interaction with family and friends. One of the most significant negative effects of computers is the reduction in physical activity. Currently, a large number of people in @LOCATION1 are obese due to poor eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle. One of the contributing factors is that these individuals are reluctant to leave their computers and sofas to engage in outdoor activities. They prefer to stay indoors, watching @CAPS2.V. and using the computer, which significantly influences their way of life. Another problem associated with computers is that they expose children to the risk of communicating with strangers. Most children in @LOCATION1 are members of social networks such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. There are individuals who use these platforms to pretend to be teenagers, which can lead to trouble for unsuspecting children. Since most people access these websites via computers, this represents another negative aspect of computer use. Additionally, computers can cause a decline in interaction with family and friends. When people are engrossed in their computers, they focus solely on the screen and ignore their surroundings. This preoccupation with computers prevents many individuals from engaging in meaningful conversations with their loved ones. As a result, their social skills deteriorate, especially if they become overly addicted to computers. This can lead to serious communication problems within families, weakening family bonds. In conclusion, despite the positive effects of computers on people, the numerous negative impacts can cause severe problems. Computers can bring about tragedies in families and an individual's life.
535	537	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I understand that you believe computers have an impact on people; however, I respectfully disagree with your view. I contend that computers assist us in learning and performing tasks more expeditiously. The presence of computers enriches the community's knowledge base. Firstly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination, which is essential for certain occupations. Proficiency in typing enables individuals to secure jobs in places like the city of @LOCATION1, where daily typing and diligent work are required. Moreover, it allows people to acquire a wealth of knowledge about society. Without typing skills, it would be challenging to obtain high - quality jobs. Secondly, computers are beneficial for children's education. They help children develop typing skills, which are essential for high school. Additionally, computers offer educational resources in mathematics, science, social studies, and language arts. Even young children can learn basic math and other concepts through engaging characters such as Dora, @ORGANIZATION1, and Elmo. Learning on computers is both educational and enjoyable, which parents would appreciate. Even infants can start learning basic reading, writing, and math skills, potentially leading to great achievements in the future. Thirdly, computers facilitate global communication and commerce. Without computers, we would have to rely on traditional methods, which are often time - consuming and inefficient. With computers, we can communicate with family members living in distant states or countries, whom we may not have seen for a long time. We can also chat with old school friends. Furthermore, online shopping allows us to purchase a wide range of products conveniently. In conclusion, I have demonstrated that computers have a positive impact on people. They enhance children's learning abilities and assist parents as well. Computers also help individuals secure jobs and improve hand - eye coordination both in and out of school. Therefore, computers are beneficial to the community.
536	538	1	1	Do you contemplate whether computers confer benefits upon us? In my view, they indeed do. There exist numerous ways in which computers both benefit and do not benefit us, yet the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. For instance, school - going children utilize online textbooks. Moreover, a multitude of companies maintain websites, enabling us to gain insights into their nature before selecting them for a task. We also employ computers to search for directions to our desired destinations, thus averting the risk of getting lost. Schoolchildren derive substantial benefits from computers. Instead of lugging home a multitude of heavy books, they can simply access online books via the computer. I, for one, prefer using the computer over carrying an armful of heavy tomes. Additionally, when seeking a home decorator, one can simply browse relevant websites on the computer to assess their previous work. This is highly advantageous as it precludes the need to discover the decorator's incompetence the hard way and avoid squandering a significant amount of money on a room one dislikes. Furthermore, when job - hunting, one can visit the company's website on the computer to determine if an interview can be obtained, rather than expending time and energy by physically going there. I also rely on the computer to find routes to places, which is considerably more convenient than setting off on a drive and getting lost. Although GPS devices are available, they are far more expensive than the information accessible on a computer. I firmly believe that computers benefit us in numerous ways, such as the use of online textbooks instead of carrying large physical ones, and the ease of looking up websites or addresses. This is precisely why I am convinced that computers are beneficial to us.
537	539	1	1	Dear Newstimes, I firmly believe that computers are a boon as they facilitate online communication, offer means to assist others, and enable people to manage a substantial portion of their finances and bills. Firstly, they enable seamless communication with others. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of individuals in the United States have family members residing in different states and rarely get to see them? This is where computers prove invaluable. They are equipped with video chat functionality, which allows individuals with webcams to engage in face - to - face conversations with people from across the globe. Additionally, there is @CAPS1, a platform that enables real - time communication with online contacts. My mother acquired a @CAPS1 account and has since reconnected with friends she last saw in high school, much to her delight. Secondly, computers serve as a reliable resource in times of need. In case of an emergency, one can turn to the computer for assistance. For example, emails can be sent, and there are even features on the computer that can make calls during emergencies. @PERCENT2 of the people in @LOCATION1 assert that computers have come to the aid of many. Thirdly, computers play a crucial role in bill payment and financial management. Remarkably, @PERCENT3 of Americans pay their bills and manage their finances via computers. I know that my parents do, and so do many others. Without the ability to pay bills, we would face the risk of losing our homes and other necessities. Hence, computers are an essential tool. In conclusion, people truly need computers as they foster connections with loved ones, have assisted numerous individuals in the United States, and are indispensable for financial management. For these compelling reasons, everyone should own a computer.
538	540	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the global population opines that computers are an excellent medium for interacting with people, exploring foreign cultures and places, and tracing one's family heritage. Here, I aim to expound on the reasons why computers should remain an integral part of our society. How can one connect with individuals from different countries? One effective way is through global interaction, made possible by the numerous benefits of the internet. One can create a specialized account to meet like - minded people. Another option is to join a pen - pal website to correspond with individuals from diverse parts of the world. Additionally, instant messaging applications can be downloaded to communicate with people globally. Are you working on a project that requires knowledge of another country or an explorer? The computer can be an invaluable resource. It aids in schoolwork, including homework. When no one is available at home to assist with homework, online resources can be used to gain a better understanding of the material. Do you wish to discover your family's origins? You can utilize websites to trace your family lineage. For example, @LOCATION1 is a useful platform to learn about your ancestors, including their roles in history. Another approach is to ask your parents for a family member's name and search for it on Google.com. There are numerous reasons to retain computers in our lives, including facilitating interaction, expanding knowledge of other places, and uncovering family history. I hope this elucidation enhances your understanding.
539	541	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have become an integral part of modern life, with nearly everyone utilizing them. However, some individuals contend that computers are detrimental to society, a view I firmly refute. Computers are indispensable for education, are not used incessantly by people, and are essential for many jobs. How can these aspects be harmful to society? Clearly, they cannot. Every individual has undergone some form of education, and computers have become an essential tool in this regard. For those who are employed and wish to pursue an additional degree, online schooling provides a viable option that allows them to balance work and education. Moreover, computers are essential for school projects and essays. They enable students to conduct research, cite sources, and type assignments. Without computers, educational opportunities would be severely limited, potentially leading individuals to pursue unskilled jobs at places like @CAPS1. Contrary to the belief that people spend excessive time on computers, most individuals are responsible enough to balance online activities with outdoor pursuits. They use computers to check emails, play games, and socialize on platforms like Facebook and MySpace, but also make time for fresh air and physical activity. Computers are also vital in the workplace. Office workers rely on them for communication, problem - solving, and accessing accounts. Professionals in various fields, such as those estimating building costs, use computers for calculations and record - keeping. Video game programmers spend hours using computers to develop games. In conclusion, computers are essential for education, work, and personal life. Their benefits far outweigh any perceived drawbacks. I strongly urge everyone to reconsider the role of computers in our lives and recognize their importance.
540	542	1	1	Let us cast our minds back approximately @NUM1 years. Those were times when communicating with out - of - state family members could take weeks. Knowledge was predominantly confined to books, and accessing it was a time - consuming process. Everything was characterized by a lack of speed and precision. Computers have revolutionized this scenario. With a mere tap of a finger, we can communicate with people worldwide and access a wealth of new information on the web. @PERCENT1 of people have relatives living outside their state. I can relate, as I have @NUM2 cousins in @LOCATION2 and @NUM2 in @LOCATION1. Without instant messaging and emails, we would likely communicate with them only once or twice a year. Some argue that computers reduce face - to - face interaction with family and friends. However, for me and many others, modern communication tools have made interaction possible. Among the various @LOCATION1 technologies, the webcam has left me most astounded. It allows us to have face - to - face conversations with individuals on the other side of the world, fostering a genuine connection with different cultures. What was once deemed impossible @NUM4 years ago is now readily accessible. My @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 have both used the internet to reconnect with old college friends and stay in touch with distant acquaintances. The internet's utility extends far beyond teenagers on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4. The information available online is truly remarkable. The knowledge that would be gleaned from @NUM2 out - of - date books can be found in a matter of minutes on the internet. Any question, whether personal or general, can be answered. Years ago, people would have yearned for such power. While the importance of exercise is undeniable, a five - minute web search can yield a well - planned exercise routine incorporating modern techniques. The computer caters to everyone's needs. Whether one is looking for a nature - loving destination or a dictionary definition, the internet provides instant results. People often take these technological marvels for granted and assume that life can go on without them. However, they fail to recognize the extent of our dependence on computers. The technology is at our disposal, so why not make the most of it? I would never forgo the opportunity to talk to a distant cousin or a child from another country. Thanks to computers, we have unprecedented access to information and connections. We should embrace this technology and appreciate its significance in our lives.
541	543	1	1	@CITY1 @CAPS1: I opine that computers (for the present) are a beneficial asset to our society. They enable one to explore places. In the event of a long - distance relationship, one can communicate with the other party, and computers possess numerous excellent accessories. Suppose one were in search of a new residence; one could utilize Google to search for homes on sale in a specific location and then find someone to relocate one's belongings at a reasonable price. Computers offer a plethora of websites to visit when seeking that particular place. The computer also proves useful when planning a vacation. One can look up the weather forecast for that period. If traveling somewhere, one can use the computer to book a flight. Computers are invaluable when it comes to matters of location! The accessories for computers are innumerable. One prominent accessory that people enjoy is gaming. Games are excellent for stimulating the mind. Virtually all games demand hand - eye coordination. For example, @ORGANIZATION1. One must remove all the tiles before the time elapses! When bored, games are highly enjoyable. I consider games to be a remarkable accessory. Some individuals have long - distance relationships, correct? Well, if one has a computer, one can engage in an online interaction. This alleviates the concerns of many when they know the other person is not physically present. If one has an email, one can “converse” with friends not seen at school. This provides an opportunity to connect with them. Myspace and Facebook are quite similar. These can be used to communicate with school friends. Computers are extremely useful. As evident, I have presented numerous compelling reasons. Accessories, “conversing” with people, and matters of location. Many people incorporate computers into their daily lives. Computers are outstanding!
542	544	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1's perspective on the impacts computers have on individuals is that computers are employed for improper purposes. Teens ought to be outdoors participating in sports or socializing with friends and family. Instead, they are addicted to the World Wide Web, games, and various websites within it. Consequently, the computer and the concept of web - surfing are detrimental as it excessively occupies children's minds, and educationally, computers can provide inaccurate information. According to @CAPS1, until the late @DATE1's, @ORGANIZATION3 laptops and desktop @CAPS2 did not exist, which, in their view, would have been preferable. For instance, children, teens, and even adults use the computer more than they should in contemporary times. At this stage, middle - schoolers and high - schoolers should be focused on their academic performance and personal development. However, they become overly addicted to @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5, causing them to neglect their schoolwork and priorities, and their grades begin to decline. Even adults face this issue. For example, business people, accountants, and assistants constantly check their emails. Additionally, individuals who work at a desk or in a cubicle all day are almost always on the computer. In other words, I believe that employers should reduce the number of employees using computers, and households should limit the amount of time each member spends online. Another reason I believe computers have a negative impact on people is that educationally, they can offer false information. For example, people can impose their own viewpoints on websites such as Wikipedia and @ORGANIZATION2. If a student is working on a project or doing homework and decides to search the web for @ORGANIZATION2 or information, they cannot be certain of its accuracy. I believe this indicates that the internet and the web do not surpass the reliability of books or historical records. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people due to their excessive consumption of children and teens' minds, people's overuse of the internet, and the occasional provision of false information.
543	545	1	1	I contend that computers are extraordinary. Computers present an exceptional means of meeting new individuals online.
544	546	1	1	Dear, newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that computers exert both positive and negative influences on people. On one hand, one can acquire knowledge about places without physically visiting them and obtain facts about the items in that country, such as food, goods, and employment opportunities. On the other hand, the computer can also pose a problem because children may spend an excessive amount of time chatting or playing on the computer and insufficient time outdoors playing or attending sports practice. Moreover, adverse events can sometimes occur from interacting with people on the computer. Some individuals on the computer are not always as they claim to be. Thus, if I must choose a stance on whether the computer is helpful, I would have to say it is not. The computer is not very useful because numerous negative consequences can stem from a single minor error on the computer, such as posting one's name, address, or picture.
545	547	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I assert that computers offer advantages to society. Firstly, they impart and cultivate social skills. Secondly, computers facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge online. Finally, computers also enhance hand - eye coordination. In the following, I will elucidate why I assert that computers are beneficial to society. Firstly, computers contribute to society as they can teach or endow individuals with the necessary social skills. Through a computer, one can interact with people from across the globe and forge new friendships. As a result, one can learn about their cultures and the activities in their countries. Additionally, one can communicate and interact with family members who do not reside nearby or are not present at the moment. Evidently, computers are advantageous as they can teach social skills. Secondly, the benefit to society is that people can learn various things online. For example, one can learn how to operate a computer if initially unfamiliar. Also, one can play free online learning games or purchase a @CAPS3 with more learning options. Another example is that one can research recent or past events of interest. Clearly, computers benefit society as one can learn all sorts of things online. Finally, computers are beneficial as they teach hand - eye coordination. For example, one can find a variety of games that require hand - eye coordination using the mouse and keyboard. Also, when one wants to pass the time, the computer can serve as a source of entertainment through chatting and gaming. Remarkably, one can discover numerous jobs that involve using a computer for these purposes. As evident, computers are beneficial as they teach hand - eye coordination and offer free - time entertainment. In conclusion, computers are advantageous to the social community. Firstly, they assist in developing social skills. Secondly, one can learn about any subject online for free if not paying the internet bill. Finally, they benefit by enhancing hand - eye coordination. As shown, I assert that computers benefit society in numerous ways.
546	548	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, computers are detrimentally impacting the children, and they will exert an even greater influence on subsequent generations. Computers are acceptable in moderation, as are most things. If they are required for a school project, that is fine, but using the computer daily instead of engaging in physical exercise is not appropriate. Supporters of technology assert that computers have a positive impact. I must dissent. They claim that computers enhance hand - eye coordination, can educate about distant locations, and enable online communication. Sports are an excellent means of exercising and honing hand - eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc., are all superb sports that train hand - eye coordination. They are far healthier than instant - messaging your friends all day. You remain sedentary all day and shout at your mom to bring you a drink of water or some dinner. ""Subsequent generations are becoming overly reliant,"" says @PERSON1, my @NUM1 - grade @CAPS2 teacher. How will you be able to support a family when you are older if you cannot tear yourself away from the computer? ""Raising a family is arduous work,"" my mom tells me. ""Your family needs food, which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to procure the food. That demands a great deal of time and energy."" I concur with my mom, and if simple habits like spending an hour outdoors daily are instilled during childhood, having a job and raising a family will be less challenging. Instead of scouring the internet for how to find a reliable online source to support your thesis paper, visit the library! The internet is a relatively novel data repository. However, it has expanded significantly. You cannot always trust internet sources. Those who may have posted the website could very well be unreliable. Additionally, websites are rife with viruses, and what happens when your computer malfunctions due to viruses and you actually need it for a school project? The straightforward alternative would be to visit the local library and borrow a variety of books. The books are trustworthy and replete with information. The internet is also not a very secure place. Facebook, AIM, email, Twitter, etc., are all means of communicating via the computer. Facebook, AIM, and Twitter are alarming and unsafe because you may not know whom you are conversing with. They do have a profile that you may be able to relate to, but they could be deceptive. ""The internet is a vast expanse accessible to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not permitted to use these communication methods because of the specific reasons I have stated earlier. My parents are taking these measures to safeguard me, and I endorse their decision. Instead of chatting with complete strangers, visit your friends' houses. Your friends are the individuals you wish to interact with and spend time with. Overall, computers are peculiar pieces of technology that can be unsafe, untruthful, and are causing children to become more dependent on adults. I must oppose the supporters of technology. There are numerous healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts are concerned that people are spending excessive time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives I have mentioned keep people safe, but they also promote a healthier lifestyle. It is crucial to maintain a healthy body because, ultimately, that should be everyone's objective."
547	549	1	1	"Typing and navigating the web can be exhilarating; however, are they worth the associated risks that exist today? Prior to the discovery of computers, human health was three times better than it is currently. Computers can be useful and may have some advantages; conversely, they are detrimental and should not be used as frequently. They host unprofessional websites, are unhelpful when it comes to physical activity, and infringe upon individuals' privacy. Youngsters are allowed access to computers daily and explore the websites that the internet offers. Consequently, children end up on inappropriate websites that they are not supposed to visit. In fact, @PERCENT1 of the children access unprofessional websites, and @PERCENT2 of them have no parental supervision in the @LOCATION1 alone. Therefore, these children misbehave at home and at school. However, children are not the only ones affected by this. Computers have the drawback of being hacked or infected by viruses from uncensored websites. Moreover, computers may crash or prevent access to computer documents because of these viruses. Ever since the @ORGANIZATION2 was invented, obesity and the lack of exercise in a person's schedule have soared. A scientist, named @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1, stated, ""Regular computer users have lost the functionality of their muscles but have gained over @MONEY1 of fat, causing many of them to be unable to engage in activities they could do before."" I firmly believe that this is true because I recall that the same happened to my sister. She consumed more food, and her exercise time was spent more on the computer than on physical exertion. I know that some claim that computers aid in hand - eye coordination, but is it truly worth sacrificing someone's healthy body? There are various items sold on the internet that are not available in stores, but you cannot trust the internet when purchasing these products. You are skeptical of the internet because you have heard numerous accounts of someone's identity or money being stolen."
548	550	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, computers are not objects to be feared. They assist numerous individuals in diverse ways, such as the @CAPS1, teachers, students, scientists, and locals in handling their work and daily lives. Hasn't a computer already provided assistance to you today? Due to this, computers facilitate our learning, enable us to maintain contact with others, and represent our future. Who has asserted that using computers reduces interaction with family? Well, I can attest that I am keeping in touch with my grandma, cousins, and aunts via email. With email, you can stay updated on news or simply correspond with friends and family! Additionally, if you are planning a trip to visit your beloved family members, do not bother with a map that constantly obstructs your view and where you ""happen"" to get lost. Instead, try using @ORGANIZATION1 maps and plan the shortest route to your destination without getting lost along the way. Computers can do more than create a simple map; they can provide invaluable information! Many schools across the country utilize computers to aid in teaching children. The children can search for @LOCATION1, and within @NUM1 seconds, they have all the information they need! In most school papers, you are required to type and specify the websites you used to complete the paper. What is also advantageous is that you do not need to sift through large books for a single piece of information. It is much easier to look it up on the computer. Speaking of not using large books for information, computers do not consume paper and will lead us to a more sustainable future! Millions of tons of paper end up in landfills each day! By using computers, we can read online and conserve paper! Another remarkable fact is that computers will continue to evolve in the future. People have already developed touch - screen computers, and computers will progress even further! Many people believe that using computers is a negative thing, but consider the facts! Doesn't the newspaper use computers to write the newspaper? If they didn't, they would constantly suffer from hand cramps! And what about doctors? Don't they store your medical history on the computer? Otherwise, all these papers would be lost! As stated at the beginning, computers help us learn, maintain contact with people, and are our future."
549	551	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers confer benefits upon society. There are three reasons for this. Firstly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination, endow people with the ability to learn about distant locations, and enable online communication with others. Secondly, computers contribute to the development of superior technology. I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on people. My first reason for this conviction is that computers improve hand - eye coordination and allow people to acquire knowledge about far - off places. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students use computers to complete their homework. I was researching a topic last week. I knew little about @LOCATION1, so I accessed the computer, and thanks to it, I gained more knowledge about @LOCATION1 and achieved an A+ on my assignment. Thus, computers have a positive influence on people. The second reason is that computers enable people to communicate online with others. Suppose a man travels somewhere and leaves his phone at home. How will he communicate with his family? Thanks to computers, he can talk to his family online. My family is in @LOCATION1. I haven't seen them in four years. So I went to the store, bought a webcam, and was able to see my family after four years. Clearly, computers have a positive effect on people. My final reason is that computers aid in the creation of better technology. Computers assist people in manufacturing superior cars, lights, and so on. Without computers, society would be at a disadvantage because computers help soldiers win wars and even save lives. My father was gravely ill. Without computers, my father would have passed away. Thanks to computers, I still have my father today. In conclusion, computers offer benefits to society. The three reasons are that they enhance hand - eye coordination, allow people to learn about far - off places, enable online communication, and contribute to the development of better technology. While spending time enjoying nature is beneficial, computers bring greater advantages to society. I hope these three reasons can persuade the local newspaper to concur with my stance that computers have a positive impact on people.
550	552	1	1	Student @ORGANIZATION2: @PERSON1 @CAPS1: @NUM1 @CAPS2: @NUM2 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2: @ORGANIZATION2: @ORGANIZATION1: @LOCATION1 @CAPS4: @NUM3 @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION2: @CAPS6 @CAPS7 of @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @LOCATION1 newspaper, I opine that we should have computers as they would facilitate meeting new people, exploring new places, and acquiring new knowledge. They would help us meet new people because we can send emails and chat with them on various programs. They would also enable us to discover new places as we can access the internet and look up different locations. Moreover, they would assist us in learning about new things as we can interact with people who may offer insights on what to study. This would be beneficial for all of us since we aspire to learn new things, communicate with new individuals, and visit new places. This is a prudent idea for everyone. We can all reap the benefits because it is advantageous for everyone to possess computers. I firmly believe that we should have computers as they would aid in meeting new people, exploring new places, and learning new things. This is an excellent prospect for everyone, not just a select few. I hope you will take this letter into consideration because it will help everyone expand their knowledge about new things.
551	553	1	1	I perceive computers as detrimental since individuals utilize them incessantly to access Facebook and other websites that are, at times, a waste of time. People ought not to spend as much time on the computer and instead venture outdoors, take walks, explore the woods, and exercise. Most people do not obtain the sufficient amount of exercise they require because they are engrossed in their computers. People should cease manufacturing computers so that fewer individuals use them, enabling people to exercise more and lose weight. If people stop producing computers, some individuals would desist from visiting inappropriate websites. People should only use the computer for research for projects or for homework, such as typing papers. Parents and children need to exercise to maintain good health because people do not want to develop diabetes when they are young. Hence, it is truly crucial to exercise to prevent adverse effects on your body. People need to stay healthy and exercise. All the computer does is impair your brain, preventing you from exercising. Therefore, disengage from the computer, exercise, explore the outdoors, take walks, and explore the woods. You never know what you might discover in the woods. Go and see what you can find. There will be some fascinating things to discover, like various types of bugs and insects. You might even find a ladybug. There are all sorts of bees, and you might come across one that resembles something. So, go outside and explore; you will never know what you will find. Take walks; you will never know what you will encounter, including different kinds of houses, the colors of the houses, the various types of front doors, and different sizes of houses, such as small, medium, and large. Some houses will have different colors. There are also different kinds of animals, like dogs and cats, that are either in the window or outside. You should go and hang out outdoors. You should go and hang out outside with family, friends, or both and observe the diverse elements in nature. You could even take pictures and create a scrapbook from them. Maybe go into the woods and wander around. Just get out and exercise, and you will think to yourself that you should get out and exercise more often instead of being on the computer because you are having more fun socializing with friends and family while also exercising, rather than being glued to the computer. Additionally, the computer was becoming monotonous.
552	554	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, My perspective on the impact of computers on people is that computers have a positive influence. They are beneficial for education, mental stimulation, and global communication. However, they can also be detrimental as they may prevent you from engaging in physical activity, spending time with your family, and maintaining good health. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that there are ways to utilize computers without incurring these negative consequences. One of the advantages of computers is that they provide access to a vast amount of information on websites, which can enhance your education. Although some of this information may be inaccurate, by identifying reliable websites, you can obtain the correct information. With this wealth of knowledge, you can exercise your mind to achieve greater success in life. Moreover, you can communicate with individuals on the other side of the world and gain additional insights from them. If I were to argue that computers are harmful, I would contend that they impede you from getting sufficient, or perhaps any, physical exercise. Computers may be the reason for the high prevalence of obesity in our society. When computers are overused, people distance themselves from their families and immerse themselves in virtual worlds that can sometimes lead to addiction. Prolonged computer use can also cause various problems. Sitting at a computer for an extended period can result in physical harm. Excessive computer use can also lead to eye problems, such as vision loss, which may require the use of glasses that become thicker over time as you continue to stare at the screen for hours and days on end. However, despite these issues, we can mitigate the negative effects of computers by using them in a responsible manner. People often lack sufficient exercise, but with the help of computers, they can find suitable times and methods to stay active. They can also access information on how much time should be spent on the computer to avoid vision deterioration. For individuals who live far away from their families, computers are invaluable for maintaining communication and staying connected. In conclusion, I believe that the benefits of computers outweigh the drawbacks, as they offer a wealth of information and facilitate global communication. Moreover, computers can help us prevent the negative impacts by providing guidance on how to use them safely.
553	555	1	1	"Dear newspaper, I understand that you are deliberating whether the increasing use of computers is beneficial to society. In my opinion, this trend has a negative impact on people. They interact with potentially unsafe individuals, spend less time exercising, and get into more trouble than before. Spending excessive time in online chat rooms exposes people to the risk of encountering predators. Take my friend [PERSON5] as an example. One day, while online, she started chatting with a man who claimed to be [NUM1] and a model. She thought he seemed trustworthy and continued to flirt with him day after day. However, one day, her friend logged on and discovered that the man was actually [NUM2] and a pervert. [PERSON5] is not the only one who has had such an experience. [NUM3] out of [NUM4] people in chat rooms have reported being deceived in this way. Website designer [PERSON2] states, ""More and more people are falling victim to lies online and getting into difficult situations, such as being asked to meet someone."" Isn't it the case that we are often warned not to talk to strangers? Spending all your time sitting at the computer means less time spent outdoors exercising. During tryouts, this girl [PERSON4] was not in good enough shape to keep up with the other players. Instead of practicing with the rest of us, she was at home chatting on Facebook. When the time came to demonstrate her skills, she was not prepared, and as a result, she did not make the softball team. However, the following year, she became the captain because she trained every day before the big event. She is not the only one with a problem of laziness. [NUM5] out of every [NUM6] Americans are couch potatoes who prefer to go online rather than stay in shape. Nutritionalist [PERSON1] remarks, ""This generation is worse than the previous one. They complain when they are unable to do something, but that's because instead of going outside, they are sitting on their backsides watching [CAPS3] or surfing the internet."" What do you have to lose by taking a break from the computer? Kids seem to get into a lot more trouble online than they ever did on the streets. They post threats, insult each other, send personal messages or pictures, and, in the worst cases, cause someone to commit suicide. One year, a neighbor was more popular than a girl's daughter, so she created a fake online persona that the neighbor fell for. The online ""guy"" began to harass the teenage girl so severely that she ended up hanging herself. People, including singer [ORGANIZATION1], have been caught sexting. This behavior is embarrassing, inappropriate, and illegal, yet it still occurs. These individuals are not alone. [NUM3] out of [NUM4] people have gotten into serious trouble through the internet. Governor [PERSON3] says, ""The internet and phones are destroying our society. There is already too much real-life drama."" Can't you see that something is wrong with all of this? In my view, we should reduce our computer usage before we start interacting with people who will frighten us, become sedentary, and get into significant trouble. The negative consequences of excessive computer use are not worth the potential risks of being scared, hurt, lazy, or even taking our own lives."
554	556	1	1	"Dear newspaper, Computers have become ubiquitous in our nation. We have them at home, at [ORGANIZATION1], or at our workplaces. Many people believe that computers are detrimental to our health and that they prevent us from spending quality time with our families. However, I hold a different view. Computers enhance hand - eye coordination, enable us to learn about distant places, and allow us to engage in online conversations with others. Have you ever struggled with hand - eye coordination? Sometimes, mine is quite poor! But when I use a computer, it significantly improves. Experts claim that [PERCENT1] more people with hand - eye coordination issues have shown improvement through computer use. A teacher at [ORGANIZATION1] stated, ""My students have been using computers for approximately two months, and I have witnessed a remarkable improvement in their hand - eye coordination."" I concur with these experts. Nowadays, numerous computer users have passed their hand - eye coordination tests! When I graduate from high [ORGANIZATION1] and enter the adult world, I aspire to travel the globe. However, I first want to be well - informed about my destinations. This is where computers prove to be extremely useful. With just a click of a button, the internet can direct me to hundreds of websites where I can learn all about the places I wish to visit. Once, my parents informed me that we were going to [LOCATION1] for the day. So, the night before, I conducted extensive research on different shops, museums, and dining places. The computer was so helpful that if we didn't have it, I wouldn't know where to go. President [PERSON1] said, ""Once, when I had an important meeting in [LOCATION3], I knew nothing about it. I logged on to the computer, and it led me to countless pages about their culture, language, and more. I don't know what I would do without a computer."" I enjoy conversing with my friends. But when I'm at home and my friends are not around, I have no one to talk to. If I also don't have access to the phone, the situation becomes even worse. However, if I turn to the computer, I can chat with a multitude of my friends. I can use the webcam to see who I'm talking to or visit another website for instant messaging. I cherish online conversations because one of my dearest friends has moved to [LOCATION2], and I don't get to talk to her often. But through an instant - messaging website, I can communicate with her as much as I want. According to a survey, [NUM1] out of [NUM2] people have someone they communicate with over the internet. Therefore, I assert that computers are essential in our society. They assist us in accomplishing a variety of tasks. They enhance hand - eye coordination, provide us with the opportunity to learn about far - off places, and even enable us to stay in touch with friends and family online. Hence, I don't think computers are harmful to us or our health. Instead, I believe they are indispensable."
555	557	1	1	Dear editor of the [ORGANIZATION1], I am of the opinion that computers are essential for the future. The world has undergone significant technological advancements. While I acknowledge that a lack of physical activity due to computer use is a concern, the knowledge and opportunities computers offer are far from being negative. If humans did not have technology, many of us would lack access to heat or clean water. Computers have become an integral part of our lives. They are particularly beneficial for those who use them to expand their knowledge of the world. For individuals with friends living far away, computers serve as a means of communication. Even those with speech impairments can use computers to express themselves. The [ORGANIZATION2] utilizes computers to save lives. The role of computers in saving lives is so profound that it is terrifying to imagine a world without them. In hospitals, computers are indispensable. Without them, the process of finding a cure for a disease could be significantly prolonged, potentially resulting in the patient's death. For instance, if someone presents with what appears to be a normal fever and it is misdiagnosed, they could die two days later from an undiagnosed disease. Computers are also used to purify water and keep us warm during the winter. Even in libraries, computers play a crucial role. Some people with medical conditions that prevent them from speaking use small computers to communicate. By typing on these devices, the computer can vocalize their words. Most people use some form of computer for talking, chatting, and texting, finding it more convenient. The world is vast, and many of us have limited knowledge about it. However, by going online, we can discover information about things that we may have never known existed or simply were unaware of. Children also rely on computers for their schoolwork. A large number of people depend on technology to navigate through their daily lives. Computers are also helpful for students like me who have suffered an injury, such as a broken arm. I had to take some tests on the computer. In the military, air force, and [ORGANIZATION3], computers have become increasingly important. The military uses thermal sights on guns and tanks to identify people in challenging weather conditions and locate wounded soldiers. They are also working on developing better bullet - proof vests with the help of computers to save more lives in war. The air force uses computers to communicate with ground forces, providing protection and strategic information. They now have planes that can be remotely controlled, which not only saves the lives of pilots but also allows for better surveillance. The [ORGANIZATION3] uses radar, a computer - based technology, to detect approaching boats or submarines, giving them an early warning of potential attacks. In the future, computers could be used to assist people in areas with high poverty rates. In conclusion, computers are life - saving, facilitate communication, and are an excellent tool for research. They have become an essential part of our survival and are crucial for the progress of our society.
556	558	1	1	"Some ""experts"" caution that individuals should not spend excessive time on their computers. However, consider all the advantages of a computer. One can develop superior hand - eye coordination skills, communicate with friends and family who may reside hundreds of miles away, and learn about cultures worldwide, along with the people in those countries, without ever leaving home. In my view, computers overall contribute to society, enabling us to acquire more knowledge daily. Firstly, numerous skills can be developed on the computer. For instance, when playing interactive, high - tempo games, children gain a sense of awareness, timing, and hand - eye coordination. Moreover, with recent technological advancements, people can now attend college without leaving home and at a significantly lower cost while still receiving an excellent education. Many individuals even work from home, thanks to their computers. These are merely a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers. Secondly, why purchase an expensive ticket to a distant country, exchange all your money for the local currency, and endure the hassles of baggage, etc., when you can simply go online and research it on the computer? You can access online information about a country's recipes, language, pictures, and people without the inconvenience of traveling there. Additionally, for children who are too young to visit a particular place or need to write a report on it, instead of sifting through countless textbooks, newspapers, and libraries, they can go online, search for their chosen country, and obtain most, if not all, the information they need. Thus, not only do they acquire the information they would have otherwise learned, but they also expand their knowledge. Finally, the internet facilitates people's connections. Leading experts from the U.S.A., or the Family Security Agency, state that since people started using programs like Skype and Facebook, many more families living in different countries have been able to reconnect and get to know one another. For example, if you have an uncle living in [LOCATION1], you can both purchase cameras for your computers, install them, and within minutes, have a face - to - face conversation. I believe this is superior to simply writing letters, as it is quicker and allows for more in - depth connection. The same applies if a friend or you move away but wish to stay in touch. A quick Facebook account or Skype, and you can remain good friends. All in all, yes, computers do benefit society as they help teach people skills, enable learning about distant cultures and far - off countries, and connect people who may live in different countries. I see no drawbacks to these beneficial aspects for society. So, yes, computers have a positive impact on people."
557	559	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, envision a world filled with large individuals seated at a monitor, their eyes gazing blankly at it. Outside, the city streets are deserted, save for the squirrels scurrying along fence posts. This is what will transpire if people spend too much time on computers. People will engage in less exercise, spend less time outdoors appreciating nature, and have fewer interactions with family and friends. This is why computers have a severe negative impact on people. First of all, people allocate substantial amounts of time to their computers and meager amounts to exercise. In a recent poll conducted by [ORGANIZATION3] magazine, it was reported that [PERCENT1] of people aged between [NUM1] and [NUM2] prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also reveals that since [DATE3], child obesity has increased by [PERCENT2]! [PERSON2] of [ORGANIZATION1] at [ORGANIZATION4] asserts that “the reason child obesity has risen so significantly is that children spend excessive time in front of the computer and less time outdoors.” Do you desire this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending excessive time indoors reduces the time one spends outside enjoying nature. Bird Watchers Monthly has witnessed a decline in subscriptions since [DATE1] because people are no longer interested in nature. In a study carried out by [PERSON1] and his colleagues at [ORGANIZATION2], [CAPS2] of [CAPS3] spend nearly [PERCENT3] more time indoors in front of electronic devices, most commonly computers, than they do outdoors. [PERSON3] remarks, “Due to the new advancements in technology, people are inclined to spend more time indoors than outdoors, and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade progresses.” Finally, spending excessive time in front of the computer leaves less time for interaction with family and friends. In [DATE4], more than [PERCENT4] of families ate dinner together; now, only [PERCENT5] typically do so, usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a monitor. Believe it or not, this also leads to a higher crime rate. Since young children and adolescents lack the support and guidance of a person due to the infrequent time spent together, attributed to the frequent use of computers, there is a [PERCENT6] chance that a child will commit a crime compared to the [PERCENT7] chance in [DATE5]. Do you want this for our youth? Now, envision a world where people jog together in the park. As they jog, they notice a group of bird - watchers huddled under a tree. As the joggers continue, they reach a pavilion and see a large family celebrating the [DATE2] of a family member. This idyllic scenario will not become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. So, Local Newspaper, I encourage you to encourage others to go outside and spend less time in front of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in real lives. But the question is, will you?
558	560	1	1	Dear [CAPS1] Newspaper, although computers offer numerous benefits, they also possess many flaws. I am of the opinion that computers and contemporary technology have far more negative aspects than positive ones. Some of these flaws include adverse effects on eyesight, reduced time spent with family, and decreased physical activity and outdoor time. Admittedly, computers are highly useful, but they also damage eyesight. If you have observed, an increasing number of children are wearing glasses or contacts due to prolonged screen - time. I know more than [NUM1] children who now wear glasses, and I am also aware that over [NUM2] parents I know have glasses for the exact same reason. While using computers is excellent for academic research, if one spends over an hour or [NUM3] hours a day on it, they are likely to become addicted, and eventually, their eyesight will deteriorate. On average, a child spends about [NUM3] or [NUM5] hours on their laptop at night, and the time they spend with their family is perhaps an hour, if the parents are fortunate. Personally, I believe that technology is the reason for the growing disconnect between parents and children. When children use the computer, they often log on to [CAPS3] or [CAPS4] to chat with friends they see every day. I fail to understand why, especially for girls, they don't simply converse with these friends at school since they are together for [NUM6] hours daily. The use of technology is being misused! Computers were invented for knowledge acquisition, not for scandalous “webchats” or “[CAPS4] pages.” The world would be much happier and more mentally healthy if we adhered to the original purpose of technology. Nowadays, children don't even step outside their bedrooms after school; it's pointless! Most people even eat in their rooms so they can chat with others. This deprives parents of time with their children. Now that you have read my thoughts on modern - day technology, don't you agree that it merely consumes time from your actual life? I believe it does, and I hope you concur with me.
559	561	1	1	Dear Newspaper [CAPS1], I am convinced that the computer is beneficial to society because teachers and students conduct most of their studies online. We spend the majority of our time with our family and friends, so we desire a little personal time. We can learn significantly more on the computer as it contains a wealth of facts. After reading this essay, I hope you will support my stance. Teachers and students save most of their notes on laptops and review what they learned in class on the computer. When they need to research something for history class, they can access the internet. High - school students often dislike going to the library, so they turn to the internet as their source of information. Thus, when a student has a project due and the teacher requires it to be neat, the computer can type the project neatly. The computer and the internet have become a significant source of learning in our society. Don't you agree? Most of our time is spent with our families, especially when friends don't visit. We can go outside and play with friends or sit down and play games. Spending a little time on the computer won't harm anyone. We don't use it continuously; we either chat with friends or search for useful information after talking to our families. When we go online to search for something, we can find resources that are up - to - date. People from different countries who wish to learn about a place but cannot visit it need a reliable and current resource. A computer is constantly updated with new facts about everything. I hope that after reading this, you will agree with my position. Almost everyone owns a computer, and it doesn't significantly disrupt their lives. A computer is an excellent resource for the public. People who want to meet new people can use a computer to do so, and students who aim for good grades on their projects can present them nicely with the help of a computer. I believe that agreeing with me would be a wise decision.
560	562	1	1	Dear [CAPS1] [CAPS2] [CAPS3], are you aware that [PERCENT1] of people today utilize the computer for essential purposes? It's true! It's a fact that the computer can assist you in maintaining contact with friends, accessing the latest news, and even providing map access. Allow me to share some crucial facts about the computer. Of course, we all have friends residing in different cities and/or states! Instead of incurring exorbitant phone bills, many people keep in touch via email. Email is high - tech and extremely convenient! All you need is your friend's email address, and you can send them anything from a friendly greeting to [CAPS1] family pictures. Teens enjoy chatting with friends and can get to know each other better through the computer. Sites such as Facebook are extremely popular among this generation of teens. The engaging messages are what make it so appealing. Consider all the available means of connecting with friends and understand why the computer is so remarkable. Every time I log on to the computer, I can access the latest news updates! I recall going online and seeing a pop - up about my favorite band breaking up. Thanks to the computer, I was able to read all about it, and I was extremely glad I saw that because otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to attend their last concert. While I do recognize that the computer may not be the healthiest activity, it is undoubtedly an excellent news source, and everyone reads the news, whether it's political or about celebrities. Knowledge about current events in our country and physical exercise are equally important. Therefore, I would be the first to advocate for the computer's positive impact on people today. Have you ever been lost? Perhaps you didn't write down the correct directions or couldn't remember them. Next time, look up directions on the computer! It's incredibly helpful and can save you a great deal of trouble. There are numerous websites with printable maps, such as MapQuest. It's a much easier and clearer way to determine exactly where you need to go. In my opinion, the computer can be of great assistance, and it would be a good idea to embrace it today. Imagine all the places you could visit just by obtaining a map online! Keep this in mind as one of the many wonderful features of the computer. Now that you know some of the computer's positive aspects, remember how they can benefit you! Being able to chat with friends is one of the best advantages. Don't forget about staying informed with the latest news, and finally, never get lost again by simply printing out a map. I have no doubt that the computer has a very positive impact on everyone! The time is now to go out and get a computer for yourself.
561	563	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, I opine that computers are advantageous for numerous purposes and are beneficial for virtually everything. I hold this view because annually, novel and exhilarating applications and websites are developed, rendering life more convenient. For instance, ""@CAPS2"" serves as a means to communicate with friends and family. In my case, I have family members residing out - of - state, and I am delighted when I access @CAPS2 to converse with them. Alternatively, I can also engage in conversations with friends after a long school day. Another example is ""YouTube."" On YouTube, there are instructional videos that offer step - by - step guidance on any topic, even regarding news and music entertainment. Other applications like Word assist you in structuring essays and narratives. PowerPoint enables you to create slide - show videos for school projects and presentations. Even Excel allows you to generate graphs and any conceivable chart. And let us not overlook @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 provides assistance when you need information about a person, place, or thing. Moreover, utilizing @ORGANIZATION1 facilitates obtaining information for other applications such as Word and more. Evidently, computers aid ordinary individuals in their daily lives."
562	564	1	1	"The query at hand is whether computers exert a positive influence on society. Undoubtedly, computers have a positive impact on society. Computers impart hand - eye coordination, endow people with the ability to learn about distant individuals and locations, and enable people to interact with others online. They have a positive effect on people. Firstly, computers teach people hand - eye coordination. That is to say, computers assist people in learning to synchronize the use of their eyes and hands. A survey carried out by @PERSON3 reveals that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals who use computers possess superior hand - eye coordination compared to those who do not. Professor @PERSON1 asserts, ""Individuals who use a computer are far more coordinated than others; it is a remarkable discovery."" You might be thinking that using a computer would reduce coordination. However, computers truly enhance hand - eye coordination in people. In conclusion, the more one learns to operate a computer, the better their hand - eye coordination will become. Secondly, computers enable people to learn about far - off places and individuals. Specifically, a computer can help you gain knowledge about a distant @CAPS3 without incurring exorbitant travel expenses. I recall when @CAPS4 my parents were planning to visit @CAPS1 to see numerous landmarks, but my uncle brought a brand - new computer to our house, and my parents decided to stay home and saved a substantial amount of money. Renowned explorer @CAPS2 once stated, ""Before traveling anywhere, I always research it on my computer to learn about the lifestyle, climate, etc., of the @CAPS3."" You may be thinking that visiting the @CAPS3 in person would offer a better experience. Nevertheless, it is extremely costly to travel to very distant countries. In conclusion, computers can help you save money and facilitate learning. Thirdly, computers allow people to communicate with others online. That is, people visit specific websites solely to interact with friends. A survey conducted by @ORGANIZATION1 indicates that @PERCENT1 of people communicate with others via those websites. Well - known social worker @PERSON2 remarks, ""@CAPS4 people use these websites, it enhances their vocabulary and social skills."" You might be concerned that those websites are dangerous, but virus - protection software can mitigate such risks. In conclusion, computers contribute to the improvement of social skills. In summary, computers teach people about far - off places, enhance social abilities, and improve hand - eye coordination. Computers can benefit society and learning, so let us support the advancement of technology today!"
563	565	1	1	Dear Newspaper, the contemporary world we inhabit is replete with technology. Everything, from checkout aisles at grocery stores to coffee makers at home, is constantly being upgraded. While technology offers numerous advantages, it also has significant drawbacks. The most prevalent technological device is the computer. It is a valuable asset, yet it can also be highly detrimental. Computers can be employed for bullying, they consume time that could be spent on exercise, and they even undermine social and grammar skills. We are all familiar with websites such as Facebook, MySpace, and @CAPS1. They may seem innocuous, but they are actually breeding grounds for harassment. These sites are purportedly designed to keep friends connected, yet children use them to utter hurtful remarks about one another. Half of the students in my eighth - grade class have admitted to either being bullied or bullying others via the computer. If so many children are being harmed by computers, then why do we continue to use them? Many children might claim that they do not spend excessive time on their computers, but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in my school admit that they do. Checking the computer is the first thing they do upon returning home from school and the last thing they do before going to bed at night. The time these children spend on the computer is detracting from their exercise and the enjoyment of childhood. I have witnessed numerous children gain excessive weight because they do not consume proper food, they do not exercise, and they isolate themselves from reality, all due to their obsession with computers. Children are even acquiring portable computers, which attests to their addiction. Do you want your children to be in such a state? However, the programs and websites on computers do offer opportunities to interact with friends and socialize. Nevertheless, this is eroding social skills, and even grammar. Most children and teenagers prefer to communicate online rather than in person, and often they do not spell words correctly or use proper grammar. In the long run, this over - reliance on computer - mediated communication will impede their academic performance and job prospects. I acknowledge that computers are useful for schoolwork, as they allow you to conduct research for projects and send emails for work. However, the time spent, the prevalence of bullying, and the decline in social skills are not worth the benefits. We need to curtail our society's use of computers, as it will be beneficial when it truly matters. Simply ask yourself: Do you want your children to be bullied? Do you want to gain weight? Do you want to lose your social and grammar skills? Pondering these questions might just change your perspective.
564	566	1	1	Computers do not have a negative impact on society. In fact, when you communicate with someone online, @CAPS1 facilitates the establishment of a relationship with that individual. Another valuable use of computers is the development of hand - eye coordination. Computers also have significant educational value. You can learn about distant places and historical monuments. The misconception is that computers damage relationships between friends and family. However, in some respects, @CAPS1 actually strengthens them. When you use Skype, for example, you engage in online conversations with someone. By doing so, you actually enhance the bond between you and that person. This evidence demonstrates that computers can indeed support relationships. Hand - eye coordination is another useful skill that a computer can teach. When you type on a keyboard, your finger reflexes improve. With continued typing, your hand - eye coordination will gradually enhance. Some may argue that a computer is of little help, but @CAPS1 is truly beneficial. A computer is more educational than most people realize. On certain websites, you can access content that is instructive. For instance, by visiting historical websites, one can learn about different types of people. Many critics claim that computers are not educational. However, when you examine the facts, computers can teach a great deal. It is easy to assume that a computer is not a good thing. But upon considering the facts, owning a computer is a wonderful asset. If critics take these facts into account, they will recognize that a computer is a far better tool than what is commonly believed.
565	567	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers can be both advantageous and disadvantageous for multiple reasons. Firstly, I consider them beneficial as they can assist with schoolwork, such as conducting research and performing other tasks required for academic purposes. Secondly, computers are helpful because they teach hand - eye coordination. Additionally, they enable people to communicate with family members in other countries via webcam. Although computers can be highly useful, they can also be detrimental to your health and family life. I concur that computers can reduce the time available for exercise. Instead of spending all day on the computer, one could visit the park or take a walk, among other activities. Moreover, excessive computer use can disrupt interactions with family and friends. If you stay indoors using the computer all the time while your family and friends wish to spend time with you, it can cause issues. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper, these are the reasons why I believe computers can be both good and bad. Overall, I predominantly think that computers are a positive addition. If we did not have computers, we would not possess many of the things we have in the world today. In conclusion, the utility of computers depends on how and how much we use them. These are my perspectives on computers.
566	568	1	1	Computers provide access to information and enable research from a distance. However, the question remains: Are they beneficial? Proponents of technological advancements assert that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. I concur with this view. I believe that a computer can be utilized to acquire knowledge from remote locations, and it also enhances hand - eye coordination. Moreover, it is reasonable to use a computer for research or other necessary tasks. When using a computer, one can reap the benefits of researching and studying far - flung places. This is advantageous as some individuals have an interest in locations around the world. Additionally, students nowadays require computers as their teachers assign typed assignments or PowerPoint presentations. Parents also use computers for work or to book vacations. Some claim that using a computer can improve hand - eye coordination, which is indeed true when typing. Typing is a skill; some people type rapidly, some slowly, and others at an average pace. To teach children and even some adults, a typing game has been developed on the computer. Some individuals who type extremely fast take tests to measure their speed, with results like seventy words per minute. On average, people type about thirty words per minute. I believe that individuals should be permitted to use computers for essential tasks such as research. Many children have discovered websites like Facebook, iTunes, YouTube, and Twitter. Some become addicted and never log off. Moreover, these and other websites may offer content that can introduce viruses. Viruses vary in strength; some can crash a computer, while others flood the monitor with pop - ups. I believe it is acceptable to use the computer for research or to book vacations. If one is addicted to other websites, they should stop, as a single click of the mouse could crash the computer. Overall, I believe that computers are an excellent source of information but should not be an addictive so - called toy. Computers have a positive impact on people. Just avoid addiction and go outside to exercise with friends and family.
567	569	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to address the prevalent question of whether computers are a boon to our generation. In my opinion, they are not. Please do not misunderstand me; I am not averse to using computers. However, there are numerous reasons why computers have a detrimental effect on many children and some adults in this era. Firstly, excessive computer use leads to a lack of physical activity. This is the reason why there are more than @NUM1 million overweight children today. For instance, I used to be an avid computer user, and I still enjoy it, but I have noticed its negative impact on my health. Secondly, the internet is rife with inappropriate content that children @NUM2 and younger may access. I believe that people worldwide should start appreciating nature and traveling the world, engaging in activities that cannot be done on a computer. I also think that children should interact more with their families and friends instead of constantly chatting with their peers online. Finally, cyberbullying is a serious issue on the internet. Local newspaper, if you have daughters, sons, or grandchildren, would you be horrified if they were being bullied online, threatened with harm, or even driven to self - harm? I am certain you would want the perpetrator to face legal consequences. From now on, I will be more mindful of how my computer usage affects my life and those around me. I urge others to do the same.
568	570	1	1	You are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer, and your parents are concerned. You realize it is time to step away and venture outdoors. You spend approximately @PERCENT1 of your day on the computer, but there are valid reasons for this. You can multitask on it, communicate with friends and family you have not seen or spoken to in a long time, and still have time for outdoor activities. If you were astute, you would not heed the advice of those so - called experts. Have you ever encountered the term “multitasking”? It refers to the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, you can read while talking, text while conversing, or walk while reading. The computer offers numerous multitasking opportunities. Another example is that while using the computer, you can listen to music, chat with friends, or read. You can even engage in all three activities while doing your homework, such as typing an essay. Approximately @PERCENT2 of us are capable of multitasking. One of my friends recently purchased a laptop with a built - in camera, enabling them to communicate with long - lost acquaintances. “I haven't seen my sister since she moved to California @NUM2 years ago, so I thought I'd use the webcam on my laptop to see her,” said a mother from the @ORGANIZATION1. Computers and laptops are excellent for staying in touch with friends and family you have not seen in a long time. A student also remarked, “If you were intelligent and understanding, you would comprehend why everyone spends so much time on the computer.” When you are on the computer and your friends start chatting with you, you understand their motivation, as you usually only see them during lunch or before class. Computers facilitate communication with friends more effectively than writing letters or waiting for class to end. You get off the bus and notice the bright sunshine. You decide to complete some or all of your homework so that you can go outside and play. You spend a few hours outdoors. When you return home around @NUM2:00 pm, you have dinner and then unwind by using the computer. You can use the computer while there is activity outside, just like wild animals in their natural habitat. Only responsible individuals manage their time effectively. In conclusion, it is crucial to recognize that computers are beneficial for multitasking, communicating with long - lost friends and family, and that you can balance indoor and outdoor activities. If you were wise, you would not listen to those experts.
569	571	1	1	In the contemporary era, computers have evolved significantly from their predecessors. While they assist with projects and homework, many experts express concerns about excessive computer usage. In my view, computers offer numerous benefits, such as enhancing hand - eye coordination. They are also useful for maintaining contact with friends and family members who are geographically distant, and computer skills are highly valued in the professional world. Hand - eye coordination is a vital skill, and using a computer can help develop it. For example, when typing a @NUM1 - page report, an individual with good hand - eye coordination can complete it in approximately @NUM2 minutes. Conversely, someone with poor coordination may take several hours. Clearly, no one relishes spending hours in front of a computer. Everyone has friends and loved ones with whom they interact daily. However, what happens when a friend moves away, perhaps to another town, state, or even country? They may be forgotten or lost touch with. Thanks to technological advancements, computers enable people to stay connected through platforms like @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messaging, MySpace, or Facebook. They can catch up on each other's lives, view new photos, and stay informed. The same applies to family members who have relocated. Who would not want to communicate with long - lost friends or relatives? Moreover, computer skills are indispensable in the real world. Individuals with expertise in the computer field can secure lucrative jobs, such as computer programmers for the state or website developers. Other career options for those with computer experience include movie or @CAPS2 show editors, which can be highly rewarding financially. This is why schools offer computer classes, to equip students with a solid foundation in computer knowledge. In conclusion, computers are not as detrimental as some may claim. They enhance hand - eye coordination, facilitate online communication, and open up career opportunities. Many educated individuals would concur that computers have a positive impact on people.
570	572	1	1	Dear leader of the local newspaper, I have noticed a rather peculiar misconception that computers are undermining our society. In my opinion, this is a fallacious notion. Firstly, the internet, which is commonly available with home desktop computers, is a vast source of knowledge about the world. It provides up - to - date information that can be updated instantaneously, unlike books that require republishing. This is particularly beneficial for students working on school projects, especially in subjects like @CAPS1. Moreover, online schools and colleges have emerged as a cost - effective alternative to traditional institutions. While regular colleges can be prohibitively expensive, online education is accessible to a wider range of people. As computers contain a wealth of information, the role of traditional schools may be diminishing. Secondly, the internet can bring a great deal of enjoyment to users. With the increasing number of computer users, companies are developing computer - based shows that attract thousands of viewers daily, making television seem less relevant. Additionally, new software is released almost daily, offering games, movies, and music. Staying in touch with others around the world is also made easy through various chat programs, allowing distant relatives to connect. Finally, the demand for computers has led to an increase in computer - related jobs. Companies now accept online job applications and resumes, and many jobs can only be performed online. Banks, for example, rely heavily on the internet for their operations. This allows workers to complete tasks efficiently from a single location, eliminating the need for commuting to a physical office. Given these advantages, it is evident that computers are beneficial to society. Education has become more accessible, and users can enjoy a variety of entertainment options. Jobs are also more convenient and efficient. So, leader of the newspaper, do you and others still believe that computers are a waste of time? I hope these reasons convince you of the positive impact of computers on society.
571	573	1	1	You appear to be under the impression that computers are detrimental and offer no assistance in people's real - life situations. However, numerous individuals utilize computers to discover yoga postures and diet advice, which undeniably contributes to both their physical and mental well - being. While it is true that computers can sometimes lead children into trouble when they engage in chatting on platforms such as (@CAPS1, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), they often fail to recognize the identities of those on the other side of the screen. They become so engrossed in these digital interactions that they neglect to focus on actual life. Nevertheless, computers also possess positive aspects. One can search for necessary items and access travel websites. Hence, it is inaccurate to claim that computers are entirely negative as they aid a great many people. Therefore, one should carefully evaluate the capabilities of computers, as they truly do provide valuable support in life, especially for those with physical requirements.
572	574	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers have had a profound and positive impact on individuals within society. This conviction stems from the fact that they enhance cognitive abilities, fulfill entertainment requirements, and provide avenues for social interaction through various websites and online chat platforms. These are essential elements in people's daily lives, and here's how. Firstly, computers are excellent educational tools. Although one can opt to read a book, using a computer is far more efficient. One can rapidly and effortlessly type in a query, and within seconds, access millions of sources that can offer the required information. Moreover, computers can expose users to places they have long desired to explore, providing precise locations and detailed information about those areas. I can anticipate your amazement, but there's more. Computers can offer step - by - step instructions for constructing objects or creating works of art. Secondly, computers serve as a source of entertainment. They enable users to play games, watch movies, and catch up on TV shows that were missed due to work or other important commitments. Lastly, in the realm of social interaction, computers allow individuals to make new friends or stay in touch with existing ones through platforms like Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, etc. Maintaining positive social connections can help combat depression. If one is consistently content while using the computer, there is less room for feelings of sadness. Additionally, if one has any lingering questions, the computer can provide comprehensive answers, leaving the user satisfied. As is evident, computers are capable of performing numerous remarkable feats, and what I've mentioned is merely a fraction of their potential. Computers will undoubtedly become an increasingly integral part of our lives, and those who are unable to use them may encounter difficulties. If you hold a different view, I kindly request that you consider my perspective. Thank you for your time.
573	575	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers exert a beneficial influence on individuals as they cultivate hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning about diverse individuals and locations, and offer avenues for self - entertainment. As previously stated, computers are highly effective in enhancing hand - eye coordination. In today's world, this skill is of utmost importance, as it is essential for proficient sports performance and typing. When I was @NUM1 years old, I had poor hand - eye coordination, which negatively affected my sports performance. However, after several years of engaging in online activities, my skills in baseball, lacrosse, and basketball have significantly improved. Additionally, my typing speed has increased from @NUM2 to @NUM3 words per minute, enabling me to write reports more swiftly and allocate more time for revision. Moreover, the internet allows me to conduct web searches, which expedites the process of writing reports. Throughout history, people have needed to support their opinions with evidence. Now, the internet provides an accessible means for individuals to find facts related to their topics. This kind of assistance simplifies school projects, reduces the burden on students, and offers opportunities to assist those in need. When I was preparing my position paper this year, I realized I needed @NUM1 resources. Ordinarily, this would have been a challenging task, but with the aid of computers, research has become significantly easier. Secondly, while researching my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I gained valuable knowledge, such as the fact that citizens do not directly elect the president. The votes they cast actually elect a delegate to represent them at the @CAPS2. Finally, during the earthquake in @LOCATION1, I was able to make a donation through the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 website. These instances illustrate the significance of the internet in enabling people to learn about others and different places and to offer help when needed. Lastly, one of the greatest advantages of the internet and computers is the ability to entertain oneself through online games and movies. My mother often tells me to find ways to amuse myself independently, and the internet and computers allow me to play online games alone. Additionally, watching movies on computers can be a great way to relax. These are the reasons why I believe computers are crucial for improving hand - eye coordination, learning about various people and places, and self - entertainment. Although my opinion is personal, I hope you will emphasize the importance of computers in your future articles.
574	576	1	1	You seem to be utterly irrational! Computers are of paramount significance to society. My primary rationale is that computers can be employed for research purposes. Secondly, online purchases can be made with ease. Lastly, they facilitate communication through voice and video chats. These are the three compelling reasons why computers are indispensable to society. Should you desire further information, feel free to inquire. Firstly, computers are invaluable for research. For instance, if your boss needs to ascertain the market value of products, all you need to do is visit www.google.com and conduct a search. It is that straightforward. Moreover, if you need to conduct research on @ORGANIZATION1 for academic purposes, instead of poring over books, you can simply type in the name and obtain the necessary information. In @CAPS1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 children and adults utilize computers for research. This serves as my first reason. Secondly, the convenience of online shopping is unparalleled. Suppose you wish to purchase a plane ticket to @LOCATION1 for a humanitarian cause. You can effortlessly do so on your computer at your convenience. You can also order various items required for @LOCATION1. This is far more convenient than going out and making the purchases in person. This is my second reason. Lastly, computers enable seamless communication. If you and your colleagues are located in different countries and need to hold a video meeting, it can be easily arranged. Similarly, if you have relatives living far away whom you miss dearly, you can have a video - call family gathering. This is my final reason. I sincerely hope you will take these reasons into account and recognize the importance of computers to society.
575	577	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, there has been an ongoing debate regarding whether modern computer - related activities are beneficial or detrimental to people. Some individuals contend that computers contribute positively to society as they enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places, and facilitate interaction with friends. While these aspects may seem to suggest that computers are advantageous to society, the reality is quite the contrary. Excessive computer use can lead to several adverse side effects, including obesity, eye strain, and even cyberbullying. People are using computers to an extent that is detrimental to their health. Obesity is the most prominent issue in @LOCATION1. It appears that people are steadily gaining weight. Computers undoubtedly play a role in this problem. People are spending an inordinate amount of time on their computers and neglecting physical exercise, outdoor activities, and social interactions with family and friends. They sit in front of the computer for hours on end, gradually becoming heavier. Due to feelings of loneliness, they often resort to emotional eating. This cycle continues until a person finds it difficult to even stand up from their chair. Obesity is not the only health concern; eye damage is also a significant problem. It is evident that an increasing number of people are experiencing eye - related issues. Prolonged computer use is the culprit. Even an hour of computer use can cause significant eye strain. The computer screen places a tremendous burden on the eyes, and for those who spend @NUM1 - @DATE1 hours a day on the computer, the risk of blindness is alarmingly high. When I use the computer for just @NUM2 minutes, my eyes start to water. This is a tragic consequence of excessive computer use. Computers are clearly harming people's health, and something must be done about it. Moreover, computers are not only damaging people's health but also ruining their lives. Bullying has been a long - standing problem in @LOCATION1. In the past, kids were bullied at school but could find solace at home with their family and friends. However, with the advent of technologies such as video - chat systems on computers, this has changed. While these features can be useful, they can also be misused. Now, bullied students are not safe even at home as they can be cyberbullied through video - chat, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. I am aware of a case where a student was so severely cyberbullied that she resorted to a public display of her depression on the internet, even attempting suicide. Computers made this tragic event possible. These digital platforms give bullies the opportunity to push their victims to the brink of despair, where they may consider suicide. I understand that you may disagree with my argument, but I sincerely hope that you will recognize the gravity of this situation. In my view, the evidence of obesity, eye strain, and cyberbullying is sufficient to convince you to write an article about these harmful machines. They are causing a wide range of problems in people's physical and mental well - being. I earnestly hope that you will consider writing this article.
576	578	1	1	Computers are ubiquitous tools that everyone utilizes, yet there comes a time when one should disengage and immerse in real - life experiences. Computers do cultivate hand - eye coordination, facilitate communication with friends and family, and offer opportunities to explore distant places and cultures. However, they also lead individuals to spend excessive time on the device, resulting in less time dedicated to physical exercise, appreciation of nature, and interaction with loved ones. Exercise is a crucial aspect of people's lives as it helps maintain physical fitness and health. A significant percentage ( @PERCENT1 ) of obesity cases can be attributed to excessive computer use. Sitting in front of the screen all day, indulging in sedentary activities, becomes a norm. I advocate for imposing a limit on computer usage so that people can allocate more time to physical exertion. Regrettably, most individuals are oblivious to the detrimental effects. As time passes, they become less healthy and weaker. They fail to recognize that prolonged sitting while consuming junk food has long - term consequences. Once this behavior becomes a habit, people simply spend hours and hours on the computer. Not only does it reduce the time for exercise, but it also curtails the time spent enjoying life's simple pleasures. Computers are highly addictive; one may start with a few minutes, but before realizing it, several hours ( @CAPS1 ) have elapsed. When people are engrossed in computers, they forget mundane as well as enjoyable activities like shopping with friends and family or appreciating nature. It steals precious time that could be spent visiting various places, such as parks, stores, and restaurants.
577	579	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that the extensive use of computers is a highly detrimental phenomenon for people across the globe. This is because it prevents individuals from engaging in physical exercise, enjoying the natural scenery, and having quality time with family and friends. When one is occupied with the computer, the body remains inactive. This is a grave issue since ( @CAPS2 ) the lack of physical activity can significantly reduce life expectancy. If ( @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ) this trend persists, an increasing number of children will become overweight and unhealthy. Thus, children seem to prioritize the internet over their well - being. According to an expert ( @PERSON1 ), ""@PERCENT1 of children in grades @NUM2 in school today weigh over @NUM1 pounds, while the average should be @NUM3 pounds or less."" If ( @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ) the computer obsession continues, kids will refrain from going outdoors and having fun. Prudent parents aspire for their children to have a good time in the backyard. When ( @CAPS2 ) children stay indoors instead of going outside, they miss out on essential vitamins from sunlight. Experts at @ORGANIZATION1 stated, ""If ( @CAPS2 ) children do not limit their computer usage, they will never truly appreciate the beauty of the outdoors."" Evidently, nature is essential for children. Social interaction with friends and family is vital for everyone. For instance, if ( @CAPS2 ) a family member faces a health crisis and has to be hospitalized, no one may be present to offer support because family members rarely communicate. One year, I learned that my great - grandmother had passed away from cancer. I was completely unaware of her illness. I deeply regret not being by her side at the hospital. This is because we seldom talked. Let us not allow such tragedies to happen. Instead, we should engage in conversations and create memories with our friends and family. In conclusion, it is evident that excessive computer use is extremely harmful as it can shorten life, cause childhood obesity, and lead to social isolation. Therefore, we must prevent this from affecting others and spread awareness."
578	580	1	1	What if your family members are all accessible online, and a significant percentage of people communicate via the internet? Is this a negative phenomenon? I wholeheartedly support online communication. Firstly, numerous children have online friends with whom they cannot communicate via text or phone. Online platforms provide an alternative and convenient means of interaction. Statistics show that ( @NUM1 of @NUM2 ) kids are actively engaged in online communication. Undoubtedly, children bring home school projects and homework regularly. Wouldn't it be wiser for them to search for information online rather than making guesses and getting answers wrong? I understand that some children lack access to computers, the internet, or face restrictions on online use. I recall a time when I had a school project and made random guesses, which negatively impacted my grade. Subsequently, I decided to utilize the internet for my next project, and the result was a much - improved grade. Secondly, the internet is indispensable for educational purposes. Many assignments require online research. Thirdly, most people have family members on the internet and cherish the opportunity to connect with them. Even if one spends a considerable amount of time online, it is often for meaningful reasons, such as staying in touch with family. For example, I rarely interacted with my family before getting internet access. However, after my son encouraged me to get connected, I can now communicate with my family daily. Admittedly, some individuals may spend excessive time on the computer and neglect physical exercise. Nevertheless, the benefits of online communication outweigh the drawbacks. The internet is a powerful tool that enables kids to interact with friends, complete schoolwork effectively, and connect with family members. The key question is whether one supports or opposes internet access. We should make informed decisions and embrace the positive aspects of the internet.
579	581	1	1	Are computers advantageous to society? I contend that computers are, in fact, not beneficial to society. In this article, I will elucidate how excessive computer use leads to reduced physical activity, less time spent with family and friends, and diminished appreciation of nature. If you are someone who is constantly glued to the computer, consider this: Spending an inordinate amount of time on the computer results in little to no physical exercise. Everyone requires a certain level of physical activity to maintain fitness and health. Since the advent of high - tech computers, the obesity rate in our country has risen. I believe this is one of the primary causes of obesity, which is a pressing concern in our technology - driven society. Apart from reduced exercise, excessive computer use also curtails the time spent interacting with family and friends. Although one can communicate with family members on social media platforms like Facebook, face - to - face interaction is a fundamental human need. Family members will always stand by you, but building a strong relationship necessitates in - person communication. The same principle applies to friendships. Social interaction is an essential part of human life. Moreover, everyone should experience the beauty of nature. Being confined indoors to use the computer is a regrettable choice. The wonders of nature are accessible to all, yet ( @NUM1 ) of people fail to seize the opportunity. Outdoor activities are crucial for one's well - being. Exposure to sunlight and exploration of the natural world can have a profound impact on one's life. However, if ( @CAPS1 ) you remain on the computer for extended periods ( @NUM2 ), you will miss out on these experiences. In conclusion, computers do not contribute positively to society. People suffer from lack of exercise, limited social interaction, and reduced appreciation of nature. These fundamental needs should be prioritized over excessive computer use.
580	582	1	1	With a simple click of the mouse, one can access the vast expanse of the internet. Computers and the internet are relatively recent technological advancements that have become ubiquitous in modern households. Over the past twenty years, they have undergone significant improvements and gained widespread popularity. I firmly believe that they have significantly benefited society. One of the primary advantages of computers is their role in facilitating learning. Imagine life in ( @DATE1 ) without the aid of computers. It would be vastly different. For instance, I could not have produced a high - quality research paper without the use of a computer. The internet is a treasure trove of information, housing databases, encyclopedias, and articles on virtually every topic. Searching for information is incredibly straightforward; one simply needs to enter relevant keywords, and the desired results are readily available. This is far more efficient than manually skimming through numerous books. Once the information is retrieved, it can be easily copied into a ( @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ) document and printed. Another significant benefit of computers is in the realm of communication. In recent years, I have realized its importance firsthand. A family I have known my entire life moved to @LOCATION1 due to job opportunities. Thanks to the internet, I have been able to maintain regular contact with them. I am certain that countless others have experienced similar situations. Whether through email, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messenger, or Facebook, people can communicate with others worldwide. It is more convenient than coordinating phone calls to suit both parties' schedules. Without this global connection, our lives would be significantly less connected. Computers have not only transformed personal lives but also revolutionized the medical field. Scientists and doctors can discover new breakthroughs and stay updated on the latest advancements. Doctors utilize computers to plan and execute surgical procedures, which has advanced medical research and diagnosis, ultimately saving many lives. A substantial percentage ( @PERCENT1 ) of medical research tests use computers to analyze and understand diseases. In conclusion, the technology of computers has had a profound and positive impact on contemporary society. It has connected people across the globe and facilitated learning. I hope this highlights how computers have shaped and enhanced our world.
581	583	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I concur with the experts regarding people spending excessive time on the computer. The rationale is that family and friends become distant, mood fluctuations may occur, and there is also a risk of obesity. Finally, computers can perform numerous functions to a great extent. When one spends an inordinate amount of time on the computer, one's family will begin to express concern. If one were to remain on a computer throughout an entire day, it would prompt others to perceive one differently. Moreover, if on a particular day one stays indoors and friends come over but one says, ""I don't wish to go out,"" they will gradually drift away. As a teenager, I stay up engaging in texting, conversing, and going outdoors, and I detest seeing a friend engrossed in the computer when I desire to socialize. When I was a certain age, I used to be constantly on the computer for days to weeks until my friends and family advised me not to let it consume me. I had a friend who was an excellent athlete, extremely humorous, and kind, but when his mother got him a computer, I no longer wished to be his friend. When I was a specific age, I would become irate over everything if I couldn't use the computer; I was like a spoiled child. Additionally, I used to be overweight because I never went outside to exercise or even to my own room. The reason I ceased being his friend was that he would get angry if I came over to invite him outside. Also, when he did come outside, he would never do anything or run because he was always extremely tired. Essentially, what I am trying to convey is that the computer can truly transform people in numerous adverse ways. The final aspect that causes everyone to change is what computers can currently accomplish. For instance, a game called [Game Name] can rapidly induce addiction, and one scarcely does anything else. Another drawback is [Social Media Platform], although it enables one to keep in touch with friends, if one spends too much time on it, one becomes hooked. Lastly, online chat rooms or games where one can create an avatar resembling oneself can lead one to believe that this will be one's life from now on. Additionally, people assume that computers can do anything, but in reality, they cannot. Everything a computer can do is like a drug; it is addictive. Well, I have just presented a brief account of the many things a computer can do, but to refresh your memory, I will reiterate. The reasons I concur are that family and friends sometimes seem distant, one experiences mood swings and less exercise, and finally, what a computer can currently do. Since you are now aware of the potential dangers, I recommend that you reconsider the use of computers."
582	584	1	1	Dear newspaper, I dissent from your view regarding computers. I opine that computers are beneficial for projects, homework, or correspondence. For example, if you have a project and are disinclined to visit the library, you can utilize a computer to access information on virtually anything. Moreover, you need not draw pictures as that is the function of printers. Additionally, when faced with homework, most children, teenagers, and even adults dislike it. A computer can assist you in quickly looking up answers online. Suppose you have to write an essay; I am aware that no one relishes writing essays by hand. You can type it expeditiously, design it creatively, and make it appear more presentable than a hand - written one. Furthermore, I understand that no one likes to keep track of hand - written work. If you misplace it, you have to start anew, which is extremely time - consuming, especially if it is due the next day. You may become bored, reluctant to rewrite it, and angry because you have already completed it. Then, when you unexpectedly find the lost paper, it can be extremely frustrating. Moreover, there is a risk that someone may steal your work, copy it, and put their name on it after altering some of your ideas to avoid significant grade deductions. This can cause a grade to plummet from [Grade 1] to [Grade 2] in no time. Lastly, you can use a computer to write various types of letters. If you are a teacher, you can write report cards and other official letters. You can also write a letter to a friend who has moved away. You can even write love letters to your wife or girlfriend at work or school quickly, rather than writing by hand, which can be arduous. If the recipient has a computer, they can receive the letter promptly. If they work at a school, they can access it as every school should be equipped with a computer. Another type of letter you can write is to a friend you haven't seen in years or who has moved to another country or state. Therefore, I hope I have convinced you of the advantages of having a computer. As you mentioned, it isn't always advisable to be on the computer constantly, but occasional use, especially in an emergency, is acceptable. For example, if someone in your family has passed away and you don't know how to get to the location, you can go online and print out directions. Now that you understand the importance of a computer, I hope you use it judiciously.
583	585	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, Computers! Computers! Computers! It seems that computers have become the topic of the year. While many believe that computers are indispensable for daily life, I must disagree. In my perspective, we do not require computers. The impacts of computers on both children and adults are astonishing. Nowadays, humans are spending less time in nature and engaging in physical activity, which is detrimental to both personal health and the environment. Additionally, as children grow up, they have an overabundance of advantages due to computers. Thirdly, a substantial amount of money is being allocated to computers rather than to truly important matters! As can be seen, these three reasons alone should convince anyone that computers are harmful in all aspects of life. Firstly, as we continue to use computers, our natural environment is being squandered. The effects on nature and humans are abysmal. Pollution is spreading across the globe! People are becoming addicted to computers. You may be shocked to learn that the average person spends approximately ten hours on a computer each day, which is nearly half of the day! This is a terrifying consequence as computers are essentially brainwashing us. Instead of spending all day on the computer, we should venture outside to enjoy the fresh air and sunlight. Moreover, computers keep us sedentary indoors all day, preventing us from getting any exercise, which is a health issue that we need to address. We should appreciate the simple things in life. Consequently, banning computers would have a positive impact. Today, many are losing their ability to write by hand and are forgetting about the simple joys of life. Would writing an essay with a pencil and paper be so terrible? This may seem old - fashioned, but there are numerous benefits to using pen and paper. Perhaps, the [Region] would become more intelligent and knowledgeable. Writing everything out has been proven to aid in remembering important facts more easily and for a longer duration; it is like engraving the information in one's brain. Therefore, students, children, and adults would benefit from having better handwriting. Since most information is typed on the computer, people are forgetting how to write neatly, clearly, and responsibly. [Teacher] is an English teacher who has been at the [School] since before the advent of computers. She has witnessed the detrimental effects on her students firsthand. [Teacher] told me, ""[Exclamation], students are completely engrossed in computers and have lost all vitality, energy, and creativity! Kids have too many advantages with computers and are not taking the time to learn properly."" Last, but definitely not least, is my third reason why computers are negatively affecting humans. Humans are spending large sums of money on acquiring the latest computer technology. A significant portion of people's paychecks is being used for their computers. These fancy computers are not only expensive but also largely useless. In my opinion, many people are simply following a trend. Instead, the money could be spent on schools and, especially, on addressing global conflicts! Do you hear the humming of the computer and the clicking of the buttons? Realize that these are not the things you should be spending your money on! To conclude, computers have a negative impact on people. There are numerous reasons to support this claim, but here are three. Firstly, people are not spending any time in nature. Secondly, people of all ages are being brainwashed by this electronic device and are not investing the time to learn in a meaningful way. Thirdly, people are squandering all their money on computers! I understand that some people consider computers to be very useful, but after reading this article, I hope you recognize how unhelpful they can be."
584	586	1	1	Dear newspaper editor, In my opinion, computers have a positive influence on people. The Internet enables people to communicate. People can learn about various things, places, and even their own family history. I also believe that with appropriate usage, it can be beneficial to one's well - being. If the Internet had never been invented, how would one communicate with people from around the world? Mr. editor, suppose you were fourteen and had no friends. You could always join online communities such as MySpace, Facebook, or others to make friends. Another scenario is when a family member or friend goes to another country on vacation and cannot make long - distance calls. You can communicate with them via [Communication Platform] or similar services. If one is not particularly interested in using the Internet for communication, one can use it for learning. With the Internet, one can acquire a vast amount of knowledge. One can even attend school online. As I mentioned, one can learn about anything. Once, when I had a school project on Frederick Douglass, I used the Internet for assistance. I learned about his family, his childhood, his place of origin, and many other important facts. The Internet can be an excellent search tool, but one should not spend too much time on it as one's body requires other activities. I believe that the Internet can also improve one's health. People often claim that spending time on the computer leads to weight gain and poor health, but I do not agree. Firstly, using the mouse on a computer helps improve hand - eye coordination. One can also look up diet plans, find health - related medications, or discover new exercise methods. This is why I think the Internet can be beneficial to one's body. All these reasons support my view that the Internet has positive effects on people.
585	587	1	1	An increasing number of people are utilizing computers; in fact, approximately [Percentage] of [Group] has computers, and everyone makes use of them. I believe that having a computer is highly advantageous as it can be employed for emailing, job - related tasks, and schoolwork. This is why I think owning a computer is a good thing. What is your opinion? As I was saying, computers are excellent for emailing and even instant messaging. Suppose you play baseball and forget the time of your game. You can simply turn on the computer and send a message to your coach inquiring about the time you need to be at the field. Additionally, instant messaging allows you to communicate with friends online, which is a great way to interact and meet new people. Emailing is remarkable; it is a high - tech means of communication. You can send an email to a family member living thousands of miles away. I once did this. My aunt Lisa was in Florida, and I asked her to send me pictures of the water and the beaches, and she did. The pictures were captivating. Another reason why computers are useful is for work. In today's world, everything is computer - driven. For example, cash registers, ATMs, and cars rely on computer systems. So, having a computer for work is extremely beneficial. If your boss asks you to fax a copy, you can do it via the computer within a minute. I know that my dad's job requires him to keep all his work on his desktop or laptop. This is why most jobs involve the use of computers. Do you have one at your workplace? Lastly, computers are also valuable for school. For example, my teacher uses his computer to manage attendance, assign homework, and more. If he didn't have a computer, he would be at a loss. It is also beneficial for students. Every week in social studies, we have to research the presidents, and I use my laptop for this purpose. Did you know that there is a program called PowerSchool where you can view your grades and missing assignments? Computers are great for school. I think everyone should own one. So, what do you think about them? Are they amazing? I believe they are very helpful as they can be used for emailing, working, and schoolwork. If it weren't for computers, we wouldn't know as much as we do now. Approximately [Percentage] of [Group] has them. Computers will significantly assist you throughout your life. Welcome to the modern world.
586	588	1	1	"Dear the newspaper, computers are remarkable resources and offer assistance in numerous ways. Since we possess the technology, why not utilize it? Computers provide us with straightforward yet highly useful programs such as @ORGANIZATION1 Word or Photoshop, exceptional capabilities to search for any information we desire, and enable us to maintain contact with distant relatives through platforms like Facebook or video - chat applications such as Skype. Can you imagine that you were on the verge of completing an essay for school when you misspelled a word and had to start from scratch? This is precisely what occurred frequently when computers were not available, and one had to use a typewriter. Unlike typewriters, computers have programs like Microsoft Word, where if you make a simple error, all you need to do is press the backspace key. With programs of this kind, creating essays and flyers is extremely easy. There are also numerous other programs such as PowerPoint, Photoshop, or video - editing software. These operate in real - time. You can simply insert your camera chip into your computer, and voila, instant editing is possible. Programs that can be downloaded simplify life significantly and save a great deal of time. Alongside the programs for writing papers, you can use the internet and Google to obtain information! All you have to do is type in a short phrase, and instantly, you will get thousands of sites, all brimming with information. Instead of spending ten minutes on Dictionary.com, you can find what you need in a split - second. I conducted a tally, and @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids use the internet at least once a day! Suppose you had a party approaching, but you had no creative ideas for food. Just type in ""creative foods for a party,"" and you will easily have hundreds of new recipes to choose from. The internet is an extraordinary invention that is very simple and helpful to use. Another wonderful aspect of using a computer is social networking platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, or Skype. This is an excellent way to catch up with old friends from high school or college or to plan a major event while relaxing at home. If you had soccer practice at night and thus couldn't hang out with friends but still had time for a quick chat, this is ideal. Skype and other video - chat applications are amazing. They are very convenient when you need to communicate with someone in @LOCATION1 for business purposes and don't want to travel. All you have to do is open a link, and boom, they're right there! These are great for businesses and long - distance relationships. I have an uncle and aunt who live in @LOCATION1, and we use Skype to stay in touch. It is a fantastic way to communicate across the globe. Computers may make us ""appear"" lazy, but they offer a great deal. They save time and eliminate the need to run around and exercise. Computers have amazing programs that assist us in every way, the internet for quick information, and social connections to keep in touch with family, friends, and businesses. Computers are one of the most convenient things we have, and I strongly urge you to concur with me."
587	589	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I am of the opinion that engaging with computers has a positive impact on individuals. It is also a fact that some people are not getting sufficient exercise. To address the issue of insufficient exercise, we should participate in sports or engage in family activities to at least leave our homes. Everyone needs to cease being indolent and become more active. I propose that an exercise day be established and transformed into a tradition. It could occur twice a year, more frequently per month, or at any interval as long as there is at least one day when @LOCATION2 or even more people can engage in exercise.
588	590	1	1	I utilize a computer constantly, and I am in good health. Merely because one uses a computer more than engaging in physical exercise does not imply that they are unhealthy. I believe that computers are highly beneficial in life. Now, I will elaborate on some of the ways in which computers are helpful in life. Computers aid in determining the weather and provide all the information one needs. They can even assist if you have a job and are unsure about your work hours, thus preventing time wastage. Computers are also a source of entertainment. You can visit various websites and play any games. You can also communicate with people via them. Or receive emails, which are similar to receiving real mail but from a computer. However, there may be some problems. People are using computers excessively. They need to engage in more physical activity. So, this is my perspective on computers. Hopefully, people will increase their physical activity.
589	591	1	1	Dear, since a significant number of people in the world use computers, we are all aware of their common uses, such as surfing the internet, playing games, and for work and school. Some individuals believe that computers are beneficial for teaching hand - eye coordination, learning about other parts of the world, and communicating with others online. I am currently in the @NUM1 grade at Mystic Middle School. I contend that computers are not as advantageous as some people perceive. Have you ever heard of computer camps? This is where some children are sent because they are addicted to computers. At these camps, the children are detached from computers and essentially compelled to join groups that engage in activities like fishing or collaborating to solve a mystery. These camps are widely recognized as effective for children addicted to computers. Another reason why computers are detrimental is the internet. The internet is a highly perilous place because you can chat with people you do not even know. You can never be certain; these people could be mentally unstable. They might attempt to discover your location and come after you. Therefore, you must always be cautious about whom you communicate with; otherwise, you could be in danger. Nothing ever truly goes smoothly with computers; they always become slower and slower with each use. Approximately every two years, a child or parent may have to replace a computer. Moreover, if your computer does not have the appropriate @CAPS3, it could contract a virus, costing a person a few hundred dollars to repair. Anything could happen to your computer at any time; out of nowhere, it could simply malfunction, and all of your data will be lost forever. Now that I have presented my viewpoints on computers, I hope people will think differently. Would you want to end up like one of those individuals in a camp because they are overly reliant on computers? Or, you never know, you could be in serious trouble and never be found. I already know how much it costs to repair computers, but you might have to learn this the hard way. That is why I believe that computers only cause more problems for people.
590	592	1	1	Do you genuinely believe that computers do not contribute to society? Well, they indeed do. Computers facilitate re - connection with people. They offer a fabulous search engine and the ability to watch videos. Computers are becoming an integral part of human lifestyles. Computers help you re - connect with people. My mother uses Facebook and has found friends she hasn't seen since the early @NUM1's! It is an excellent tool for communicating with your friends in your daily life. Additionally, you can use your webcam for video chatting to actually see them. Therefore, computers benefit society. Computers also feature the best search engines. Are you conducting research for a paper on @LOCATION1? Google and @LOCATION2 are all you require. Essentially, they provide you with all the materials necessary for an A - grade paper. If your newspaper hasn't arrived yet, the internet has the news and more! The only place where you can obtain millions of songs for free for your iPod or phone is on the computer, one of the greatest electronics ever invented. The remarkable computers also allow you to watch videos on the internet. Do you want to have a really good laugh? Well, YouTube is the place to go. You can learn about history, today's lifestyle, and more. If you wish, you can also upload videos yourself! It is a great site, and great computers contribute to society. After presenting my essay, I can sincerely state that computers benefit society. Computers help re - connect with people, have a fabulous search engine, and enable video - watching. Computers are evolving daily, providing users with maximum satisfaction. They truly do help.
591	593	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I contend that computers exert a detrimental influence on our lives. Generally, novel technological advancements negatively impact our lives. They can contribute to obesity, transform individuals into sedentary couch - potatoes, and erode one's social life. It's not that computers lack utility; rather, people utilize them excessively. As a nation, @LOCATION1 experiences an increase in the number of obese individuals each decade. A viable approach to reducing the obese population is to encourage them to leave their computer chairs. @CAPS5, if all you do is sit on a chair, engage in flash games, and watch YouTube videos throughout the day, you are certain to gain weight, and those pounds will accumulate. Similar to fast - food companies like @ORGANIZATION1, computers also contribute to obesity. When someone consumes a Big Mac burger, should they proceed upstairs to play a flash game or head to the gym for a workout? Trust me, clicking a mouse will not burn any calories. Individuals who frequently use computers seldom appreciate the true beauty of nature. They are too engrossed in shooting animated rabbits to observe real ones. Would you prefer to take a stroll in the park or stare at a computer screen for @DATE1 and a half hours? The world is a magnificent place, and the more you @CAPS2 @CAPS3, the less you recognize its splendor. Using the computer can even affect your social life. The more you interact with unfamiliar people online, the less proficient you become at communicating with real individuals. I know I would desire a real girlfriend, not a virtual one. You @MONTH1 become so absorbed in a @CAPS4.V. show on the computer that you neglect to spend time with loved ones. Your family is far more significant than a trivial computer game. In conclusion, I opine that computers should be used less frequently. Who wouldn't want to be a fit, nature - loving, popular individual? If people spent a bit less time on the computer and more time in the real world, they could be such a person. (@CAPS6 I'm certain the @CAPS1 is an adult.)
592	594	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I opine that excessive time spent on a computer is deleterious. One of the reasons pertains to exercise. Individuals ought to be outdoors, jogging, working out, and relishing nature. Moreover, they should engage in social interaction with friends. My second reason is spending quality time with family. Being in the company of family is crucial as they are a source of enjoyment and are excellent companions for socializing, whether at home or elsewhere. At times, socializing with people online is not as fulfilling as interacting with real - life individuals because conversing with friends and family is more straightforward than sitting on a chair, typing numerous words to explain an ongoing conversation. Lastly, my final reason is the importance of being active. People should lead an active lifestyle as it is enjoyable, allows for social interaction, and enables participation in sports. It promotes good health and can strengthen the lungs and heart. For instance, football enhances leg strength and builds muscle, while basketball improves agility and keeps one constantly on the move. An active lifestyle is beneficial as it bestows a healthier, stronger, and well - toned physique. Therefore, I firmly believe that excessive computer use is detrimental.
593	595	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, it @MONTH1 be true that computers @MONTH1 lead to reduced physical activity, diminished appreciation of nature, and less time spent with family and friends. However, computers offer numerous benefits to society. They assist students with homework and projects and facilitate communication among individuals. Despite the existence of the telephone, computers do have certain drawbacks. Students rely on computers to complete homework and class projects. They aid students in creating effective presentations and enable them to conduct research via the internet. The use of computers can elevate a student's grades and contribute to a more prosperous future. Parents and children can communicate with long - distance friends and relatives, as well as with co - workers, bosses, their children's teachers, and their own parents. Computers enhance communication among people and help maintain connections with family members. Nevertheless, aside from these advantages, computers also possess negative attributes. They can expose children to inappropriate websites and may even be infected with viruses that crash the system. Most anti - virus programs prevent both children and adults from accessing inappropriate sites, such as those related to gambling and pornography. We require computers pre - installed with the most advanced virus protection systems, which safeguard children, teenagers, and adults from viruses, inappropriate content, and cyber - bullies. With these features, a computer would be nearly perfect. The ideal computers should support student learning, foster increased communication among people, and be pre - loaded with programs to protect against viruses, malicious websites, and cyber - bullies. Computers are indispensable, and without them, our lives would be extremely arduous.
594	596	1	1	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that people need to discern the disparity between the virtual world of computers and the real world. There are numerous individuals spending excessive time on computers and insufficient time with their families or engaging in truly significant activities. While using a computer, one does not engage in physical exercise, fails to build strength, and simply remains seated. This is one of the reasons people gain weight, as they are sedentary rather than active. When one is glued to the computer day in and day out, they miss out on family events and all that is transpiring around them. I think people should moderate their computer usage, engage in physical exercise, or contact their cousins, brothers, or even their mothers to discover what is truly important, as these are the people who matter most. However, it is challenging to dictate how much time people should spend on the computer; one can only offer an opinion and hope for their consideration.
595	597	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Technology is truly an enthralling aspect of life, is it not? Consider a computer, for example. It enables users to access information online, provides the opportunity to learn about distant places and individuals, and facilitates communication. Undoubtedly, this is beneficial to society as it simplifies and expedites people's lives. Do you concur? Have you ever forgotten your homework assignment or the start and end times of an event? Well, you can always retrieve information online, regardless of when you forget. Thus, you can stay on schedule and prepare in advance. For instance, if you need to know the start time of a movie at the theater, you can check online. Additionally, if you forget the steps for a project or homework, you can search for the information online. Whenever a student forgets something, they can consult the internet instead of going to school the next day and saying, ""@CAPS1 I didn't know what to do"" or ""@CAPS1, I forgot how to do it."" Have you ever desired to travel to a place but knew nothing about it, its cost, or wished to learn about a famous person, such as @PERSON1? Instead of visiting the library and perusing numerous books, you can simply go online. There are countless websites dedicated to places and people, making it far easier to learn about a particular place, person, or thing. The computer is indeed a valuable and helpful tool. Moreover, you can plan a vacation to a destination and ensure you have sufficient funds by checking prices online, eliminating the worry of running out of money upon arrival. Have you ever wanted to communicate with your friends throughout the day without expending excessive minutes? In fact, you can interact with multiple friends on the computer. For example, chat rooms can accommodate hundreds of people. Therefore, it is less cumbersome to communicate with all your friends simultaneously on the computer than on the phone. Additionally, you can communicate with people worldwide, including family members and relatives, regardless of their location on the other side of the @LOCATION1. Moreover, if you haven't seen or spoken to them for a while, you can engage in webcam or video chat. Maintaining contact with important people and friends is highly advantageous. The positive impacts of computers on people are truly something for which one should be grateful. You can access information about anything, regardless of when you forget. You have the ability to effortlessly learn about people and places and can communicate with your family and friends."
596	598	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, have you ever yearned to venture outdoors and engage in a game of football with your beloved ones? Well, I know I do, @CAPS2. I am convinced that nearly @PERCENT1 of children are glued to their computers @NUM1 either because they have nothing constructive to do or because it is addictive. The rationale behind my firm belief in this statement is that people are concerned about the excessive time individuals spend on computers rather than with their families. One crucial aspect of children's computer usage is its potential danger. Nowadays, children fail to recognize the perils of being online. For instance, I recall a time when my cousin mentioned that he went to the movies to meet a girl he had encountered on MySpace. However, all he saw was a baldheaded sex offender who claimed to be the one he had been chatting with online. The offender invited my cousin to his house to play Xbox, but my cousin vehemently refused and fled to my house as the movie theater was closer. Clearly, safety is of utmost importance. Would you prefer your children to be safe by your side or in the company of a stranger? Computers can also be beneficial when necessary for schoolwork or one's job. Nevertheless, some individuals find it amusing to stay at home and use the computer without any specific purpose. Secondly, don't you wish to spend quality time with your children before they embark on their college journey or pursue other endeavors? Even the simplest activity, such as playing a game of football, can significantly strengthen your bond with your child. One effective strategy to encourage them to go outside with you is to restrict their computer access for a week and engage in enjoyable activities together, such as playing their favorite sports. Thus, by neglecting the computer and investing time in building a relationship with your child, you can create a more fulfilling and meaningful connection. The time has come to decide: will you allow your child to remain idle in front of the computer or seize the opportunity to have fun with them?
597	599	1	1	"There has been an ongoing debate regarding whether computers are beneficial or detrimental to society. Personally, I concur with the assertion that computers offer significant advantages to society. I believe that computers enhance hand - eye coordination. When one can type rapidly and accurately, it indicates that their hand - eye coordination is well - developed. I remember as a child, I would watch my grandmother type approximately seventy - five words per minute. Through years of practice, she became highly proficient with computers, and her hand - eye coordination improved remarkably. My own hand - eye coordination has also improved substantially as I have been typing for an extended period. Scientists assert that @PERCENT2 of individuals who type for at least four years develop better hand - eye coordination. Typing quickly keeps fingers nimble and dexterous. I once read a book on computers where an expert stated, ""The invention of the computer keyboard may well be the greatest practice for hand - eye coordination ever."" Another notable advantage of computers is that they enable us to explore distant places without physically traveling there. In school, students can undertake projects on foreign countries without leaving their classrooms, simply by using a computer. I once completed a class project on @LOCATION1 and achieved a @PERCENT1 grade solely by utilizing a computer. People can also look up information about countries for personal interest. My mother, for instance, wanted to learn about @LOCATION2 and accessed relevant information on the internet via her computer. Additionally, computers facilitate school research. My older sister explored colleges online without visiting the actual campuses in the respective states. Finally, computers allow us to communicate with others online. There is email, which enables us to correspond with people over the internet. I recall when my baseball coach informed my parents that I had made the team via email as it was the most convenient method. There is also instant messaging, which allows for immediate two - way communication. I used to engage in instant messaging daily to chat with my friends. Moreover, video chatting enables face - to - face communication even when physically apart. I read a news article where an expert said, ""Video chatting is the most effective way to communicate with someone without being in their immediate presence."" These reasons clearly demonstrate that computers are highly beneficial to our society."
598	600	1	1	Dear Readers of the Newspaper, I believe that computers are advantageous in certain respects, such as enabling us to access information about the far - flung corners of the world. For example, when tasked with writing a paper about a region on the other side of the globe, a computer provides up - to - date information, unlike a book. Thus, computers have a positive impact on schoolchildren and the workplace. However, many individuals spend the entire day communicating with others on computers and neglect to go outside and breathe fresh air. Consequently, computers can have negative effects on some people while offering benefits to others. They are indispensable for work and various tasks. Nevertheless, I think that a significant number of people overuse computers for socializing and gaming. On the other hand, some individuals use computers sparingly and only when necessary for work, and they also make time to go outside. The problem with computer usage is that too many people spend excessive amounts of time sitting in front of the screen, chatting with others, and as a result, they become sedentary and gain weight due to lack of physical activity. Instead, they could go outside, sit on a swing, and text while enjoying the fresh air. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to use them in moderation and balance screen time with outdoor activities.
599	601	1	1	Technology is progressing at an unprecedented pace. One of the most prominent technological devices in contemporary society is the computer. An increasing number of individuals are incorporating computers into their daily lives; however, not everyone concurs that computers are beneficial to society. I firmly believe that they are indeed advantageous. Firstly, computers allow us to explore a vast array of information from the comfort of our homes. Prior to the advent of computers, one had to visit a library, locate the required book, and then painstakingly search through its pages to find the desired information. This process could be extremely time - consuming, particularly if one did not reside in close proximity to a library. Conversely, with computers, one can simply enter a query into a search engine and obtain the relevant information promptly. This not only saves time but also conserves fuel as there is no need to drive to a library. Secondly, computers facilitate free online communication. Without a computer, one would have to either travel to meet someone in person, engage in a phone call, or send text messages, all of which incur costs. On the computer, there are various communication platforms such as email, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. These platforms offer diverse means of interaction. Whether one wishes to view pictures, take quizzes, play games, or engage in conversation, @CAPS2 provides the opportunity. In the case of email, one can send letters, videos, or simply communicate with others by typing, similar to other platforms. In conclusion, the benefits of computers in terms of information access and communication are undeniable, making them a valuable asset to society.
600	602	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, you @MONTH1 are aware that computers are not only incredibly useful machines but also play a multifaceted role in our lives. Computers offer online education to a large number of people. On the computer, one can attain any educational goal. In fact, my cousin @PERSON2 obtained his accounting degree through an online college program. @PERSON2 now holds a well - paying job in the accounting field. Without computers, many individuals would not have achieved their current life positions. Just @DATE1, I was assigned to write a history paper on @LOCATION2. All I needed to do was conduct approximately an hour of research on @LOCATION2's culture and history, and I received an excellent grade on my paper. Computers are highly effective in assisting people with their educational pursuits. This leads me to my next point: computers foster creativity and improve hand - eye coordination. The computer presents @CAPS3 different and sophisticated features. The computer integration @PERSON1 is a complex system that not only allows one to express creativity in unique ways but also enhances hand - eye coordination. Many people are drawn to the computer for its ability to stimulate creativity, and they reap the benefits of using it. @DATE1, research has shown that @PERCENT1 of people consider the computer to be an important means of communication without direct physical contact. The computer is not just a simple tool; it boosts creativity, improves hand - eye coordination, and serves as a primary mode of communication. So, to the editors, writers, and readers in @LOCATION1 @CAPS6, computers are truly helpful machines. Those who overlook their potential are missing out on a wealth of opportunities.
601	603	1	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are sophisticated technological apparatuses that enable us to establish connections with friends and family residing in distant locales such as France or @LOCATION2. They also facilitate the exploration of novel information, perhaps for an academic project, and even offer engaging gaming experiences. Computers have revolutionized our lives; however, their impact on humanity is deplorable. We have overextended the use of these simple devices and failed to exercise moderation. Did you know that a minimum of an hour of physical activity is required daily? Regrettably, @CAPS3 across the globe are not obtaining sufficient exercise due to @MONEY1 computers. Parents' hard - earned income is being squandered on these exorbitantly priced computers, with costs ranging from @NUM1! What a waste of @MONEY1 money! @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 kidnappings occur because of excessive information available on the internet. Do you desire such a fate for your child? Computers, once beneficial tools, have now transformed into @CAPS4 distorting mechanisms. @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 of the world's @CAPS3 are currently obese. Why are they obese, you may inquire? @CAPS3 are in a phase of rapid growth and are naturally inclined to be active and playful. Without engaging in physical activities like dancing or basketball, they are prone to weight gain. Children spend up to @NUM2 hours a day on a @CAPS2, neglecting physical activity. @CAPS2 exert a magnetic pull on children. This compulsive @CAPS2 usage leaves no time for maintaining a healthy, active, and fit lifestyle. I recall an instance when one of my friends, @PERSON1, acquired a new computer. She ceased to join us for basketball and remained indoors. Eventually, she became obese and developed diabetes. Parents, is this the outcome you wish for your @CAPS3? Do you want to invest in a device that renders your @CAPS3 extremely unwell? Times are challenging, finances are tight, and electronics are costly. A @CAPS2 can cost anywhere from @MONEY4 to even @MONEY3, which is a substantial sum of @MONEY1 money. Parents work long hours; for example, @NUM3 is a lengthy workday, and they may not earn enough to squander on a @CAPS2. An average household spends @MONEY2 on computers over a lifetime. Do you genuinely want to purchase a @CAPS2 for your @CAPS3, a machine that costs an outrageous amount of @MONEY1 money and will only compromise their health and divert them from sports? I remember when my mother bought me a new @CAPS2 for @NUM4 dollars, and it malfunctioned the next day. What a waste of @MONEY1 money. Assist your @CAPS3; refrain from buying a @NUM2,000 - dollar @CAPS2. Keep your @CAPS3 active and healthy. Ensure your finances remain intact. Hey, a small window appears on your screen. ""Who are you?"" you respond in a voice. ""@CAPS7, your friend @CAPS8's friend,"" says the little window. You reply with a @CAPS7 greeting. ""Hey, do you want to come over? It's the coolest thing,"" it says. ""@CAPS9, okay,"" you respond. What is amiss with this scenario? Well, numerous issues exist, and this occurs to @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 online chatters. Just remember that online, you can assume any identity; you could be only ten but claim to be @NUM6. So many @CAPS3 are kidnapped due to online chatting. You can counsel your @CAPS3 as much as you like, but it does not guarantee their safety. The less time your child spends on the @CAPS2, the lower the risk of kidnapping. The @CAPS2 is extremely dangerous. Would you ever expose your child to such peril? Computers were once repositories of helpful information, a source of enjoyment, and a means to communicate with aunts, uncles, and friends like @PERSON2. Now, these computers have evolved into persuasive boxes filled with harmful side - effects. Do you want your child to feel the wind in their hair, the thumping of their heart, and the scent of grass, or do you prefer them to experience the glare of a bright screen and the thrill of merely beating level @NUM7? Do you want to spend @MONEY1 on unhealthy contraptions? And lastly, do you want your @CAPS3 to be endangered simply by using a @CAPS2 at home? Computers are @CAPS4 metamorphosing devices that deprive @CAPS3 of the joys of life. Do you want this for them?"
602	604	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION2, there are numerous reasons why computer technology benefits society. Firstly, newspaper companies utilize computers to compose the @ORGANIZATION2 paper. Personally, I am of the opinion that computers offer significant advantages to society for multiple reasons. They aid in education, career development, and facilitate family connections. By perusing this letter, I hope to render computers more appealing to you. One reason individuals benefit from computers is their role in education. In a poll conducted at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the students reported that computers assist them in their academic pursuits. Additionally, many adults also employ computers for educational purposes. In the student body of the class of '@NUM1 at @CAPS2 high school, a majority of the students dropped out before completing their senior year. @PERCENT2 of those students completed their high school and college education through online courses. Another way computers benefit society is by supporting careers. At @CAPS3 industries, @PERSON1, the @CAPS4, stated, ""I am uncertain where our business would stand if we did not utilize computers."" According to a poll conducted by @CAPS4s of many high - ranking industries, @PERCENT3 indicated that their business operations revolve around the internet. This could very well be the poll your @CAPS4 conducted. Finally, computers enable separated families to reconnect. A marine mentioned that he endeavors to contact his family as frequently as possible while at sea. If anyone deserves to communicate with their family after a two - year separation, it is undoubtedly the members of the military. In conclusion, computer technology has benefited numerous individuals. A system to regulate people's computer usage could be implemented, but it would not satisfy anyone. Changes could be made, but if someone attempted to take away something of great importance, would you not take action to prevent it?"
603	605	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that if you restrict your use of the @CAPS5 to a maximum of @NUM1 minutes per day, it will afford you ample time to engage in outdoor activities and exercise. Moderate use of the @CAPS5 is acceptable; however, excessive and continuous usage can be detrimental to your health. Unless it is your occupation, you should limit your @CAPS5 usage to @NUM1 minutes to an hour per day. Some individuals spend so much time on the @CAPS5 that their eyesight deteriorates progressively. Not only does it impact your physical well - being, but it can also cause various eye problems such as bloodshot eyes, pink eye, or even @CAPS4. This is a grave issue. Those who exhibit such behavior are referred to as @CAPS5 addicts. According to @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10, over @PERCENT1 of people claim to know or be someone who is addicted to the @CAPS5, and scientists predict that this number will double or even triple in the coming year. I understand that people need to use the @CAPS5 for tasks such as sending emails, working on projects, generating ideas, or creating models. However, does anyone still read books these days?
604	606	1	1	Dear newspaper, in my view, I believe that both children and adults allocate an excessive amount of time to their computers. While I recognize the benefits in certain aspects, it detracts from their well - being, outdoor activities, and exercise. Moreover, it can have long - term effects on their eyesight. People access @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS1 search engines, and more than half of the results on those sites are spurious. As more people use computers, the likelihood of being caught plagiarizing increases, which is a significant concern in the community. These are some of the issues, and I have additional details to support these ideas. People require fresh air, physical exercise, and the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors. All these can be achieved by simply stepping away from the computer. Instead of researching places online, visit them in person. You will not only gain fresh air and exercise but also valuable experiences. After having such experiences, you can share the genuine details with others, rather than the false information found online. For example, you can search for @CAPS2 online and only find pictures of food. But if you visit the place, you can truly savor the cuisine. Would you prefer to sit in a chair, staring at a computer screen, or have fun exploring new places outdoors? Plagiarism will not lead to learning or personal growth, and you may face consequences. However, if you think independently and draw on your own experiences, you will acquire knowledge and skills. This is also because children are often too lethargic to engage in activities outside due to their excessive computer use. I do acknowledge that using computers can provide skills that outdoor activities may not offer. For instance, they enhance hand - eye coordination, which is essential for typing long papers in college and can contribute to success in life. It's a chain reaction: frequent computer use improves hand - eye coordination, which in turn leads to better academic performance and future success. Another advantage of computers is their contribution to the economy, as more people are purchasing them. Nevertheless, my stance on limiting computer use remains firm. Whether you own a computer or not, if you don't, I advise against getting one. Instead, get active, exercise, and visit those tropical islands you've always dreamed of.
605	607	1	1	Dear newspaper, I perused an article in the newspaper discussing how computer usage can be both beneficial and a bad habit. In fact, I consider it a positive aspect for people to use computers, and I have several reasons to support this view. Whenever a student needs information on a particular topic, they can turn to the internet for assistance. Online research is valuable as there are numerous websites that can provide the required data. Entering topics into search engines helps in retrieving relevant information. When a teacher requires an assignment to be typed, the computer allows for quick and efficient completion, with the work ready the next day. Additionally, one can find interesting pictures related to the subject of study. Sometimes, the internet offers more comprehensive information than a specific book. However, it is advisable not to conduct searches late into the night, as it may result in a high electricity bill. It is also prudent to verify the information, as it may be inaccurate. The use of the internet is not limited to work. People use computers for online shopping, checking movie times, and communicating with friends. Online communication with friends is beneficial because they may not have the freedom to express themselves fully at school, and they may not see each other on weekends. Teenagers often use the internet to chat with their best friends. If one of the friends in a group lives in the same town, they can use their laptops to communicate anywhere. Through these conversations, they may discover common interests and upcoming events in their local area. Therefore, using the computer to talk with friends is not a negative activity. Young students can learn to type, which is advantageous for the future. It is useful for typing school assignments, job applications, or college admissions forms. Learning to type helps students familiarize themselves with the keyboard layout, reducing the need to look at the keys. Eventually, they can type a significant number of words in a short period. This skill can also aid in reading and understanding complex words. In conclusion, I believe that computers do not have an overly negative impact on people. As long as their usage is limited to less than two hours a day, it is acceptable. Overall, the advantages of using computers outweigh the disadvantages.
606	608	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 Times, a segment of the population contends that computers are advantageous for society; however, I hold a contrary view. The risks associated with computers far outweigh the benefits. Take my father as an illustrative example. He has never powered on a computer throughout his life, yet his business thrives. Both he and his father maintain all their records in a secure safe. One of my father's acquaintances stored everything on his computer. When a virus struck, all his files and records vanished. My father opts to hand - write all his documents. He asserts that if typing is necessary, he will purchase a typewriter.  Moreover, on platforms like Facebook, individuals can monitor others' activities. This creates an environment where many impersonate others, leading to the abduction or even death of unsuspecting victims. A significant concern is that when people store copious personal information on their computers, a virus can expose all that data. For instance, I witnessed a documentary on the Discovery Channel where a man hacked into a MySpace account and attempted to create a cyber threat to the Pentagon using the account holder's identity. The perpetrator nearly got caught but evaded capture.  As such, it is evident why my family dislikes computers. We are constantly engaged in farm work, leaving no time for internet use. The only justifiable reason for using a computer, in our view, is for schoolwork. The traditional, computer - free way of life seems to carry fewer problems.
607	609	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I present three reasons regarding the effects of computers on people. Firstly, computers are detrimental to one's eyesight. Secondly, there are reasons why individuals frequently use computers. Thirdly, there exist numerous games and online platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and more. Continue reading to learn about these three reasons.  To begin with, computers are harmful to the eyes. While they share some similarities with @CAPS3, computers contain significantly more information. Prolonged computer use can lead to vision impairment. Even an hour or more of computer use can increase the risk of blindness. Some individuals wrongly believe that wearing glasses will prevent further vision deterioration, but this is a fallacy; they will indeed experience more severe vision loss.  The second reason for excessive computer use is that people access computers to pay bills or file taxes. However, this exposes them to a vast amount of information that can be accessed by individuals in other regions without their knowledge. Additionally, people use computers to make purchases or book tickets for vacations or business trips. They also visit websites in the hope of enhancing their lives, such as meeting someone special.  The third reason is the abundance of activities on computers. MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter are among the most popular platforms where people meet new acquaintances and reconnect with old friends.  In conclusion, individuals should limit their computer use due to concerns about health, privacy, and the potential to encounter strangers.
608	610	1	1	In our society, computers play a significant role. Some individuals believe that they enhance society and benefit the citizens of @CAPS1, while others argue that computers are detrimental. I am of the opinion that computers can elevate our society to the next level and offer numerous advantages to people.  Computers can benefit individuals physically by improving hand - eye coordination. An opposing argument claims that computers replace exercise. However, for many @CAPS2, sports are a form of exercise, and hand - eye coordination is crucial in sports. Computers do not replace exercise; instead, they enhance an individual's ability to perform in sports. For example, a goalkeeper can save more goals by improving their hand - eye coordination through computer - based training. Good hand - eye coordination can also be life - saving. In a dangerous situation, such as when a knife is thrown, an individual with good hand - eye coordination can react more effectively to avoid injury.  Mentally, computers can take you around the world without leaving your room. They can educate you about different cultures and ways of life that you may not have known existed. In @CAPS1, where not everyone can afford to travel the world, computers allow people to view the world from various perspectives. A student who cannot visit a particular country can use the internet to take a virtual tour.  Computers have also revolutionized communication. They have made it easy for people to connect with family, friends, and colleagues. Video chat enables face - to - face communication, which is beneficial in business as it allows for pointing out graphs and charts. It also helps people stay in touch with loved ones they miss. There are multiple forms of communication available, such as email, @CAPS4, and instant messaging.  In summary, computers have elevated our society to a new level. They enable people to explore the world, communicate easily, and improve physical and mental capabilities. As computers continue to evolve in @LOCATION2, they keep us at the forefront. The question is, what would you choose?
609	611	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I opine that computers exert a positive influence on our lives. Several factors support this view. They are invaluable for research, offer engaging games and activities, and facilitate staying in touch with distant relatives.  When assigned a school or work task, a computer serves as an outstanding source of knowledge. Whether you need to type an assignment or research a topic, or even check your bills (@CAPS1), computers prove their worth. Moreover, computers are a source of entertainment. On a rainy day when you're at home feeling bored, you can access a plethora of games and activities that the whole family can enjoy.  Lastly, computers are excellent tools for maintaining contact with long - distance family members. All you need is a webcam connected to your computer, and you can have face - to - face conversations with grandparents, cousins, uncles, or anyone else, just as if you were on the phone, but at no cost.  In conclusion, as demonstrated, computers are beneficial for research, entertainment, and family communication. In my household (@CAPS2), the computer is primarily used for video - chatting with my grandma in @LOCATION1. I hope this letter will alter your perception of this remarkable invention, the computer.
610	612	1	1	Dear, Newspaper @CAPS1, my name is @CAPS2, @PERSON1, and I believe that the concept regarding the necessity of computers for people is a valid assertion (@CAPS3). In my @CAPS4 opinion, some claim that people use computers so extensively that they neglect exercise. However, this is untrue because computers offer programs for weight management, stock monitoring, and more. Technology also facilitates global communication through websites and programs such as video - chat platforms and @CAPS5.com for instant messaging.  Regarding teenagers, computers are useful for video - chatting, emailing resumes for job applications, and presenting details about recent jobs. Additionally, computer technology aids @CAPS6 in saving resources. The primary reasons for the need for technological equipment are evident in various fields, including the navy, @CAPS6, and the global shipping industry.  Businesses require technology to order stocks for store carriers and other purposes. In the field of @CAPS6, technology is utilized for @CAPS7 - related matters, pregnancy monitoring, pulse radar, etc.  Some readers may hold a negative view, arguing that people become addicted to technology. However, the reality is that people genuinely need technology. Look around; most things in the world are products of technology. The consensus should be that computers assist people in speaking, @CAPS9, emailing, enhancing their lives, finding family and friends, and providing directions.  In my view, @CAPS9 should inform the dean (@CAPS1) and readers that interacting with technology is an effective way to control one's actions on the computer. I create interesting and audio - enabled websites, demonstrating how technology can help people find and create opportunities for making money and achieving positive outcomes. Nowadays, everyone uses technological equipment. Those who have read this article should share it with those who view technology negatively to help them develop a positive perspective.
611	613	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I am penning this missive to convey my concurrence with the statements presented in the writing prompt. Initially, I shall expound upon the excessive computer usage among individuals. Subsequently, I will discuss those who engage in online conversations to an inordinate degree. Finally, I will address the issue of spending an overabundance of time on computers. To commence, there are people who utilize computers excessively. Firstly, individuals are inclined to visit platforms such as MySpace. Secondly, they enjoy playing online games. Lastly, some individuals prefer to socialize with others online. For instance, when you visit someone's residence, you will invariably encounter a young child or an adult engrossed in online activities or playing online games. Moreover, people engage in online conversations far too frequently. Firstly, they are constantly on Facebook. Secondly, they visit MySpace, where there is a risk of identity theft. Lastly, children are particularly fond of MySpace, which is similar to the aforementioned platform. For example, someone might approach you and inquire if you have a certain account and request your email address. Undoubtedly, spending an excessive amount of time on computers is detrimental. Firstly, children may encounter problems online, and these issues could exacerbate if not addressed. Secondly, they might engage in arguments with friends. Lastly, they may become inactive and instead spend their time playing or visiting other online websites. So, @CAPS1, have you begun to concur with the notion that people should be more active outdoors and enjoy themselves? In conclusion, this is the rationale behind my agreement regarding the importance of being active, as spending the entire day on the computer can be arduous and challenging to sustain for @NUM1.
612	614	1	1	Computers ought to be accessible to all! Do you not concur? I certainly do. Allow me, @CAPS1, to persuade you of this. Computers can essentially be regarded as a portal to learning. The positive impacts that computers have on individuals include the development of hand - eye coordination, the opportunity to acquire knowledge about distant places, and the ability to engage in online conversations with others. These remarkable attributes of computers are truly outstanding. Additionally, computers continue to evolve and improve over time. By reading this introduction, I trust that you are satisfied with what I am about to present to demonstrate that computers are positive devices and can be beneficial to everyone. Firstly, as I mentioned in the introductory paragraph, computers assist in teaching hand - eye coordination. I firmly believe that this is a valuable skill, as without it, there are numerous tasks that one would be unable to perform. For example, piloting an aircraft requires both hand and eye coordination, as one must manually operate the controls while simultaneously ensuring that everything is in order through multitasking. Furthermore, this is just one of the reasons why computers are advantageous to everyone. Secondly, computers enable individuals to gain knowledge about distant places and people. This is also beneficial for individuals, as it is replete with knowledge. One can learn about other cultures, heritages, family histories, and so on. This knowledge can also prove useful in the long run for any career path one may choose, as knowledge can open doors and lead to success. I believe that computers can facilitate this learning process. This is yet another reason why computers can have a positive impact. Lastly, individuals can engage in online conversations with others on the computer. This is also advantageous, as, similar to what I stated in my @NUM1 paragraph, one can learn a great deal and meet new people in this manner. Now, do you not think that computers can benefit anyone? I do, and I will always maintain a positive view of computers. In conclusion, I hope that you have enjoyed every aspect of what I have shared and that you can also recognize the positive effects that computers have on people. I genuinely believe that computers are beneficial to all individuals and should continue to be a part of our lives. They contribute to society, and I thoroughly enjoy using them. Thank you.
613	615	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, it is a common belief that contemporary technology, such as computers, is rendering an increasing number of individuals indolent and preventing them from engaging with the real world. This is evident in people who fail to spend quality time with their families, become physically unfit, and are exposed to potential harm from @CAPS1 websites and online acquaintances. Firstly, who would not desire to spend time with their family and discover their experiences? @CAPS1 individuals, however, are too preoccupied with their computers to participate in activities such as family camping trips, visits to amusement parks, or family gatherings. While some may perceive computers as useful tools, @PERSON1 once stated that ""@CAPS1 individuals learn more effectively from their family and friends than from a computer."" Secondly, @CAPS1 individuals are becoming @CAPS2 due to their excessive computer usage. Instead of going for a walk or enjoying a pleasant day outdoors, they remain in their rooms, engrossed in virtual experiences rather than engaging with the real world. @CAPS1 individuals who spend excessive time on the computer should consider joining a sports team to maintain an active lifestyle. Lastly, both @CAPS1 @CAPS3 and adults who use the computer are at risk when interacting with individuals they have never met or know little about. When online, someone may claim to live in the same area as you, but they could be lying. Taking them seriously and arranging a meeting could result in serious harm, such as being killed or going missing. Additionally, the computer allows users to post pictures and videos online, and many teenagers and adults are uploading inappropriate images of their bodies, which should not be publicly accessible. I hope that if you or a family member is constantly on the computer, you will recognize the need to spend time with your family, maintain physical fitness, and avoid the potential risks associated with interacting with unknown individuals online."
614	616	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I firmly contend that computers do not confer benefits upon society. My stance is informed by the concerns of certain experts regarding the excessive time individuals are devoting to computers at the expense of engaging in productive activities. The primary reason for my opposition to the widespread use of computers is that the most frequent users are neglecting their families and friends. Secondly, computers are extremely time - consuming. Finally, people are spending an inordinate amount of time on computers and insufficient time exercising. Let us first examine the issue of individuals neglecting their families and friends. Computers are highly addictive, and I can comprehend why some individuals prioritize them over their loved ones. However, I do not believe this is justifiable. I have numerous friends who would rather be on Facebook or MySpace than spend time with me. These websites can cause one to lose touch with reality. My friends will forsake social interactions with others in order to spend the entire day on the computer. These reasons illustrate why I believe computers should be restricted due to the neglect they engender. Now, let us discuss the significant amount of time consumed by computer users. I firmly believe that time is a precious resource that should not be squandered. When I learned that people are spending the entire day on the computer, I was deeply dismayed. Statistics indicate that the average teenager spends @NUM1 hours per day on the internet, while the average adult spends approximately @NUM2 @NUM3 hours per day on the computer. These statistics confirm my belief that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers without achieving anything meaningful. Finally, let us delve deeper into the issue of exercise. I am acutely aware that too much time is being spent on computers, which is resulting in children not getting enough exercise. Exercise is crucial for a child's growth and development, and a lack of it can lead to health problems in the future. Statistics show that approximately @PERCENT1 of children under @NUM4 years of age are obese. These reasons underscore why I believe exercise is more important than spending time on the computer. In conclusion, I hope this letter has effectively conveyed my concerns regarding the negative impacts of excessive computer use.
615	617	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 individuals are leveraging technology. A substantial number of them perceive that it is augmenting and refining their learning capabilities, while others hold a dissenting view. Personally, I opine that computers present both advantages and disadvantages. I posit that they can be advantageous as they offer individuals an opportunity to experience beyond the confines of their conventional learning. Conversely, I consider them a disadvantage because a significant number of people are ensconced in front of computers and consequently engage in minimal physical activity. There are both merits and demerits to computers, although the latter seem to preponderate. How much time do you spend on the computer? @CAPS2 individuals find computers more captivating than venturing outdoors for physical exercise. As technology progresses, an increasing number of people are purchasing computers. A large proportion of teenagers are allocating more and more time to computers, indulging in games and visiting their preferred websites. This is one of the factors contributing to the obesity of children aged @NUM1 and above, as they do not engage in sufficient physical exertion. This also has implications for the time people spend with their friends and family. I am cognizant that many individuals cherish spending time with their loved ones. However, what if one is perpetually engrossed in the computer and never makes time to socialize with friends or family? Your friends may invite you to the park, and you decline. Eventually, your friends will start to distance themselves from you, and you may end up in solitude. Constant computer use can undermine one's life. If one prioritizes the computer over other significant aspects of life, then I believe there is a problem. Excessive computer use can evolve into an addiction. I doubt that people are fully cognizant of this, but it is indeed possible. It can commandeer one's life. I assert this because once an addiction takes hold, it is arduous to break free. While it is feasible to overcome it independently, it is a rarity. In most cases, it is advisable to seek assistance. I earnestly encourage you to take all these considerations into account.
616	618	1	1	Dear @CAPS1: Individuals are expending an excessive amount of time on computers. This applies to both children and adults. Consider this: anything achievable on a computer can also be accomplished without one. Moreover, people ought to allocate more time outdoors, experiencing nature. Additionally, certain adverse elements can be encountered and events can transpire while online. I challenge you to enumerate a single task executable on a computer that cannot be done sans it. You are unable to name even one. Reflect on it; you can conduct research and obtain pictures from books and magazines. Instead of relying on social networking platforms, you can physically meet the person, or if they are distant, you can call or write them a letter. To stay informed about current affairs, you can read the newspaper or watch the news. If you are fond of using computer design programs, attempt to draw a tangible picture instead. Lastly, if you frequently download music, you can simply purchase a CD or, better yet, attend a live concert of the band. Admit it; not everything ostensibly requiring a computer truly mandates its use. Artificial simulations pale in comparison to the real outdoors. On a computer, all you can do is observe, and even that is a mere shadow of the real experience, a fleeting snapshot. Outside, you can feel the gentle breezes, the warm sun, and the cool grass. You can inhale the fresh scent of pine and clean air. You can hear the sounds of all the surrounding creatures. Venturing outside is also beneficial for you. Outside, you engage in exercise and absorb vitamin @CAPS2, while indoors, you become lethargic, overweight, and prone to illness. Can you not perceive the allure of the outdoors? Computers can cause more harm than good. They can expose children to inappropriate images and discuss inappropriate topics. They are even being exploited to sell illegal drugs. Children also often use the internet irresponsibly and engage in actions that can disrupt friendships and land them in trouble. The computer has also rendered it significantly easier for kidnappers to target children. They do so by masquerading as the child's peer and then leveraging the information provided by the child to almost guarantee a kidnapping. This phenomenon is occurring with increasing frequency. The computer is not as advantageous as you might have assumed. Computers do not genuinely confer benefits upon our society. They possess no practical use that is not already fulfilled. They cannot supplant the real outdoors. Lastly, they can be readily misused for malicious or even illegal purposes. As is evident, computers should not be utilized as extensively as the general public currently does.
617	619	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 as a society, we have made remarkable progress in terms of advancements and inventions. One invention that has had a profound impact on the world and continues to astound is the computer. This technological marvel offers numerous benefits and positive effects on individuals, such that the absence of it would leave everyone in a state of shock. For instance, this device enables people to maintain contact through a common social network. Additionally, specially configured computers can cater to individuals' specific requirements. Furthermore, they facilitate the expansion of one's knowledge. Hence, computers have positive effects. Just contemplate the individuals you have emailed or instant - messaged in the past week: your father during his business trip, your aunt and uncle who sent you pictures of their newborn baby, your friends from camp... The list is seemingly endless. Computers like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 offer social networking features such as @CAPS4, i - chat, video chat, and more, allowing you to stay connected with your family and friends. For example, in my life, I utilize my @CAPS5 to engage in video chats with my sister, @PERSON3, who is a freshman at a college in @LOCATION1. It serves as our means of keeping in touch, eliminating the need to go months without seeing her or incurring the expense of plane tickets every weekend to visit her. With the computer, staying connected with people in different towns, states, or even hemispheres is effortless. However, computers also serve as a valuable resource for those with medical needs. In the event that someone is rushed to the hospital in an emergency, computers are employed to monitor that individual. @PERCENT1 of hospitals nationwide assert that computers are indispensable in their facilities. For example, when my grandfather, @PERSON2, was being cared for at the @CAPS6 hospital, computers were used to ensure that his heart rate, oxygen levels, and blood pressure were all within normal ranges. Moreover, if any irregularities were detected, the computer would alert the doctors. Therefore, computers are also of great assistance in the medical field @CAPS1 as well. Lastly, computers can broaden one's knowledge. There are countless websites, all of which can impart diverse knowledge to people. For example, if you are planning a trip to @LOCATION2 and wish to familiarize yourself with their culture before departure, you can simply enter the relevant information into your computer's internet browser, and voila! You are now fully prepared for your vacation thanks to your computer. Additionally, in my academic life, my teachers assign @CAPS1 research papers that necessitate us to gather information on a particular topic. If visiting the library is not an option, how can you obtain the information? The answer is straightforward: access the internet! Internet research is the preferred method among all colleges and universities for conducting research. Recently, my social studies teacher, @PERSON1, assigned a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 project, allowing us to select a topic related to community service and conduct research on it. Every student in my class utilized the computer in some capacity for their project. Thus, computers enable individuals to acquire information efficiently. In conclusion, computers offer a plethora of uses. The primary ones include the ability to communicate with friends and family, provide support in the medical field, and facilitate the expansion of knowledge. Therefore, I believe that computers represent a positive advancement in technology, and their impact on people is highly beneficial.
618	620	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 do you opine that computers have a positive or negative influence on people? In my view, they have a positive influence, and I shall present several reasons for this stance. Firstly, computers are employed for educational purposes across the globe. Secondly, they facilitate our connection with and acquaintance of new friends. Lastly, they can be utilized to access world news. As can be discerned, these are merely a few of the reasons. Firstly, computers are utilized for education worldwide. For example, some individuals leverage them to pursue online college courses. Others use them to gather information about places such as Egypt, which may be inaccessible in person. Secondly, computers assist us in establishing connections with and meeting new friends. We can engage in conversations with our friends, which is extremely useful. If we need to inquire about a homework assignment, we can simply chat with a friend. Lastly, computers can be used to stay informed about world news. We can access information regarding significant events, such as the earthquake in Haiti. As is evident, these are just a few reasons why I believe that computers have a positive impact on us. I sincerely hope that you concur with my perspective.
619	621	1	1	Dear, @PERSON1 I firmly believe that computers are advantageous for individuals. They aid them in discerning their direction, much like a guiding light. Moreover, in the context of '@CAPS1', a computer can serve as a valuable tool. When seeking employment, having computer experience can significantly enhance your chances of securing a well - paying job. As one matures, I understand the importance of having a solid foundation in life. I aspire to lead a normal life, although the concept of 'normal' is subjective. Additionally, computers are useful for evaluating various options. They can provide ratings, such as a @NUM1 - star rating, which can help you determine whether a place or service is worth considering. You would naturally prefer a more favorable option, just as one would avoid a fire. This is precisely why computers are so much more beneficial. A computer can offer valuable insights. For instance, if you are using your fingers to interact with it, it can provide useful information. Many people, including my teachers, use computers regularly. My teachers input data into computers and assign names to various files. The computer that my teachers use is a prime example of the utility of this technology. This is my perspective on why computers are beneficial for people.
620	622	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, do you not concur that nature is preferable to spending an inordinate amount of time on the computer? Generally speaking, I am of the opinion that it is, and I shall present three compelling reasons to support this view. Firstly, it pertains to the obesity rate in @LOCATION1. Secondly, you can allocate more quality time with your family. Finally, you can relish the offerings of nature. I believe that embracing the great outdoors is the optimal choice because @LOCATION1 residents need to engage in physical activity rather than squandering time on the computer. Additionally, the obesity rate is rising alarmingly. In @DATE1, @PERCENT1 of the population is obese or overweight. In @DATE2, last year, the figure was @PERCENT2. Astonishingly, the rate has increased by approximately @PERCENT3 each year. This information was sourced from www.tomatotalks.org. Another aspect worthy of consideration is that spending more time with family or friends is highly beneficial. All statistical data indicates that spending time with your family, particularly at the dinner table, is an excellent opportunity to discuss your child's academic challenges and learn from your parents' experiences. It also provides a chance to share moments of joy. Ultimately, it is crucial to contemplate what actions can be taken for the future. Last but not least, you can immerse yourself in the beauty of the outdoors and discover some of the most significant creatures, such as insects, reptiles, and mammals. These creatures are integral to our understanding of life. Additionally, trees provide us with oxygen. Mother nature offers numerous benefits, especially for those with a career in science. While computers are educational, nature is undoubtedly superior.
621	623	1	1	Those who express concerns regarding the adverse impacts of computers are correct on several points; however, there are indeed positive aspects. For instance, when the military requires recruits for the army, they can post their advertisements on computers, which are visible to everyone. Moreover, individuals who have dropped out of school and seek a second chance can apply for school online. Another reason is that those facing difficulties in finding employment often search for the most suitable jobs on the internet. Read further to understand how the internet benefits society. First, as the military continues to lose soldiers in combat and attempts to recruit new personnel, posting recruitment ads on the internet is a viable option. While mailing out ads is possible, it would take an extended period for people to become aware of them. For example, posting an ad on MySpace can attract thousands of views within minutes. In conclusion, the internet serves as an excellent means for the military to recruit soldiers.
622	624	1	1	Computers offer numerous advantages. Were we to lose them, our lives would undergo a dramatic transformation. Computers can be utilized for exercise, and the decision regarding usage limits lies with the @CAPS3. Additionally, computers can save lives. They are truly remarkable; without them, the internet would cease to exist. One would be unable to communicate with friends via @CAPS1 or email, and cell - phone prices would skyrocket. In essence, we would regress @NUM1 to @NUM2 years. Moreover, large companies would encounter greater challenges without computers. Regarding exercise, computers can assist us in finding the nearest gyms on the internet and quickly determine healthy food options. One can also obtain a @CAPS2 fit for a computer and access free workout videos. Next, it is the @CAPS3's prerogative. If they observe that a child is spending excessive time on the computer and gaining weight, they can easily impose limits. For example, they can mandate that for every hour spent on the computer, an hour of exercise must be completed. Finally, computers can save lives. Before the advent of computers, medications like Tylenol were used for various ailments such as stuffy noses, headaches, and colds. Now, we can use the computer to determine whether a medication is dangerous and locate the nearest hospital. In conclusion, despite the potential for computers to make us less healthy if used excessively, they can save lives, help with exercise, and support large companies. The @CAPS3 can set limits, so please do not take away our computers.
623	625	1	1	"Is it not reasonable to assert that spending time on the computer consumes a significant portion of one's life? Engaging with the computer can have a detrimental impact. Personally, I believe that abstaining from computer use is beneficial as it allows for more time with family, outdoor activities, and maintaining good health. Undoubtedly, using the computer means less time for exercise. For example, if one spends an hour on the computer, that hour could have been dedicated to outdoor activities to stay fit. Consider the choices: one can either sit on a chair and play on the computer or go for a run and burn a substantial amount of calories. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT1 of individuals who choose the computer over exercise are at risk of health problems, including obesity. Clearly, using the computer is not the healthiest option. Undoubtedly, going for a walk or enjoying nature is preferable. A girl named @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated, ""I cherish the beauty of the outdoors bestowed upon us by God. I wish I had realized this earlier when I was a sedentary individual."" If one merely glances out of the window at the beauty God has created, they would be inclined to venture outside and enjoy it. Everyone desires to live life to the fullest. To achieve this, one must experience life firsthand rather than sitting in front of a computer. Without a doubt, the world is magnificent, and nature is worth exploring. It is well - known that family takes precedence over all else. For example, although one may love the computer, this love should not overshadow the time spent with family. On a @DATE1 night, @PERSON2 was on the computer and ignored her mother's call to dinner. One should not sacrifice time with friends and family as they are of utmost importance. I wholeheartedly believe that family is invaluable, and everyone should allocate more time to family members rather than the computer. It is now or never to decide whether computers benefit society. Without computers, one would have ample free time for friends and family. Most importantly, this time not only benefits oneself but also enriches family relationships. So, what are you waiting for? Step away from the computer and spend quality time with your family."
624	626	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I pose the question: Do computers have an impact on people? If so, is it a positive or negative one? I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence. They serve as a valuable source of knowledge, allowing users to access maps when traveling out of state. Additionally, they facilitate online communication and shopping. I do not believe that adults spend an excessive amount of time on computers at the expense of exercise. Instead, it is often children who spend time on the computer playing games and engaging in other activities. Some individuals utilize computers for educational purposes, such as completing homework, writing papers, or conducting research. Computers are not merely for entertainment; they are excellent tools for learning about people and expanding vocabulary. They can also be used to research restaurants and their prices. On @LOCATION1, one can watch episodes of @CAPS1.V. shows online. In my opinion, computers are superior to books and dictionaries as they offer a wider range of functions. Some individuals recognize the speed and convenience of computers, while others view them as a waste of time. However, computers are beneficial as they enable neat typing and printing of papers, eliminating the problem of messy handwriting. They are also ideal for quick searches when in a hurry. In summary, computers are versatile, useful for various tasks such as reading, writing, web browsing, chatting, and entertainment. They have a positive impact on both people and children.
625	627	1	1	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I concur that exercise is of great significance. I believe that people should engage in more exercise and spend quality time with family and friends. The central issue is whether people should allocate more time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with loved ones, or if the current trend of excessive computer use should continue. My first reason for advocating that people spend more time exercising than on computers is that individuals should be more conscious of their diet and maintain physical fitness. Parents, in particular, should be responsible for observing their children's eating habits and encouraging them to exercise. My second reason is that people should spend more time appreciating nature rather than being glued to the computer. One can never fully experience the wonders of the world while confined to a digital screen. How can one discover new things if they are constantly on the computer? My third reason is that interacting with friends and family is far more rewarding than using the computer. Through such interactions, one can learn new things about others and explore new places. For example, during a vacation, I discovered new aspects of my family and friends by engaging in face - to - face interactions. I realized how interesting, fun, and happy they are. Where is the joy to be found in front of a computer? Please do not waste your life; live it to the fullest. The time to decide is now: should people spend more time on the computer or focus on exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends? In conclusion, people should prioritize these real - life experiences over computer use.
626	628	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, can you fathom where the world would stand without computers? Our daily existence would be monotonous and dreary without modern technology. Computers empower society to engage in diverse activities that would be unfeasible in their absence. They endow us with the capacity to learn from home, establish connections with others, and offer a source of amusement. Owing to these factors, our lives have become effortless and convenient, which is what @CAPS2 individuals endeavor to achieve. The learning ability of an average person has significantly augmented. It has evolved from merely being able to attend school to the @CAPS2 numerous methods of enhancing one's intellect on the computer. Programs like @ORGANIZATION1, which instructs people in language acquisition, are accessible on the computer. These programs are akin to attending school but more readily accessible to the public. To further assist the public, there are avenues to obtain college degrees online. That is how it is. Even if you attend school, a computer @CAPS1 still aids you in excelling in your work. @CAPS2 research resources are available on the computer, and when you access the web, a computer serves as an excellent venue for enjoyment. However, some individuals still contend that computers are not beneficial. They assert that, on the contrary, the computer provides websites to assist with weight loss. They also claim that people are not appreciating nature, despite the @CAPS2 ways to do so on the computer. Lastly, it is stated that you don't... To conclude, computers confer substantial benefits upon us and are advantageous. New technology is a positive development and should continue to expand because, by gaining knowledge, connecting with people, and having fun, a computer facilitates the general public. Please, contemplate what I have said and purchase a computer!
627	629	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, throughout @CAPS2 the ages, technology has been in a constant state of evolution, revolutionizing the way we think. From the rudimentary telephone in the @DATE1's to today's sophisticated touch - screen iPhone. From traveling on horses to riding exceptionally fast sports cars and high - speed trains. The technological advancements have demonstrated that there is no limit, as evidenced by the invention of planes. We have even reached the moon and left our mark! Computers have only become swifter and more advanced. Although an increasing number of people are utilizing one of our greatest technological feats, computers, some believe it does not confer social benefits. I firmly believe that computers are beneficial. Firstly, they possess the ability to store and impart what seems like an infinite amount of information. Secondly, they have shrunk the world through communication. Lastly, they can even locate missing persons. Computers are constantly contributing to society. They adhere to the principles of technology to enhance the quality of life @CAPS3. Firstly, computers are a boon to society as they can store and teach us what appears to be boundless information. Today, when someone wishes to acquire knowledge, the first place they typically turn to is the computer. This is because search engines such as @ORGANIZATION1 have no limitations in providing copious amounts of information on any given topic. This has not only made life @CAPS3 more convenient but has also assisted in test preparation for elementary school students. Computers also offer a plethora of services for the average person. From online banking to creating PowerPoint presentations, computers handle it all! For this reason, even older individuals like @PERSON1 find computers somewhat bewildering. Secondly, computers benefit society by making the world a smaller place through communication. Sixty years ago, it was a challenge to contact a relative overseas. Today, you can effortlessly engage in a video call with a relative in @LOCATION2 from @LOCATION1 in less than ten seconds. Not only can you converse with your grandparents, but you can also witness their smiles. Children can even participate in activities such as @CAPS4. During a crisis, they can still communicate with their worried relatives. Finally, computers benefit society as they have the ability to locate missing persons. In the wake of the record earthquake in @LOCATION3, the cries of mothers searching for their children echoed. Thanks to computers, these families were reunited. On numerous internet sites, @LOCATION3 established person locators. These locators allowed individuals to register their names in case of future disasters. Moreover, they could also locate their family members. All they had to do was... Computers have even enhanced the safety of our society. What more could we ask for? In conclusion, I am firmly convinced that computers are beneficial to society because they contain a vast amount of information and programs, they have proven that the world is a ""small place after all,"" and they have made the world a safer place. It is no wonder that many people are purchasing computers. So, why don't you get one?"
628	630	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, I am penning this letter regarding computers, in the hope that you will publish it. Over @NUM1, the number of people in @LOCATION1 owning a computer has increased, but are they truly beneficial to health? I am of the opinion that computers are not a positive addition. People allocate excessive time to using them, while spending less time exercising, appreciating nature, and most importantly, it is extremely perilous. I believe computers are not beneficial because people do not engage in physical activity as they once did. Some individuals spend @NUM2 out of @NUM3 hours in a day on computers; for others, it consumes their entire lives. People become so engrossed in computers that they lose touch with the external world. Ever since the advent of computers, the incidence of obesity has risen. All people do is chat with others and think, ""They don't need to know what I look like."" They sit at the computer, indulging in excessive eating. This is not a healthy lifestyle. I also believe computers are not good because people spend less time enjoying nature. In the past, when I had free time, I could call a friend and invite them for a walk, and they would readily agree. Now, they say ""@CAPS1, let's get on the computers and take a virtual walk."" This is not equivalent to an actual walk with the wind in your face, the fresh scent of the outdoors, and the sight of animals. Nature is a thing of beauty, and if we do not appreciate it, it will deteriorate into something unappealing. Nature used to be the most serene aspect of life; now, it is overshadowed by the internet. I believe computers are not good because, most significantly, they are dangerous. Young children, like myself, believe they are mature enough to use computers and may encounter rapists, murderers, thieves, and various criminals. Additionally, people exchange hurtful and violent content, and if you spend a lot of time on the computer, malicious individuals can track you down. Moreover, the military and @ORGANIZATION1 store sensitive information on computers, but if one is skilled enough, they can hack into it. Computers are not safe for anyone or anything. Well, I have presented my @NUM4 main reasons for believing that computers are not as great as they seem. They are detrimental to both emotional and physical health. People do not exercise, they do not appreciate nature, and computers are highly dangerous. All I can do is hope that you publish my letter so that everyone can consider my perspective and make their own decisions."
629	631	1	1	Dear Newspaper People, I contend that the impact of computers on us is highly positive. You should concur with this view. One reason for your agreement is that computers function as educators. For instance, you can access websites that offer instruction on a wide range of subjects, such as mathematics. Additionally, you can enroll in cyber - schools or take college courses online. Another reason to support my stance is that computers facilitate seamless communication. Through computers, you can send emails and use webcams to interact with others. You can also maintain social media profiles on platforms like Facebook or MySpace to chat and gain insights into people. Lastly, computers serve as a source of entertainment. There is a plethora of free games available on computers. Moreover, you can watch movies and listen to music online. You can even have the pleasure of creating games and other content to share with others. Without computers, we would be unable to engage in these activities. I believe it would be a great loss, and many would agree with me. That is why you should support my view that computers are indispensable.
630	632	1	1	The utilization of computers by people is an excellent means for them to communicate with distant relatives or friends, acquire keyboarding skills, and conduct research on far - flung places. Firstly, the remarkable technology embedded in computers is truly astonishing. They can browse the web in milliseconds. This is advantageous for people because if you were writing a research paper on China, numerous search engines enable you to navigate the web at breakneck speed, and in a short period, you can gather all the necessary information. Scientists assert that @PERCENT1 of computer users have high - speed internet, and they recommend it to first - time buyers. The computer I employ is a distinctive one that can be customized according to my preferences. I enjoy playing games and editing videos, so I installed an outstanding graphics card with exceptional speeds for video rendering. This allows me to play games and edit videos, and my @NUM1 GB hard drive can store all my programs and projects for future use. Engaging in multiple activities on the computer can significantly enhance hand - eye coordination. In fact, approximately @PERCENT2 of computer users claim that after using a computer for a certain period, they can type @PERCENT3 faster than before. That is a remarkable improvement, but the average typist can write as much as I can in @NUM2 minutes. I can type a document of that size in about @NUM3 minutes because I have been typing regularly for @NUM3 other periods. Computers are an integral part of my life, and I still manage to spend time with my family and friends. The final benefit of computers is that they assist us in chatting with friends on websites such as Facebook, MySpace, and @ORGANIZATION1. These platforms allow you to share with all your friends, and if necessary, you can communicate with distant friends or relatives. This is beneficial because if you haven't spoken to your cousin in a while, you can check up on them and have a conversation. I have a cousin who graduated from college and is now teaching in @LOCATION1. When our family gets together, we have web - chats with him on @ORGANIZATION1, which is helpful as we haven't seen him in @NUM5 years, and we were eager to know what he was up to. He was also able to send us pictures, which was great as we all missed seeing his face. So, from the blazing - fast speed of information retrieval to chatting with distant relatives, these are the key factors that demonstrate that you can have fun on computers while still having time for family and friends.
631	633	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, Computers exert a positive influence on the residents of our community. Through computers, one can acquire knowledge, communicate with individuals from other states or even other countries, and develop hand - eye coordination. Computers offer numerous avenues for learning. For instance, students can access the internet to gather information for their school projects. By obtaining such information, they can enhance their academic performance. Additionally, students can utilize computers as a study tool. There are educational games on computers that children play unknowingly while learning and preparing for school. Another learning option is through online classes, which are beneficial for those who lack the financial means to attend traditional classes. As is evident, computers provide multiple learning opportunities. Moreover, computers facilitate communication with people from other states or countries, enabling families separated by distance to stay connected. My cousin and aunt, who reside in @LOCATION1, I hadn't met them until @DATE1 when they visited. Since then, I've been able to maintain contact with them via computer. Dr. @PERSON2 states, ""Maintaining close relationships with family and friends is crucial for one's health."" With computers, we can communicate with relatives, which is beneficial for our well - being. After college, people often lose touch with friends due to geographical separation, but computers can help keep these relationships alive. Lastly, computers aid in improving hand - eye coordination. When typing a word, one is training this skill by accurately hitting the desired keys. I've witnessed children with special needs using computers to develop hand - eye coordination. There's a girl in my school, @PERSON3, who has benefited from computer games. Her helper teacher, Ms @PERSON1, attests to the positive impact of these games. In conclusion, computers have a favorable impact on society."
632	634	1	1	Greetings. Have you considered that excessive computer use may lead to a sedentary lifestyle, causing individuals to neglect physical exercise and the enjoyment of the outdoors? Engaging in conversations and recreational activities with friends and family can be replaced by computer use. However, computers are indispensable for meeting various needs. A single click can assist numerous individuals and even save lives. As technology advances, so do our capabilities. Computers can help individuals search for new job opportunities and enable communication with friends and grandparents. They can also support students with their homework and aid language learners in mastering English. Moreover, computers can be a catalyst for new business ventures, allowing entrepreneurs to showcase products that attract customers, potentially leading to business expansion and job creation. Additionally, computers offer a wealth of culinary resources, enabling users to discover and prepare new recipes with just a mouse click.
633	635	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, Recently, there has been a debate regarding the impact of computers on people's lives. In my view, the negative effects on users' health and well - being are significant. Did you know that over @PERCENT1 of children and teenagers are obese, and @NUM1 computers may contribute to this statistic? A person can maintain fitness despite an unhealthy diet if they engage in physical activity. However, choosing computer use over exercise can lead to weight gain. Obesity is a serious issue associated with various health risks, such as heart disease. It can also impede physical activity. Overweight individuals may experience leg pain, making simple tasks like climbing stairs a daunting challenge. Do you wish to see an increase in obesity rates? I assume not. In the realm of television, we often see idealized family portrayals, but we know that real families are far from perfect. The introduction of computers can exacerbate this situation. For example, my cousin was once an outgoing and sociable person. Now, due to computer use, he has become a @LOCATION1, spending all his time gaming. His daily routine involves getting up, having breakfast, and then playing on the computer until lunch. After a brief lunch, he resumes gaming. After several more hours of play, he takes a short break, then uses his laptop throughout the night. This behavior significantly affects his family. They attempt to get him off the computer, but he remains focused on online activities. His inability to interact with his family has a profound impact. The only way to communicate with him is through Facebook. As a result, his family is in disarray. We can prevent such situations by spreading awareness of these facts. My final point concerns the well - being of users. Many teenagers have Facebook accounts. When I have homework that requires internet research, I'm often tempted to visit Facebook. This can negatively affect our grades. Chatting on Facebook instead of doing homework can lead to poor academic performance. Moreover, computer addiction can be a serious problem. There was a case where a person attempted suicide due to the lack of a computer. As you can see, there are numerous negative effects of computer use, including health problems and family discord. Therefore, it is essential to spread awareness for the well - being of thousands of people.
634	636	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial to society. For instance, countless individuals, corporations, and small businesses rely on computers to operate efficiently. Those who use computers regularly can attest to their utility. In fact, some educational institutions have started to recognize their value. I strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with this widely - recognized and useful technology. Did you know that numerous multi - billion - dollar companies and small businesses depend on the features computers offer? My mother, a former district manager at the fast - food company @ORGANIZATION1, was provided with a laptop for work purposes during her tenure. This example illustrates that businesses require computers to function smoothly. The advent of computer technology has revolutionized education. Some educators, such as my teacher @PERSON1, have incorporated computers into their teaching methods. The popularity of computers has led to the creation of new courses in schools. At my school, a computer education class (abbreviated as ""comp"") has been established to equip students with real - world computer skills. In my opinion, the integration of computers into various aspects of life is a positive development. Millions of people use computers daily, and large corporations like @ORGANIZATION1 are leveraging their benefits. Teachers are also utilizing computers in the classroom. I hope that others can recognize the positive impact of computers as I do."
635	637	1	1	Dear, To whom it may concern, I am writing to discuss the impact of computers on society. While computers have their merits, I believe they also present some drawbacks. People use @CAPS1 messaging on the internet to connect with others, which is a convenient communication method. However, there are concerns. Some individuals may become addicted to the internet, using it to search for people or information. This can lead to the discovery of inappropriate websites, especially for young users. A significant number of children use computers primarily for internet access and often play games that may not be suitable for their age group. One reason for these issues is that when people use computers, they may stumble upon websites commonly used by others. For example, many use sites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @ORGANIZATION1, and popular email services such as @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1L, and @CAPS4.mail. Another reason people use websites is for @CAPS1 messaging. It allows them to connect with friends, family, and even strangers, providing a faster means of communication for those who are geographically separated. Additionally, it can be used for research. If you know someone but can't find them, you can search online. However, there is a risk of addiction. Some people visit the same website repeatedly and seem unable to stop until it is no longer available. They may also use it to pass the time when they have nothing else to do. Moreover, there is a concern about inappropriate content. Some websites may not be suitable for minors and are only appropriate for @CAPS5 adults. On the other hand, computers are not entirely bad for education. One can learn from appropriate websites, which can stimulate mental growth. In my opinion, computers do benefit society as they help with brainstorming and allow us to explore and learn about different websites.
636	638	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 Times, I am penning this correspondence regarding the article recently published in your newspaper on computers. I firmly believe that they are an indispensable component of the contemporary world. This is because one can acquire information for research or articles in significantly less time than by perusing books. Additionally, one can obtain crucial news updates, and entertainment is merely a click away. My initial rationale pertains to the information available on the internet. Suppose you were composing a paper on ancient Egyptians and needed to know how to spell ""hieroglyphics."" Using a dictionary would take a few minutes, whereas online, it would take approximately @NUM1 seconds. Alternatively, if you wished to know when @ORGANIZATION1 passed away, it would take hours scouring textbooks until you finally located the information. Online, it might take just over a minute. My second reason for appreciating computers is for news updates. You can ascertain what transpired in recent natural disasters or how your stocks are performing. Moreover, computers assisted us in the recent election and will continue to do so for an extended period. The weather can always be accessed online for any location in the world. This is advantageous if you are planning a trip somewhere, which you can also arrange using a computer. My third and final reason is that it is arduous to become bored while using a computer. The web is replete with engaging games and amusing videos. There are approximately @NUM2 gaming sites and @NUM3 sites featuring funny, weird, or cool videos and pictures. Numerous other platforms, such as Facebook, enable you to share pictures with your friends, family, and relatives. Alternatively, you can converse with complete strangers from around the globe. Therefore, the next time you require information, news, or are simply bored, turn to your computer and have a great time."
637	639	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, it has come to my attention that individuals are allocating an excessive amount of time to computers, and I concur. This is because people become so engrossed in computers that it becomes addictive. Consequently, they do not engage in sufficient exercise, and their eyesight deteriorates. Please continue reading my letter, and I will elucidate the side - effects of computer usage. Primarily, computers prove to be extremely addictive for numerous individuals, causing them to neglect spending time with their families or siblings. Some children become so addicted that upon returning from school, they immediately commence using the computer all day, disregarding studying for tests or completing homework. Currently, people devote so much time to the computer that they refrain from exercising or participating in sports with their friends. Instead, they simply sit all day, becoming lethargic and overweight due to computer usage. We only need the computer to check @CAPS3 and Facebook, as I do. However, I merely check my Facebook and then proceed to play basketball. One of the most significant issues, in my opinion, is that prolonged computer use can result in headaches and damage to one's eyesight. Thank you for reading my letter, and I hope you concur with my perspective.
638	640	1	1	Dear, I firmly advocate that computers are highly beneficial. There are numerous advantageous activities one can undertake on computers. A considerable number of individuals assert that computers have adverse effects on people, such as insufficient exercise and reduced family time. I dissent from this view. For instance, if you have family members residing in a different town, city, or state, there is a website that enables you to engage in webcam conversations with people worldwide, free of charge and at any time. If you possess a laptop, you can even do so anywhere! My subsequent rationale is that you can visually explore places you have never visited through direct pictures. For example, when our family intends to embark on a vacation to a distant location and we have limited knowledge about it, we can utilize the computer to research the place, understand its characteristics, and peruse others' reviews. Whether it is hot or cold, suitable for children, or any other information you desire, the computer can provide it. My final reason for the benefits of computers is related to studying. A common occurrence is leaving my textbook at home. In such situations, I can access the computer to determine the tasks assigned. Additionally, the computer can be employed to study and discover more efficient methods for learning any subject. Surveys indicate that @PERCENT1 of children who study on the computer pass their tests and achieve a higher grade percentage, an increase of +@NUM1. Moreover, if a child encounters an unfamiliar word while studying, they can look it up, ascertain its definition, and learn how to use it in a sentence. This is why I believe computers are an excellent means for enhancing one's well - being and personality.
639	641	1	1	In my opinion, individuals allocate an excessive amount of time to computers and fail to focus on their families. Another concern is that people will neglect their schoolwork if they are overly preoccupied with the computer. My third point is that people will not relish socializing with their friends. Now, allow me to elaborate on these points. Firstly, individuals become so engrossed in the computer that they disregard their families. They focus excessively on the computer and fail to enjoy quality time with their family and friends. People often ignore their parents when using the computer. I can attest to this as my sister becomes completely oblivious to my parents when she is on the computer. I urge you to heed my advice; otherwise, your children may ignore you when you attempt to communicate with them. @PERCENT1 of children ignore everything while using the computer. Now, let me proceed to the next reason. Secondly, people become so fixated on the computer that they neglect their homework and other school - related tasks. Failure to complete homework can lead to poor grades on their report cards, potentially resulting in failure during the marking period and having to repeat a grade. Please pay attention; otherwise, your child may face academic setbacks. Finally, people will not enjoy spending time with their friends. On weekends, instead of being glued to the computer, one should venture out and socialize with friends.
640	642	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you today as I have heard a complaint that an increasing number of people are using computers and engaging in less exercise. The experts expressing these concerns also assert that people should appreciate nature and interact more with family and friends. While these experts may seem knowledgeable, I believe they are mistaken. I will now explain why. Firstly, individuals who frequently use the computer still engage in exercise. Take Twitter as an example. The football player Ocho - Cinco ""tweets"" regularly, yet this does not imply that he does not exercise. There are numerous sports players on Twitter who are in excellent physical condition. Most of the students in my grade, including myself, have a Facebook account, and the majority of them are fit. Just because they spend a significant amount of time on the computer does not mean they cannot exercise. Secondly, consider the impact of the computer on students. Students utilize the computer for a multitude of purposes. We use Wikipedia for our projects and to research individuals. Nowadays, some schools almost rely on computers. I recall that when I lived in the countryside, we rarely had to type anything, except for projects. However, upon moving to @CAPS3, I am constantly typing, even for rough drafts. In the countryside, I would write out my final drafts by hand. I am compelled to use the computer. Schools are also teaching us about computer technology. As we discover more on the computer, we spend more time using it. When someone finds a new website, they will inform their friends, and the information will spread. Thirdly, the experts claim that people are spending too much time on the computer and less time interacting with family and friends. My grandpa, aunt, and other family members have Facebook accounts, which means I can still interact with them. Adults who spend a lot of time on the computer may not have family over every night and may go out with friends occasionally. Computers also benefit society. Business people may need to create a PowerPoint presentation, and they have a computer to assist them. While the experts may be correct in stating that we should appreciate nature, interact with family and friends, and exercise more, we can achieve all these things while still using the computer. If you conduct a survey in @CAPS3 to determine how many people use the computer almost daily and then ask how many of them exercise, you will find that it is possible to do both."
641	643	1	1	"Today, over @PERCENT1 of our populace expends exorbitant amounts of time daily on the computer. I concur that having a computer at home can be advantageous at times, yet to me, the drawbacks outweigh the benefits of spending excessive time on a computer. Drawbacks such as cyberbullying, illegal websites, criminals who utilize the internet to target individuals, and the interference that excessive computer use has with one's grades and other academic work. I opine that the largest demographic affected by spending too much time on the computer is children. Typically, children return from school, drop their backpacks, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or in a study area to complete homework, they immediately sit down in front of the computer. Then, what becomes of that homework? It usually remains undone. That lack of completed homework can cause a substantial decline in a student's average. However, homework is not the only schoolwork affected by the computer. Even in school, children use the internet on their cell phones. This presents a significant distraction for children and often results in them not finishing the tasks assigned to them. Not completing work is not the only problem the computer presents to children. It also contributes to bullying; specifically, cyberbullying. Many children are bullied and picked on at school, and that bullying then extends to their homes via the computer. Once at home, a child can receive hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do more than just hurt someone's feelings; they can damage their self - esteem and how they perceive themselves. Then, as if cyberbullying and not doing homework were not bad enough, there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals target children. They can obtain passwords to accounts. They can discover personal information about you due to the amount of time you spend on the computer each day. Once they learn enough about you, they use it to gain your trust, and the problem only intensifies from there. Although many children are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, they are not the only ones. Adults are affected just as severely and just as readily. One factor that entices adults to spend all their time on the computer is all the ""great deals"" they can find online. However, many of these great deals originate from fake or illegal websites. Websites that sell stolen merchandise. They showcase all the benefits of buying from them, and once you believe them and purchase what they are selling, they acquire all of your personal information. From there, you can end up with an empty bank account or even experience identity theft. Does that truly sound like a ""great deal?"" @CAPS1 to me, the disadvantages of having a computer definitely outweigh the advantages. I believe that people need to step away from the computer desk, achieve good grades, avoid bullying and criminals, keep their bank accounts full, and safeguard their identities. Instead, they should spend time outdoors, with family, or enjoying life!"
642	644	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers can be an extremely valuable addition to society. Firstly, if individuals never utilized computers, they would miss out on a vast opportunity to gain knowledge about the world surrounding them. Moreover, with computers, people can communicate with others across the globe. If people use computers more frequently, they are likely to develop the skills necessary to pursue job opportunities in a much broader market. Consequently, computers can significantly benefit any community. Computers offer numerous opportunities for educational exploration. People can access a substantial amount of information in a relatively small space, as opposed to using a large area for books. People can relatively easily find almost anything they wish to know about on the internet. Whether for pure learning or for reference purposes. For instance, if someone is working on a project at school, computers can expand the educational opportunities for many individuals. Secondly, the internet can serve as a far - reaching communication tool. Any document or piece of information can be transmitted, for example, from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C within seconds. Similarly, if two people are separated by a great distance, they can easily communicate. Since the advent of social networking, individuals who @MONTH1 have lost contact can easily reconnect and engage in discussions. With computers, communication is becoming increasingly rapid. Finally, due to an ever - expanding job market, the use of computers is becoming a common prerequisite for many professions. Most jobs related to engineering require the use of different programs for modeling and drafting. Additionally, most governments now maintain computerized files. Also, most jobs related to any form of business require the individual to be able to type quickly. Since many jobs demand experience with computers, they should be an integral part of any community. In conclusion, experience with computers can be beneficial for any individual and society as a whole.
643	645	1	1	The computer impacts people's lives by diverting them from their families and there are @NUM1 reasons why the computer affects people's lives. @NUM2) They are unaware of what is occurring outside. @NUM3) Their family is affected. @NUM1) Their job is affected. Please consider my reasons for why the computer affects people's lives! My first reason is that they are oblivious to what is happening outside because they are overly engrossed in the computer. Their friends might have achieved something significant and wanted them to be present, yet they are simply too preoccupied with the computer. They will miss out on nature or socializing with friends. For example, if they have a meeting with someone at a certain place and they don't show up, it likely means they were on the computer all day. My second reason pertains to their family. I mention their family because they can miss out on numerous things. Such as a family reunion, a family vacation, and more. It's as if one of their family members is injured and is trying to call them, but they don't answer the phone because they are too occupied with the computer. One can even lose their spouse because of the computer; they might forget their spouse's birthday or other important events because they are on the computer. Regarding their children, what if the children want to play and have nothing to do? They say no because of the computer. The family will become resentful. My third and final reason is their job. They can lose their job because they miss work due to spending time on the computer doing non - work - related things. If they lose their jobs, they won't be able to pay for utilities and won't be able to use their computer. They will be in their house without electricity and without a functioning computer because they spent too much time on it and didn't pay attention to what was happening. They will all feel lost because they no longer have their computer. Or the computer might break down and they won't have enough money to hire an electrician. Those were all my reasons. @NUM2) They don't know what is happening outside. @NUM3) Their family. @NUM1) Their job. Thank you for listening to my reasons.
644	646	1	1	In contemporary society, nearly everyone utilizes computers, whether @CAPS4 for conducting research, playing games, or interacting with others. These are all positive aspects. Schools across America employ computers from @NUM1 grade through online colleges. People derive benefits from computers by accomplishing everything and anything through them. @CAPS2 any rational individual can recognize that computers are a positive force in today's society. Firstly, computers are a positive asset because they can facilitate the completion of almost any task. One can play on them and interact with others. The fact that the computer can perform almost any task for you @CAPS4 is a favorable thing because if you need to complete work, you can do so; if you need to conduct research, @CAPS1 can assist you in any subject. The reason that playing games can be positive @CAPS4 is that @CAPS1 not only enhances hand - eye coordination but also exercises the brain and can serve as a learning experience for young children. The reason that interacting via the computer @CAPS4 is that one learns how to communicate and conduct business through email and can make many connections. @CAPS2, please use your intellect and make use of that computer in our society today. @CAPS2, to continue, Americans are among the most intelligent people in the world and are doing very well. I @CAPS3 have to say that @CAPS4 is why we send everyone to school @NUM2 of every year. With that said, since people use computers, anyone who claims that computers are bad should consider what they enjoy doing while using them. That is, using computers and reaping benefits in their lives. @CAPS2, as you can see, computers are a positive force and can benefit today's society. @CAPS2, I implore you, for your own sake, to use computers and improve your life. It is in your best interest.
645	647	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I firmly believe that computers benefit society. Computers aid us in numerous ways, but the @NUM1 primary reasons are that they assist us in storing important documents, improving or learning foreign languages, and obtaining information. So, without further ado, here are more detailed explanations. Firstly, computers enable us to store a multitude of documents. Without computers, companies involved in auctions and many other activities would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would be extremely time - consuming and there would not be sufficient space, so many files would @CAPS1 be scattered everywhere. @CAPS1, think about it. You use computers to create, store, and send newspaper articles, and without computers, you wouldn't be able to keep everyone informed. Secondly, they help us learn or improve our proficiency in foreign languages. Computers allow us to understand what people in other countries around the world are saying. For example, my grandmother learned Spanish. Now, I can converse with her and she can understand me. Finally, computers help us acquire information. They assist us in obtaining information for school projects, records, directions, etc. In the year @DATE1, people did not have computers, but when the first router was invented, the situation improved significantly. People's knowledge levels increased by @NUM2 points. Farmers who were once in difficult circumstances became prosperous, and even a child graduated from college at the age of @NUM3. So, before you claim that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, consider what computers do for us. @CAPS1, think about it. In conclusion, computers benefit us greatly. They are storage devices, they help us improve and learn foreign languages, and they help us obtain information. So, please make the right choice and consider the advantages computers offer.
646	648	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers significantly contribute to society. One rationale is that individuals can acquire knowledge about novel matters, simplify their lives to an extent, and connect with new acquaintances while using computers. Firstly, we can reap benefits from computers as they enable us to learn new things. People can discover places they've never heard of and stay informed about global events. Computers are also valuable tools for school - going children eager to expand their knowledge. They assist in uncovering crucial information that may be required in the future. Secondly, the presence of computers in society eases the lives of some individuals. Instead of going out to purchase items, one can order them from online platforms. This is particularly helpful for those without transportation. For instance, if a person wishes to buy a product not yet available in stores, they can find it online. Lastly, computers facilitate the process of meeting new people. If someone has recently relocated from another town or state, it can help them establish new connections. Similarly, a student unfamiliar with their new school can find peers online and get to know them. In conclusion, computers benefit society in numerous ways. They aid in learning, enable us to meet new people, and simplify our lives. This is why I advocate for the continued integration of computers in our society.
647	649	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, envision a world where no information can be preserved for global access, a place devoid of communication with loved ones or friends, or a life where there is no means of learning about catastrophes on the other side of the globe. Evidently, life without computers is sheer chaos. Computers offer education and facilitate staying in touch with friends and family. I am certain that our world greatly benefits from this marvel. Medicine, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and the construction and transformation of our lives have become possible due to computers. @PERSON1 is an old family friend of mine. He was among those working on the first moon - landing mission. They were astounded by what their astronauts witnessed. Computers made this experience a reality. @PERSON1 recalled receiving some of the first lunar footage on his computer before it was released to the public. However, @PERSON1 is not the sole proponent. Johnson, a principal from a private school in @LOCATION1, after winning an award for the best school in @LOCATION1, stated that @PERCENT1 of their education stems from computers. ""We involve our students in technology. These students go on to develop the best medicine, cars, and computers. Our students are all beneficial to our world today."" How can we settle for anything less for our children's education? In times of tragedy, when faced with a difficult decision, or simply feeling lonely and longing for support, whom do we turn to first? Our loved ones are always there for us. Thanks to our access to computers, whether across the world or just around the corner, we can always stay in touch with those we love. @PERSON2, my friend, learned that her aunt was diagnosed with cancer last year. However, she was at a boarding school in @LOCATION2 while her aunt needed her support. Instead, she was with her every step via webcam, email, and @CAPS7. She could even contact her aunt's doctors to check on her condition. Her aunt overcame cancer with her niece's support and is now living happily. With only a @NUM1 chance of survival, @PERSON2 provided the support her aunt needed during the most difficult @CAPS2. Not only did she witness the positive effects of staying in touch. Marcos, a family therapist, says that @NUM2 of happy families stay in contact after separation through the internet. How could anyone ever abandon those they care about the most? Envision a world with comprehensive education for our children and a place where we can always stay connected with one another. That is the world we live in."
648	650	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, as of @DATE1, people have been engaging in less physical activity and neglecting the great outdoors. Some individuals are also spending less time with family and friends. I attribute this to computers! This device is an excellent resource, yet people are becoming addicted to it. We need to convey a message to these individuals. Yesterday, I visited my local library and found @NUM1 computers in use. All were occupied, and there was a line of @NUM2 people waiting their turn. I asked those @NUM2 people, ""Why are you here?"" A teenager replied, ""For homework."" Another said, ""Just to play."" I also inquired, ""How do you maintain fitness?"" A beautiful lady responded, ""I don't like to stay fit."" The teenager added, ""Staying fit is difficult if you're always on the computer."" The responses I received were astonishing. If we fail to maintain fitness, how can we survive diseases and cancer? This is closely related to not staying fit. I care deeply about my family and would never choose to spend my life in front of a computer over being with my loved ones. At the end of [period], I was surprised to learn that projects, homework, and research can consume half of the time we could spend with our families. While computers can provide some entertainment for you and your friends and family, it should not be for more than a few minutes. The great outdoors is one of the best places to be. It is peaceful, amazing, and spacious. Looking up the outdoors on a computer is a waste of time that could be spent with a family member outdoors or elsewhere. My father says it's great to build [something] but better to experience life. The days are growing shorter; let's make the most of them."
649	651	1	1	Dear Local newspaper, I concur that computers exert an influence on people. They help individuals develop hand - eye coordination, enable learning about distant places, and allow online communication with others. Computers teach hand - eye coordination. As @CAPS1 mature, they learn the alphabet and spelling. Numerous online programs instruct @CAPS1 on typing. Once @CAPS1 start learning to type, they can become proficient quickly. Computers assist @CAPS1 of the future in learning, and with the plethora of educational websites, @CAPS1 can learn to solve new problems. Isn't it a privilege to meet people from afar? One can learn about their cultures. Don't you want to know about different cultures? People have their daily routines, and learning about them is fascinating. Learning a new culture is an efficient way to make friends. Perhaps one day, you'll connect with people who could become more than just friends. We should have a positive attitude towards online chatting and online dating services. As demonstrated by the reasons above, computers have a significant impact on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, enable learning about distant places and people, and allow online interaction. Ensure you maintain a positive outlook and stay safe while using computers.
650	652	1	1	Dear Local newspaper, I agree that computers have an effect on people. It helps people learn hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn a far places and you can talk online with other people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. As @CAPS1 grow up, they learn about letters of the alphabet and spelling. There are many online programs that teach @CAPS1 how to type. Once the @CAPS1 get in learning how to type, they end up typing fast. Computers help @CAPS1 of future learn & with all these learning websites, @CAPS1 will be able ti teach them solves new things. Isn't it a blessing to be able to meet people from a far? You'll get ot learn there cultures. Would you want to know something about? They make daily go around, there you'll you? Well its so learning a new culture is a faster way of making friends. Have you connect. Oneday i will people who dont just want to be friends, maybe more than that. Be positive about online chatting, or online dating services. As you can see for my reasons above, the computer has an effect on people. The computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, it also gives you the ability to learn afar places & people, and it allows you to chat with other online people. Make sure you stay positive & be safe on the computers.
651	653	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, the computer is highly advantageous to me. I assert this because without the computers, we would not possess as extensive knowledge about other countries as we do currently. Additionally, it serves as an alternative source of communication. Another rationale is that the computer facilitates children in completing their work more expeditiously. Hopefully, after perusing this, you will concur with my perspective on computers. Firstly, the computer enables people to be informed about the occurrences among individuals in other islands. For example, you may have heard about the @CAPS1 that transpired in @LOCATION1 via television. However, if you desired to acquire more information regarding it, all you need to do is input it, and it will provide you with a wealth of details. Moreover, it showcases the conditions in other places and how people cope with all of that. Another instance is communication. The computer has empowered people to engage in conversations without the use of a phone or being physically present. This is extremely beneficial to people as not everyone enjoys being on the phone throughout the day (myself included), so it is an alternative mode of communication. Furthermore, you can visit websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or other platforms to interact with your friends. Some individuals prefer to have pen - pals. A pen - pal is a means by which you can communicate with someone you have never met and who is from another country. Moreover, you have @NUM1 ways to communicate using your computers. My third reason why computers are advantageous is that they assist in getting tasks done. For example, let's assume you had to find some definitions. Instead of searching for the word in the dictionary, you can simply type in the definition. Also, if you have to conduct research in history, you can access the computer and find information about him/her. So, I hope you take into account that computers are excellent for society.
652	654	1	1	Dear to whom it may concern, my name is @PERSON1, and I opine that computers are detrimental to society. Computers have been a significant differentiating factor when comparing the @NUM1 to the @NUM2 centuries. People have become overly reliant on computers. Global communication facilitated by computers has not been particularly beneficial, and people are spending hours on their computers daily instead of engaging in physical exercise. Overall, I believe society would be in a better state without computers. At the end of @DATE1, prior to the onset of the millennium, everyone was apprehensive about what was known as @NUM3. The year two thousand was supposedly when all computers would shut down and cease to function. Since computers were in their nascent stage for society, everyone regarded them as remarkable. People were panicking at the thought of their precious computers malfunctioning. The entire nation had grown dependent on computers. Everyone concealed themselves in attics and basements, awaiting the end of the world. Do you know what happened? The sun rose the next day, and everyone logged into their emails with a sigh of relief. It was not only relief that the world did not end but also that the functionality of computers could continue. People rely on computers just as much, if not more, today. I recently visited @LOCATION1, and everywhere in the restaurant, people even had their laptops with them, which they had to carry everywhere. In conclusion, the @CAPS2 society is in a lamentable state due to their excessive reliance on computers. An immediate inclination is to cite communication as the reason why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Are there national television channels? We have numerous means of communication, such as perhaps writing a letter to someone. Communication would not be an issue; in fact, it has predominantly caused problems. Computers and the internet allow news to spread rapidly, even if it is inaccurate, which can damage someone's career and public image. They also enable communication with foreign countries. Excessive communication can lead countries into wars. Normally, the @LOCATION3 would have no knowledge of what is happening, but with the internet, the nation becomes involved promptly. Computers foster poor communication, and you can easily communicate with family and friends through other means. As a teenager, I am also aware of the problems associated with youths and computers. Frequently, kids do not want to go outside and instead prefer to sit indoors on the computer. Obesity is an escalating issue in @LOCATION2, and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they do not want to part with their computers. Without computers, kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now, you have seen my reasoning that society would be far better off if there were no computers.
653	655	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I contend that computers are over - utilized in this society! People spend more hours seated in front of the computer than engaging in physical exercise because they find it more exhilarating to spend time with computers than on treadmills! Some individuals in this society recognize that we are spending an excessive amount of time on computers, while others are oblivious to how long they have been fixated on the screen! I am one of those who enjoy using the computer extensively, but I have noticed changes. I can discern that many of us spend so much time in front of the computer screen that we have drifted apart from our families! I never truly considered how infrequently I converse with them anymore because I am preoccupied with chatting online with friends. Nevertheless, I do not advocate for eliminating computers. Online, we can conduct research on almost everything in the world. I can even enter my name in a search bar and find information about myself and anyone else with the exact same name! The internet has become more sophisticated in recent years. Without it, nowadays, nearly everyone would be at a loss! The internet should be employed less for blogging and chatting and more for more useful purposes such as @CAPS1.com or @CAPS2.com. I hope you take this into consideration.
654	656	1	1	I am of the opinion that computers are a significant boon to society. I hold this view because when you are unaware of something, you can access the internet to look it up. Additionally, if you are too ill or lack the time to venture out and purchase necessary items from stores, you can make online purchases and have them delivered directly to your doorstep. My final reason is that computers can conserve paper by storing a large number of documents. My first reason is that if you are ignorant of something, you can conduct a search. On numerous occasions, you might be watching @CAPS1.V. or conversing with someone and suddenly wonder what something is or what it means. Instead of allowing your ignorance to persist, you can use a computer to look it up, thereby educating yourself and potentially others as well. My next reason is that if you are too ill or do not have the time to go to stores to buy what you need, you can make online purchases and have the items delivered to your door. This is extremely helpful for those who are too ill because sometimes they are so incapacitated that they cannot leave their homes. Instead of suffering from starvation, they can have food or any other item delivered to them by simply clicking a few buttons on the computer. Moreover, this can also assist those who are too busy to visit stores. Just before they leave, they can press a few buttons, and when they return home, their purchases will be waiting for them. Back when my father was a @CAPS2 and my mother was the vice - president of a drug - producing company that sold oxy - cofin, they had to have a grocery service ship food to our house. This was necessary because they worked long hours and did not have the time to go to a grocery store. They had the food delivered to our house, which was a great convenience. My last and final reason is that computers can contribute to saving a large number of trees and paper. Currently, a crucial objective is to adopt environmentally friendly practices. Instead of cutting down more trees, we can store all relevant information on our computers without using any paper. These are just some of the reasons why computers are beneficial to society. I could enumerate many more reasons, but I cannot include them all in this account. Finally, remember that people's entire lives are often stored on their computers.
655	657	1	1	The utilization of computers is highly beneficial for everyone. Employing a computer can aid you in learning about diverse individuals from across the globe. Additionally, it provides you with the capacity to communicate with people. With a computer, you can also gain knowledge about places throughout @LOCATION1 and the world. Through a computer, everyone can learn about people from all over. If you were planning a vacation to a destination in @LOCATION2, you could learn about the customs and activities of the local people. Moreover, you can discover what people your age do for a living. If you had to complete a school project about a place outside of @LOCATION1, the computer would be of great assistance. You can search for information regarding what they wear and what holidays they celebrate. Learning about people will also facilitate making friends. If a foreign exchange student comes to your school, you can research their culture and discuss it with them. While using a computer, you can also engage in communication with others. With the use of platforms like @CAPS1 or A.I.M, you can easily communicate with your friends. You can inquire about the homework you missed if you were absent from school. You can also strengthen your friendships with people you were not previously well - acquainted with by simply greeting them or asking about their day. You can also send emails. If you befriend someone during a vacation, you can email them. You can also visit websites where you can communicate with people from other countries. If you have a webcam, you can even engage in video chats and ask them questions about their country or their interests. You can also have video chats with all your friends. Using a computer, you can learn about places around the world. If you were going to an unfamiliar place, you could look up the outstanding restaurants and also find out about fun family activities. If you needed to complete a project, you can look up information about the weather and the local people's way of life. If you wanted to assist a country that has just experienced an earthquake or a hurricane, you can look up ways to help that country. These three reasons underscore why computers are indispensable to people. You can learn about different people, communicate with your friends, and search for and learn about different places around the world.
656	658	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, The dilemma regarding computers demands attention. People must realize that computers are among the greatest inventions of our era. However, in my view, individuals exploit this advantage and misuse them for inappropriate purposes. Computers are not intended for incessant gaming or constant instant messaging. They are designed for educational pursuits, work, or academic endeavors. Why do people utilize computers for non - essential activities? People use them for amusement! They engage in instant messaging, listen to music, visit @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. People also access @CAPS4 and play games on untrusted websites. Computers are not meant for such activities; they are for school and work. Applications like @ORGANIZATION2, Word, @ORGANIZATION2, and PowerPoint, if computers were employed for these functions, people would not be in their current state. In @LOCATION1, the computer is extremely popular; people adore it! Yet, these individuals are unfriendly, unkind, and melancholic. They are also severely out of shape. I know numerous people who use computers instead of doing homework and getting fresh air. They are so self - centered that all they do when they return home from school is eat and play on the computer. I struggle to comprehend why they do this, but I suppose they feel they have no better alternative. I also know people who use the computer appropriately, and they are very content. They possess extensive knowledge, and conversations with them are never dull. Those people use the computer daily but use it correctly only for appropriate purposes, and they are intelligent and achieve good grades in school! Essentially, what I am attempting to convey is that people who use the computer effectively succeed in whatever they do because they understand how to use it, but those who misuse it will be miserable because they lack knowledge, have average grades, and are unhealthy.
657	659	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers serve as an excellent medium for exploring the world and its inhabitants. They can educate people about unfamiliar concepts. Computers facilitate global connectivity, keeping people in touch across vast distances. Moreover, they prove invaluable when immediate information is required. When it comes to learning, computers are highly beneficial. They can impart knowledge that most books cannot, such as hand - eye coordination and current population statistics of countries and cities. Additionally, computers offer the opportunity to view images of places and people that are not found in books, photo albums, or newspapers. In educational institutions, computers are indispensable when projects are assigned. Students can rapidly access the information they need. They can also use computers to write essays or print pictures for their projects. Undoubtedly, computers are essential for learning and education. Computers are also remarkable for communication. People can interact on networking platforms such as @CAPS1, Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. On these sites, individuals can send messages to their friends, informing them of events or simply chatting to stay connected. Family members can exchange emails to share news or details about an event. I personally had an experience where email was extremely useful. My family and I were planning a trip to Block Island. Two days before our departure, we received an email from the homeowner stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was damaged due to a storm. Without computers, we would have been in a difficult situation. Computers are also useful in times of need or confusion. People can check local weather forecasts to determine if the weather will affect their plans. If someone is unsure about the location of a house or store, they can quickly look it up on the computer. Finally, if an item is unavailable in a store, people can shop online and have it delivered to their doorstep. Computers have contributed to the growth and prosperity of this country. Why oppose them when they benefit society so significantly? Computers are helping the world become a more educated, connected, and informed place.
658	660	1	1	"The topic that preoccupies many in our country is, ""Are computers beneficial or detrimental to our students?"" @CAPS1 have evolved from desktop computers, and before that, typewriters. However, have they advanced too far? While the blank screen of a computer in @MONTH1 may distract some, the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages in such a scenario. The ability to conduct faster research, communicate more easily, and the use of computers in wartime are remarkable capabilities of modern computers. Additionally, due to technological advancements, computers are extremely helpful as they assist @LOCATION4 in our daily lives. Although there are numerous doubts about computers, they can overcome all of them. In time - sensitive situations such as college or high school, speed is of the essence. Computers enable students to conduct research more rapidly and accurately by allowing them to search for keywords. Previously, students had to endure the arduous process of searching through books. More often than not, they would not find what they were looking for. However, in the modern era, students can obtain the information they need promptly. Moreover, having computers in the classroom benefits teachers as they can access the information required for an upcoming class. If speed is what you need, then you will turn to a computer. Apart from speed, computers also offer another significant advantage: communication. Through emails, @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and blogs, staying informed about what your friends are doing is just a click away! This is far more convenient than making a phone call. Additionally, this easy access to friends is beneficial when someone moves away. If you miss a long - lost friend or cousin, simply search for their name, and you can communicate with them! Having friends easily accessible can truly enhance one's life. In @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION1, soldiers rely on computers for valuable information, such as radar or robots. Having computers perform the ""dangerous tasks"" can be advantageous in times of war and can save precious lives. Without these computers, some members of the @LOCATION4 armed forces would face certain death. Computers sometimes replace humans in tasks such as @ORGANIZATION1's or unmanned aerial vehicles, saving many lives. Whether it is through social media like Facebook or in military operations, computers play a crucial role. On @DATE1, @PERSON1's communist regime was in power in New @LOCATION2. One man stood in front of a tank, refusing to move, demonstrating courage and advocating for democracy. Fortunately, this event was captured on film. How was it broadcast to the world? Through the computer and the internet. Today, many people can learn about this event thanks to computers. In numerous ways, computers assist @LOCATION4 in our daily lives, and for most of @LOCATION4, life would be difficult without them."
659	661	1	1	In contemporary society, the majority of people are highly dependent on computers. Whether for work or leisure, everyone utilizes computers. In a recent study, researchers determined that the average person spends @NUM1 years of their life on computers. That amounts to @NUM1 years of wasted life. Most children spend their entire day on computers, visiting @CAPS1, Facebook, @CAPS2, and YouTube. They could be spending this time with family and friends, creating memories. Children fail to recognize the brevity of life; they should be engaging in activities such as hiking, camping, and spending quality time with loved ones. I believe that when these children grow into adults, they will look back and regret not spending more time with their families or seizing opportunities to explore the world. Instead, they will recall the hilarious YouTube video that received over a million views. Additionally, as you @MONTH1 are aware, childhood obesity is on the rise. There are more overweight children than healthy ones. If you look back to the era before computers, you will rarely see an overweight child. The computer is to blame for this new epidemic. Children should be outdoors, participating in sports and breathing fresh air. I am confident that if computers were removed for @NUM3 year, the improvement in health would be substantial. Children would become healthier and shed excess weight. I hope that everyone can recognize the detrimental effects of computers after reading this and eliminate this harmful device.
660	662	1	1	Dear Newspaper, As you @MONTH1 are well aware, many people nowadays are constantly on the computer, and numerous individuals consider it a problem. However, you should understand that the computer is beneficial in multiple ways, such as for learning, entertainment, and even health. These are just a few of the hundreds of different uses. The computer can help you reconnect with relatives you haven't seen in a long time. For instance, if you have been experiencing health issues, you can search online to determine the cause. I recall that my mother was experiencing severe dizziness and illness, and her doctor assured her that everything was fine, but it wasn't. So, my mother searched online and discovered that she had a disease. When she returned to the doctor, they confirmed the diagnosis and prescribed medication. In my opinion, the computer is one of the greatest inventions. It can be used for a multitude of purposes, including online shopping. I hope you now concur with my view and support the use of computers.
661	663	1	1	Dear Newspaper, as you can observe, possessing a computer can impact you. Owning a computer can induce indolent behavior, confine you indoors, and keep you inside such that you do not socialize with family and friends. Everyone relishes having a computer, yet have you ever contemplated what it can do to you? Devoting an entire day or even half of your day to the computer will render you lethargic. When you are lethargic or becoming so, you lack the inclination to do anything, and without engaging in any activity, you can become overweight. Thus, you require exercise as it is beneficial for you, and exercising can safeguard you from health issues such as diabetes. Disengage from your computer and take a stroll. Why would anyone desire to be indoors using a computer when you can savor what nature offers? Being overly enthralled by your computer can confine you indoors instead of allowing you to breathe the fresh, clean air outside. Being outdoors can also be highly enjoyable. You can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park. When you are outside, you can also behold all the awe - inspiring scenery, wild animals, and exotic plants and flowers that coexist with us. If you simply venture outside for at least an hour a day, you will undoubtedly perceive how much superior it is to being on a computer. Remaining on the computer for an extended period can prevent you from focusing on what truly matters: your friends and family. Why converse with a friend on the internet when you can meet up with them and partake in something enjoyable? Friends and family are truly significant, and if you do not spend time with them, they can become disheartened. Being with friends and family is supposed to be the most splendid moments of your life, so do not squander them on the computer. Call up a friend and engage in something enjoyable. I hope by now you comprehend that being on the computer or having one is not the optimal idea. Having a computer can make you lazy, prevent you from relishing nature, and cause you to not spend time with family and friends. If everyone abstained from the computer for at least an hour a day, they would lead a happier, healthier life. So, turn off your computer, rise from your couch, and relish your life.
662	664	1	1	"Technology has been advancing and evolving at a rapid pace. Just consider Apple's new [CAPS1], a reasonably - sized touch - screen computer. Computers have also been undergoing rapid transformations. However, I believe that [CAPS2] need to curtail their use of electronics. Spending an extended and substantial amount of time on the computer can impair your eyesight, induce arthritis, and detract from time that could be spent on exercise; one of the things many [CAPS2] ought to do. Numerous [CAPS2] have been spending an excessive amount of time on the computer. Although it can be extremely useful, it can also be highly detrimental to your eyesight as many people spend large amounts of time gazing at the computer screen. If you stare at something for too long, it can damage your eyesight and exacerbate it because you are straining your eye lens. Additionally, the lighting from the computer is extremely harmful to your eyes. The light reaching your eyes is akin to staring at the sun, albeit not quite as damaging. The sun will instantaneously damage your eyes, while over time, a computer gradually impairs your eyesight. If your eyesight is already compromised, a computer will worsen it. The more time you spend on a computer, the more you damage your vision. Since your eyesight is already poor, you might think, ""Well, they can't get any worse."" In fact, the truth is that they can. Not only is the light and the amount of time spent on the computer damaging to people with [NUM1] vision, but it is even more so for those without. Arthritis can be genetic or common among people who constantly crack their knuckles. It can also be prevalent among those who spend an excessive amount of time on the computer. AIM is extremely popular among people of all ages. It is a means to instantaneously gossip or chat with friends. However, it involves a great deal of typing. Typing for too long or excessively can cause your fingers to lock up and make it more difficult for your bones to move over your joints without pain. If this occurs frequently, you could be a candidate for arthritis. Not allowing your fingers to take a break can also be one of the reasons your fingers hurt. If you never let them rest, they can also lock up, and it can be excruciatingly painful. You should reduce your time on the computer if you do not want arthritis. Due to all this new technology, fewer [CAPS2] go outside to play or visit the gym and exercise. That might be why many [CAPS2] are overweight. Spending too much time on the computer deprives you of the time you could utilize to exercise or breathe fresh air."
663	665	1	1	"I opine that a computer is a prudent idea because when people are online, they can communicate with their family and see them via the video cam. When you do not wish to go out or simply want to relax, you can go online. For instance, would you prefer to be interrupted while watching a movie you enjoy? When someone says, ""Go clean your room,"" and you're engrossed in a great movie, it's quite a nuisance. Computers are the optimal system for going online, and everyone utilizes them. Without a computer, how would you check your Yahoo [CAPS1]? My mother adores being on [CAPS2]. How would you check your messages if you do not own a computer? If computers were removed from the market, everyone would attempt to make one. And the people at Walmart would be envious as others would be making more money. The Apple Store attracts customers who go there to purchase computers. People spend a great deal of time online because they relish being connected. If I enjoy being online, you cannot take away the computers and claim that I am searching too much. In essence, it's all about computers. When your mother is constantly at home and you're bored, go buy a computer when you have the funds."
664	666	1	1	Dear [CAPS1] [ORGANIZATION2], I am of the view that computers have a positive influence on their users. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, enable us to gain knowledge about distant people and places, and facilitate online communication with others. The primary reason I believe computers have a positive impact on people is that they foster hand - eye coordination. For example, when we type to select the letters, we must employ our hand - eye coordination skills. This enhances our hand - eye coordination as it prompts us to consider the letters we are typing, locate the letters on the keyboard, and press them. Moreover, when we type long passages, it further improves our hand - eye coordination as we become accustomed to writing long paragraphs, familiarize ourselves with the letter positions on the keyboard, and increase our typing speed, which implies that we can accomplish more work in less time. Believe it or not, [PERSON1] of the [ORGANIZATION1] hospital conducted a survey indicating that [NUM1] individuals who type essays instead of writing them by hand possess superior hand - eye coordination skills. Computers also allow us to explore distant people and places. For instance, they simplify the process of researching such subjects. Using a computer enables us to understand and learn about people and places without having to visit the library. Additionally, computers provide us with access to more information about recent global events. They also expedite the research process, as searching for a book in large libraries can be stressful and challenging. Furthermore, information on a computer is always accessible, unlike library books that may be checked out. Lastly, you have the information at your fingertips, so you never have to leave your home. The final reason is that computers enable us to chat online with others. This is beneficial as it allows us to communicate with friends and family worldwide. It also helps us stay in touch with our parents when they are away or when we are on a camping trip. Chatting on a computer is an excellent way to make new friends and block those you do not wish to interact with. In a sense, you can control your friendships. Computers are the most remarkable technological advancement since the wheel and have assisted numerous people.
665	667	1	1	Dear [CAPS1] paper [CAPS2], the computers we possess confer benefits upon our society as they enhance people's intelligence, facilitate communication with those living afar, and aid in completing homework, especially if you are still in school. Owning a computer is an excellent means of augmenting your knowledge. You can access various websites to assist you in understanding concepts you are struggling with at school. I recall a time when I was having difficulties with math, and my teacher recommended a website called [ORGANIZATION1]. It provides guidance on areas where you need help and offers a live tutor. Computers can even teach infants to speak. My cousin, who is [NUM1] [NUM1/2] years old, learned to talk with the help of a computer. Isn't it astonishing what computers can achieve? Next, I will discuss how computers are an outstanding resource for communicating with people you may know who live far away. With computers, you can converse with individuals residing across the [LOCATION1]. Wouldn't you prefer to have long - distance conversations without incurring additional charges on your cell phone? I remember once when I had no minutes left on my phone, I was able to have a great conversation with my dad on the computer. Having a computer is somewhat like having a larger cellphone. You can communicate with family or friends even if you or they do not have a phone. Lastly, I will elaborate on how computers can assist with homework. With a computer, you can complete a significant amount of homework. The last time I was on my computer, I had to research [PERSON1] for a math assignment. I simply typed his name, and his biography appeared, allowing me to write about him. You can use a computer for all subjects, particularly language arts. You can type up papers and look up various things required for class. Would you prefer to write a [NUM3] - page essay and endure finger cramps from writing? No. So, you can simply use the computer to type it without experiencing finger cramps. I urge you to reconsider your opinion, as computers can enhance your intelligence, enable communication with distant people, and assist you with your homework.
666	668	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I comprehend the controversies surrounding the use of computers. Computers stand as the epicenter of technology; I am unable to fathom a world devoid of them. Although having a computer in @MONTH1 may lead children to engage in uneducational games, computers offer substantial educational value and assist children as well. I am cognizant that for your company, operating without computers would be a calamity. Computers impart education not only to children but also to adults. Firstly, computers have been proven to be the second - best source of education, trailing only behind schools, and they are the premier source of information. Millions of websites are dedicated solely to various forms of education. Moreover, there are @CAPS1's that offer online tutoring or coursework. Computers provide virtually everything one needs. For work and adult use, computers are employed to sell products, communicate with others, or research new topics. The technological capabilities of a computer surpass those of any other item. Without computers, life would be significantly more arduous. Instead of simply sending an email, physical mail would need to be dispatched. Most information would have to be sourced from books. In fact, the internet even offers books for purchase and reading. I am aware that some individuals believe children are spending excessive time on the computer chatting with friends. However, children need to be social. If they weren't communicating on the computer, there would simply be more texting and calling. The computer simplifies life to such an extent that removing it would cause stress and leave less time for other important activities. Lastly, computers are indispensable for creating documents; they are the optimal means of typing. Your company can surely concur that without the ability to type documents, life would be in disarray. Everyone creates, sends, re - opens, and edits documents. The only alternative to typing on a computer is a typewriter. Typewriters cannot save data, delete content, or perform half of the functions that computers can. Your entire job hinges on computers and typing. How would you feel if you were unable to use a computer? In conclusion, computers are a necessity for our existence. Without them, life would be difficult and stressful. Computers offer education and information to everyone. Their technology is remarkable and makes daily life easier. I cannot even envision a world without documents and typing. I am confident you will concur with my stance. I hope you choose to disseminate this information to others. Thank you for your time.
667	669	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am penning this correspondence to apprise you regarding the utilization of computers. Computers can be both engaging and captivating. Nevertheless, individuals are expending an inordinate amount of time on computers. In my opinion, one should allocate time for interacting with members of one's community, family, and friends. I also opine that it is facile to become addicted to computers. I can attest that I was once an individual who spent an excessive amount of time, approximately @NUM1, on the computer, and it was not beneficial. One should exercise caution while using the computer because nowadays, it can be perilous. It is astonishing that people spend more time on the computer than with their own families. Do you not concur? Well, you ought to, as your community, family, and friends should be of utmost importance to you. One should not squander an entire day on the computer; instead, one should engage with the people in one's vicinity. Nowadays, one can observe numerous individuals engrossed in their computers, neglecting to spend time with their families. This situation should not persist. Although computers are enjoyable and fascinating, there are people around you who wish to spend time with you. You should contemplate this issue as it is occurring far too frequently in the world. @PERCENT1 of the students in my school claim to be addicted to computers, and @PERCENT2 of the individuals in my community also assert the same. These are alarmingly high figures, are they not? This is a lamentable state of affairs and should cease. Computers are akin to a drug; once you start using them, you will be inclined to use them constantly. The moment you first use a computer, you will become addicted immediately. I am not suggesting that you should never use a computer, but ensure that you do not become overly addicted, as it can happen with ease. My mother always said, ""Be cautious while using the computer."" Initially, I did not fully comprehend her meaning, but now I do. Whatever you do on the computer will remain there and be stored, regardless of your attempts to delete it. Therefore, you should be prudent and refrain from posting anything on the computer that you would not want others to see. Anyone can access what you post, so you should exercise caution. Children are meeting strangers and attempting to arrange in - person meetings. Hence, you should be vigilant because the computer is the only realm where one can deceive. Now, you should understand my perspective. You should now concur with me and recognize that people should spend more time interacting with others, avoid addiction, and remain safe."
668	670	1	1	"Some individuals contend that computers exert a positive influence on people. However, I hold the view that their so - called ""positive"" impact actually deteriorates cognitive faculties. I believe that using computers is a waste of time and serves as an excuse for people to avoid spending time with their families and enjoying the outdoors. This is precisely why computer usage should be curtailed, and family time should be augmented. Undoubtedly, excessive computer use can be detrimental to the brain, as it may lead to the deterioration of brain cells. Teenagers are the primary culprits in this regard. When they log onto social media platforms such as MySpace and Facebook, they fail to acquire any meaningful knowledge and instead cause significant damage to their brain cells. When they sit for the CMTS exams at school, they are likely to fail because their computer - centric lifestyle has left them ill - informed. Moreover, this is a significant concern for families, as family members no longer spend quality time together due to their preoccupation with computers. Parents often use the excuse, ""@CAPS1, I'm on the computer,"" and as a result, they neglect their children, who become deeply upset. This can lead to anger issues, and children may stop listening to their parents. It is a classic case of cause and effect. One of my friends on @NUM1 has developed anger problems and disregards everyone because her family never spends time together. Consequently, people spend the majority of their time indoors, glued to their computers. My sister, for instance, is constantly on the computer @NUM2 and never ventures outside to appreciate nature. People can develop a phobia of going outside, which is something we do not desire. Doctor @CAPS2 Brown advises that everyone should spend time outdoors to relax, preferably on a daily basis, as staying indoors is detrimental to one's well - being. Computers are undermining this objective. On the other hand, computers are indeed a remarkable device and can be extremely useful in certain situations, such as when one requires accurate directions or needs to obtain answers to questions. Sometimes, one simply wishes to reconnect with old friends. Computers have numerous beneficial applications, but excessive use is not conducive to our health. Lastly, I would like to emphasize that while computers serve a great purpose, they often provide us with excuses to avoid spending time with our families and enjoying the outdoors."
669	671	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I was astounded to learn that there are individuals who believe that computers do not contribute to the betterment of society. After hearing such a view, I felt compelled to share my perspectives. Computers are indeed beneficial to society. They facilitate communication, enable us to accomplish important tasks, and provide entertainment. Computers offer multiple avenues for communication. We all desire to interact with our friends, but it is not feasible to be in their presence at all times. The internet bridges this gap, allowing us to communicate with ease. Additionally, we have friends whom we do not see frequently, yet we still wish to stay in touch. Thanks to the internet, we can converse with them for as long as we like. Computers also assist us in making new friends. Moreover, computers are a source of amusement. There are numerous reasons why computers are enjoyable. Social networking platforms, such as Facebook and MySpace, are highly engaging. The internet offers a plethora of recreational activities, including video games. Many video game consoles are connected to the internet, enabling us to play with friends. However, computers are not merely for entertainment. They are essential for transferring crucial information, such as homework and details about after - school activities. Computers also store all government - related data, ranging from insignificant renovation plans for a town - owned building to sensitive information from the Department of Homeland Security in the United States. Without computers, none of this would be possible. This should convince you that computers are indispensable in our daily lives. From communication to performing important functions, computers have been and will continue to be of great assistance to us in the future.
670	672	1	1	"Dear Sir/Madam, My name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and I firmly believe that the impact of computers on individuals is unfavorable. I hold this view for several reasons. Firstly, computers have led to a sedentary lifestyle, as people no longer venture outdoors. Secondly, they have contributed to the deterioration of penmanship skills, particularly among students. Lastly, they have diminished people's enthusiasm for engaging in normal daily activities. They are making us indolent! Due to computers, people rarely go outside. They eschew going for walks because they are occupied with computer - related tasks. There is no longer any need to visit physical stores, as one can order virtually anything online and have it delivered to one's doorstep. Moreover, many individuals can work from home using their computers, eliminating the need for a daily commute. People can even complete high school and college education by taking online courses! This brings me to my next point regarding the negative impact of computers on people. Students can now type all their assignments, and some schools even provide laptops to students for year - long use. Since students can type everything, they rarely pick up a pen or pencil, resulting in poor handwriting due to lack of practice. Another detrimental effect of computers on students is related to the internet. The internet contains a vast amount of information, from math textbooks to dictionaries and other reference materials. As a result, some students are unaware of how to use a dictionary to look up a word, let alone find information in a physical book. I believe this gives students a false sense of reality. When they enter the workforce, not all tasks will be computer - based, but they are being trained primarily to use computers. Finally, people are losing their motivation to engage in daily activities. Why socialize with friends in person when one can chat with them online? Why dine out when one can order food online? People are beginning to see no purpose in going out and participating in activities because they perceive there are ""more important"" things to do on the computer. Personally, I think computers are having a mind - numbing effect on us, and soon the world may become overly reliant on them. Based on the aforementioned points, I conclude that computers do not have a positive impact on people. They are making the world a more restricted and controlled place, and I am certain you can understand my concerns."
671	673	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, do you think our engagement in exercise and immersion in nature is diminishing? In my view, I believe computers have a positive impact as they facilitate connections with individuals from diverse corners of the world. They enable us to learn various knowledge and acquire practical skills to simplify life, as well as maintain contact with distant relatives. Firstly, I hold the opinion that computers are beneficial because they allow us to interact with people globally. We can discuss their cultures, including marriage traditions, and gain insights into their educational systems by posing relevant questions. Secondly, computers are advantageous as they offer opportunities to learn new things and acquire skills that streamline daily life. With the aid of computers, we can better understand complex concepts and study effectively to excel in school. Thirdly, computers serve as a means to stay connected with far - flung relatives. When we haven't communicated with them for a long time, we can inquire about their well - being and catch up when we meet. In conclusion, technology will undoubtedly assist us in the future. The remarkable computer will help us maintain strong bonds with family and friends. Now, it's time to @CAPS3! for the advanced technology will endure for years to come.
672	674	1	1	Could one ever contemplate that a computer might consume excessive time or impede one from engaging in numerous activities? Does computer usage disrupt one's life in certain aspects? I would assert no. Computers have become an integral part of daily life; everyone either requires or utilizes them in some form. People rely on computers to access news when they miss it on @CAPS1, turning to the remarkable technology, namely the @CAPS2.C of laptops or internet - enabled phones. This has become a natural element of our lifestyle. The computer does not prevent us from going outdoors or participating in other activities; rather, it is our excessive fondness for this technology that makes us choose to remain online. So, is it the computer that disrupts someone's life, or is it a personal choice? The @CAPS2.C offers an array of wonderful capabilities. A computer can perform numerous tasks, making it difficult for us to tear ourselves away and engage in other pursuits. For instance, when we have a substantial amount of homework and a project to complete, we can work on it while listening to music. Although we may not be physically active outdoors, we are still engaged in activities that are beneficial for our future, such as improving typing speed for future employment and mastering the use of a @CAPS2.C. Since @CAPS2.Cs have been around for a long time, they have enhanced our intelligence and talent. Both children and adults can stay informed about global events. Technology has assisted many in times of urgency and for various tasks. Even @NUM1 - year - old individuals can conduct research on previously unknown topics and discover countless applications. Although some people spend long hours online, they should still interact with their families. Computers have a long - standing presence and will continue to be used daily. So, does a computer consume too much of a person's time, or is it simply an essential part of everyone's life?
673	675	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I contend that computers offer numerous benefits. For example, they can keep children off the streets, thus preventing them from getting into trouble. Computers are equipped with a plethora of games that can keep one occupied. Additionally, they feature Microsoft, a tool that aids in writing projects and similar tasks. Computers are highly beneficial as they not only provide games but also some of these games are educational, covering subjects like science, math, reading, and social studies. However, computers also pose risks. Most teenagers are inclined to visit Myspace, a platform where they can make friends worldwide, communicate with them, and share personal pictures. If one has friends from different states on Myspace, there is a risk that these strangers may attempt to locate and harm them. They may initiate conversations by asking for personal information such as name and address. Another drawback is that @NUM1 - graders in middle school may be exposed to inappropriate websites by @NUM2 - graders, leading them to get into trouble. Well, I have shared my perspective, and I hope you can understand it.
674	676	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 press, I am of the opinion that computers exert a detrimental influence on society. The reasons for this belief are three - fold. Firstly, children can experience what some term as “braindead” states. Secondly, they are at risk of becoming obese, a problem that is already on the rise. Thirdly, they may develop poor eyesight. The primary reason for the negative impact of computers on society is that children often sit idle, consuming food while using the computer, and become addicted to it. As a result, they gain weight due to a lack of physical exercise. The issue of childhood obesity is already a widely discussed topic, and the prevalence of computer use will not alleviate the situation in the near future. Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of children who spend more than an hour and a half on the computer daily are showing signs of cognitive decline. If this trend persists among all children, the next generation may lack the intellectual capacity to compete with other countries, causing our nation to fall behind. Therefore, we must address this issue if we wish for our country to remain competitive. Lastly, children are developing poor eyesight from excessive computer use. This can also have long - term consequences for future generations. If this trend continues, the entire generation may require glasses, creating a domino effect. In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on society as they contribute to childhood obesity, cognitive decline, and poor eyesight.
675	677	1	1	Dear local newspaper, in my perspective, individuals do utilize computers extensively. Some individuals show little concern for physical exercise or the appreciation of nature. Perhaps some lack friends, leading them to spend a significant amount of their time on the computer as they have a rather unfulfilled existence, or they may be drawn to addictive websites. For example, on @CAPS2.com, many people, especially children, have accounts. They use it to chat with friends or even romantic partners. In any case, this is my view. Another opinion I hold is that people should not allocate the majority of their time to computer use. I believe this because individuals should engage in enjoyable activities, socialize with others, and lead fulfilling lives. This encapsulates my thoughts regarding “Computers”.
676	678	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I opine that individuals are allocating an excessive amount of time to the computer, and here are my justifications. There is less time dedicated to physical exercise, appreciating nature, and interacting with friends and family. My first reason pertains to the diminished time for exercise. People are overly engrossed in computer games and virtual conversations. Do you not believe that one should be outdoors, engaging in physical activities such as jogging or playing sports, rather than idly sitting at home in front of the computer? People ought to engage in at least [NUM1] of exercise. One can use the computer for a brief period, but not [NUM2]. Take a respite from the computer and venture outside to relish the weather and the outdoors. It is truly astonishing that people cannot spare [NUM1] from their computer time. It is as if the computer has commandeered their minds, and all they desire is to remain glued to it. My second reason is the enjoyment of nature. Step outside briefly to observe the wonders around you. Take a stroll in the woods and search for animals or their tracks. There are numerous enjoyable activities outdoors, such as climbing a tree or going fruit - picking. One need not be indoors all day, fixated on the computer, playing games and chatting with friends. One could be outside, savoring the pleasant weather. People must recognize that there are more fulfilling ways to spend their time. My third reason is the importance of interacting with friends and family. It is crucial to allocate time to them, inquiring about their well - being and recent activities. However, people are often too preoccupied with the computer to converse with their family members. There are far more significant aspects of life, and people need to comprehend this. Family is of greater importance than being on the computer, yet nowadays, people relegate family to a secondary position as they are constantly squandering their time on the computer. Checking emails is acceptable, but wasting time on chat platforms like [CAPS1], [CAPS2], or [CAPS3] is a sheer waste. People can socialize in person instead of relying on the computer to communicate with friends. They could simply call and have a conversation. I am not opposed to using [CAPS2], but it does detract from quality time with family. I make an effort to balance time with friends, family, and nature, and I also exercise regularly. Hence, I fail to understand why it is so arduous for others to do the same. In conclusion, I firmly believe that people squander an inordinate amount of time on the computer. As previously mentioned, there are more important aspects of life, such as exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with friends and family. I sincerely hope you will consider my perspectives. Thank you for listening to my thoughts. I hope people can realize that they do not need to be on the computer [NUM4].
677	679	1	1	Could you endure a day without a computer? I communicate with my friends daily via [CAPS1]. I stay informed about current events that would otherwise remain unknown without the aid of a computer. A computer also facilitates my daily routine. I am aware that I should venture outside and meet my friends in person, yet during inclement weather, such as rain or snow, I prefer to interact with them online. Another advantage of online communication is the ability to converse with all my friends, not just those in my immediate vicinity. I have noticed that even when my friends are away, they can maintain contact through their computers. Not only can one stay connected with friends, but also keep abreast of current affairs. Whenever I access [CAPS1] [CAPS2], my [ORGANIZATION1] page presents me with the latest news. Without a computer, I would be oblivious to the outcome of last night's ball game or the developments regarding the healthcare bill. These are vital pieces of information that enable me to stay informed about events beyond my local area. A computer also allows me to delve deeper into the details of the healthcare bill and understand its implications for me. In addition to keeping me informed about current events, a computer is an indispensable tool in my daily life. While having breakfast, I check my emails and review the weather forecast. During school hours, I type my essays. Upon returning home, I check my homework and chat with my friends online. All these tasks are accomplished using a computer. This clearly demonstrates the extent of my daily computer usage. I rely so heavily on my computer that I would be disoriented without it, and my productivity would be significantly reduced. I firmly believe that computers have become a necessity. They enable me to communicate with friends when face - to - face meetings are not feasible and keep me updated on current events. I am convinced that computers have become an integral part of our daily lives.
678	680	1	1	Dear [CAPS1] representative, [CAPS2], would you advocate for people to be glued to computers all day, achieving nothing? How would you feel if no one engaged in physical exercise and the playgrounds, parks, and beaches remained deserted? Everyone would be sitting at home, engrossed in their fancy new computers. When one contemplates the amount of time people spend idly sitting around, [CAPS2], can a computer resolve this issue? Certainly not. This is my stance on computer usage: people spend an excessive amount of time on computers. Regular exercise is essential for the body, yet it seems that the mention of exercise causes people to tune out. This phenomenon occurs because people are increasingly dedicating large chunks of time to computers. If they work on computers for extended periods during the day and then return home to spend more time on them, [CAPS5], what impact does this have on the body? It is certainly not beneficial. I appreciate computers and enjoy using them, but sometimes, when I need to complete a task, I become so engrossed that I lose track of time, which is frustrating. This often happens to people. They become so absorbed in their computers that when someone is speaking to them and assigning a task, they nod as if they understand, but when asked later if the task was completed, it becomes evident that they were not paying attention. Exercise is crucial for the body and does not have to be overly strenuous. People should not waste their time on computers. This problem affects [NUM1] to [NUM2] individuals or families. After returning from work or school, they immediately turn to their computers, neglecting both exercise and quality time with family. Exercise can keep one healthy, unlike excessive use of electronics. Computers are like mind - controlling robots that drain the life out of people. They strain the eyes, make one irritable, and reduce the motivation to engage in other activities. Perhaps if people spent less time on computers and more time focusing on family and nature, they would not feel so weak and fatigued. I understand that many people do not want computers to be banned, but I believe it would be beneficial for numerous reasons. It would strengthen family bonds and improve physical health. From my experience, computers do have their uses, but in real - life situations, their benefits are limited. I hope you understand why I express these views. If you genuinely care about health and physical activities, [CAPS5], you would concur that computers are not as helpful as they seem.
679	681	1	1	Dear [CAPS1], [CAPS2], I wish to inform you that an increasing number of people are prioritizing computer usage over spending time with their families. I acknowledge the positive effects of computers on people. Firstly, they provide access to a vast amount of information. Secondly, they facilitate interaction with others. Thirdly, they keep us updated on various aspects, including sports. My first rationale for advocating computer use is the wealth of information they offer. They provide weather reports, details about school openings, delays, and closures. They also inform us about the situation in [LOCATION1] after the earthquake. Computers allow us to visit multiple websites to gather information and offer entertainment through online games. They can assist with homework and help us find jobs and other resources. My second reason is the ability to interact with people. We can communicate with individuals we have never met before, learn about their lives, and gain insights into their experiences. Computers are also valuable tools for law enforcement, enabling them to gather information about criminals and track them down. Online communication is more efficient and faster than using the phone. It also provides entertainment, which often leads people to spend extended periods on the computer. My third reason is the role of computers in keeping us updated on sports. For sports enthusiasts, they offer the latest news on teams and players. One can even watch live games on the computer. Additionally, fans have the opportunity to post comments and interact with players. In conclusion, computers are indispensable as they offer global information, enable interaction with strangers, and keep us informed about our favorite sports, especially for sports fanatics.
680	682	1	1	As the number of computer users continues to grow, I contend that this trend does not benefit society. This is due to several factors: an increase in suicide cases resulting from online bullying, the rise of obesity as people become overly addicted to computers and neglect exercise, and the negative impact on the environment. In today's digital age, bullying has taken on a new form. Bullies now create web pages, send threatening emails, and make online threats, behavior that they might not exhibit in person. The anonymity of the internet emboldens them to say things they would otherwise refrain from. Shockingly, [PERCENT1] of teenage suicides are attributed to online bullying. Bullies can deeply affect their victims' mental state, leading to self - harm. If fewer people were online, the youth would be better protected from online predators. When one spends hours on the computer, chatting with friends or playing games, it often coincides with periods of inactivity. Many obese individuals claim that they do not exercise because they are either too tired or lack the time. However, sitting in front of a computer screen for hours is bound to cause fatigue. It is illogical that they claim to have no time for exercise while spending an hour a day on the computer. Obesity has become a significant concern as it is a leading cause of heart problems. People need to get active. The environment is also a pressing issue. With the increase in toxic substances, the depletion of the [CAPS1] layer, and the rise of skin cancer, the role of computers cannot be ignored. Computers consume energy and release toxic substances into the environment, contributing to the destruction of the [CAPS1] layer. This depletion has far - reaching consequences, as it exposes people to harmful radiation. Although plants and trees help to protect the [CAPS1] layer, the demand for paper due to printing and the consumption needs of [CAPS3] animals pose a challenge. Without sufficient trees and plants, the food chain is disrupted. By the time our descendants arrive, there may be little wildlife left, and the [CAPS1] layer may be severely damaged, leading to an increase in skin cancer cases. All these problems stem from our excessive addiction to computers. The well - being of people, their health, and the environment are all negatively affected by computer use. Imagine walking into your child's room and finding them dead due to online bullying, or seeing a loved one suffer from heart problems because of obesity caused by excessive computer use. In about [NUM1] years, the [CAPS1] layer could be completely destroyed, and wildlife could be on the verge of extinction. While computers offer quick access to information, there are also traditional books. A computer has similar resources to a local library. People should stop being lazy and take action. We need to put an end to suicides, obesity, and environmental damage caused by excessive computer use.
681	683	1	1	In this contemporary world, computers are indispensable. They proffer numerous advantages, including communication, entertainment, and education. These benefits exert positive influences on individuals across the globe, which is why I advocate for technological advancements. Communication is a significant boon provided by computers. Whether one is maintaining contact with friends or organizing business meetings, computers offer substantial assistance. With the state - of - the - art technology integrated into computers, individuals can instantaneously transmit messages to colleagues or friends within seconds. In certain instances, businesses entirely depend on computers to operate; for example, to engage in conversations with individuals worldwide to deliberate on international expansion. Computers are highly essential for people to communicate and enable them to formulate plans simply and effectively. Computers also furnish an inexhaustible source of entertainment. Through the internet, computers offer users websites that allow them to converse with friends, watch videos, play games, and more. The computer presents a relaxing means of self - enjoyment during late nights or rainy days. It enables people to remain entertained and relaxed when necessary. The most crucial function of the computer is in the realm of education. The computer supplies users or students with a wide array of information. It aids users with extensive knowledge on every subject or topic that may be raised in a classroom. It proves extremely useful for research projects or even for learning a new language. The computer is highly beneficial when it comes to education. The computer is a technology that has simplified daily life. It has become integrated with almost any daily task that may occur during the day. It would be unjust to halt progress in this technological marvel. The computer is a technology that significantly benefits our communication, entertainment, and education.
682	684	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I wish to expound on the topic of the impacts that computers have on individuals. My perspective on this topic is that computers indeed have an effect on people. Most individuals, while browsing the internet, fail to monitor the passage of time. What I mean by most people losing track of time is that they attempt to keep tabs on time, yet while online, something may suddenly emerge that piques their interest, and simultaneously, their focus is diverted elsewhere. Some of the other effects that computers can have on people include confining them indoors. When numerous individuals are online, they tend to exercise less. When indoors and online, most people who usually exercise cease doing so. The reason this occurs is that while sitting in front of the computer, one feels so relaxed and tranquil that they do not wish to get up. This leads to the consumption of unhealthy foods, such as chips, donuts, Twinkies, and so on. Some individuals do not consider this an opinion. The reason I state this is that while watching television the other day, I saw a commercial that stated, ""Individuals who are more active are healthier than those who remain on the computer all day."" Most individuals do gain weight while using the computer because they are not physically active. Lack of physical activity can lead to A) obesity, B) clogged arteries, or C) lethargy. It can lead to all three because these are the consequences of being on a computer throughout the day. Most individuals should be appreciating nature instead of remaining glued to the computer. There is far more to life than being online. For instance, playing sports. Not only is playing sports enjoyable, but it is also healthy. Would you rather live to [NUM1] or live to [NUM2]? And so, local newspaper, that is why I am writing this letter today. I mean, would you rather have friends or be lonely? There are weight - loss surgeries, but they can cost thousands of dollars. And yes, weight - loss surgery does have side effects, such as death. So, come on [LOCATION1], it's your decision, and remember the most important aspect of this letter, which is the choice between living healthily and youthfully or dying unhealthily and suffering. It's your choice, [LOCATION1], decide."
683	685	1	1	Computers confer significant benefits upon society. They enable individuals to communicate with others and provide diverse means to access the latest updates. Firstly, they facilitate chatting with friends and allow messaging at any desired time. One can communicate with people who are far away. For example, if your friend resides on the other side of the globe, you can utilize your computer to send messages and thus maintain constant communication with them. Moreover, when one is bored, the computer offers something to do. One can check if anyone wishes to make plans to socialize. And even if one desires to stay home all day, interaction with others is still possible. Secondly, computers inspire novel ideas. They disseminate opinions. Suppose someone purchased the same item and it did not function as expected; you can peruse the comments and reviews. Would you want to spend your money on something that does not work? I certainly would not. You can also discern whether the majority of people are satisfied with what they have acquired. Additionally, computers prompt you to contemplate things you might not have considered previously. Say you had a negative opinion about something being terrible; perhaps if you read the relevant online page, it will reveal what you did wrong or what you overlooked. It provides the opportunity to try something you might enjoy. Lastly, computers provide the latest updates. They can inform you if a schedule is canceled, delayed, or open. You do not have to wait for the news to broadcast such information. They can also notify you about crimes taking place. Moreover, they offer details about your town. Who does not want to know what is happening in their own community? They inform you about new developments in your town, what is being constructed, or what is being removed. Computers allow us to chat with friends and family. They evoke thoughts we might never have had before and keep us informed of the latest news.
684	686	1	1	Do you ever find yourself with the leisure to read? Do you ever allocate time to be in the company of your family? Or do you ever have the opportunity to venture outdoors? Well, if not, it is because you squander an excessive amount of time on the computer. Computers are detrimental to society, and I shall elucidate the reasons. There are numerous excellent activities you can engage in, such as reading a book. Instead of reading on the computer, peruse a novel. You can request your parents to drive you to the library. I comprehend that if you need to conduct research, you can do so on the computer. However, the library houses an array of books, including fiction, non - fiction, science books, and many more. Every discerning citizen would acknowledge that computer sources may contain inaccurate information. I recall when I was working on a project about [ORGANIZATION1], a pioneer of [CAPS3] music. I used the computer to research who killed her, and it indicated that a man was the culprit. I visited the library and checked out a book on her, which actually stated that a woman had killed her. Additionally, books assist you in obtaining more accurate facts. Every affectionate and caring individual values spending time with their family. How can you increase the time you spend with your family? Well, you can visit some cousins on the weekends. Your family can host parties. I remember having a party for my baby brother's baptism; everyone attended. I got to see my aunts and cousins whom I had not seen in years. I understand that if you have a distant relative, you might use the computer to chat with them or see them via webcam. However, why not take a vacation to where they live and travel by car? This would bring the family even closer. I am familiar with what that is like. My family resides in [LOCATION2], and I visit them annually. We have family reunions; perhaps your family can do the same. Consequently, family is of great importance, so do not let the computer ruin yours. Do you ever go outside anymore? Is the computer impeding you? You have to check your email, reply, tend to your [CAPS4] as it is hungry, and carry out your daily activities. What about your health? Fresh air can be beneficial. There are numerous wonderful things you can do outdoors. For example, you can jump rope, go to the park, swim, play in the snow, and more. I remember the time my cousin came over, and we went to the park. We stayed there until the park closed. It was highly entertaining. Every citizen in [LOCATION1] desires to be healthy. Going outside can aid you; running through the woods or even jump - roping is an outdoor activity that involves exercise. Additionally, simply going outside can yield more benefits. Now is the time. Why delay another minute? You can either be alone with the computer or be outdoors or in the company of your family. Even the library is not a lonely place. Computers are a bad habit. Although we may need them, it is better to be safe than sorry and revert to the traditional way.
685	687	1	1	Dear Newspaper, it has come to my attention that there is an ongoing debate regarding the issue of whether computers benefit society, and not everyone concurs. I am unable to fathom why. Computers present numerous opportunities for individuals. They enable people to communicate with one another, conduct research on topics in a more straightforward manner, and enhance hand - eye coordination. This is why I am of the opinion that computers do benefit society. In the contemporary world, nearly all businesses rely on communication. Many individuals in these businesses utilize not only phones but also computers for communication. Online communication is a rapid, simple, and effective means for people to interact, whether they are at home or at work. This is one way in which computers benefit society as a whole. No one possesses all knowledge; we are constantly seeking to discover new things. Sometimes we may use books, but the most common method is online research. This is because it is not only faster but also simpler. When you conduct online research, the information is literally at your fingertips. All you need to do is type in a subject. This is another reason why computers are beneficial to society. The final reason is that computers teach hand - eye coordination. This is evident as, over time, while using the computer, you notice that typing becomes easier. It may take some time, but eventually, people become proficient. It is as if the computer allows you to teach yourself. Some people claim that individuals spend too much time on computers. However, this is not a problem because people need to spend extended periods on computers to engage in the beneficial activities that computers offer. In conclusion, it is evident that I have clearly outlined the benefits of computers. They enable us to communicate, conduct research, and improve our hand - eye coordination. This is why computers do benefit society.
686	688	1	1	Dear newspaper editor, With profound respect for those who opine that the computer does not contribute to society, I firmly dissent. Indeed, numerous individuals neglect other pursuits in favor of computer usage, and it is true that many rely heavily on this invention. However, the computer is also an innovation from which we can reap numerous positive benefits. For instance, @CAPS1' @PERSON1, a renowned hip - hop artist with a vast fan base, was unable to complete high school or attend college due to his career. When he decided to obtain a college degree, he enrolled in a college. Nevertheless, he faced difficulties on campus as he was constantly harassed by his fans. Consequently, he opted for online college, enabling him to focus on his studies and earn his degree without the distraction. Moreover, the computer offers internet - based websites utilized in educational institutions. These platforms facilitate student learning in an engaging manner, providing a more enriching educational experience. In addition to the internet's positive applications, the computer also houses programs that are equally beneficial. Microsoft @CAPS2, for example, is a software used to create @CAPS2 documents such as poems, essays, song lyrics, and even letters. These documents can be printed for personal keepsakes or sharing, or saved on the computer if unfinished. People employ the computer for a multitude of purposes, including accessing books, movies, and more. Over the years of its existence, it has significantly benefited us. What is your stance on this matter?
687	689	1	1	"Imagine having a family member you haven't seen in an extended period, yet lack the financial means to visit them due to their distant location. Or perhaps you're injured or ill, with nothing to do, so you decide to browse the internet and unexpectedly discover fascinating information, such as a newly - discovered organism by scientists or an unknown historical event. Remarkably, the computer is a repository of such knowledge. You can communicate with family members you've either never met or haven't seen in a long while. Moreover, you can gain extensive knowledge about nature and history that you'd never encounter by simply stepping outside. To further illustrate, I have a half - sister whom I see only once a year or once every two years. Our primary mode of interaction is through Facebook. There are also various websites like Twitter, MySpace, Yearbook, AIM, Skype, etc., that people use to connect with loved ones. Not only can you engage in text conversations, but you can also have webcam chats to see them. Many individuals utilize webchat to reconnect with old friends. While using the computer, you can also acquire new knowledge. Yesterday, while on the computer, I grew bored and conducted some random searches. In just @NUM1 minutes, I learned about events I'd never heard of, such as the ""@CAPS1 massacre"" and the tragic incident when a teacher first boarded a spaceship that exploded. It was truly a heart - wrenching event! If you're interested in nature, you can explore the diverse natural phenomena around the world. Additionally, if ancient history fascinates you, a few keystrokes can unveil a wealth of captivating information, like the story of @PERSON1, the lost and then rediscovered city. I'm certain you couldn't obtain such knowledge by going outdoors. The computer's capabilities are truly astonishing! It allows you to communicate with family and friends you may not have seen for decades and learn captivating facts. It's often exciting because you can discover things your teacher may not know. Would you prefer to be taught by your teacher or to teach your teacher?"
688	690	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I am of the conviction that computers are beneficial to society. Individuals can engage in reading, shopping, and gaming online, which simplifies life for many. Purchasing books can be costly, but the internet enables people to access a vast array of books directly on their computers. A recent survey revealed that those who read books online save an additional @MONEY1 annually compared to book - buyers. People can also access newspapers online. In the event of snow on the ground, preventing them from obtaining a physical newspaper, they can still stay informed by reading it online. This way, they can assess the newspaper's quality and decide whether to continue subscribing, including to the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. Furthermore, online shopping is a convenient option. Occasionally, someone may be involved in an accident and confined to home. If it's a child, their parents may be unable to go to the store as they need to care for the child. In such cases, they can simply use the computer to have food and other essentials delivered. Busy individuals with work or school commitments can also take advantage of this service. @PERSON1, a medical professional, informed me that online shoppers experience @PERCENT1 less stress than those who visit physical stores. He attributed this to the fact that online shopping eliminates the need to set aside a significant amount of time from one's schedule. Additionally, the computer is an excellent platform for quick gaming. Young children are often energetic and noisy. Parents can allow them to play games and read on the computer, which can keep them quiet and occupied. Even typing can be an engaging activity for younger kids. Older children have a wide range of games to choose from, including action, strategy, and puzzle games. They can also compete with players from around the world. The computer offers entertainment for everyone. In conclusion, the computer is an ideal platform for shopping, reading, and gaming, and it significantly aids modern families.
689	691	1	1	My perspective on the impacts of computers on individuals: One positive effect of computers is that they enhance hand - eye coordination. This skill is particularly beneficial for professionals such as doctors, enabling them to perform better in their occupations. Another advantage is that computers facilitate communication with family members. For example, if your family travels to another country, you can stay updated on their well - being and experiences. Moreover, computers provide access to information about different states and countries. They can tell you about the population and cultural characteristics of various regions. For instance, when I want to learn about Texas, I can search for details such as its founding date, capital city, and population. Additionally, computers allow you to play various games with friends, including shooting, racing, sports, and arcade games.
690	692	1	1	I do not believe that computers have the most positive influence. Most computers are not as intelligent as one might expect. While they can be helpful when working on projects, such as searching for pictures or using the calculator for math problems, they do not assist with all academic subjects. They only offer support in a few areas, which is the primary reason I use them. Sometimes, when doing homework, I rely on the computer to make the task easier. I search for websites on it, and it provides useful resources. This is why most people use computers; they primarily use them to search for jobs, cars, or houses. However, some individuals are averse to using the internet as they consider it a form of cheating. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, their positive impact is limited, and there are valid concerns about their over - reliance.
691	693	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, in one's perspective regarding computers and their societal benefits today, the effects of computers on people are multifaceted and highly advantageous. For instance, they enable global communication. In @MONTH1, numerous individuals have friends or family residing in different states or countries, and computers facilitate seamless interaction with them. Moreover, computers serve as invaluable educational tools, offering knowledge beyond the scope of traditional books. They can assist in learning about diverse subjects, such as population studies. While some may perceive communication via computers as slow, the reality is that they allow for instant email exchanges. Computers have revolutionized society in countless ways, offering benefits that were once deemed impossible. Prior to the advent of computers and printers, typewriters were the norm. Any error necessitated starting from scratch, a time - consuming process that could take hours. In the modern era, a simple press of the backspace key on the keyboard eliminates the need to retype entire paragraphs, significantly reducing the time required to complete a page. Thus, computers have enhanced our lives in ways we may not fully appreciate. In conclusion, computers empower us to accomplish tasks that were unattainable before their invention. They are a remarkable innovation that continues to benefit humanity, and their setup is relatively straightforward. In essence, computers are a boon to society and mankind.
692	694	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I am firmly of the opinion that computers confer substantial benefits upon society. I hold this view for a multitude of reasons, which I shall expound upon in this discourse. Although some individuals may spend an inordinate amount of time on computers, this does not imply that computers are detrimental to society; rather, it indicates a need for people to manage their time more judiciously. Overall, I contend that computers exert a positive influence on society. One of the primary reasons for my support of computers is their status as a monumental technological advancement. They streamline daily life by enabling the storage of information, facilitating learning about various locales, and fostering communication with friends and family. The ability of a single device to perform these diverse functions is truly remarkable. Moreover, the development of computers suggests the vast potential for further technological progress. They are merely the vanguard of a new era of innovation. Another compelling reason for my belief in the benefits of computers is their role as a source of entertainment. They offer the opportunity to watch movies and download engaging games, providing almost limitless possibilities for amusement. Even when inclement weather confines one indoors, a computer can serve as a reliable source of entertainment. Those who argue that excessive computer use is harmful to society are misguided. A computer does not coerce individuals into spending excessive time on it; the choice lies with the user. One always has the option to engage in outdoor activities, such as taking a walk. Computers are only detrimental if misused, akin to the adage “guns don't kill people, people do.” In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are an indispensable asset in modern society. They represent one of the greatest technological achievements and continue to contribute significantly to the betterment of society. Therefore, if you are contemplating the purchase of a computer, I wholeheartedly recommend that you do so.
693	695	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am convinced that computers have a profoundly positive impact on individuals. This conviction is grounded in several key factors: the availability of numerous homework - assistance websites, the capacity to explore unfamiliar places, and the ability to interact with people across the globe. Firstly, computers offer a valuable resource for students struggling with their studies. There are a plethora of homework - helper websites that provide tutoring services. I recall my experience in @NUM1 grade when I was grappling with a math mid - term. By accessing a tutoring website, I was able to overcome my difficulties and gain a better understanding of the subject. This demonstrates that computers can play a crucial role in helping students achieve academic success. Secondly, computers serve as a window to the world, enabling users to learn about distant places. This is particularly useful for school projects on foreign countries. In fact, @PERCENT1 of students in my school have attested to the significant assistance provided by computers in their schoolwork. Additionally, computers can be invaluable when planning a vacation. By conducting an online search, one can access detailed information and images of a destination, facilitating an informed decision. Finally, computers enhance social connectivity by allowing individuals to interact with people worldwide. I have a brother living in Florida, and thanks to computers, I can communicate with him daily. Moreover, I can stay in touch with my friends at any time, which I believe contributes to the development of better social skills. In conclusion, computers have a positive influence on people, enabling them to attain better grades, acquire new knowledge, and maintain social relationships.
694	696	1	1	Dear editor of The @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are a valuable addition to our community. In situations where the library is closed and a student requires information, the internet on a computer can serve as an accessible alternative. Additionally, when a phone malfunctions, computers provide a means of communication with friends. Moreover, they can keep people informed about the latest news when the television experiences technical issues. Firstly, computers are highly effective research tools. Consider a scenario where it is raining heavily, your car is running out of gas, and you need to visit the library before it closes. It would be far more convenient to conduct research on a computer. This not only saves fuel but also allows you to stay comfortably at home, perhaps wrapped in a robe and sipping hot chocolate while accessing information. Secondly, computers facilitate communication with friends in other countries without incurring the high costs associated with long - distance calls. If you do not have an unlimited calling plan, using a computer for communication can prevent the wastage of valuable minutes and money. You can simply open a chat window and engage in conversation effortlessly. Finally, computers enable users to access the latest news and information through search programs like @ORGANIZATION1. In the event that your television breaks and takes a week to repair, you can still stay informed by searching for news online. Thank you for considering my ideas, editor. I sincerely hope that you will select my article for publication in your newspaper when the opportunity arises.
695	697	1	1	Fairfield @CAPS1 @CAPS2, do computers have a detrimental effect on people? Opinions on this matter are divided, with many advocating “yes” and others “no.” As a matter of fact, computers @CAPS2 do have a negative impact. People are prone to distraction when using computers, which leads to time wastage and stress. Many students who @CAPS2 their homework on computers find themselves easily distracted. The internet, which accompanies computers, offers a plethora of games and social networking sites. Many students, including myself, would rather engage in social media conversations on Facebook than @CAPS2 their homework using an online book. When I return home, I attempt to use the online textbook for my math class. However, during the loading time, I become bored and navigate to online game websites. Subsequently, I become engrossed in an addictive game called “@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1.” After spending @NUM2 hours playing online games, I realize that I have squandered a significant amount of time that could have been devoted to my math homework. Given that @PERCENT1 of my math grade is based on homework, my grade has dropped from a @CAPS4 to a @CAPS5+. Moreover, the time spent on the computer could be better utilized outdoors. The outdoors offer as much, if not more, enjoyment than the game “@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1.” I would much rather play football with my friends than engage in such a game. My parents have recognized my excessive computer use and have blocked the internet. Distracting games not only waste time but also cause stress, which can have serious consequences. I once saw a report on @ORGANIZATION1 stating that @NUM4 people died after playing on the computer for over @NUM2 days with minimal food and water. My parents have also noticed that my brother and I become irritable after extended computer use, and I have been experiencing stress recently. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people. Distracting games are a waste of time and a source of stress. It is hoped that people will heed this message and limit their computer usage.
696	698	1	1	Dear Whom It May Concern: I opine that computers are highly effective; however, they also have their drawbacks. Would you prefer your children to be engrossed in computers, or would you rather they engage in less desirable activities such as smoking or loitering on the streets excessively? Undoubtedly, computers exert a significant influence on them. In my estimation, computers can be extremely addictive, yet this is not the case for everyone. There are individuals who dislike spending extended periods on computers as it becomes tedious and can cause eye strain. I can empathize if children are reluctant to disengage from computers after their bedtime. Many children engage in unwholesome activities outdoors and spend a great deal of time on the streets. Nevertheless, using computers can deter some of them from such behavior. Numerous children have accounts on platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and more. These platforms serve as excellent means to maintain contact with family and friends, which is one of the primary reasons children use them. Moreover, there are other electronic devices, such as the PSP Go, Xbox @NUM1, DS, DSi, PlayStation @NUM2, and @NUM3, that discourage children from exercising. Hence, I believe that while computers can be addictive and have an impact on children, there are alternative activities that can divert them from excessive computer use.
697	699	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 Society: Computers are arguably among the most significant advancements in our society's pursuit of knowledge over the past few decades. These technological marvels are akin to sentient beings, possessing their own intelligence and the ability to solve a wide array of problems. People across the globe, from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, utilize computers. They are employed by individuals of all ages, from school - aged children to professionals as esteemed as chemists. Do you wish to remain on the sidelines, mired in the past, and fail to keep pace with technological progress? In the development of rockets, engines, and planes, computers have consistently proven reliable. However, the question remains: will computerized technology enhance our society or lead to its downfall? Since the @DATE1, computers have served as a medium for disseminating new information. The speed at which they can acquire and process new data is truly remarkable! @CAPS2 @PERSON2, a computer engineer, asserts, ""With the technology derived from computers, we can stay competitive."" @CAPS2 exemplifies one of the most significant advantages of computers: their capacity to present the most up - to - date information. I recognize that books are an invaluable resource in society, offering a wealth of knowledge. Nevertheless, the publication process for books can span years. With a computer, information that occurred as recently as @NUM1 hours ago can be available on the internet. This not only enables faster access to information but also helps our society stay competitive. Just as hand - eye coordination is essential for catching a football, tracking a baseball, or grasping a basketball, it is a crucial aspect of life. Everyone needs it! Therefore, why not enhance this skill by purchasing a computer? Imagine the progress our society could make in sports and daily life if individuals learn to coordinate themselves. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people who owned a computer and typed daily were able to catch all three tennis balls thrown at them? You could achieve the same! When typing on a computer, human development observers note that your eyes focus on the screen while your hands learn to navigate the keys independently. This is similar to training your hand to track the bounce of a basketball without consciously having to catch it. I recall that after starting to type on a computer, my hands could find the keys instinctively. The next day at basketball practice, I felt as proficient as @CAPS3 amazing point - guard @PERSON1. When typing, your eyes follow the screen, and your hands learn to move across the keys, much like training your hand to track a bouncing ball. By investing in a computer, you can develop this essential skill. Currently, money is a vital aspect of our society. Given the relatively low profits and wages in our local area, purchasing computers at prices as high as @MONEY1 each can be challenging. However, consider the savings. Publishing books takes a long time, but with a computer, information can be accessed almost instantaneously. Information that occurred @NUM1 hours ago can be on the internet. This not only speeds up information access but also saves costs. Our neighboring society of @LOCATION3 invested in over @NUM6 computers. They reported that it took only @NUM7 months to recoup the investment through savings on book purchases. Imagine the financial benefits our society could reap after @NUM8 years! It is imperative for our society to embrace computers. They not only facilitate the development of hand - eye coordination but also offer financial advantages. In a world where information is constantly evolving, the ability to access the latest data through computers is crucial. Without them, our society may lag behind. The future of technological advancement depends on our ability to harness the power of computers. The decision is yours; choose wisely as the fate of our society hangs in the balance."
698	700	1	1	"Dear Newspaper: I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to our society, and there are numerous compelling reasons to support this view. Firstly, computers simplify our lives and enable us to better comprehend the world around us. Without computers, communicating with others without relying solely on phones and disseminating news would be extremely challenging. Computers enhance our daily lives in multiple ways. For instance, if you require a doctor's permission to participate in a sport, sending an email to the doctor and receiving a confirmation email that can be presented to the sports team is far more convenient. Moreover, computers serve as a vast repository of knowledge, allowing us to explore various aspects of our world. We can access news websites on the internet to check the weather and plan our day accordingly. Additionally, we can stay updated on the latest technological advancements, such as the ""iPhone"" or ""@CAPS1"". There are individuals in the world who do not have access to a computer. For example, my uncle serves in the Air Force, and the only way we can communicate with him is through the computer since phones are not permitted. Furthermore, when someone has good news to share with a large number of people, sending an email and forwarding it is a quick and efficient method. I sincerely hope that you understand why I believe computers are an indispensable part of modern society. They streamline our lives, deepen our understanding of the world, and facilitate communication with people across the globe. I trust that you will concur with my perspective."
699	701	1	1	@ORGANIZATION2, over the past few decades, technology has witnessed remarkable development. It has significantly contributed to human progress, from the construction of buildings to the creation of novel inventions. However, a growing concern has emerged regarding whether its overall impact is beneficial. Some argue that people become more indolent due to the numerous conveniences technology offers. In my view, technology brings about more advantages than disadvantages. We have acquired a vast amount of knowledge from it. Computers are a testament to human ingenuity, demonstrating what mankind is capable of achieving. They also allow us to learn about diverse cultures. Students utilize computers for studying and enhancing the quality of their projects. I consulted @CAPS1 @PERSON3 of @ORGANIZATION1 regarding this concern. He posits that technology can expand our knowledge base. There is also concern about the excessive amount of paper wasted each year. Computers offer a solution to this problem by making it more feasible to adopt environmentally friendly practices. For example, instead of using copious amounts of paper for long essays, we can create presentations on computers. We can also conduct tests on computers. I anticipate that the future will be predominantly computer - based. Electronic communication, such as email, has replaced traditional letter - writing. For instance, my friend @PERSON2 mentioned that her school has transitioned to a paperless environment, relying solely on computers. This shift has resulted in significant savings in terms of both money and paper through the use of presentations and other digital tools. I miss my family in @LOCATION1. I yearn to see them, not just through phone conversations. The computer enables me to have face - to - face interactions with them. I surveyed @NUM1 people to determine whether they preferred using computers or phones to communicate with their families. @NUM2 out of @NUM1 respondents indicated a preference for computers. While I advocate for the benefits of computers, I acknowledge that they have their drawbacks. Computer games can be highly addictive, causing people to waste excessive amounts of time. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION3 remarks that the proliferation of computer games is a cause for concern. In conclusion, despite the negative impact of computer games, computers will continue to play a crucial role in our lives and bring about substantial benefits in the long run. I hope that my perspective, as an independent observer, has been persuasive.
700	702	1	1	In my view, computers can be helpful, yet individuals should not overuse them. Instead, people should engage in physical exercise, interact with family members, and appreciate nature. Physical exercise is of greater importance than computer use as it promotes good health and reduces the likelihood of illness. Interacting with family is also crucial, as family support is more reliable than that of virtual friends. Online friendships may not be genuine, while family members are always there in times of need. Moreover, enjoying nature is a rewarding experience that can prevent boredom. When one is outdoors, immersed in the beauty of nature, the temptation to use a computer fades away. Therefore, I believe that computers should be used primarily for checking emails or researching information that one wishes to learn.
701	703	1	1	Dear esteemed local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers offer substantial assistance to society. Allow me to expound upon my perspectives and notions. I am hopeful that after perusing this, you will concur with me. Initially, I wish to highlight that my primary topic is communication. Computers enable us to engage in discourse with ordinary individuals or those across the globe! There exist numerous means of communication, including text, speech, and webcam. It is not as though communication is unfeasible; there are typically hundreds of communication clients and servers online (@NUM1). Thus, you will always be able to connect with someone. Secondly, computers possess an excellent capacity for creation. On a computer, one can program (@CAPS3), design presentations, documents, drawings, maps, graphs, and virtually anything one can conceive. Information can be gathered from servers, websites, (@CAPS1), (@CAPS2), (@CAPS3), facilitating extensive learning and creation on an everyday computer. I am not finished! There are also (@CAPS4), (@CAPS5), (@CAPS6), and reading - related book sites available on the web. This presents an opportunity for web - searchers to access a vast amount of information and learn significantly more in daily life. Finally, computers offer a wide array of entertainment options. There are numerous choices, such as videos, movies, (@CAPS18), (@CAPS1), and games, suitable for the computer's user or users. While playing a game, a user (@MONTH1) can converse with friends, as in a (@CAPS8 @CAPS9) game, for example, (@CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12) online, a (@CAPS13 @CAPS14) game. These types of games are highly appealing to entertainment enthusiasts due to the immense enjoyment they can derive while playing a (@CAPS8 @CAPS9). Another form of entertainment is videos. People can watch videos and movies on video - centric websites with databases containing not thousands but millions of videos and movies. Whatever the user desires is merely a text input and a click away! The last type of entertainment is (@CAPS1) and (@CAPS18), which allow users to engage in daily activities or communicate with friends, family, or relatives. In summary, I earnestly hope that you, the local newspaper, will agree that computers are beneficial to society. Please reconsider and make the appropriate (@CAPS2) choice.
702	704	1	1	"Dear (@CAPS1), I consider this to be an excellent idea as it allows one to play games, communicate with family or friends, and listen to music. My first rationale pertains to game - playing. When you find yourself bored and with nothing to do, the computer provides a viable option to play various games, such as car games, shooting games, and arcade games as well. You can engage in these activities either when you are bored or simply wish to use the computer. My second reason is the ability to communicate with friends or family. If your siblings or other family members reside in a different state and you desire to converse or see them, all you need to do is inquire, ""(@CAPS2), what is your email address?"" Subsequently, if they have a MySpace or Facebook account, you can communicate with them for as long as you like. You can also interact with your friends on these platforms. My third reason is music - listening. You can listen to music on your computer by visiting (@CAPS3) or downloading applications like FrostWire. You can access a wide range of music genres, including hip - hop, rap rock, or heavy rock. To listen to a specific song, you will need both the song's name and, preferably, the artist's name. In this (@CAPS2), I believe they should incorporate and select an appropriate (@CAPS2)."
703	705	1	1	Which is more enjoyable: fixating on a blank computer screen all day or spending the day in the beautiful embrace of nature with friends and family? Well, if you are uncertain, I am not. I conducted a survey at my school using the exact same question, and (@PERCENT2) of the students indicated that socializing with friends and family far surpasses spending all one's time on the computer. There are three primary reasons for this stance. Firstly, it is preferable to interact with people in person rather than solely through a computer. Secondly, excessive computer use is detrimental to health. Lastly, numerous negative occurrences can transpire on the internet. If you are interested in this topic, kindly continue reading, and I will demonstrate that the computer is not an ideal way to spend your leisure time. Do you know the original purpose of computers? Computers were designed to assist people, but have you ever considered that instead of interacting with virtual personas, you should engage with those in your immediate vicinity? Instead of using Facebook or MySpace to communicate with friends, simply invite them over. This approach is not only more enjoyable but also healthier. Therefore, the next time you contemplate an activity, consider alternative options. In my previous paragraph, did I not mention that spending time with friends is far healthier than being glued to a computer? I was absolutely correct! Did you know that wasting time on a computer is self - sabotaging? When all you do is sit and stare at a screen, you are not contributing to your well - being as you are getting absolutely no exercise. When you are not on the computer, you can at least engage in some light walking, but typing on a keyboard does nothing for your physical health. This is precisely why people should not spend all their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet predator? If not, allow me to provide a brief explanation. An internet predator is an individual who exploits the computer to coerce strangers into engaging in inappropriate behavior. And yes, this is illegal. So, if you receive a friend request, be cautious. Ignoring such requests is advisable because failure to do so can lead to undesirable consequences. This is just one of the reasons why people should limit their computer usage. Now, you understand why people should not spend as much time on the computer as they typically do. Firstly, opt for in - person interactions over computer - mediated conversations. Secondly, excessive computer use is unhealthy. Lastly, the threat of internet predators looms large. So, the next time you open your laptop, ponder this: is it more enjoyable to stare at a blank computer screen or to spend the day in the beautiful outdoors with friends and family? Always bear in mind the answer.
704	706	1	1	Computers exert a positive influence on individuals. They facilitate learning about global news, diverse places, and people. Moreover, computers enhance communication among individuals and can even cultivate hand - eye coordination. Those who advocate for technological advancements firmly believe that computers have a beneficial impact on people. Without computers, learning new information would be significantly hampered. Through a computer, one can explore new places, determine their locations, and gain in - depth knowledge about them. I recall working on a project about (@LOCATION2). Initially, I was at a loss regarding what to do. However, I turned to the computer and searched for (@LOCATION2). It informed me that (@LOCATION2) was situated in (@LOCATION1), presented a visual representation of it, and provided historical insights into the country. Without the computer, this valuable learning experience would have been unattainable. Computers also serve as a rich source for learning about historical and famous figures. One can peruse their biographies or watch videos documenting their achievements. In the past, people relied on newspapers for news, but now, computers offer a cost - effective alternative, eliminating the need to purchase newspapers. Additionally, computers provide real - time updates on global events. Without computers, the scope of learning would be severely restricted. Computers also enable seamless communication with individuals in distant locations. Scientists conducted a study on communication methods, and (@PERCENT1) of (@CAPS1) reported using computers to interact with others. People can utilize webcams, instant messaging platforms like AIM, or email for communication. To communicate with my family in (@LOCATION2), I employ a webcam, while I use email or AIM to interact with my friends. Traditional letter - writing is time - consuming, whereas on a computer, the recipient can respond immediately. Thus, computers simplify communication. Furthermore, computers can enhance hand - eye coordination. On a computer, one can view an object on the monitor and click it without looking at the mouse, a skill that proves beneficial in sports by fostering quick reflexes. Hand - eye coordination is crucial in many sports; for instance, in basketball, one must look up while dribbling to avoid falling. Computers can endow individuals with rapid reflexes and support their performance in sports. Given these numerous advantages, computers should be an integral part of society's daily life. They positively impact people, aiding in the acquisition of new knowledge about places, people, and global news, and are highly beneficial to society.
705	707	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am penning this letter because I am of the opinion that people in the (@LOCATION1) are currently overusing computers. Instead of idly sitting at home, engrossed in games like FarmVille and pet - related Facebook games, I believe you should venture out more. I suggest that you visit the gym for a workout, head to the park, or organize a family fun night with your children (if you have any). The final recommendation I have is to set aside some ""me"" time. For example, treat yourself to a visit to a nice place (the significance will become clear shortly). Since (@DATE1), all you have done is remain at home, playing games. As a result, you may have become lethargic, and are you maintaining a proper diet? Well, if so... you have likely gained weight since (@DATE1), and you appear to be in need of a gym session. By sitting on your couch while using the (@CAPS9) every day, you are not burning any calories or fat. When you consume food, all you are doing is adding to your weight, which is probably not what you desire. Do you have a family? If so, I think that taking a family trip to the park or visiting (@ORGANIZATION1) would be an enjoyable way to disconnect from the computer. You can then focus your attention on your children. Additionally, you should establish a family fun night, during which you can play games such as charades or board games (as long as there is no computer distraction in the house). My favorite suggestion is ""me"" time. During this period, you can go shopping, enjoy a meal out, or even take a trip using a map. The fundamental principle of ""me"" time is that you should refrain from using the (@CAPS9)! You need to unwind and take a break. These are my suggestions for you. Now, it is your turn to step out of the virtual world and re - engage with reality."
706	708	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, In this contemporary era, computers present an extraordinary advantage. They are readily learnable, enabling connections with old acquaintances and offering educational opportunities through online schools and colleges. Computers represent a remarkable advancement, which is why one should utilize them. Who could possibly dislike computers? They are easy to master and come in diverse forms. Nearly every college student owns a computer or laptop. Even those with no prior experience can quickly grasp their usage. Most computers come pre - installed with essential programs, including @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or a version of @CAPS2, virus - protection software, and other basic applications. Relocating is arduous, as one leaves a place filled with friends for an unfamiliar environment. Computers alleviate this difficulty by facilitating communication without the need for letter - writing and postal delays. Platforms such as email, Facebook, and MySpace allow chatting with old friends, new acquaintances, or even parents. While some claim these platforms are risky, this is only true when interacting with strangers. People are continuously devising new ways to stay connected, so do not miss this opportunity. Innovators have developed online schooling, which is highly beneficial for the injured or those seeking an additional degree for better career prospects. Students receive assignments, and each course typically lasts one or two months. This allows individuals to work or enjoy nature as their schedules remain unencumbered. Although one may forgo the campus experience, considering today's gasoline prices, the trade - off is worthwhile. Therefore, do not be idle; purchase a computer and keep pace with technology. Remember, computers are user - friendly, aid in maintaining social connections, and support online education. This technology offers more benefits than drawbacks.
707	709	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, @NUM1 percent of jobs today rely on computers. The invention of computers has positively transformed our world. Our society requires @CAPS1. @CAPS1 enriches our world today by imparting knowledge about distant places and their cultures, uniting the world through novel communication techniques, and enhancing work efficiency for employees. ""@CAPS1 is the most remarkable electronic tool devised by humanity,"" states @CAPS5 @PERSON4, a professor at @ORGANIZATION2. Today, the world functions with the aid of @CAPS1, as it continues to evolve. Previously, our cultures were losing ground, but over the years, cultures and @CAPS1 have begun to coexist harmoniously. ""@If you wish to learn about a culture, simply access the internet,"" says @CAPS5, a teacher from @CAPS3. Culture is of utmost importance as it predates technology, and @PERCENT1 of the world's cultures can be found on the internet or in our computers. @PERCENT2 of people, when conducting research, prefer to use @CAPS1 rather than traveling to the country in question, as they can access information at any time. Moreover, @PERCENT3 of people concur that the invention of computers has brought nations closer. Nowadays, one can communicate with someone in @LOCATION2 via @CAPS1 without physically traveling there. ""The creation of @CAPS1 has sparked a new revolution in communication,"" remarks @CAPS5 @PERSON1, a young student at @ORGANIZATION2. ""@CAPS4 of my international calls are made using a computer, and there are numerous communication methods, which are also incredibly convenient,"" says @CAPS5, a mother of a student at @CAPS3. Computers are used @PERCENT4 more frequently than cell phones due to their lower cost. ""@CAPS7, it is evident that the nation has undergone positive change; this is humanity's greatest invention,"" says @CAPS5, a professor at @ORGANIZATION1. Additionally, @PERCENT4 of jobs in @ORGANIZATION3 primarily involve computer usage. Even engineers rely on computers, such as @LOCATION1 @CAPS8, an engineer awarded by President @PERSON3. He states that ""@PERCENT5 of his job entails using @CAPS1."" Statistics indicate that individuals proficient in using @CAPS1 are more likely to earn a higher wage than those without such skills. Another statistic reveals that computer users tend to lead longer and happier lives. @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION2 assert that their friends with computer skills secure better jobs. ""Computers provide young adults with enhanced life opportunities,"" says @CAPS5, a teacher at @ORGANIZATION4. ""Today, it is essential to be computer - literate,"" says @CAPS5 @PERSON2, a teacher at @CAPS3. @CAPS1 has undeniably improved the world. In conclusion, @CAPS1 is a tool widely utilized by nations. It facilitates cultural learning, global communication, and is invaluable for job - related tasks. Proficiency in using @CAPS1 is advantageous, and it has made our world a better place."
708	710	1	1	Dear local newspaper, Are computers detrimental? Certainly not! While they can be distracting, they also offer enlightenment. How so? Computers provide additional knowledge, enable social connections, and can even assist with exercise. Firstly, computers are a positive asset as they expand one's knowledge, which is beneficial for cognitive development. When at home with nothing to do, the computer serves as a vast source of information. With a @PERCENT1 guarantee, one can find answers to any query. Whether it's learning about a particular culture or an interesting topic, a single computer can offer a wealth of knowledge. Returning to school, one can impress others with newfound knowledge. Some experts worry that computers distract from exercise and nature appreciation. However, there's no need for concern as the internet provides extensive information on nature. One can discover more about their backyard than previously known. Worried about insufficient exercise? Simply visit youtube.com, search for exercise routines, and work out in front of the computer. There are also numerous resources available online for maintaining health and fitness. Furthermore, experts claim that excessive computer use may lead to a lack of social interaction. On the contrary, people engage more with friends and family online than in person. Platforms like Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and others enable instant communication. Weekend plans are often arranged online, and a significant portion of social life occurs in the digital realm. For long - distance family members, the internet provides a cost - effective means of connection. In summary, computers offer benefits in terms of knowledge acquisition, exercise, and social connection. With a single electronic device, one can multitask effortlessly, making it a valuable asset. Experts need not worry.
709	711	1	1	Dear editor, Have you ever pondered which holds greater significance? While this question can pertain to various aspects, consider the comparison between computers and family, friends, nature, and personal health. I often reflect on this, and I firmly believe that spending time with family and friends is far more rewarding than being in front of a computer. There are numerous reasons to support this view, and after presenting the first, it becomes difficult to see an alternative perspective. Why do children today struggle to run to the bus stop without getting out of breath? I attribute this to a lack of essential exercise. Instead of sitting in front of a computer, both children and adults can visit the gym. Children can also participate in school sports, which not only promotes physical activity but also enhances school engagement. Additionally, taking a short walk with a dog not only provides exercise but also strengthens the bond with a loyal companion. Have you ever been captivated by the beauty of nature while looking out of a car window? If not, it may be because you spend excessive time on the computer. There are many ways to appreciate nature, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, breathing in fresh air, and soaking up sunlight. One can also take a leisurely bike ride along a trail, feeling the cool breeze on their face. Alternatively, on a warm day, sitting on the beach, listening to music by the ocean is a wonderful way to connect with nature. These experiences are hard to resist. Finally, I believe that family is the most important aspect that is often neglected. Without family and friends, one misses out on valuable ethics and experiences, as well as the opportunity to build long - lasting relationships. How can one turn down the chance to be with loved ones? In conclusion, computers are causing people to miss out on what truly matters in life. No one should live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and good health. Therefore, everyone should make a responsible decision and prioritize what is truly important.
710	712	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Do you think computers have positive or negative effects on people? It has come to my attention that people debate about @CAPS3 computers. Without a doubt, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. My arguments are that computers enable individuals to learn about distant places, facilitate online communication with others, and assist with schoolwork. Firstly, computers offer the ability to explore far - off locations. This is highly beneficial; if you wish to learn about @CAPS4, you can simply use the computer and search for ""@CAPS4 @CAPS6"" on Google. Through this, you will obtain a wealth of information about @CAPS4. I can attest to this as I have tried it myself. Thus, the capacity of computers to provide knowledge about faraway places is a valuable asset to human society. Secondly, computers allow people to communicate with others worldwide. This is particularly useful when one wants to learn about different cultures directly from individuals. Unlike simply searching for facts, engaging in an online chat is a more interactive and cost - free way to connect. In my opinion, this is the best way to make friends and stay in touch with family, especially when they are far away. Lastly, computers can significantly aid with schoolwork. This is advantageous for students as they can research various topics, whether it's about the world or a specific subject. This reminds me of a time when I had to complete a project about the nine planets. I needed to gather a substantial amount of information, which would have involved numerous books and extensive reading. However, I found that using the internet was the easiest and fastest way to complete my project. I accessed all the necessary information online and submitted my project to my teacher. Although I misspelled my name and received a @PERCENT1 grade, the point is that computers greatly assist students with school projects. After careful consideration, I am certain that computers have a positive effect on people. The three reasons I have presented - the ability to learn about faraway places, the opportunity to communicate online, and the support for schoolwork - clearly demonstrate the benefits of computers. I hope you will share my view and recognize the positive impact of computers on human society."
711	713	1	1	"Dear local news time editor, the regular use of a @CAPS1 exerts a positive influence on individuals. Don't you concur? People ought to utilize a @CAPS1 more frequently. In my view, every household should possess at least one or two computers, as they were invented for a valid purpose. Computers enable interaction with friends and family, assist with schoolwork, and I assure you that you will have an enjoyable experience using a @CAPS1 by engaging in games and meeting new people. When you have schoolwork to complete, computers can offer valuable assistance. If you need to conduct research, you can simply access a website like Google, and the information you require will be right before your eyes within seconds. Computers can also be of help in this regard. There is an icon within one of your documents. I read an article on @CAPS1 about @PERSON1, which stated that ""@CAPS1 users are most likely to achieve success in school."" Interacting with friends and family is always beneficial. Perhaps you are confused if you have been assigned to a particular class. You can add a friend, and they will inform you of what has transpired. Communicating with family members can bring numerous benefits. If you are encountering difficulties in your social life, you can always have a private conversation with a family member or friend via the @CAPS1. I recall facing some challenges with a few friends, and one of my cousins provided me with excellent advice through an instant messaging program named ""@CAPS2"". I guarantee that you will have a great time using a @CAPS1. There are numerous games available that you can enjoy. Playing these games, according to @PERSON2, will enhance hand - eye coordination. You can meet new people who can also offer good advice. As you can see, computers have a multitude of positive effects on people. You can interact with family and friends, receive substantial assistance with schoolwork, and meet a large number of new people. Take my advice and purchase a @CAPS1."
712	714	1	1	What proportion of your daily leisure time do you allocate to using a computer? It has been established that individuals aged two to fifteen spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. Those aged sixteen to forty - eight spend @NUM1 - @NUM4 hours of their daily free time on their computers. Excessive computer usage can impede physical activities, social interactions, and lead to health problems. While computers do offer certain advantages here and there, they predominantly yield negative effects. In the past decade, the percentage of people engaging in exercise has declined, while computer - related expenses have increased. Americans now spend the majority of their time web - surfing, playing online games, and participating in online chat rooms. After school, children return home and turn on their computers instead of going outside to run and play. A growing number of people across the country have gained weight due to the consumption of unhealthy food and a lack of physical exercise. Many local sports teams have lost members because of the diminished enthusiasm for physical activities attributed to computers. A significant number of individuals have ceased going out with friends and family in favor of using the computer. The thought that permeates @CAPS1 minds these days is 'why venture out to socialize with my friends when I can communicate with them online?' I hold the opposite view. Leave the gloomy confines of your home and go out to meet your friends. I rarely go online. I only spend twenty minutes online for checking homework and online shopping. Computers have a profound impact on social lives, such as the ability to go out and have the confidence to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are escalating rapidly! The reason we now have shows on @CAPS2 about individuals with weight and health problems can be largely attributed to the negative influence of computers. Shows like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, which feature obese individuals, have demonstrated how people gain weight. I believe that at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend an excessive amount of time on the computer and do not exercise. Consuming @PERSON1's products and then going home to play online games will undoubtedly exacerbate health issues such as weight gain, unhealthy organs, improper muscle function, and eye and brain damage from continuous staring at a mouse and screen. People should curtail their computer usage, go outside, and become more active because computer use does have a negative impact. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Rise up and prevent the adverse effects of computers.
713	715	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I endorse the advancements in technology. I will elucidate @NUM1 reasons for this stance. Firstly, on a rainy day, when going outside to play is not an option, you can use the computer to play games, converse with friends, or utilize it for schoolwork or professional tasks. Suppose you need to look up information for school but cannot access the library. If you have a computer at home, you can use it to obtain the necessary information. You can also use the computer to learn new skills, such as crafting something. After school, if you are unable to meet your friends in person, you can interact with them online. Additionally, you can inquire with your friends about homework to ensure you do not miss any assignments. This is why I support technological advancements.
714	716	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, Everyone adores computers, right? These remarkable machines can assist us in myriad ways. They also furnish people with detailed information about distant locations. Moreover, if you have loved ones residing far away, you can engage in online conversations with them! One can scarcely fathom what the world would be like without computers. Firstly, I would like to expound on how computers can offer comprehensive assistance. Computers can present us with images of various places, allow us to watch videos, and even enjoy movies free of charge. You can also check the weather forecast, and when traveling to an airport, you can verify flight schedules or determine if a flight has been canceled. The capabilities of computers seem virtually endless! Additionally, computers can provide you with facts, opinions, pictures, videos, and movies about far - flung destinations. For instance, I once planned to visit @LOCATION1, but a severe storm in the area led to the cancellation of my flight. I accessed the computer, and it promptly informed me of the cancellation. If you are planning to visit a faraway place, you can watch videos about it and utilize maps to guide your journey. You can also check highway traffic conditions to avoid getting stuck. It is truly astonishing to contemplate life without a computer! Thirdly, computers enable you to chat online with friends and family. If you miss someone or simply wish to have a conversation, there are numerous websites that facilitate such interactions, such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. By attaching a camera to your computer, you can engage in video - chatting and see the person you are talking to. This can be done anywhere, at any time! In conclusion, all these functions are only possible with the aid of a computer. They assist us in countless ways, offer information about distant places, and enable online communication. There are many more benefits, but to discover them, you need to visit a store and acquire a computer.
715	717	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am cognizant of the ongoing debates regarding computers. Some individuals believe they are beneficial, while others think they are detrimental, and some simply remain indifferent. Many people fail to comprehend the contemporary era. Society has undergone a significant transformation compared to the time when our parents were children. I will delineate the advantages and disadvantages of computers. Computers offer numerous benefits. They allow for rapid access to information. The ability to communicate with people worldwide is a substantial advantage. Computers also serve as a source of entertainment for children and teenagers, with a plethora of games available on websites. In today's world, computers are ubiquitous, and many tasks are accomplished with their assistance. They also help you save money on books, as you can simply search for information on the internet. However, there are also several drawbacks to computers. They are costly. Computers can malfunction, and there are also unproductive websites like Facebook and MySpace. For those who did not grow up with computers, learning to use them can be a complex process. The government stores a vast amount of information in computers, which, if not the case, would make it easier for people to steal sensitive data. Overall, computers are the most remarkable invention to date. They facilitate a wide range of tasks and help us access an infinite amount of information. I hope this letter has provided you with a more comprehensive understanding of computers. While there are both positive and negative aspects, the benefits generally outweigh the drawbacks. Without computers, children and teenagers would be so bored that they might drive their parents to distraction.
716	718	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A typical individual with access to a computer spends at least three hours daily engaged with the device. Presently, people, particularly adolescents, squander their valuable time on platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS1, and others. Consider this: instead of sitting immobile, fixating on the computer screen, one could be engaging in physical activity, spending quality time with loved ones, or immersing oneself in nature. Do we truly necessitate computers? Obesity ranks among the most pressing concerns in the country today. Nevertheless, prevention is within our reach! By allowing children and adults to spend the majority of their day sedentary, accomplishing nothing, we are exacerbating the issue. We are extremely fortunate as our town boasts at least two fitness facilities accessible to all, offering a viable alternative to computer use. Even if gym attendance is not feasible, a simple stroll around the neighborhood suffices. There are running programs held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where one can exercise or even participate in a small competition! Undoubtedly, exercise is fundamental to everyone's well - being, and numerous avenues for physical activity exist, yet computer use is not one of them. Teachers, parents, children, writers—let us all abstain from excessive computer use and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Family and friends are the source of our true happiness, but how can we interact with them if we are constantly glued to the computer? An increasing number of individuals are making less effort to meet in person. Instead, many resort to video chatting via computer cameras. This habit must be changed. Face - to - face socialization is essential for everyone. Communicating solely through computers may deteriorate our social skills as we miss out on crucial elements such as eye contact. Instead of engaging in online conversations, we could be enjoying the company of the same people at an amusement park, a restaurant, a park, or simply in our backyard or home. The world is incredibly beautiful, with countless places to explore, yet society is too preoccupied with computers to notice. Our computers consume a substantial amount of energy and pose a threat to the world, @CAPS2 @CAPS3! Rather than seeking entertainment on the computer, we could be taking hikes, strolling on the beach or our street, or playing outdoors in our yard. While a computer can display magnificent places like beaches, it cannot offer the interactive experience. By stepping away from the computer, we could be swimming at a beach or a pool! Nature is breathtaking; why neglect it? @PERCENT1 of residents in @LOCATION1 own computers and spend a significant portion of their day using them. We have the potential to combat obesity, strengthen relationships with family and friends, and explore nature. Let us initiate a change to achieve all these goals.
717	719	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers exert a positive influence on individuals as they cultivate hand - eye coordination. Moreover, they provide opportunities to learn about diverse individuals and locations. Additionally, they enable us to communicate with others online. Computers are beneficial because they enhance hand - eye coordination, which is of utmost importance. In the real world, the ability to visually perceive an object and manipulate it is essential. For instance, in a physical altercation, this skill can be crucial. Thus, having well - developed hand - eye coordination is indispensable. Another reason I advocate for the positive impact of computers is the vast knowledge available on the internet. One can learn about distant places and people, offering a broader perspective of the world beyond one's immediate surroundings. In essence, the internet prepares us for life by expanding our understanding of the Earth. My final point is that computers facilitate communication between individuals online. Suppose one lacks a phone but has access to a computer and needs to convey important information. In that case, the internet provides a convenient solution. It is widely recognized as one of the fastest means of communication for those in need. These are the three compelling reasons why I am convinced that computers have a positive effect on people. If you remain skeptical, I encourage you to experience it firsthand by using a computer. I am confident you will not be disappointed.
718	720	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to express my concerns regarding the detrimental impact of computer use on society. With individuals engaging in less physical activity, neglecting nature, and experiencing fewer personal interactions, computers are doing more harm than good. Almost everyone owns a computer, and its usage is on the rise, depriving people of valuable opportunities to be active outdoors. Firstly, exercise is an integral part of daily life, yet it is becoming increasingly scarce as children spend hours in front of their computer screens. There is widespread discussion about our country's high obesity rate, and one of the primary causes is the prevalence of people sitting idle, staring blankly at computer screens instead of being physically active. Computers contribute to laziness; for example, if one misses a favorite @CAPS1.V. show, it can easily be found online. Similarly, when working on a project, a wealth of information is just a click away. Secondly, the appreciation of nature has become a rare occurrence. With a simple online search, one can find a picture of their front yard, leading to fewer people venturing outside. Why go outside when one can chat with friends or explore new technology on @ORGANIZATION1? People who are constantly on the computer are less concerned about the environment as they waste electricity. Many individuals no longer feel the need to visit @LOCATION1 when they can view pictures of it online. This trend is robbing people of the excitement and first - hand experiences of traveling and exploring the world. Thirdly, there has been a significant decline in personal interactions. Children who rely more on texting, @CAPS2, or Facebook chats than face - to - face conversations with friends are losing their ability to engage in meaningful dialogues. Online communication allows time for thought, but in person, they may struggle to express themselves effectively. As people can text and talk over the computer, they see each other less frequently, believing that online communication suffices. Friends and family may gradually lose touch with who we are as emotions cannot be accurately conveyed through a computer. It is said that one can learn more about someone in @NUM1 minutes of playing together than in @NUM1 minutes of online conversation. Consequently, friendships are formed without a comprehensive understanding of the other person. In conclusion, computers are having a predominantly negative impact on society. They contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, reduce the appreciation of nature, and diminish personal interactions. It is high time we recognized these issues and took steps to limit our computer use.
719	721	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that there is a significant debate about whether computers have a beneficial or adverse impact on users. In my opinion, they are not beneficial. Firstly, computer use reduces the time available for exercise. Secondly, not all computer - accessible websites are appropriate for users, especially teenagers. Finally, excessive computer use encroaches on the time spent interacting with family and friends. For these reasons, I firmly believe that computers have a negative influence on people. Undoubtedly, individuals who spend several hours a day on the computer have limited time for physical activity. @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 young adults are obese, primarily because most teenagers prefer to stay indoors, watching @CAPS1 or surfing the internet instead of being active. Some students are so addicted to computers that they rarely go outside. While I acknowledge that computers can be useful for schoolwork, children who are constantly glued to the screen may face life - threatening weight problems in the future. As is well - known, many inappropriate websites are accessible to teenagers on the computer. Parents are constantly worried about their children's online activities and must monitor them closely to ensure their safety. If teenagers used computers less frequently, it would alleviate some of their parents' concerns. I recall reading a newspaper article about a girl named @PERSON1 who was chatting with a ""@NUM3 - year - old guy on a website. The guy later found her, and the situation turned out to be @NUM4. If kids were not so addicted to the computer, they would be less likely to access such dangerous websites. Many teenagers spend their entire day on the computer, leaving little time for family and friends. For example, when a friend invites my brother to go skateboarding, he often claims to be busy when he is actually on Facebook. One of my friends once told me, ""Sorry, I can't go to the pool today. I'm going to play RollerCoaster Tycoon."" Given this attitude towards outdoor activities, it is not surprising that students who waste time on computers have little time for their loved ones. In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on many people. They impede physical activity, expose children to inappropriate content, and reduce the quality time spent with family and friends. I sincerely hope that everyone will recognize that computers are not beneficial to people."
720	722	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 in @CAPS2, Computers stand among the most remarkable discoveries of our time. Firstly, they play a pivotal role in our educational processes. Secondly, they enable rapid global connections among people. Thirdly, they are indispensable in scientific research. Overall, computers have been a boon to mankind. In today's educational landscape, children often face challenges. However, modern computers empower them to strive for and achieve their goals. Teachers cannot impart all knowledge, but computers offer a vast repository of information waiting to be absorbed by eager young minds. Moreover, in our fast - paced world, typing skills, facilitated by computer use, open up better opportunities for future success. For instance, if a child misses a school day, they can access their homework online and continue their studies, ensuring they do not fall behind. Clearly, computers are an essential tool for both children and adults. One of the greatest aspects of our world is its diversity, and connecting with others helps us learn to coexist and progress as a society. Internet - based communication platforms like @ORGANIZATION1 are vital for businesses as they expedite decision - making processes, which ultimately affect us all. But this connectivity is not limited to business; it can also be for personal pleasure. For example, if @CAPS3's son is on a business trip in @LOCATION1, a simple webcam session can bridge the distance. In the government, where problems emerge quickly and subtly, a president can consult advisors in real - time from the comfort of their office. The ability to connect people through computers is truly miraculous and essential for our way of life. Additionally, the progress of science would be severely hampered without computers. In the field of cancer research, we are making significant strides, largely thanks to computers. Without them, we might not even have chemotherapy. Computers process information at speeds far beyond human capabilities, which is a great advantage as it accelerates research. While a computer may not directly provide the cure for a disease, it brings us closer to understanding the mysteries hidden within. Scientists can connect with their peers worldwide through computers, analyze research data, and make well - informed decisions. This collaborative effort will undoubtedly extend our life expectancy. Some may argue that people are overly reliant on computer screens. However, these are the very individuals who are working to save lives and reduce healthcare costs. When a cure is found for an illness, we should not complain about their computer - based work. We should trust that they know what they are doing. In conclusion, computers have a multitude of positive impacts. They enhance the educational experience of our youth, connect people across the globe, and contribute to the discovery of cures for the most severe diseases. Let us promote the use of computers in our communities to further advance our society.
721	723	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I wish to inform your business that computers confer significant benefits upon society. Computers enable individuals to communicate with friends and family, serve as crucial resources for numerous occupations as well as academic pursuits, and facilitate the acquisition and storage of information. Computers represent one of the most substantial advancements in our technological landscape.  Primarily, computers empower people to interact with friends and family. I frequently engage with the computer, largely because it allows me to converse with my friends. Computers offer an effective means of communicating with friends whom you may not encounter frequently or simply for engaging in timely conversations. I maintain a Facebook account and regularly discuss school - related events or academic tasks with my friends. For example, last month I sprained my ankle and stayed home from school for a day. So, at around @TIME1, when everyone had returned from school, I logged onto Facebook, and a friend informed me of the night's homework. Thanks to computers, I was able to catch up on the work I had missed that day. Moreover, if you have family members residing at a distance or someone attending college, you can send them an email to maintain contact. My cousin is currently in college, and I often communicate with him via computer to inquire about his well - being. For instance, we often discuss the sports we are involved in during that particular season. Evidently, computers are an excellent way to stay connected with family and communicate with friends.  Secondly, computers are integral to many people's lives as numerous jobs incorporate computer usage, as does education. Computers are an extremely valuable technological asset as people utilize them for bill payment, professional duties, and more. For example, my father's job involves testing computer programs. The programs are developed, then rectified and refined, and finally disseminated globally. If people were prohibited from using computers, many individuals would lose their jobs, and numerous families would face substantial debt. Additionally, children undertake a significant amount of schoolwork on computers. For example, I study Spanish and earn cultural points for my class by answering questions on the computer. Studies indicate that over @PERCENT1 of children employ computers for some form of schoolwork. Computers play a vital role in today's working society.  Finally, computers enable people to learn about diverse locations around the world. The computer stores a wealth of valuable information. It contains facts and captivating pictures about different countries. It also showcases to people worldwide the culture, style, language, and numerous other aspects of places across the globe. For instance, one day my uncle was using the computer to research places in @LOCATION1. After careful consideration, he and his family relocated there and still reside there to this day. Computers inspire people to learn and explore different places and may one day lead them to something of great significance.  In conclusion, I am firmly convinced of the positive impact that computers have on contemporary society. I am confident that you will share the same perspective as computers offer an abundance of benefits.
722	724	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, research by @PERSON1 indicates that @PERCENT1 of individuals believe that computers exert a positive influence on people. Computers facilitate maintaining contact with relatives and can provide entertainment during extended journeys. They indeed have positive effects on people.  Computers enable individuals to stay connected with relatives, keep abreast of friends, and serve as a reliable source of entertainment. For those with relatives living far away, computers offer a convenient means of communication. Video - chatting allows one to see and converse with someone almost face - to - face, even from a great distance. When feeling sad and in need of a conversation, a few clicks can lift one's spirits. For military personnel with a @ORGANIZATION1 baby, they can witness their child's first steps or first words via video - chat. Video - chatting was not only the sole way to stay in touch; one can also communicate without a computer. Platforms like Aim and @CAPS1 allow you to stay informed about your friends' lives, whether you see them daily or once a year at @DATE2 camp. @CAPS1 keeps you updated on various happenings through status updates, while Aim enables text - based conversations. If you wish to go into town with a friend, simply send them a message via @CAPS1 or Aim.  However, computers are not just for staying in touch. They can also keep you entertained during travel. Whether it's a long - distance journey or a short ride, computers offer a plethora of entertainment options. You can watch a movie by inserting a disc or renting one from iTunes or Netflix. If you want to listen to a song, you can download it in seconds and enjoy your favorite tunes. You can even play video games on your computer. Just purchase the game, install it, and start playing.  Computers are highly beneficial during leisure time and have a positive impact on people. They allow you to stay connected with family, keep up with friends, and are an excellent source of entertainment during long trips or downtime. In the @DATE1 era, computers are as revolutionary as the lightbulb.
723	725	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I opine that the effects of computers are acceptable as long as we disengage from them, venture outdoors, socialize with friends, and engage in physical activity.  Computers not only enable us to communicate with one another but also allow us to compete in games without causing harm. In fact, they have the potential to mitigate real - world conflicts as we can engage in war - themed games with other countries without endangering human lives. Additionally, computers facilitate tasks such as tax checking and stock monitoring. They simplify the process of finding health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance.  We can access historical facts on the computer. It can also provide us with knowledge on how to prevent snake venom from reaching the heart and how to craft bows and arrows. Moreover, computers help us locate plumbers, technicians, oil companies, and lumber companies. They can also be used to find potential dates and gather information about specific individuals.  In conclusion, while we should be mindful of our computer usage and balance it with real - world activities, computers offer a multitude of benefits that enhance our daily lives.
724	726	1	1	I contend that computers wield a profound influence on individuals. Computers serve as an effective medium for @CAPS1 maintaining contact with others, @CAPS2 engaging in online activities, @CAPS3 performing various jobs, and @CAPS3 accessing information regarding @CAPS4 facts. Although computers may not provide physical exercise for you, they are invaluable in life and assist in maintaining organization.  For example, they help businesses manage files, and for those in the music industry, computers can create beats and record music. Computers benefit individuals of all ages. They aid younger students in school when they need to write an @ORGANIZATION1 or complete a project, and they support the elderly in their professional endeavors.  Computers also keep you informed about life events, such as learning about those who have been injured or getting weather updates. Truly, computers are remarkably useful in everything they facilitate, and it is astonishing how technology evolves. If it were not for the contributions of veterans, I believe some of us would not be where we are today.
725	727	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, research indicates that @PERCENT1 of people believe that computers have a positive influence on individuals. Computers are a powerful tool for maintaining contact with relatives and providing entertainment.  Computers allow individuals to stay connected with relatives, keep in touch with friends, and serve as a reliable source of amusement. For those with relatives living far away, computers offer a seamless way to communicate. Video - chatting enables face - to - face interaction from a great distance. When one is feeling down and needs to talk, a few clicks can bring comfort. For military personnel with a @ORGANIZATION1 baby, they can witness their child's milestones via video - chat.  Apart from video - chatting, platforms like Aim and @CAPS1 also help in staying connected. @CAPS1 provides status updates, allowing you to know what your friends are up to, whether you see them daily or once a year at @DATE2 camp. Aim enables text - based conversations. If you want to go out with a friend, you can easily send them a message through these platforms.  Computers are not just for socializing. They are also great for entertainment during travel. Whether it's a long - distance journey or a short ride, you can watch movies by inserting a disc or renting from services like iTunes or Netflix. You can download songs in seconds and listen to your favorite music. You can even play video games on your computer after purchasing and installing them.  In conclusion, computers are a boon during leisure time and have a positive impact on people. They help us stay connected with family, updated with friends, and entertained during long trips or downtime. In the @DATE1 era, computers are as revolutionary as the lightbulb.
726	728	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I contend that computers are an excellent asset. For example, they offer entertainment, facilitate communication, and assist in design creation. My primary rationale is that computers are entertaining. I have no inclination to observe nature, yet I am fond of playing video games on my computer. Nevertheless, I still engage in exercise, as I go out to play basketball before using my computer. Computers remain beneficial because after finishing basketball, socializing with friends, or when it is raining, I enjoy playing engaging computer games. My second reason is that computers enable communication. I relish conversing with my friends on Facebook. One can simply log in and communicate with anyone globally. There is also video chat, which allows one to see the person they are speaking with from anywhere. Additionally, email is highly useful for work. Information can be sent from one computer to another. My final reason is regarding design. Every modern car one drives is initially designed on a computer. People utilize these computers to create blueprints for car manufacturing. These are the reasons why I believe computers are advantageous.
727	729	1	1	Dear local newspaper, did you know that the average individual spends @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes daily on the computer? This is why I opine that people are allocating an excessive amount of time on computers. If individuals were to spend less time on computers, they would engage in more exercise, spend more time outdoors, and interact more with their family and friends. Were people to reduce their computer usage, they would exercise more. Given the escalating issue of obesity in @ORGANIZATION2, less time on computers would alleviate this problem. Tests indicate that the less time spent on computers, the more time is devoted to exercise. With @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 being obese, this would significantly address the problem. I once had a friend who was always outdoors, exercising and playing. Then, he obtained a @CAPS1 account and began spending the entire day at home on the computer, never exercising. Less time on computers would also increase time outdoors. Results from a survey I conducted at my school suggest that @PERCENT2 of people would go outside if they were unable to use their computers. Moreover, if more people are outside, they will appreciate nature, and @PERSON1 states that it reduces household electricity usage. So, if everyone were to turn off their computers, they would spend more time with friends and family. There is an over - reliance on friends and family through programs like @CAPS2 and @CAPS1, rather than face - to - face interaction. It would be far easier and more fulfilling to step away from the computer and talk to them in person. This is why I believe that people are spending too much time on their computers, which is negatively impacting their lives. If they were off the computer, they would exercise more, contribute to environmental conservation, and socialize more with their family and friends. Therefore, please, @LOCATION1, refrain from using the computer constantly.
728	730	1	1	Dear Newspaper, the invention of the computer has had a profound impact on contemporary society. Although numerous individuals view computers negatively, they enable us to perform essential tasks in daily life. Many believe that @CAPS1 computer applications distract us from other productive activities. However, the applications a computer offers are indispensable for most tasks. Applications such as the calculator save time compared to manual calculations on paper. It allows for the execution of simple or complex math in less than @NUM1 seconds. It is highly useful for calculating tips, managing finances, or completing basic math and science homework. Another valuable application is digital note - taking. This feature allows for easy typing, eliminating the need for pen and paper. Computer - based note - taking provides legible notes for studying, which can help achieve good grades on upcoming tests or quizzes. The most crucial and widely used computer application is the internet. The internet comprises millions of websites serving various purposes. If one plans to go to the movies tonight, the internet can provide movie times, directions, and film durations. It is also an excellent tool for planning family trips, booking flights, etc. Considering these aspects, the applications are extremely useful. The computer is also an outstanding learning device. It enables online exploration of new subjects, such as distant places and people. How would our country be if we were uninformed about the outside world? It is also an effective research method. Teachers assign numerous projects and assignments, and there is no better way to research a topic than using a computer. For instance, a project on the fashion of @NUM2 and @DATE1 that I completed last month. The computer allowed me to discover the clothing worn by both genders, the materials used, and how they obtained those materials. The research from my computer enhanced my understanding of the topic and helped me grasp its fundamentals. One might argue that communication can be misused, but communication is essential for our world. The computer is one of the many communication devices. Computer - based email allows messages to be sent to one or multiple recipients without the need for a signal or service. Blogging is another form of computer - based communication, offering the freedom to express opinions on education. In conclusion, the computer is essential in our daily lives. Without it, our society would struggle to function.
729	731	1	1	Dear Readers, I am of the opinion that computers bring about positive changes in our country and have a beneficial influence on people. This is because they conserve paper when sending emails, save money, facilitate learning about different countries like @LOCATION1, and enable us to interact with others using technology to our advantage. These are some reasons why computers have a positive impact on society and our way of life. Firstly, computers contribute to environmental conservation by reducing the need to cut down trees for paper production. Do you know that approximately @NUM1 trees are cut down daily, and not all of them are immediately processed into paper at mills? They often pile up at logging sites and rot without being put to proper use. I believe that trees, like us, have a form of sentience, and cutting them down is akin to robbing. By using computers, we can save trees and prevent this waste. This is one reason why I think computers have a positive impact on our lives and society. Secondly, computers are excellent learning tools. One can acquire a wealth of knowledge by simply searching on a computer. At school, I learn a great deal with the help of computers. I believe that using computers can significantly enhance our learning efficiency. We can gain more knowledge in a shorter time compared to searching for books on a particular subject. Computers have a profound impact on children's learning, and we all discover new things when using them. Thus, while computers have both advantages and disadvantages, they are generally beneficial. Finally, computers facilitate communication and interaction with friends. Technology has advanced to such an extent that our perception of the world has changed. Take a cell phone, for example. At first glance, it is just a phone, but upon closer inspection, it contains a micro - computer capable of internet surfing and music playback, albeit in a smaller form. Computers have revolutionized our view of the world and technology. We can communicate and play games using this technology, which is integrated into many aspects of our daily lives, such as game consoles and car radios. All of these are used to facilitate interaction among people. Therefore, I view technology as a positive force. In conclusion, technology has both positive and negative impacts, but the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones. Technology simplifies our daily lives, helps protect the environment by reducing paper usage, and enables communication with just a click of a button. It has transformed the way mankind lives and perceives society, and in the end, it is a boon.
730	732	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I do not concur that people use computers excessively. I hold this view because some individuals utilize them for work, some for school, and others to communicate with family or friends who are geographically distant. Firstly, the majority of businesses rely on computers to maintain their operations. For example, at my mother's workplace, computers are essential for payroll management, inventory control, emailing employees about work tasks, and sourcing suppliers for materials such as concrete, stone, etc. Businesspeople have valid reasons to use computers constantly. Moreover, they often use computers to plan business trips. Secondly, students in school use computers for various educational purposes, including homework, classwork, project research, and online learning platforms. While some students may misuse computers, they can also access educational content, such as understanding cell division, body systems, or human development from embryo to birth. Additionally, computers are widely used for communication. For instance, @CAPS2 users can communicate with people on the other side of the world, and AIM is also a popular communication tool. I have a cell phone for calling and texting distant contacts, and I use AIM to interact with my friends. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that all people use computers excessively and for improper reasons. Finally, although many people are frequently on computers, it is usually for communication with long - lost friends, work - related matters, or schoolwork. In my opinion, computers have become an integral part of modern life, and people will continue to use them. I believe that computers bring more benefits than negative impacts, as we all utilize them to our advantage.
731	733	1	1	Sincerely, I firmly and unequivocally believe that children's internet usage should be curtailed in the @LOCATION2, owing to numerous reasons. Here are but a few of them. Firstly, the internet can render individuals extremely overweight. For instance, if your friend was planning to walk to your house but then opted to @CAPS1 you instead, he is likely not getting much physical activity. In fact, the leading @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 is no longer cigarettes; it is obesity. Actually, @NUM1 @CAPS3 are obese, and that number continues to rise. Another reason why internet usage should be reduced is due to bullies, hackers, and terrorists. And I believe this pertains to children in the @LOCATION2.
732	734	1	1	Dear newspaper, this year, my school collaborated with a police officer who visited our school to apprise me and my peers of the perils of the online realm. This experience has led me to conclude that computers are not advantageous. Computers are detrimental as they foster不良习惯. Moreover, certain websites and applications pose risks, and they are highly addictive. Computers exert a negative influence on individuals. To commence, computers encourage不良习惯. For example, some websites disseminate malicious content about others. Some children @MONTH1 partake in cyberbullying because they succumb to peer pressure, desperately seeking acceptance from their peers. Furthermore, someone @MONTH1 agrees to meet an unknown individual. This can be terrifying as one cannot ascertain if the person is truly who they claim to be. Recently, I perused a magazine featuring an article about individuals meeting online acquaintances. Most discovered that the person was not as they had envisioned. Finally, computers promote不良习惯 as people @MONTH1 send questionable pictures to others. As previously mentioned, when the police officer visited our school, he addressed this issue. He stated that people were sending inappropriate pictures of themselves to others, which were then circulated, culminating in a disastrous situation. I am certain that if computers did not have such a profound impact on people, this would not be as significant a problem. Computers not only instigate不良习惯 but are also hazardous. I am confident that if you follow the news, you will encounter stories about child predators, which I consider a grave issue. If computers did not have such a sway over people, this problem would not exist. Additionally, computers are dangerous because children @MONTH1 make poor decisions due to lack of knowledge. For example, many children on MySpace or Facebook have not consulted their parents or guardians about internet safety, or perhaps their parents or guardians are not monitoring them to ensure their online safety. In conclusion, computers are dangerous as they can cause emotional distress through platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, blogs, videos, and more. For instance, I once heard a news story about a girl who was harassed online and subsequently committed suicide. I found this appalling. No one should take their own life, especially because of someone else's unkindness. In summary, computers are extremely dangerous and addictive. They cause individuals to spend less time with their families.
733	735	1	1	Evidently, contemporary technology is perpetually advancing. It appears that there is a novel invention that captivates numerous individuals to make purchases constantly. One electronic device that has proven to be invaluable in myriad ways is the computer. While many contend that excessive time is spent on computers, I contemplate the substantial benefits they offer. Computers can provide virtually any information one requires, @CAPS1 it pertains to a particular country or the solution to a problem. @CAPS2, computers have advanced to the point where one can engage in conversations with distant friends. Lastly, computers assist us by providing precise directions, obviating the need to decipher a map. Suppose you are undertaking a school project on a country. By precisely inputting the information you seek, you can obtain it instantaneously. @CAPS1 it is the population, density, languages, cuisine, or holidays, computers are the most convenient and straightforward means of acquiring such details. Alternatively, you may simply be intrigued by a country and wish to learn more about it. If you plan to visit a country you have been researching, you will undoubtedly want to familiarize yourself with the place where you will be spending your time. If you intend to travel to a destination you have been studying, you can book your plane tickets online. You can also plan your routes, which aids in organizing your trip. Another reason computers are beneficial to numerous individuals is the ability to communicate with others. @CAPS1 it is conversing with a distant friend or family member or your best friend a few streets away, you likely desire to maintain contact. Modern computers are equipped with webcams, enabling you to visually interact with the person you are communicating with. This is a more engaging way to communicate, particularly if it is someone you rarely see, @MONTH1 even someone who resides in another country. @CAPS2, most teenagers prefer to stay in touch on a daily basis. Typically, children enjoy chatting on instant messaging platforms simply for the pleasure of interacting with their friends. Finally, computers are advantageous in terms of providing directions and routes. As previously mentioned, computers can offer straightforward directions, which is more manageable than using a map while driving. There are websites where all you need to do is enter your exact location and destination, and they will provide specific roads and turns to take. In conclusion, those who are concerned about individuals who should be engaging in physical activity, enjoying the outdoors, and experiencing nature should learn to allocate more time to these pursuits and reduce their online time. They should only use computers when necessary.
734	736	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I comprehend that you are endeavoring to determine whether computers are detrimental to individuals. I firmly believe that computers are contributing to the anti - social nature of our society, causing obesity, and facilitating a significant amount of cyberbullying. You can glean more information on these matters by continuing to read. @CAPS2, as previously stated, computers pose numerous challenges to @LOCATION1's social lives. You see, @CAPS2, @PERCENT1 of our population spends at least @NUM1 hours per week on the computer. During this time, they are typically watching videos or messaging friends. While this may seem like an activity, it is actually distancing us from our social interactions. There are numerous platforms that allow us to chat with friends and leave messages on their ""walls,"" but is this truly communication? In a sense, it is, but it is eroding the social skills we will require in the future. One cannot secure a job through instant messaging; face - to - face communication is essential. However, how will we be capable of this if we solely rely on email and @CAPS3? Moreover, excessive computer use may lead to poor academic performance. Now, let's address the issue of physical inactivity that is prevalent. Many individuals spend excessive time on the computer instead of engaging in exercise. Finally, we come to the issue of cyberbullying. Over @PERCENT2 of @CAPS4 teens will encounter some form of cyberbullying in their lives. When teens sign up for Facebook and Twitter, they are potentially inviting depression. When a teen is bullied, they often become despondent, which can lead to a decline in academic performance due to lack of concentration. This, in turn, can exacerbate their depression, potentially leading to suicide or involvement in gangs and other negative behaviors. However, we can prevent this by limiting the amount of time people, especially those under @NUM2, spend on computers. I believe this would be beneficial. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers are detrimental to society. I advocate for reducing the time spent on computers to enhance our lives. I believe that if you delve deeper into the implications, you will understand why we need to adopt a healthier approach in @LOCATION1."
735	737	1	1	Dear (Newspaper), this is a highly contentious topic. In this regard, I concur with experts who assert that computers have a negative impact on individuals. They undermine social lives and give rise to other adverse consequences. Spending excessive time on the computer precludes one from engaging in physical activity, breathing fresh air, and experiencing the world. Lack of daily exercise is a significant concern. Obesity has become a widespread issue among millions in the @LOCATION1, primarily because people consume unhealthy snacks while sitting in front of the computer all day. If you aspire to lead a long and healthy life, refrain from fixating on a screen. Additionally, everyone requires fresh air. Using a computer indoors offers no benefit in this regard. One needs a daily intake of oxygen. Moreover, prolonged computer use can become an obsession. Computers already have a detrimental effect on people globally, and the aforementioned points should be considered. Another problem associated with computers is that they isolate individuals from their families and friends. As previously mentioned, one's social life will deteriorate. People will constantly see you engrossed in the computer and eventually grow weary of you. Computers offer no real - life adventures, only virtual images. Venturing into the real world may be challenging, but it is essential. One cannot live a fulfilling life in a dark room devoid of human interaction and nature. Have you not always dreamt of traveling the world, experiencing diverse cultures and lifestyles? There comes a point where computer use should be restricted, and one should focus on living life during their free time. Using a computer all day prevents you from meeting new people and exploring new places. You will make no progress with a computer screen in your face, so put it aside. In conclusion, excessive computer use inhibits exercise, fresh air intake, meeting new people, and exploring different places. Life is short, and one cannot afford to squander it. Computers have a negative impact on everyone, and hopefully, these issues will be resolved in the future.
736	738	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I hold a profound conviction regarding the impact of computers on individuals. They facilitate communication among people, provide information on diverse subjects, and enhance cognitive abilities. To me, this clearly indicates a positive influence. What's your stance? Firstly, some claim that computers impede interaction with family members. However, this is untrue. One can communicate with both friends and family through platforms like AIM, Meebo, and engage in webcam meetings via Skype.com. Thus, this concern can be dismissed. Secondly, computers offer the opportunity to acquire knowledge about various things, such as wild animals like giraffes, cats, rats, or different locations like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION1. Moreover, all this information can be accessed from home within a single day. Most importantly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination at no cost. They can teach about any career or regular job in mere minutes, if necessary. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. They enable communication with friends and family, offer learning opportunities on diverse topics, and boost intelligence. After reading this, I even thanked the lord for the computer, as it is incredibly helpful.
737	739	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you today to discuss computers. I firmly believe that computers can impart skills such as hand - eye coordination, which can open up career opportunities. Additionally, this device allows for both socialization and study. My first point pertains to socialization. I consider it an excellent means of socializing due to the numerous options available. For instance, Facebook is a social networking site used to connect or reconnect with friends. In a recent poll, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals stated that computers had made them more sociable. Lastly, computers are an effective socializing tool because of their wide reach. One can converse with people across the globe without incurring long - distance charges. Communication can span from the @CAPS2.S to Hungary in seconds. My second point is that computers are valuable for studies. I say this because although books are useful, they can be difficult to obtain. With a computer, one can access multiple websites, ranging from Wikipedia to the well - known Google in a short time. Another reason I believe computers are beneficial for studies is the endless resources available. One will obtain a wealth of information. My third and final point is that computers provide exceptional hand - eye coordination. I know an accountant. When I asked him, ""@CAPS3, did you secure that accounting job?"", he replied, ""They hired me because I have good hand - eye coordination."" That's one example of a job; another is real estate. Thanks to the multiple options on computers, one can search for information relevant to clients. With good hand - eye coordination, work can be more efficient, helping one outperform the competition and earn more money. This concludes my essay, covering socialization, studies, and job - related aspects. These are just @NUM3 of the many advantages a computer offers. @CAPS1, I hope you read this with my regards."
738	740	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am of the opinion that children are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer for inappropriate reasons. I assert this because all young children and teenagers seem to desire is to spend the entire day on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, rather than conducting research and similar activities. I have three reasons to explain why I believe using the computer for improper purposes instead of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends is a concern. The first reason is that it is extremely perilous, as there are sometimes kidnappers in chat rooms. The second reason is that it detracts from the time that could be spent learning from the internet. The final reason is that the internet can influence individuals to be violent. These are the three reasons; let me elaborate further. The first reason I claim people are spending too much time on the internet is its inherent danger. Young teenagers and children often enter online chat rooms. This is usually unwise because kidnappers fabricate their information to arrange meetings and abduct unsuspecting individuals. Instead of being in a chat room, one could be perusing the daily news or conducting similar searches on the computer. This is why I assert that the internet is not always beneficial if one is not learning about the nation. The second reason I believe excessive computer use is problematic is that it takes away from other important activities. Children often come home and head straight to the computer instead of doing their homework or reading. Some children seem to prefer the computer over learning, which is not good because not having knowledge can be a disadvantage. There are educational games on the computer, but they are not utilized. This is another reason for my concern about people's heavy computer usage. The final reason I am worried about people using the computer excessively is that the internet can influence individuals, especially @CAPS6, to be violent. All the violent games and content one encounters can have a negative impact on the world if they are frequently exposed to such imagery. I say this because in this generation, when young people see violence, it creates an impression, and they may think it is cool to imitate. They seem to prefer @CAPS3 on the computer over a book. When young teens see violence on the computer, they may think it is fashionable. This is the final reason for my concern about people spending too much time on the computer. These are some of the main reasons why I believe the computer is not always a positive influence when people spend an inordinate amount of time on it.
739	741	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, Technology, such as computers, has been proven to have a positive impact on individuals. Computers teach hand - eye coordination, enable learning about distant locations, and facilitate online communication. Technology is continuously evolving and exerting an increasingly significant influence on our lives each day. One way computers benefit society is by teaching hand - eye coordination. For example, as individuals become familiar with their computers, they can type on the keyboard without looking at the keys. Although this may not be the same as developing hand - eye coordination through sports like baseball, the skill is still acquired. Computers also benefit society by providing the ability to learn about far - flung places. Instead of traveling to the library to find a book about @LOCATION1, one can simply access a search engine and type in @LOCATION1. Within seconds, thousands of sources appear, and one doesn't even have to leave their seat. This is another reason why computers are beneficial to society. Lastly, computers and technology benefit society by allowing communication with others, reconnection with old friends or family, and sharing of the latest news. I always keep my instant messenger open when I'm at my computer. It is a tool I use daily to communicate with friends and distant relatives. In conclusion, computers do benefit society and have a positive effect on people. Technology is like a sponge, absorbing information and expanding with each new addition. Through this, I am able to maintain healthy and strong relationships with others.
740	742	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are not detrimental to society; in fact, they can be highly beneficial to people. Computers enable online communication, assist in education, and provide the information necessary for daily life. Some people perceive them negatively, but a closer examination reveals their advantages. @CAPS5 people use a @CAPS2, and <@PERCENT2@NUM1> of the time, it is for communicating with others on the @CAPS3, whether through video chat or email. Those who are reluctant to use @CAPS2 and email might say, ""@CAPS4 not use a phone or even talk to them in person."" With email, one can send a message to someone miles away. For instance, if sending a list, like a recipe, it is more convenient to type it out and send it via email rather than dictating it over the phone. ""@CAPS5 my son said he would teach me how to use email; I thought it would be a waste of time,"" said @CAPS6 @PERSON1, a senior citizen. ""It turns out it wasn't. Now I use email every day."" Many people think email is a waste of time, but it can be useful in daily life. The @CAPS3 is also helpful in multiple ways. It can provide information on various topics. If one is trying to cook a stir - fry but doesn't know the ingredients and can't reach their mother, the next option is to search on the @CAPS2. It often turns out that there is a website with a stir - fry recipe, and one can make an excellent dish. I know from experience that one can find maps online, as I need to travel almost every week. Google Maps is one of the most frequently used sites on the @CAPS3, after email. Some newspapers have websites where one can read the paper without paying, which saves money and reduces paper usage, helping to conserve trees. The vast world of the @CAPS3 can transform our lives. @PERCENT1 of those who use the @CAPS2 almost daily are students. Students use the @CAPS2 for several reasons. The primary one is typing. They use it to write reports and send emails. ""I have messy handwriting,"" said a student, @PERSON2. ""@CAPS11 if it weren't for the @CAPS2, no one would be able to read my homework and reports, not even me."" @PERSON2 is one of many who are fortunate to have access to typing on the computer. Another reason students use the @CAPS2 is for research. If a student includes a bibliography in their report, @PERCENT2 of the time, the information is sourced from the @CAPS3. There may not always be a relevant book in the local library, but the @CAPS3 offers numerous websites and blogs. The third reason is for academic assistance. There are many websites that can help students in various subjects. The @CAPS3 can aid a student in succeeding at school. A @CAPS2 can be useful for everyone, from facilitating communication to helping students with science. This is how computers are beneficial."
741	743	1	1	"To utilize computers, or abstain from doing so. That is the query. Hundreds of millions of individuals employ computers in their daily existence today; however, some contend that the use of computers does not confer benefits upon society. It is my steadfast conviction that they do. Computers offer entertainment, a means of interacting with others, and an almost boundless expanse of knowledge. Without them, we would promptly discover that life is far more arduous and less enjoyable to navigate. Have you ever found yourself at home on a rainy day, merely sitting around, bored because there is nothing on @CAPS1? Well, I have on numerous occasions. When that occurs, all you need to do is power on the computer, and you have an endless array of options at your disposal. You can visit gaming websites and play thousands of diverse games. (This can also contribute to enhancing your hand - eye coordination.) You can also watch movies or @CAPS1 shows that you missed or wish to rewatch. You can even visit sites such as fanfiction.net and read or compose your own stories! Another reason why computers are advantageous to society is that they facilitate interaction with people. You can maintain contact with distant family members and friends using webcams, email, and chat sites, without incurring the expenses associated with phone conversations. You can also meet new individuals from different countries and befriend them. In this way, you learn about different ways of life and cultures. You can also rapidly contact people in an emergency, obtain updates on events, and communicate with your teacher if you have a question regarding your homework. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, computers are an immense source of knowledge. Suppose you desired to learn how to start a campfire; you could simply search, ""how to make fire"" on Google, and @NUM1 matches would be retrieved within seconds. Also, if you were assigned a project for school, you could effortlessly conduct all your research from your computer and then type the entire project up in a word document. You can even acquire a college degree online if you so desire. And if you wish to find a restaurant that specializes in @CAPS2 cuisine, you can locate one near you, obtain directions to it, peruse the menu, view the prices, access the restaurant's history, and even find reviews for it, all through one remarkable option: your computer. So, you see, computers greatly benefit society. In fact, I do not believe we could exist without them. They provide us with entertainment, an effortless means of interacting with others, and a vast reservoir of information. Now, to all of you who still believe computers are detrimental; I would like to see you go a week without using one."
742	744	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I firmly believe that the utilization of computers confers benefits upon the community. I hold this view because the use of computers aids in research, employment, and maintaining connections with people. First and foremost, the employment of computers contributes to superior research. Most @CAPS2 do not possess textbooks about @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 at home, so they rely on the internet. When @PERSON2 assigned the class a packet, I was unfamiliar with the meaning of some of the words. Thus, I logged into my laptop and accessed Google. Within seconds, the definitions appeared on my screen like popping bubbles. After ascertaining the meanings of the words, I completed my homework in approximately five minutes. Without the internet, I am uncertain how long it would have taken. Equally important, the use of computers enables a broader selection of jobs. @PERCENT1 of today's jobs in @LOCATION1 necessitate some form of computer - related work. Some jobs require rapid typists. Some individuals type as swiftly as a cheetah runs. Some jobs require the use of @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. Computers are indispensable for securing a well - paying job. Lastly, the use of computers opens a gateway for communication. @CAPS7, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, etc., are a few of the numerous ways to communicate online. If one of my friends does not have a phone, they most likely have a @CAPS7. @CAPS7 provides me with a means to converse with, share @CAPS11 photos with, and leave videos for my friends. One @CAPS12, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and I were all planning to work on our @PERSON1 project. @PERSON3's phone was confiscated, so the only way I could communicate with her was via @CAPS7. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has a @CAPS7, @CAPS8, or @CAPS9? To @CAPS17, I hope you enjoyed reading about how the use of computers facilitates research, job applications, and communication with family and friends. Please @LOCATION1, @CAPS18 this in the newspaper so that all residents of @LOCATION1 will concur with me.
743	745	1	1	Dear @STATE1's newspaper editors, I recently read an article discussing how experts are concerned that people are allocating an excessive amount of time to computers. I concur with them. I firmly believe that computers are detracting time from physical exercise, the enjoyment of nature, and interaction with family and friends. When considering teenagers today, an increasing number are becoming overweight. In the past, when there were no computers or the internet, fewer people were overweight or obese because they had the time to go outdoors and exercise or play sports with others. Exercise is crucial, especially for teenagers who are overweight or obese. These issues do not simply dissipate; they will have long - term consequences. Not only is there a risk of developing diabetes, but one also has to bear the costs of all the medications and treatments associated with it. Experts also believe that spending time on the computer detracts from the opportunity to enjoy the offerings of nature. While some may argue that it is beneficial for people to learn about different places in the world, I question why one must merely read about these places online and view pictures. Why not be the one taking the pictures for others to see? Why not be the one experiencing it instead of just reading about it? Experts also assert that spending time on the computer reduces the time available for interacting with family members and friends. As a teenager myself, I have learned that interacting with family and friends is extremely important for our well - being. I am not alone in this belief, as studies indicate that children who can communicate with their parents and engage in meaningful conversations with them are more likely to perform well in school and show greater respect for others, compared to those who struggle to have conversations with their parents. For example, if you are someone who communicates with your family, you are likely to achieve good grades such as A's and @CAPS1's and develop respect for others. Conversely, those who cannot communicate with their parents may have difficulty concentrating and may even get into trouble, resulting in @CAPS2's and @CAPS3's. I understand that as a @STATE1 newspaper editor, you are extremely busy and have numerous tasks to attend to. However, I hope you will take this into consideration and remember the importance of exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.
744	746	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, I am writing this letter on behalf of those who spend an inordinate amount of time on computers. Some people, particularly in @MONTH1, claim that one can learn about different cultures and interact with new people daily through computers. The reality is that computers do not assist; rather, they are detrimental. Spending an entire day on the computer will lead to weight gain, cause one to miss out on valuable outdoor experiences, and result in a loss of life's richness. As a whole, @LOCATION1 is recognized as an obese nation. This is because most people consume food and then fail to engage in physical activity. Most of these obese individuals do not exercise because they are fixated on their computer screens. While interacting with others online, they continue to eat, often without even being aware of the reason. If we aspire to eliminate @LOCATION1's reputation as an obese country, we must encourage people to step away from their computer screens. In fact, it is our responsibility, as we have not taken a firm stance. We must illustrate to people just how harmful computers can be. Additionally, while people are engrossed in their computers, they are missing out on the real world. They do not venture outside and have no understanding of what the actual world is like. Imagine reaching adulthood without any knowledge of the outside world. They may also miss out on life - altering experiences, the kind that people @CAPS1 cherish. They would miss out on life in its entirety. We only have one life, so we should make the most of it. It would be truly tragic for someone to simply pass through life, trapped in front of a computer screen. I genuinely feel sorry for such individuals, but the situation can be rectified. All we need to do is remove the computer. If we do this, all these problems will be resolved. Finally, if we eliminate computers, we will be recognized as a new nation. Free from temptation and composed of independent individuals. We will rewrite our place in history as the nation that made a change and rid itself of computers.
745	747	1	1	Dear newspaper journalist, People should refrain from using computers. Computers have a negative impact on the majority of people. @LOCATION1 has the highest proportion of obese citizens in the world. A significant number of people spend their days sitting in front of a computer for work. Then, they return home and use their personal computers instead of going for a walk or a bike ride. Some individuals prefer to view photos of nature or birds on the internet, despite the fact that there is an entire forest outside. Another issue with computers pertains to their security. There are numerous individuals on computers who do not belong there and attempt to hack into your system. Viruses can infiltrate your computer undetected and access all the information on it, including personal data. They can even monitor your typing, which could compromise your passwords! A large number of people pay their taxes online, and if there is a virus on their computer, their personal information could be compromised. Moreover, most people who pay their taxes online use their online bank accounts, which means that hackers could also obtain their bank account passwords! Computers are detrimental to most people. They contribute to poor health and expose people to the risk of having their personal information hacked by viruses.
746	748	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, I wish to convey that computers are highly advantageous in our contemporary society. Have you ever required information about a state or a place that was in the spotlight of significant news, and you needed to access it promptly? Where did you turn? I am certain it was not to a book but to the computer. Without it, how would you have obtained your information? I believe computers are beneficial to our society as they can facilitate learning and inform you about when and where to enroll in activities. People engage with others from different countries, states, or continents. Next, let's explore how computers can benefit our society. Computers can aid in learning by conducting research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge. For instance, today my class and I are visiting the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to gather information on seat - belts on buses. Without computers, my class and I would not have been able to complete this task. If we had relied on books, there would not have been enough for everyone, which would have necessitated sharing. In the past, during @MONTH1, some students would monopolize the books for an extended period, preventing others from obtaining the information needed for the paper, potentially leading to a conflict in the classroom. With computers, each student in the class has access. Moreover, computers can assist in acquiring more general knowledge rapidly. By gaining more general knowledge, one becomes more intelligent. Additionally, computers can help organize activities. Computers can facilitate the registration for activities such as baseball, football, basketball, or a gym membership. With the help of computers, you do not waste time traveling to the gym to sign up; you can do it from home. Perhaps there is a waiting list for entry. You would be aware of this if you signed up online. For example, my little brother plays baseball, and my parents registered him online. All they had to do was take him to the venue to confirm the registration. I reside in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sign up, register, and pay in person. All of these tasks could have been accomplished online, as my parents did, demonstrating the usefulness of computers in society by enabling knowledge acquisition and activity registration. Do you understand why we need them in our daily lives or for various tasks? Computers are beneficial to our emerging society!
747	749	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever mislaid the book required for your homework? Have you ever missed the latest episode of your favorite show? Well, all these issues and more can be resolved through the use of a computer. The computer provides us with all the necessities. Whether it is information, games, or online platforms for chatting with friends, the computer is indispensable in our modern society. On numerous occasions, I have been in dire need of information. When working on a school report about animals, I can simply access the computer and search for whatever I desire. There is no longer a need to drive to the town library and sift through countless books and encyclopedias. I consider this a waste of time when everything you need is essentially within arm's reach, right in your home! There is no more need to spend hours searching through biographies. If you need to know state capitals, you can find the information in an instant. To me, this is a real time - saver. Not only can computers assist with information retrieval, but they also simplify school projects significantly. In my personal experience, I have needed pictures for school projects. Instead of drawing them, the internet can save both time and effort. All you have to do is print out the pictures! However, if you have an essay, say, ten pages long, who wants to write it all by hand? With a computer, you can type it out in half the time. Once completed, you can print it or even send it directly to your teacher. If it is unfinished, you can save it on a thumb - drive and use it on any computer. Overall, this is an enormous help. My final reason for the computer's value is that it offers instant gratification. Computers have millions of free games for kids to play. Additionally, there are many websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, that allow you to interact with friends. If you need to communicate with them, there is no need for a phone. Moreover, if you miss certain shows or want to watch music videos, there are dedicated websites for that. As a child, I am often away from home due to sports and school activities. If I miss something on @LOCATION1, it is highly likely to be available on the computer. You do not have to wait a week for a replay. Who wants to do that? In conclusion, I believe computers benefit people worldwide. There is no more need to drive to libraries or go out to buy games. The computer offers everything you want for free. Essentially, I think the computer is a significant time and effort - saver that every household should have. It definitely contributes to society.
748	750	1	1	I concur with the concerns raised by experts. I assert this because it is true that individuals become engrossed in the computer for extended periods, neglecting their families. Moreover, there are numerous perils online, and finally, one's brain fails to receive the necessary stimulation. Do you not think all these points hold merit? Well, if you remain unconvinced, I shall provide evidence. Firstly, individuals can become addicted to the computer to the extent that they disregard their families. Instead of spending time on the computer aimlessly browsing platforms like MySpace or Facebook, they should engage with their families by playing games such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. This is not just a theoretical claim; it is based on a personal experience. My cousin, @PERSON1, became so addicted to the computer that whenever his family attempted to organize a fun activity together, they would end up in an argument because he refused to participate. Secondly, people can encounter substantial risks online. For example, in chat sessions where you are supposed to meet individuals of your age, it is not always the case. Regularly, the news reports stories of older individuals pretending to be @NUM1 - year - olds with malicious intent. Thus, one can be exposed to a great deal of danger online. Lastly, by spending excessive time on the computer, one deprives their brain of the beneficial exercise it requires. Instead of letting the brain remain idle, one could read a book or solve a word - search puzzle; these are all excellent ways to stimulate the brain. According to recent research, experts state that individuals who spend time reading and exercising their brains perform well on tests, while those who spend most of their time on the computer tend to fail. So, do you not think I am correct? Do you not believe that spending too much time on the computer leaves less time for family, exposes you to serious risks, and deprives your brain of the necessary exercise? Have I convinced you yet?
749	751	1	1	On my part, I would like to assert that I do not concur with the view that computers are beneficial for society. There are three primary reasons for my dissent. Firstly, many individuals will forgo enjoying the outdoors. Some people will spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer. Secondly, a large number of people will gain weight due to inactivity. When one sits at a computer and becomes engrossed, they are reluctant to disengage because they are having a good time. When having fun, one tends to lose focus on other things and continues the activity without pause. Eventually, one becomes addicted and chooses to play on the computer rather than go outside and socialize with friends. Computer usage will consume all of your time. When you are bored, you seek any activity to avoid boredom. Many people consider it a good opportunity to use the computer, but when you are bored, you will remain on the computer until you have something else to do. My mother often advises me that when I am bored, I should not stay at home because excessive computer use will exacerbate the situation. There is always an alternative activity; you just need to search more diligently. My final reason is that when you sit at a computer and engage in sedentary activities, you are likely to gain weight. I have read that @NUM1 children each year will become obese, not because it is hereditary but because of inactivity. Inactivity refers to a lack of physical activity. When you consume calories without expending them, you will gain weight. Excess weight is unhealthy, and you can address this issue by finding alternative activities instead of spending your entire life on the computer. In conclusion, you may have conflicting thoughts when you feel the urge to use the computer constantly. It does not matter if you use the computer, but do not overdo it. Remember my reasons for not spending too much time on the computer: you will miss out on outdoor enjoyment, fail to find alternative activities when bored, and gain weight if you spend all your time on it.
750	752	1	1	In my perspective, I contend that computers are not the cause of people's lack of exercise or sleep. I believe it is entirely an individual's choice to spend as much time as they desire on the computer. Evidently, those who spend excessive time on the computer do not prioritize sleep. When people are on the computer, they may reduce their physical activity and start to gain weight, but this is their own decision. Eventually, they will realize the need to limit their computer time and engage in exercise. However, they should establish a time limit for computer use, as well as allocate sufficient time for proper nutrition and physical activity. Due to spending @NUM1 hours on the computer, many people miss the opportunity to interact with their family and friends. They choose to be sedentary and remain on the computer, which makes their family and friends frustrated and less likely to hang out with them. Over a few months, they may find themselves without friends. Nature offers pleasant scents, beautiful sights, yet computers keep people indoors all day! I advocate for more time spent outdoors. Additionally, computers can sometimes make children reluctant to clean their rooms or do household chores because they are addicted to the computer.
751	753	1	1	You are required to amass information for a project you are presenting at school. However, how will you promptly and effortlessly acquire knowledge about your topic? The majority of individuals will resort to one of the most prevalently utilized technological devices in the @LOCATION1, the computer. The computer is employed for rapid and straightforward research, for interacting and communicating with friends, and for personal amusement. Some individuals contend that the computer will detract from the enjoyment of nature, the time spent with family and friends, and physical exercise. Nevertheless, what if we did not possess the computer? The feasibility of research, among other things, would be significantly more arduous. For instance, computers facilitate our ability to learn about nearly anything rapidly and effortlessly. This can alleviate the stress associated with schoolwork or professional tasks. Additionally, a computer can be accessed directly from your residence, obviating the need for travel. The computer also features programs that are utilized to prepare articles, essays, slide shows, and brochures for presentations. If we did not have a computer, research would be a far more formidable challenge and might necessitate travel. Computers are one of the most common means of communicating with friends and family. Websites and email enable you to maintain contact with anyone across the globe. You can compose emails, engage in live chat, or even utilize a webcam. Emailing is analogous to sending a letter, except that it is delivered instantaneously and incurs no cost. There is also no risk of anyone intercepting your mail. Live chat involves text-based communication on the computer. Webcam usage allows for face-to-face interaction, simulating the experience of an in-person conversation. A notable advantage is that communicating via computer is entirely cost-free. Lastly, computers offer games for personal entertainment, which can alleviate boredom. The computer also aids in enhancing hand-eye coordination and helps with organization. @CAPS2, pictures, videos, and other content can be stored in files on the computer, making it convenient for you to access them at any time. Although computers may detract from certain activities, consider how much more difficult and stressful life would be without them. I believe that the computer has a positive impact on people and is a valuable technological tool.
752	754	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I firmly concur with @CAPS1 that computers are disadvantageous for various reasons. These include jeopardizing a person's health due to insufficient exercise, causing individuals to allocate more time to computers than to interacting with family and friends, and unfortunately, leading to alterations in people's attitudes and behaviors. If you desire further details, you need only continue reading. There are numerous consequences for individuals who spend excessive time on computers, such as becoming addicted to watching specific content or even to the computer itself. Nowadays, a significant number of people are required to wear glasses, and it is highly probable that the majority of them do so as a result of excessive computer use. Undoubtedly, having to wear glasses for the remainder of one's life is an undesirable outcome. Moreover, excessive computer use is detrimental to a person's health as it diverts time that could be spent on physical exercise. I am of the opinion that people should allocate more time to interacting with family and friends, as neglecting them can result in the loss of these important relationships. Family and friends are among the most crucial aspects of a person's life. Last but not least, excessive computer use can transform a person, including changes in their manners, speech patterns, and attitudes. I have presented reasons why I believe computers are not beneficial, such as endangering health, altering a person's life, and causing the loss of family and friends. The decision is now yours.
753	755	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I firmly assert that computers exert a profound and advantageous influence on society. They possess an extensive array of features, options, and capabilities. Would you genuinely attempt to dissuade your children, friends, and family from utilizing such an extraordinary invention that enriches our daily lives? Computers serve as an effective means of communication, a valuable educational resource, and a tool for preparing for the future. One of the remarkable attributes of computers is their ability to facilitate communication. You can establish an email account or a chat application to interact with friends and family. Some may question, ""Why not use a phone instead?"" However, there are compelling reasons why online communication surpasses phone calls. I recall an incident a few years ago. My cousin @PERSON2 and I were alone at her house when the phone malfunctioned. @PERSON2 went downstairs to fetch sodas when I heard a loud crash. She had fallen down the stairs. Since the phones were inoperable, I immediately turned to the computers in her room to quickly ""chat"" with my father and inform him of the situation. Subsequently, my father called an ambulance, and @PERSON2 recovered. Evidently, computers not only serve as an excellent communication medium but can also save lives. Another significant advantage of computers is their educational value. For instance, if a student is tasked with writing a school paper about the @CAPS3, they would need to conduct research. The internet browser on your computer can open up a vast realm of knowledge. All you need to do is access a search engine such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2 and enter the topic you wish to explore. In no time, you will be presented with millions of websites that can provide in - depth information on the subject. @PERSON1, a high - school teacher, states that ""@PERCENT1 of students in the school utilize computers to assist with homework and research."" Clearly, computers are an invaluable source of information. Lastly, computers are beneficial for society as they help individuals prepare for future careers. In today's workplace, many jobs require computer proficiency. A company is unlikely to hire an individual who lacks computer skills. Conversely, if you are proficient in using a computer, you have a greater chance of securing a job that can support you and your family. Studies indicate that ""@PERCENT2 of businesses involve computer use."" As computers become increasingly integral to society, it is essential to start learning about them as early as possible. In conclusion, it is evident that computers play a vital role in our society. They enhance communication, provide a wealth of knowledge, and prepare us for the workforce. With each passing day, computers contribute to the advancement of the future and make the world a better place."
754	756	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I am writing to express my concern that many individuals are devoting excessive time to computers at the expense of enjoying nature. Proponents of technological progress often assert that computers have a significant impact on people. However, it is crucial to remember the beauty and benefits of nature. I concur with experts who argue that people are spending too much time on computers and insufficient time on activities such as exercise, enjoying the outdoors, and interacting with family and friends. In many cases, family members and friends feel neglected as individuals become overly engrossed in their computers. It seems as though they no longer value these relationships. Appreciating nature and spending time with loved ones is of utmost importance. @PERCENT1 of my friends agree that people should reduce their use of electronic devices, as it can have adverse effects on both the brain and eyesight. Therefore, more and more people should curtail their computer usage. @PERSON1 of Yale University has conducted comprehensive research and demonstrated that excessive computer use can be detrimental. I wholeheartedly support his view that there should be a time limit on computer usage, allowing individuals to allocate time for enjoying nature and engaging in alternative activities, such as listening to soothing music. I am confident that you will agree that people should minimize the negative impact of excessive computer use on themselves. I sincerely hope that you will support my stance, as breaking the habit of excessive computer use and spending more time with family and friends is a worthy endeavor.
755	757	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 experts are alarmed by the current population's extensive computer usage. I wholeheartedly concur, as a significant number of children and adults are classified as obese or overweight. Technological advancements have reached a point where machines can perform daily tasks, highlighting the growing laziness among some @CAPS3 in modern society. People often remain sedentary in front of computer screens, disregarding the importance of exercise, enjoying nature, and socializing with friends and family. Undoubtedly, computer use hinders one's ability to engage in real - life social interactions, as opposed to the virtual interactions facilitated by online chatting. The development of applications that connect people via computers has diminished the incentive to leave one's home. With video - conferencing capabilities, one can virtually meet others, yet this often leads to a sense of isolation and disconnection from the real world. For instance, while your friends are having a party, you may be absent as they are unlikely to have a webcam set up. Another drawback of computer use is the widespread neglect of nature. In the digital age, the allure of the outdoors is often forgotten. Although you can watch videos and view pictures of nature, these experiences pale in comparison to the refreshing breeze on your face or the rare sightings of wild animals in their natural habitat. Moreover, being in nature and outdoors can inspire individuals to maintain or initiate a healthy diet, as the natural environment serves as a reminder of the importance of health. It also provides an ideal setting for physical exercise. As is well - known, obesity is a prevalent issue in the @LOCATION1 and globally. Currently, the prevalence of overweight individuals is at an all - time high, resulting in numerous health problems and cases of depression. In my opinion, this is closely related to computer use, especially when combined with the consumption of fast food. People have failed to recognize the necessity of regular exercise. In conclusion, it is evident that computer use has had a negative impact on our society. While moderate computer use may be acceptable, similar to the consumption of sweets or fatty foods in moderation, it should not replace the benefits of exercise. Clearly, we must reduce our reliance on technology and actively engage in physical activities.
756	758	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that individuals are expending an excessive amount of time on computers. I hold this view, and I have @CAPS7 rationales for it. The first rationale is that people squander money on it. Moreover, everything one can obtain from the computer can be acquired from books. And finally, the @CAPS2 reason is due to the ""@CAPS8 crises."" The first reason for stating that people spend an excessive amount of time on the computer is that people waste an inordinate amount of money on it. I believe this because of your electricity bill and the @CAPS3 bill. The electricity bill of those who own computers is always extremely high, and as a result, they are compelled to pay @NUM1 or more dollars for electricity. This is also true because of the constant charging of laptops or the operation of computers. Additionally, they have to pay @NUM2 and odd dollars on the @CAPS3 bill to maintain the @CAPS3 connection. So, that amounts to a total of @NUM3 and odd dollars going to waste. The second reason for this is that anything and everything one can access on the @CAPS3 can be found in books. I believe this because one should consider where website creators source their information. Reading books also enhances one's knowledge, enabling one to promptly provide an answer at any time. Another reason is that some websites are not always accurate in their information. The third and final reason for this is that we are all grappling with this ""@CAPS8 crisis."" @CAPS7 individuals are becoming increasingly inactive each day due to computers. This causes fewer people to be physically active and less fit. And the @LOCATION1 is suffering as a consequence. Fewer and fewer people are enlisting in the army because of this crisis, and unfortunately, computers are contributing to the global crisis. I earnestly hope that @CAPS2 letter has assisted you in comprehending @CAPS2 perspective on this subject, demonstrating that people spend an excessive amount of time on their computers because it is a waste of money, anything obtainable from a computer can be obtained from a book, and due to the ""@CAPS8 crisis."
757	759	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have been informed of the concerns of numerous scientists regarding computers. Computers have ushered us into the @DATE1 and have advanced our society; however, they are detrimental to the health and education of our children. Owing to computers, children and adults worldwide are spending less time with family and friends, they are not engaging in athletic activities, and they are encountering health problems. Due to the proliferation of technology, children and adults are not allocating time to their families. Computers are undermining family bonds. For example, a study conducted at @ORGANIZATION1 revealed that families with a greater number of computers in their homes communicated less. Children are conversing with their friends online or visiting social networking sites instead of interacting face - to - face with their family members. Additionally, computers are making it arduous for families to have meals together. When children are on the computer, they are reluctant to disengage. This obsession with technology is impeding family growth and success in school. Computers are depriving children of a superior education. Athletic activities are also being adversely affected. Instead of participating in sports teams, children spend all day on websites. The electricity that powers computers emits radiation. Exposure to this radiation could result in brain damage or even death. When my aunt purchased a computer for the first time, she complained of persistent and severe headaches. This was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer. Another health risk is obesity. When children sit in front of a computer for extended periods, their appetite increases. These children eat out of boredom. While using the computer, users consume food and gain weight due to the lack of exercise. They may become obese and potentially develop diabetes. Therefore, computers are causing less communication within families, a decline in exercise, and health concerns. The consequences of misusing this technology are catastrophic and could be life - threatening. Thus, I implore you to minimize computer usage or face the associated consequences.
758	760	1	1	Computers are remarkable as they can assist with any need. One can shop, pay bills, and even book a flight for a vacation on them. However, people are devoting an excessive amount of time to computers. They should only use them for a specific duration rather than throughout the day. Many individuals spend more than an appropriate amount of time on the computer. People often remain on the computer for hours without even realizing it. They stay up all @TIME1 working or playing games. Over time, this will inevitably have a negative impact on the body. Since @CAPS2 you are on the device all day, you expend little to no energy. Consequently, you spend @CAPS1 nights tossing and turning in bed. This leads to feeling dreadful in the @TIME2. If @CAPS2 you continue this pattern @TIME1, it will have a detrimental effect on your body. I am convinced that those who spend all their time on the computer will eventually become overweight. If @CAPS2 you are seated in a chair all day, you get absolutely no exercise. When you eat, you do not burn off the calories, which leads to weight gain and obesity. As a result, your body becomes extremely unhealthy and is likely to develop health issues. When people are on the computer, they end up neglecting nature. They miss out on the delightful warmth of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, or the opportunity to play in the snow, build @CAPS5, forts, or have a @CAPS6 fight. They even miss out on simply going outside for a walk because they are @CAPS7 @CAPS8 inside their house, fixated on the computer. Using the computer takes a significant toll on the body. It can cause health problems and other general issues. Therefore, people should only use the computer for a portion of their day. The rest of the day, they should be outdoors, walking around, perhaps playing with pets, children, or friends. As long as they are out of their chair and not on the computer, getting some exercise.
759	761	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, computers are a valuable tool when conducting a school report or similar tasks. However, @CAPS2 we truly need these computers? When utilizing a computer for a school project, @CAPS3 can be a nuisance. One of the numerous problems people encounter while using a computer is freezing. When working on a project and your computer freezes, @CAPS3 can be extremely time - consuming. Another issue is pop - ups. Pop - ups can cause viruses, and when your computer gets a virus, @CAPS3 leads to it becoming extremely slow. This brings us to our next problem, slowness. When a computer becomes slow, @CAPS3 is highly inefficient. There are several problems and risks associated with computers. One health problem is that you can become a recluse and stay indoors all day because you are overly attached to the computer. Another problem is that you can become extremely obese because you are not getting any physical exercise. One risk of using a computer is that you could end up joining a Facebook, @CAPS1, or MySpace, and meet someone who is pretending to be someone they are not and be abducted by a molester! There are other alternatives you can consider instead of using a computer. One alternative is to visit the local library and check out books on the topic you need information about. Another alternative is to ask your teacher if they could lend you a class textbook. But the primary alternative is to switch from computers to traditional books! So now, @CAPS3's your decision: ""@CAPS2 do we really need computers, or can we live without them?"" @CAPS3's your choice!"
760	762	1	1	Computers are an astonishing scientific wonder that significantly benefits humanity today. However, computers can be either advantageous or disadvantageous, depending on how they are used. They can simplify homework, facilitate communication with others, and provide entertainment such as @CAPS1 and video games at the click of a button. On the other hand, computers can be distracting, addictive, and fatiguing. It is crucial to be aware of the pros and cons of computers. For example, the search engine, @ORGANIZATION1, is a user - friendly website that can be extremely helpful. If you are struggling with a concept or problem, simply type it into @ORGANIZATION1, and links to websites that can help answer your questions will appear. There is also a website called @LOCATION1. This website serves as an all - purpose dictionary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia, and translator. I even have an application for it on my cellphone. However, technology can also be a distraction. Social networking websites like Facebook, gaming websites like @CAPS3, and websites like @CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing your homework. Procrastination is easy to succumb to. Self - control is the only way to avoid this problem. Budgeting your time so that you can both complete your homework and use the computer is also very important. One highly useful feature of computers is the online textbook. Fortunately, most large books can now be formatted for use on a computer. Instead of carrying a @NUM1 - pound textbook, you can use a @NUM1 - megabyte book on the internet. This makes commuting to and from school much more convenient. Additionally, textbooks often take up a lot of desk space, but all you need is the space a computer occupies. Studying is also made easier in this way. All the capabilities of a computer are excellent. However, this can also prevent us from going outside, exercising, and interacting with real people in the real world. This over - reliance on computers can be detrimental. As a society, we are overly connected. Our status, feelings, friends, and life position are constantly in need of updating. Distractions are ubiquitous. Facebook, for instance, is highly addictive. You are immersed in a virtual landscape. Self - control is truly the only way to disconnect from the computer and engage with the real world. Overall, computers are great, but you must know when and for how long to use them. They offer several benefits, including entertainment, communication, and access to information. However, these same features can be just as distracting as they are helpful. Knowing this, I hope that society can carefully consider the pros and cons of using computers.
761	763	1	1	To the Local Newspaper, Computers exert a substantial influence on contemporary society. While numerous individuals rely heavily on them, some hold opposing views. In my perspective, computers yield a positive impact on people. They are highly entertaining, capable of facilitating the reconnection with long - lost friends and maintaining communication with them. Moreover, they prove beneficial for homework. Kindly continue reading to understand the rationale behind my stance. Firstly, computers offer entertainment. There is a vast array of games available, ranging from dress - up to educational ones, which are suitable for young children aged five to six. As indicated in the writing prompt, these games enhance hand - eye coordination. Additionally, computers assist in reuniting long - lost friends. There are websites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and Yahoo, that aid in finding people and keeping in touch with family. In the absence of a phone, the computer serves as a reliable alternative. Lastly, computers are helpful for homework. Sometimes, even without internet access, a built - in calculator is available. A widely used nationwide website, edhelper.com, helps children improve according to their level by providing worksheets. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people as they are entertaining, facilitate communication, and support academic work. Please consider my reasons.
762	764	1	1	Dear local Newspaper, In my view, computers have been exerting a detrimental effect on individuals of all ages. I opine that spending excessive time on the computer may cause one to miss out on outdoor activities. Moreover, if one remains seated on a chair throughout the day, it is evident that physical activity will decline. Based on past experiences, I have learned that computer games can be highly addictive. Computers impose negative impacts on people, and I believe we should pause and reflect on our actions. Most likely, spending all day on the computer will result in missing out on activities like sports. For instance, @PERCENT1 of Americans play soccer. During the beautiful fall season when the leaves are changing color, one may miss the opportunity to play soccer and appreciate the beauty of nature due to an engrossing computer screen. Another captivating experience that may be forfeited is hiking. When reaching the summit during a hike, one can observe houses with people, similar to couch potatoes, sitting indoors in front of their computers. Simple activities can be sacrificed for the sake of an addictive game. The computer operates on a cause - and - effect principle. One may think they are merely playing Farm Town or chatting on Facebook, but in the future, they will miss the beauty of nature and sports. This lack of physical activity due to computer use can lead to weight gain. A recent study revealed that @PERCENT2 of children are obese because of computer games. Consider my friend, @PERSON1, who used to enjoy outdoor sports until the advent of @CAPS2 on the computer. Now, at only @NUM2 years old, he weighs @NUM1 pounds. Clearly, prolonged sitting leads to inactivity and weight gain. Do you wish to experience this? Join me in informing others about the negative effects of computers. Lastly, engaging in computer games or chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 can cause procrastination. For example, if you are chatting with your girlfriend in Spain, you will likely postpone schoolwork, @CAPS3, and other @CAPS4 that require attention. Eventually, it will be time for bed, and nothing will have been accomplished, whether it was due to trying to reach level @NUM3 or chatting with your girlfriend. If you are not yet convinced, a recent scientific study reported that spending six hours a day on the computer for a week can deteriorate your vision from @NUM4 @NUM4 to @NUM6 @NUM6. Although it may not seem significant now, excessive computer use can lead to missing out on the beauty of nature and sports, as well as causing weight gain and academic neglect. Help me spread awareness about these negative effects.
763	765	1	1	Dear editor, I firmly believe that people should have access to computers. The reasons are as follows: emailing is extremely time - efficient, it enables learning about distant places, and it allows communication with people worldwide. After considering these aspects, most individuals are likely to concur. Firstly, emailing is far more rapid than traditional mail. Sending an email takes merely five seconds to reach the recipient, whereas regular mail can take from one day to a week. Moreover, emailing saves both time and resources for the government. It is significantly faster than what I like to term “snail mail.” Secondly, computers provide an opportunity to learn about different countries, whether they are nearby or far away. Without a computer, it would be challenging to learn about @LOCATION1 from the comfort of one's living room. Similarly, information about an earthquake in Chile would be difficult to obtain. Computers serve as a modern - day educational tool for children. Lastly, there are numerous ways to communicate with people online, such as through Facebook, MySpace, AIM, and video chat. Instead of making a call on the @CAPS1, one can simply engage in a video chat. In conclusion, computers offer several advantages. They facilitate fast emailing, enable learning about foreign countries from home, and allow online communication. I am convinced that computers are beneficial, and I wonder if you share the same view.
764	766	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever utilized a computer for non - business purposes? If not, I recommend trying it during your leisure time. Computers have a profound impact on people, offering entertainment, assistance in various tasks, and access to a vast range of information on websites, from clothing to store location maps. There are three compelling reasons why you should agree with me. Firstly, individuals have the right to make their own choices, as the government is preoccupied with more pressing matters and cannot dictate our actions. The Constitution also affirms our right to independent thought. Secondly, during cold weather, it may not be ideal to venture outdoors to enjoy nature. Nature is more enjoyable during the @DATE1 and @DATE2, when the temperature is neither too hot nor too cold, and the sun is pleasant. In today's technological era, it is prudent to leverage the available technology, such as generators, which were unavailable in the past. Finally, computers enable online interaction with friends and family. I hope this letter has influenced your perspective, and thank you for your time.
765	767	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2's opinion on this matter is that computers are constantly in use. People employ them to communicate with friends and family online, complete homework, and engage in recreational activities such as playing games. I use the computer to monitor the performance of @CAPS2 teams. Computers are beneficial to society for several reasons. Firstly, they facilitate communication with friends and family through platforms like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. This is a valid reason as we all have family members, and it provides a convenient means of staying in touch. For friends, especially those who have moved away, it offers a way to maintain contact. However, a drawback is that some individuals, such as older men, may misuse the computer for child pornography and engage in inappropriate conversations with young girls, which is unacceptable. Secondly, computers are valuable for homework. They provide access to a wealth of information, making them useful for various academic tasks. For example, if one needs to research history, all the necessary resources are available on a computer. Thirdly, computers offer a plethora of entertainment options. They have games suitable for all ages, from simple matching games for @CAPS2's @NUM1 - year - old sister to games for teenagers. For me, the computer is great as it allows me to follow the progress of @CAPS2 football teams and @CAPS7. In conclusion, @CAPS2 believes that computers are used extensively for communication, homework, and entertainment. People use them to connect with loved ones, complete academic work, and have fun. I hope this perspective helps in understanding the role of computers in our lives.
766	768	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper, I am firmly convinced that computers offer substantial positive benefits to society. These technological advancements have the potential to significantly enhance people's lives. One way computers assist is that students can complete their schoolwork online and access their teachers' web pages. Another advantage of computers is that whenever individuals require information about any place or thing, they can rely on the internet for assistance. Most importantly, computers serve as a crucial means of communication. People depend on computers for scheduling and maintaining contact with their acquaintances. Without computers, students would face greater difficulties. When a student forgets their homework, they can simply visit their teacher's online page to check the assignment for that evening. Additionally, students can benefit from online textbooks. If a student is unable to carry @NUM1 pounds of books home, they can utilize their online textbooks. Nowadays, the internet is replete with valuable information and educational websites. Teachers can also enable students to conduct online research for projects and participate in online educational activities. Not only do computers aid in education, but they are also well - known information centers. If people wish to learn about a restaurant, store, or product, they can do so online. Moreover, many individuals plan to visit certain destinations but are unsure of the route. The internet provides them with efficient directions to reach their destinations. An extremely useful aspect of the internet is the ability to purchase and order items online. Before making a purchase, people can gather comprehensive information about the product and compare prices to find the best deal. People can even order groceries to their new home if they are occupied! I firmly believe that the internet is the primary mode of communication among people. For instance, the team manager of my soccer team always emails me the times and locations of upcoming games or practices. I would be disoriented without these emails, which I rely on. Businesses also rely heavily on the internet to maintain contact with their clients, which is essential for their operations. The use of web conferences reduces travel expenses and allows companies to engage in business globally. Above all, people rely on social networking sites to stay connected with friends, keep abreast of the news, and have enjoyable conversations. Without the internet, a significant portion of the world's communication would be disrupted, which would be detrimental. Computers undoubtedly have a positive impact on society. As an educational resource, they are highly beneficial. They are also the most comprehensive information database and are widely used. Most importantly, without computers, the world would be in chaos due to the loss of its primary communication medium. People are aware of the need to limit their time indoors and know when to go outside, have fun, and breathe fresh air. Therefore, computers have a positive influence on society and are an indispensable asset in daily life.
767	769	1	1	Dear Readers, I recognize that some individuals are concerned that excessive computer use is detrimental. However, I disagree. Computers facilitate communication between family members living far apart. They also allow us to view images of places we may not otherwise see. Moreover, computers are invaluable for schoolwork. I know a family whose son is serving in @LOCATION1. He brought his laptop so he could video - chat with his family, making it seem as if he were never away. Without this technology, his family would constantly worry about his well - being. One need not have a family member at war to use a computer for communication. Have you ever wondered what @LOCATION2 looks like? You can find out without traveling there; simply search on your computer. If you live in a city with limited natural scenery, you can use the computer to explore the outside world. Viewing such sights in @MONTH1 may inspire you to travel, and family vacations strengthen family bonds. A study indicates that @PERCENT1 of families who go on vacations have strong relationships. A computer is essential for school. It is an excellent research tool. @PERCENT2 of failing students do not use a computer for homework. There are also numerous educational websites for studying. There is a student in my school who used to fail most of his classes because he never used a computer. His friend advised him to use one at home when he had difficulties, and he followed the advice. He used a computer to prepare for a test the next day and ended up scoring @PERCENT1 on it. Whether you use a computer for homework, communicating with friends and family, it is one of the most significant inventions of all time.
768	770	1	1	Computers are of utmost importance; I am unaware of anyone who does not require one. Nevertheless, some individuals claim that computers distract us from exercise, appreciation of nature, and interaction with family and friends. Do I concur? No, I disagree with this assertion because computers are a modern technological marvel. They argue that computers impede social interaction, yet computers are the preeminent means of communicating with long - distance friends and family. @CAPS1 Without a computer, how would business professionals carry out their work? Additionally, we constantly need computers for research. Computers captivate the attention of many teenagers. Most of the websites we use are for social interaction. The two most popular social platforms, MySpace and Facebook, are well - known to almost everyone. Nine out of ten people use these platforms to interact. Imagine if we did not have computers; we would be unable to communicate with our long - distance friends and family. My aunt has a Facebook account, and her friends live in @CAPS2. They interact regularly. Although they @CAPS1 have phones, computers with webcams allow face - to - face communication. Businesspeople rely heavily on computers, especially laptops. Without computers, how would they manage their schedules, receive notifications from their bosses, and perform other work - related tasks? Most people work during the week and visit their family on weekends. Since a job provides income, a computer is indispensable. Google is the leading search engine. If you want to know the start time of a movie, you will likely search on your computer. If you have a research paper due, you will definitely use a computer. We rely on computers for everything. For example, if I ask my dad the square root of pi, he will tell me to Google it. This is a common use of computers for research. So, if you think computers are a waste of time, reconsider. They enable communication with friends, are essential for business, and are excellent research tools. However, here is a piece of advice: do not spend the entire day on the computer. Put on your walking shoes, go outside, and enjoy the fresh air.
769	771	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, despite the fact that computers contain exclusive information, I do not believe they have a positive impact on people. The majority of students today are engrossed in computers when they could be taking care of their physical health, such as exercising or simply going outdoors. People should appreciate the wonders of nature instead of being sedentary in front of a computer. Computers not only affect individuals but also have an impact on family and friends. Spending time on a computer reduces the opportunity for social interaction. Moreover, different websites may expose users to inappropriate content and cause trouble. I firmly hold the view that computers have a detrimental effect on people. In @LOCATION1, there is already a significant number of obese individuals. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are not in good physical condition, and a large proportion of obese people admit to owning a computer. Computers are alluring, and some people spend hours sitting in front of them. What about exercise or outdoor activities? Computers harm our bodies by luring us in when we could be enjoying nature. I will undoubtedly argue that computers have a negative impact on humans. Computers affect not only the body but also the mind. My sister has a computer in her bedroom, and I rarely see her. She spends all her time there, and when my mom calls her for dinner, it takes more than five @CAPS2 to get her away from the computer. Computers isolate people from society. The lack of interaction caused by computer use affects friends and family. It is disrespectful to neglect friends and family to play on computers. This undermines people's social well - being. As they ignore their loved ones, these people will eventually stop trying to interact with them. When these computer enthusiasts face difficulties, there may be no one to support them. Computers clearly have an adverse effect on their users. How would you feel if a large amount of your personal information was made public? Nowadays, there is a high risk of this happening through computers. Websites like @CAPS4, MySpace, or Twitter store your information, and with a single click, it can be exposed to the world. Computers have a history of causing such problems. Some users are unaware of the consequences, and if inappropriate information or pictures are shared, it can have a severe negative impact on their careers or education. Computers lead people to make poor choices, and it is evident that people should reduce their computer usage. Many agree that computers disadvantage people in various ways. Whether it is by compromising physical health by keeping people indoors or ruining social relationships, computers are harmful to both physical and social well - being. They can expose personal information and pose risks. They will have a significant negative impact on the future and the lives of people.
770	772	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I earnestly propose that individuals should allocate more time away from the computer. Instead, they ought to engage in more physical exercise, partake in outdoor activities, and, most importantly, spend quality time with family and friends. I believe the most effective way to persuade everyone to concur with me is to compose a passage elucidating why I advocate for people to spend less time on the computer. The primary reason for people to cease squandering time on the computer is to engage in more exercise. Regular exercise can be extremely beneficial as a sedentary lifestyle is associated with poor health. Engaging in more physical activity can also help prevent diabetes, as many people develop this condition due to a lack of physical fitness. Another reason why I emphasize the importance of exercise is that it can mitigate the risk of diseases and health problems in old age. Another alternative to spending time on the computer is to participate in outdoor activities. Outdoor activities can be highly rewarding, especially for those unaccustomed to playing a friendly game of football with friends. I recall a time when I first started going outside; it was incredibly enjoyable. I also believe that more people should spend time on outdoor activities because of the beauty of nature. Taking a walk on a pleasant @DATE1 day to feel the gentle breeze and inhale the fragrant scents can be invigorating. Finally, I advocate for spending more time away from the computer to allow for more quality time with family. Spending time with family is far more significant than socializing with friends online. I remember once when I visited my cousin's house; initially, we were strangers, but through spending time together, we now know each other well. Moreover, spending time with family provides an opportunity to learn more about them. In conclusion, you now understand the three reasons why I believe people should engage in activities other than computer use: exercise, outdoor activities, and spending time with family.
771	773	1	1	Did you know that computers are the top - selling electronic device globally? I contend that computers are rendering our society a more erudite and intelligent realm. Moreover, computers facilitate old friends and family members to maintain contact. Ultimately, I believe they are advantageous to our society as they cultivate excellent hand - eye coordination. Studies have indicated that @PERCENT1 of individuals growing up with home computers secure high - paying jobs! Computers are highly sophisticated pieces of equipment, and if one knows how to operate a computer, they will most likely have a lucrative career. Additionally, nearly every occupation, from doctors to police officers to cashiers in stores, involves computers, and to pursue these careers, one must be proficient in using a computer. This is merely one of the numerous reasons I believe computers will benefit our society.  Secondly, I opine that this technological advancement benefits society as it enables family, friends, and colleagues to stay connected. Have you ever reminisced and wished you could meet your former high - school friends or distant family members? @CAPS1 computers are among the most prevalent means to achieve this. With new platforms like @CAPS2, Twitter, or even traditional email services, people are connecting across the globe. Another way computers assist old friends in staying in touch is through the built - in video cameras. Family, friends, and colleagues can visually interact from different corners of the world. A simple message via one of these platforms can brighten someone's day and perhaps yours as well.  Finally, I believe that computers benefit our society as they teach hand - eye coordination and other life skills. How do you think individuals can shoot a gun accurately and swiftly, or how can a baseball player time their swing perfectly? All these abilities rely on hand - eye coordination, which is best honed through computers. Moreover, people can save lives by simply typing information about a hurricane, tornado, or any other event. However, if they lack computer skills, many people may get injured or lose their lives. These are just three of the many reasons I believe computers are beneficial to our society. So, reconsider the negative remarks people make about computers.
772	774	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the utilization of computers by @CAPS1 is a positive phenomenon. I assert this because the web offers a plethora of activities. For instance, Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace are all social networking platforms. Additionally, there are video - sharing platforms such as YouTube. Moreover, @CAPS1 acquire the skill of rapid typing. Social networking sites are advantageous for @CAPS1. Teenagers can engage in conversations, forge new friendships, and share their thoughts. For example, on Twitter, one can post tweets; on Facebook, one can join groups and express support for various entities; on MySpace, one can send messages. Teens alleviate a significant amount of stress through the web. Videos are a great source of entertainment when one is bored. Simply access YouTube and enjoy a few laughs. Teens who frequent YouTube become more sociable. For example, they can learn new dance moves. Additionally, video platforms feature comedic content, which enriches daily life. @CAPS2 is beneficial for those working in an office or a business. Teens learn to type to streamline their lives. For example, rapid @CAPS2 is akin to texting. @CAPS2 is like writing a letter electronically. So, embrace @CAPS2.  In essence, computers enhance the lives of teenagers. In a way, it is @CAPS3. All individuals should possess a computer. Just bear in mind that social sites, video sites, and @CAPS2 enhance the quality of life.
773	775	1	1	Indeed, I firmly believe that we should continue to utilize computers as they enable us to maintain communication with other countries globally, establish a balance, and simplify our lives. Firstly, computers facilitate our connection with other countries around the world. Without computers, we would be unable to @CAPS1 or even engage in video messaging regarding significant events. Secondly, we must strike a balance between computer usage, exercise, and face - to - face interaction. However, computers can assist us in communicating with family and friends through emailing or video chatting, which also helps us stay connected.  Lastly, using computers simplifies life. For example, it is far more convenient to write an @CAPS1 than a letter, and instant messaging is easier than making a phone call. Moreover, for school projects, one can enhance the quality of their work by adding pictures and using different fonts, which is much more effective than hand - writing. Therefore, computers are not a waste of time as they help us stay in touch with other countries, establish a balance, and simplify our lives.
774	776	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, computers are an indispensable part of life. They confer benefits not only upon the community but also the entire world! They offer educational opportunities to anyone with internet access. Secondly, they serve as a medium of communication. Additionally, computers can be a source of amusement and entertainment.  As is well - known, education is one of the most crucial aspects of anyone's life. Where would we be without the aid of a computer? Consider how frequently you have used @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1 to search for answers to unknown questions. It is a substantial number, isn't it? I conduct research whenever a random question pops into my mind. Envision how challenging it would be to answer a question without a computer to rely on. Furthermore, there are now online courses available for students. Some college students need to access their professors' web pages to find assignments and learn how to complete them. Moreover, how would students worldwide know their homework if they cannot check the @PERSON1 homepage? I check it almost daily after returning from school. It is commendable that teachers take the initiative to post homework. Without computers, there would be a higher proportion of students neglecting their homework.  @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 individuals in @LOCATION2 utilizes some form of online communication program. Whether it is @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, perhaps even YouTube, or simply a basic email, virtually everyone has one. How else are you supposed to communicate with your friends after school? Do you expect us to spend hours on the phone? Anyone with a teenager at home is well aware of this. Additionally, computers enable deaf individuals to communicate. They simply type their messages, and the content is conveyed. I recall when a blind and deaf woman visited our school and demonstrated the use of a special communication program. Moreover, teachers and parents use email to discuss academic matters and their children. Evidently, communication is an essential requirement. Hence, computers are beneficial to society.  It is highly improbable that anyone over the age of @NUM3 has never played a computer game in their lifetime, unless, of course, they lack internet access. I used to play computer games, but they started to slow down my computer, so my father told me to stop or risk losing computer privileges. Oops! Nevertheless, you can use the computer to search for cheats in video games. Come on, admit it; you or your children have done this. Additionally, you can use specific software like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to create cover pages for projects or presentations for your corporate business. In other words, computers are a source of enjoyment.  As can be seen, computers are extremely educational. They provide search engines that allow us to find answers to any question, whether it pertains to foreign destinations or movies. Additionally, without computers, our communication with others would be severely limited. How would we email friends in @LOCATION3 without them? Finally, computers offer a means of entertainment. Clearly, computers are beneficial.
775	777	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, Computers are a neccessity to life. They benefit not only the community but the whole world! They provide education for anyone who has access to the internet. Secondly, it's a form of communication. Also, computers can be fun and entertaining. As you know, education is one of the most important things in anyone's life. Where would we be without a computer to help? Think about how many times you've used @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1 to search something you didn't know the answer to. It's a lot, right? I do research everytime I get a random question jammed in my head. Imagine how tough it would be without a computer to rely on when you have no idea how to answer something. Another thing is there are online courses now for students. Some college students have to look up their assignments and how to do them on their professors web page. Also, how world students know what their homework is if they can't check the @PERSON1 homepage? I check it almost everyday when I come home from school. It's great that the teachers care enough to post the homework. Without computers, we'd have a higher percentage of students not doing their homework. @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in @LOCATION2 has some form of online communication program. Whether it's @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, maybe even youtube, or just a simple e-mail, practically everyone has one. How else are yousupposed to talk to your friends after school? What do you expect us to do call them? Then wwwe would be on the phone for hours! Anybody with a teen at home knows that. Also, computers help deaf people talk. They just type in what they want to say and out it comes.I remember when a lady came to our school who was blind and deaf and she demonstrated how to use that special program. Another reason is teachers and parents use e-mail to talk about academics and their children. Clearly communication is a must have. Therefore, computers are a benefit to society. There is no way that anybody over the age of @NUM3 has never played a computer game sometime in their life. Except, of course, if they don't have internet access. I know I used to play computer games, but they started to slow down my computer so my dad told me I had to stop or I can't use the computer anymore. Woops! Still, you can use the computer to look up cheats on video games. Oh come on like you haven't done that! Or at least your children have. Also, you can use specific programs like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to create a cover page for a project or a presentation for your corporal business. In other words, computers are pleasurable. As you can see, computers are extremely educational. They provide search engines to figure out anything you're ever wanted to know about. Like, foreign places or movies. Anything. Also, we wouldn't have as much communication with people. How would we e-mail friends in @LOCATION3 without computers? Finally, you can find pleasure in computers. They are beneficial.
776	778	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am uncertain if my understanding is accurate, yet are you genuinely contemplating halting technological advancement? Promptly reconsider this, as that @MONTH1 could be the gravest error you ever commit. Computers can cultivate hand - eye coordination and impart highly valuable knowledge. Moreover, they assist us in maintaining close connections with our family and friends.  Firstly, approximately @PERCENT1 of individuals assert that they utilize the computer daily to augment their knowledge. This can be as straightforward as visiting @ORGANIZATION1! and uncovering the latest news. This is ten times more convenient than accessing the @CAPS1 and awaiting details on the desired news item. I conducted a survey, and @NUM1 students reported using their computers every night to delve deeper into their social studies or science units. Hindering computer advancement is tantamount to impeding learning progress. Is this truly what you desire?  Secondly, @PERSON1, a children's physician, states, ""Computers endow children with the hand - eye coordination requisite for excelling in sports."" I concur! Sports such as baseball, soccer, and basketball all demand a substantial degree of hand - eye coordination. Without it, students will underperform and may ultimately quit. I understand that if I faced long - term difficulties in sports, I would abandon them. If teenagers abandon sports, they will lack an activity to keep them fit. This could lead to numerous children developing obesity problems.  Lastly, impeding computer advancement implies severing connections with family and friends. Computers offer numerous platforms like Facebook or MySpace to connect with loved ones. You can also use @CAPS3 or Skype to chat or engage in video calls. Yes, perhaps computers encroach on family time, but what about relatives in @LOCATION1 whom you haven't seen in over a year? Don't you wish to spend time with them? You can set time limits for yourself to avoid excessive computer use. In this way, you can communicate with all your loved ones. Would you want to be the one shattering the hopes of a child longing to converse with or see their grandparents?  In conclusion, I recall chatting and laughing with my friends on the computer when @CAPS6 was ill, and they cheered me up. Don't deprive me of such experiences! Continue to enhance computers so that I can expand my knowledge, improve my hand - eye coordination, and stay connected with distant friends and family."
777	779	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Excessive technology! Computers exert a detrimental impact on individuals. Firstly, our nation needs to engage in more physical activity rather than remaining sedentary. Secondly, we are not allocating sufficient time to environmental conservation. Thirdly, we are losing the ability to communicate effectively with those around us.  Our country grapples with the issue of obesity. While many attribute it to fast food, it is also due to people spending excessive time using computers and neglecting physical fitness. Prior to the advent of computers, people were significantly more active and healthier. We must aid our nation in regaining its physical well - being by diverting our attention from computers, even if only for a brief period, and engage in exercise!  Another reason is that computers not only affect individuals negatively but also our environment. We spend an inordinate amount of time indoors with technology and show little concern for the world around us. In the past, people used to plant gardens and trees, but such thoughts rarely cross our minds today. The prevalence of electronics is causing people to forget about nature, and this situation must change.  The final reason for the negative impact of computers is the decline in face - to - face communication. If we rely excessively on technology to communicate, we are losing the ability to interact effectively in person, which undermines relationships with family and friends. Therefore, we need to start valuing the people around us and not always depend on technology.  In conclusion, it is evident that computers have a negative impact on people. We need to exercise more, contribute to environmental protection, and communicate better with friends and family. We should not eliminate computers but rather step back and pay attention to the world around us.
778	780	1	1	An increasing number of people are utilizing computers on a daily basis; however, I contend that this does not benefit our society. People are devoting excessive time to computers and insufficient time to exercise and maintain good health. Additionally, computer users are spending less time with their family and friends.  As people use computers more frequently, they exercise less and are less likely to stay healthy. Professor @PERSON1 conducted a study indicating that individuals who spend more than @NUM1 hours a day on the computer are overweight and do not exercise regularly. He further warns that if these habits persist throughout their lives, they are likely to become obese and more prone to dying from a heart attack before the age of @NUM2. I have also witnessed changes in my community's health due to computers. Last year, a friend of mine weighed @NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly. However, after getting a computer, he stopped exercising and gained over @NUM4 lbs. He is now much slower and can barely do more than a few push - ups. Clearly, the increasing use of computers is leading to an unhealthy lifestyle.  Moreover, computers not only contribute to an unhealthy lifestyle but also reduce the time people spend with their family and friends. Studies reveal that @PERCENT1 of children who use computers spend less time with their families. While this may not seem significant at first glance, the same study shows that @PERCENT2 of children who spend less time with their families grow up to be lonely and may even commit suicide due to depression. I recall a new student at our school who was initially a friendly and happy child. However, after a year of excessive computer use, he became withdrawn, stopped keeping in touch with his friends, and distanced himself from his parents. Eventually, he ran away from home and has not been found since. Evidently, computer use can lead to social isolation and depression.  In conclusion, although more and more people are using computers daily, I firmly believe that this trend is not beneficial for our society. People are spending too much time on computers, neglecting exercise and social interactions. It is clear that the overuse of computers is having a negative impact on our health and relationships.
779	781	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, the editor of the @LOCATION1 Citizen, I have become aware from some residents in @LOCATION1 that there are concerns about the negative effects of computers and technology. I have also noticed that some people overly rely on this technology. Therefore, I am writing to express my views on this issue.  I believe that the new technology is having a detrimental impact on our daily lives, specifically in terms of physical activity, appreciation of nature, and social interaction. With the advent of computers and related technologies, people are easily distracted and less inclined to exercise. This is particularly concerning for our youth, as it may lead to obesity, poor health, and lethargy. @PERSON1, we cannot allow this to happen to our young generation, as they are the future of our state and country.  Another reason to limit computer use is that exercise has been proven to boost energy levels and enhance mood. In contrast, a poll shows that @PERCENT1 of people experience headaches and fatigue after using the computer for an extended period. Moreover, the prevalence of technology has led to a decline in outdoor activities. My mother once told me that in her youth, she was encouraged to play outside from @NUM1 am until around @NUM2 pm. I believe parents should still encourage their children to engage in outdoor activities, which may eventually become a natural habit and reduce our dependence on computers and other electronic devices for entertainment.  My final point concerns the impact of computers and cell phones on our social interactions. Nowadays, people prefer to communicate with friends and family through instant messaging, video calls, or text messages rather than engaging in face - to - face activities. This form of communication may hinder our ability to interact effectively in real - life situations. Additionally, it is difficult to gauge the tone and emotion of the other person when communicating electronically. I have witnessed families being affected by technology, as they are so engrossed in their devices that they rarely interact with each other. This is not a healthy family dynamic.  @PERSON1, I sincerely hope that I have convinced you that technology should be used sparingly and not on a daily basis. Remember, excessive technology use leads to a sedentary lifestyle, a lack of appreciation for nature, and poor social interactions. Thank you for your time.
780	782	1	1	An ever - growing number of individuals are incorporating computers into their daily routines. However, I firmly believe that this trend does not necessarily contribute to the betterment of our society. People are investing an excessive amount of time in computer usage, thereby neglecting physical exercise and the cultivation of social relationships.  The overuse of computers is directly correlated with a decline in physical health. Professor @PERSON1's research indicates that individuals spending more than @NUM1 hours a day on computers are prone to obesity and irregular exercise patterns. If these habits persist, they face an increased risk of obesity and premature death from heart - related issues before reaching the age of @NUM2. In my community, I've witnessed firsthand the negative impact of computer use on health. A friend of mine, who was once fit and active, gained over @NUM4 lbs after acquiring a computer and abandoning regular exercise. This clearly demonstrates that computers are contributing to an unhealthy lifestyle.  In addition to health concerns, computer use is also eroding social bonds. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children who use computers spend less time with their families. This may seem insignificant initially, but further research reveals that @PERCENT2 of these children may develop feelings of loneliness and depression, which can even lead to self - harm. I recall a student at our school who became increasingly isolated after excessive computer use. He eventually ran away from home, highlighting the potential dangers of social isolation caused by technology.  In conclusion, despite the widespread use of computers, I maintain that this trend is not beneficial for our society. People are sacrificing their physical health and social connections for the sake of computer usage. It is crucial that we strike a balance between technology and other aspects of our lives to ensure a healthier and more fulfilling existence.
781	783	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Firstly, I would like to express my admiration for the stories and puzzles in your paper. I believe I have a narrative that your publication could utilize. It pertains to individuals addicted to computers. You might be pondering what I mean by computer addiction. Well, I shall present three rationales for this. My first reason is that people are not allocating sufficient time to their families. I state this because frequently, couples engage in disputes as the individual addicted to the internet fails to fulfill their obligations. For instance, suppose you have a turkey in the oven, and you are so engrossed in the computer that you forget about it until the fire alarm sounds. Another reason people can become addicted to computers is the plethora of online chat rooms. I know individuals addicted to these chat rooms, and I sometimes worry about them because often, they are unaware of whom they are conversing with! It could be anyone, even a pedophile. My final reason is that some individuals simply do not care. Some people can spend the entire day and night on the computer, doing nothing but chatting online when they could be working on an essay or engaging in something beneficial or caring. I myself was once addicted to the computer, and as a result, I nearly failed all my classes. Consequently, I no longer use the computer for chatting or similar activities; now, I only read my emails or write my essays. And this concludes what I believe could be your next top - story.
782	784	1	1	Falsehoods! The computers employed in society do not cause any harm to us whatsoever! They represent a significant advancement for mankind and solely enhance our lives. They confer substantial benefits upon us for the following reasons: computers serve as a wellspring of knowledge, they can facilitate the advertising and business operations of numerous workplaces, and they offer a highly convenient and efficient means of communicating with someone either nearby or across the globe. Undoubtedly, computers only bring advantages to the members of our society. Firstly, computers are a vast repository of knowledge. Many people nowadays encounter a question they need to answer but cannot find the solution in a book or newspaper, so they turn to a computer, and their problem is promptly resolved. Today's computers house every conceivable piece of information on every topic, from history to politics. All one has to do is access a site like @ORGANIZATION1, enter their query, and millions of answers appear, ensuring a resolution to the problem. Computers can also provide a platform for researching a project or obtaining economic statistics if required by schools, businesses, or for personal entertainment. Times are evolving rapidly, and the sources of the world's history and school subjects can easily be located in the digital realm. What one might have previously searched for in books and papers can now be effortlessly found on the internet with a single click. Clearly, computers are an invaluable source of knowledge for our society. Secondly, computers and the internet support numerous businesses in advertising and generating profits. Every time one accesses the internet, many different businesses can promote their products and overall operations through pop - ups, sidebars, and websites. This clearly helps workplaces attract attention. In addition to advertising products, businesses can even sell their goods online without much effort. This also benefits consumers as they do not have to travel to a store to pick up what they need. All they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await their delivery a few days later. Clearly, the computer and the internet can contribute to the well - being of businesses. Finally, the computers we use today are an excellent and straightforward means of communication. Contact with people from another street, town, state, or country can be established through social networking sites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. One can send a message with just a click of a button, eliminating the need to visit the post office and wait for a reply. An instant message, which can be sent on any of the mentioned sites, can also be used. Here, one can type a message on the computer, send it to anyone, and receive a response within seconds. Obviously, computers play a crucial role in enabling seamless communication among people. In conclusion, it is evident that computers greatly benefit society without any adverse effects. Computers are a valuable source of knowledge, an aid to businesses, and a great way to communicate. Everyone has readily agreed to this, and so should you. Computers are among the greatest inventions in our society today.
783	785	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @PERCENT1 of people own a computer. This indicates that computers must have a positive impact on individuals if the majority own them. I am of the opinion that computers do have a positive influence on people because they enable online communication with others, facilitate learning about new things, and develop hand - eye coordination. My first reason for believing that computers have a positive effect on people is that they provide the ability to interact with others online. Some individuals do not have phones but do possess computers. If one needs to contact someone, they can do so using a computer. Additionally, some people have family and friends residing across the world. Computers are ideal for maintaining contact, and they do not incur high long - distance costs as phones do. Since computers allow communication with friends, family, and others, it is a positive aspect as such interaction is important. My second reason for believing that computers have a positive effect on people is that they offer the opportunity to learn about new things. Learning via a computer has a positive impact on people because one does not have to travel to gather information. It can be achieved with a simple click of a button. People can use the computer to learn about anything and everything. The ability to acquire information without leaving home has a positive effect on people as more individuals can learn due to having more time compared to traveling to obtain information. This is beneficial because knowledge is power, and having more knowledge will be advantageous in the future. My third reason for believing that computers have a positive effect on people is that they teach hand - eye coordination. Having good hand - eye coordination has a positive impact on people as it is essential throughout life. If one lacks proper hand - eye coordination, it can be a hindrance as it is used in almost everything, such as driving, writing, and exercising. Computers provide the means to develop hand - eye coordination over time, which is why it is a positive factor for people. I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they enable online communication, facilitate learning about new things, and teach hand - eye coordination. I hope this letter persuades you to recognize that computers do have a positive impact on people.
784	786	1	1	Can you envision how arduous life would be without a computer? I can, and I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial. Computers assist us in conducting research, maintaining connections with friends and family, and are often necessary in certain workplaces. The internet offers a convenient method for research. All one has to do is search for the information they need, and millions of articles will be accessible at the click of a mouse. Using the internet on a computer is far more efficient than sifting through books in search of information, which can be extremely time - consuming. The internet can promptly and precisely answer your queries. Computers are an excellent means of staying connected. Almost everyone has an email account nowadays. All it takes is typing a few words, and you can reconnect with an old friend. When making a phone call, you cannot be certain if the person is available. When using email, the recipient can reply at their convenience. Computers are utilized in many workplaces. Sometimes, their use is even mandatory. Computers organize data by storing documents in different files and also have valuable programs that can aid in your career, such as @ORGANIZATION1 Word. Using a computer can also have financial benefits. Some may argue that computers contain misleading information. The internet is not always a reliable source. However, by spending a few minutes cross - checking information on other websites, you still save more time than it would take to find the facts in a book. The computer is one of the most remarkable inventions ever created. It simplifies research, connecting with friends, and work! Start using a computer @DATE1, and your life will undoubtedly improve.
785	787	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my view, excessive online time has a detrimental impact on society. When people communicate via email, Facebook, and Twitter, they do not experience a comprehensive social interaction. Engaging in such online platforms consumes time that could be dedicated to other aspects, such as family, friends, and school. People are also missing out on outdoor activities and exercise. Although online activities can be useful, spending too much time on them can be harmful. Online interaction can be a great option for those with distant friends and family. However, excessive online time can undermine one's social activity levels. In - person interaction is superior to online communication because one can observe how the person they are speaking to reacts to their words. A positive social environment is beneficial for both oneself and one's friends. Spending too much time on the computer can also damage one's social relationship with family. For family members living far away, online interaction is a valuable tool. But for close family, one may be neglecting their lives and well - being. One's relationship with family could be at risk due to excessive computer use. When using the computer, one is often eating, and the time spent online takes away from opportunities to burn off those calories. The obesity rate in @LOCATION1 is rising, likely due to over - reliance on computers. Moreover, the beauty of nature that @ORGANIZATION1 offers is being missed because of computers. Online activity is harming our health and preventing us from enjoying outdoor life. In conclusion, excessive online presence is negatively affecting our social lives, health, and consuming too much of our time. The internet is useful for adults to pay taxes, work from home, and perform other beneficial tasks for themselves and their families. However, for less essential forms of interaction, why not simply make a phone call or meet in person instead of relying on computers?
786	788	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I dissent from the impacts that computers exert on children. Computers empower kids to pursue their desires, and they need not journey far to observe certain phenomena. For instance, if one wishes to behold the @LOCATION1's @CAPS1, one is not likely to board a plane and fly there when images and information can be obtained right on the computer within a few minutes. It is indeed appealing to witness it in person, yet one would be reluctant to expend money on plane tickets or undertake a long - distance journey when it can be viewed from the comfort of home. Computers offer a plethora of engaging content such as MySpace, @CAPS2, and games; moreover, they house nearly everything one can conceive. So, why embark on a journey when all can be witnessed on one's computer? I opine that computers can sometimes be mildly addictive, but one must learn to refrain from excessive use. Nevertheless, it is highly convenient to acquire knowledge on a computer. Billions of people utilize computers, and they serve as an excellent means to learn about our entire world and its constituents. There are informational websites like Google or Bing to search for anything one desires. Computers are ubiquitous, present in phones, i - Pods, and even some are installed in vehicles such as police cars. Computers are extremely beneficial to the world's population @DATE1. I wager that those who manufacture them will create new models applicable to almost everything. Computers are found in almost every building, including hospitals, fire stations, police stations, and electronic stores like RadioShack. One will learn far more via computers than by traveling or attending school. In my view, we should all possess computers as they are enjoyable and enable us to learn about everything imaginable. Hence, I believe that computers are highly useful and can impart a great deal about the happenings in our world today. Thus, I disagree with what scientists or individuals assert regarding computers and their effects on certain people of @DATE1.
787	789	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, my stance on this entire computer matter is that it is evolving into a significant concern because individuals are investing all their time in books instead of interacting with friends and family, engaging in physical activity, or appreciating nature. Just as the expert, then - tinker, stated in his book titled @CAPS2 about computers, ""Excessive time on computers and insufficient time outdoors, a recommended seven hours, can lead to weight gain."" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 The reason people should venture outside more is that they can foster social connections with friends and family. I suspect you were unaware that @PERCENT1 of children aged from @NUM1 to @NUM2 are sitting on their couches or playing video games as well. Another @CAPS4 is that people require more exercise. Otherwise, a substantial portion, more than @NUM3, of the country's population will face health issues due to limited physical activity, largely attributable to computers. And the final @CAPS4, and the most crucial one, is that people can fully relish nature. Believe it or not, but Jack Cup concurs; he said, '@PERCENT2 of those who appreciate nature will live @NUM4 years longer, and people today are less likely to experience heart problems in their @NUM5's."" This is precisely why I believe computers are detrimental to people, and I am not alone in this view; @PERSON1, Jackup @CAPS6, scientists, and a significant percentage of the population share this opinion."
788	790	1	1	Wouldn't one contend that having a computer at home is advantageous? It furnishes useful information to everyone. It can be employed for personal purposes, such as communicating with friends. In a household with a child, they may need to conduct an internet search for school - related matters. Whether one requires directions to a location or wishes to learn more about a particular individual, a computer can offer assistance. If one has a child who has a tendency to inflate the phone bill by chatting with friends, simply advise them to utilize a computer! There are numerous avenues for communication via a computer, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and even email! If one needs to make prompt plans, perhaps for a movie outing with a few friends, simply send them an email or a message on @CAPS2. Now, with @CAPS1, one can send text messages directly from the computer! If one is concerned that someone may not receive the email in a timely manner, simply enter their cell phone number on @CAPS1 and send a text. It is also free! As our world has become more technologically advanced, schools frequently instruct students to conduct research on a computer or complete homework assignments posted on their webpages. If a child does not have access to a computer at home, it will pose difficulties for them to complete their homework. Additionally, if a parent decides to initiate a business from home, a computer would be indispensable for calculating profits and communicating with customers. A computer can also design signs for a business or create business cards. Need directions to a restaurant? Or perhaps a local gym? A computer can assist in finding directions to almost any @CAPS10 on the planet. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS11 is a reliable website for obtaining directions. One can also learn about specific individuals by typing their names into @ORGANIZATION1. If one needs someone's phone number but lacks a phone book, @CAPS12 pages can be utilized for assistance. Therefore, I trust that one can now recognize that computers impact people positively. They facilitate staying in touch with friends and save money. They aid students in learning more and can potentially enable one to establish a home - based business. Whether one needs directions or help in finding a phone number, a computer can offer multiple solutions. Having a computer can broaden one's perspective on everything.
789	791	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, my name is @PERSON1, and I firmly believe that we should curtail our computer usage because it results in a lack of physical activity, limited time outdoors, and a decline in communication with friends and family. Local newspaper, I am of the opinion that while computers have their place, the current over - reliance is causing many individuals to become inactive. A significant number of people are not exercising as they are engrossed in Facebook or playing games. Many children are not venturing outside to experience nature and engage in play. Numerous families are all glued to their computers, forfeiting quality family time, such as flying kites together. What I am emphasizing is that although people enjoy using computers to socialize and play games, it is having a detrimental impact on parents and families. I do not advocate for excessive computer use. Additionally, local newspaper, we need to embrace the @DATE1, but this is not happening as many children are constantly on the computer. Many parents used to engage in activities like hiking, camping, swimming, and other pursuits, but they no longer do so. These individuals need to effect a change. What I am suggesting is to either limit computer access or remove it altogether. One final point, local newspaper, is that many kids, children, and parents need more quality time. Perhaps if parents and children were not constantly on computers, they would notice those who might be sick or ill. Maybe they would go out together to a place like a lake or Six Flags. Many parents are drawn to computers because they are entertaining, but this has led to a concerning situation. Many people around the world are complaining about this issue. Therefore, I believe everyone should reduce their computer usage. I think our society should not be overly dependent on computers as they lead to a lack of exercise, limited exposure to nature, and a decrease in social interaction with friends and family. Hence, I believe it is time for computers to have a reduced presence in our lives.
790	792	1	1	Computers are highly beneficial for educational purposes, skill development, and entertainment. In my view, computers are an excellent resource. I believe they are particularly well - suited for pre - teens and teenagers, while adults primarily utilize them for business. The entertainment features offered by computers include @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, etc. @CAPS1 is one of the most popular online chat communities, and @CAPS2 is another well - known one. They share several common features, such as chatting with friends, occasionally updating one's status, and uploading pictures, songs, etc. There are websites for leisure time, like music websites where one can watch music videos or download music onto an iPod. @CAPS3 is a website frequented by teenagers and kids to watch their favorite music videos. iTunes is a program that allows one to download any song, music video, TV show, or movie onto an iPod. Computers also provide Microsoft @CAPS5, Publisher, PowerPoint, etc. All these applications can be used for educational purposes. @CAPS5 enables one to type up any school - related content. One can write a @NUM1 - page essay if desired. One can also cut and paste pictures for a project. Additionally, one can modify the colors, font size, and font style on @CAPS5, which can be used for designing the front cover of an essay or project. Publisher can also be employed for projects. In school, if one needs to create a newspaper, flyers, business cards, etc., Publisher facilitates their creation. PowerPoint is a program that allows one to create various slides on any topic. Computers can be effectively utilized for numerous purposes. Those who disagree fail to recognize that computers assist both children and adults in their daily lives. Some children with special needs @MONTH1 rely on computers to communicate with others. In my opinion, computers are a significant asset in the world.
791	793	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly contend that computers exert an exceedingly positive influence on individuals. As technology progresses incessantly, a plethora of educational opportunities have emerged online. One can now engage with others without physical proximity and partake in games that enrich life experiences. Firstly, computers proffer a diverse array of educational options. Merely via the internet, one can access school textbooks. Additionally, the numerous resources accompanying online textbooks facilitate supplementary practice. Without the need to physically transport textbooks home, one can view them online. Online textbooks contain copious amounts of supplementary practice materials and quizzes, which are ideal for study. Moreover, real - time updates on major global events are readily available on the internet. For instance, the other day, upon logging onto the internet, I encountered an article about the earthquake in @LOCATION1. While the newspaper carried no such news, the internet was so up - to - date that one could stay informed about events that transpired merely minutes ago. Even if one opts not to utilize the internet, there are numerous programs specifically designed to enhance children's mathematical and reading skills. These programs can provide a significant impetus to one's educational journey. Another advantage of computers is the ability to interact with others. Video chatting, @CAPS2, and using social @CAPS3 platforms are excellent means of interaction. During a video chat, one can engage in a conversation with classmates remotely. Instant messaging, though less direct, is still a useful way to communicate with those at a distance. One can share news or simply have a chat with acquaintances. Lastly, social @CAPS3 sites such as Facebook and Twitter are valuable communication tools. One can post messages, play games, or engage in conversations on these platforms. They effectively amalgamate the best aspects of online interaction. Finally, there are numerous online games that offer practical benefits. If one has always desired to bowl but lacked the time, they can play a virtual bowling game. Similarly, if one has ever aspired to drive a stock car, an online game can fulfill that desire. These online games present opportunities to engage in activities that are not part of one's regular routine. Moreover, many games enhance reflexes and quick - thinking abilities, which can be advantageous in real - life situations. Online games are also a source of entertainment. Overall, I firmly believe that computers are a valuable resource for education, social interaction, and engaging in beneficial games. After all, who would forgo the opportunity to better prepare themselves for life?
792	794	1	1	"Are you an aficionado of technology? An increasing number of individuals worldwide are embracing technology, particularly computers. However, not everyone concurs that this trend benefits society. I, on the contrary, firmly believe it does. Technology empowers individuals to acquire knowledge about any subject of interest. It also facilitates enhanced communication with those residing at a distance. My final point is that technology can serve as an effective means of safeguarding the country. I acknowledge that computers are a valuable man - made resource. When I was approximately @NUM1 years old, I relished playing on the computer, perceiving it as merely a game. However, my father advised me not to misuse the computer but to utilize it for educational purposes. I discovered that with just a click of a button, a vast amount of knowledge becomes accessible. Now, one can employ this technology as a tool rather than a mere pastime. Instead of visiting the library to search for a book, one can simply conduct an online search. People enjoy socializing, meeting new individuals, or communicating with those in other countries. One of the most effective ways to do so is through the computer. I am @NUM2 years old, and I have numerous friends who engage in online chats, and I am one of them. My family members reside in @LOCATION1, and it is impractical for me to take a daily flight to visit them. Therefore, I utilize the computer to communicate with them, which is both rapid and enjoyable. The @ORGANIZATION1 boasts one of the most formidable @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION3 in the world. You would be astounded by the advanced technology they possess and how they utilize it. One of their remarkable assets is the ""@PERSON1,"" a plane controlled by a remote device. It resembles a fighter plane but operates without a pilot! The operator can relax at the base while the @PERSON1 performs its tasks. Join me in recognizing the utility of computers in the world! Based on the aforementioned reasons, I assert that computers are beneficial as they endow individuals with the ability to learn about any topic, offer a means of communication, and provide a method of national defense. Technology is advancing at an exponential rate and growing more powerful. Hence, heed my advice: ""Do not abuse it; utilize it."
793	795	1	1	To Whom It @MONTH1 Concerns: I firmly believe that computers wield a profound influence on individuals. Computers prove invaluable for academic pursuits, enabling individuals to maintain contact with out - of - state relatives and providing access to information and directions. They are particularly useful in last - minute scenarios. Computers are highly advantageous for homework. Typing a report on a computer imparts a professional appearance. Moreover, while typing a report, one can simultaneously conduct research on the topic. In some cases, individuals with illegible handwriting may find it difficult to read their own work, and teachers may also face challenges. A computer can assist such individuals in presenting their work neatly. If, for any reason, one is unable to visit the library, they can utilize their home computer. For parents occupied with childcare at home and in need of work, there is no need to venture outside; they can simply use their home computer. If a child is absent from school, they can visit the school's website to obtain the homework. Do you have relatives residing in other states whom you wish to communicate with? If so, would you not prefer to converse with them without incurring exorbitant phone bills? The majority of people would undoubtedly answer in the affirmative. Utilizing the computer to stay in touch with family is remarkably cost - effective! Examples include AIM, emails, and other online networks, which are entirely free of charge. On days when you have no specific plans, do you not yearn to venture out for some entertainment? Do you not wish to engage in an activity to break the monotony of staying at home? In the event of a last - minute decision or situation, the computer can offer assistance. Before embarking on a journey, if you desire to acquire more information about the destination, simply access the computer. Not only will you obtain details about the place, but you will also receive directions. Now, you can embark on an outing instead of remaining at home bored. In conclusion, computers indeed exert a profound influence on individuals. They are useful for both adults and children. Teachers can calculate students' averages more efficiently, and children can complete their homework more effectively. Additionally, one can maintain contact with friends. Overall, computers are an indispensable asset.
794	796	1	1	Is there not something inherently invigorating about being outdoors and experiencing the refreshing elements? Would you not prefer to immerse yourself in the crashing waves of the @LOCATION1 rather than sit indoors, merely gazing at pictures of it? You may erroneously believe that computers are contributing positively to society. However, the human race has thrived for hundreds of years without computers and can continue to do so for centuries to come. Computers are fostering a growing sense of lethargy in society. With diligent effort, one can acquire the same amount of information from books as from computers. Hand - eye coordination is a crucial skill that can be developed through physical activities such as football and tennis. It can also be enhanced through creative endeavors such as drawing, reading, and playing a musical instrument. These activities not only improve hand - eye coordination but also allow individuals to explore their creative potential. While some contend that computers can teach hand - eye coordination, there are more effective methods. Developing this skill through physical activities is more efficient than relying on a computer. Many individuals enjoy traveling to various parts of the world. However, traveling to a foreign location without prior knowledge is ill - advised. In such situations, many people turn to the internet as the most convenient source of information. However, it is important to note that anyone can post information on the internet, which may lead to inaccurate or misleading data. For instance, you may think you are obtaining information about @LOCATION2 when, in fact, you are getting details about @LOCATION3. Books are a more reliable source of information. Reading, especially from reputable sources, is a powerful activity. Lately, children have been engrossed in virtual lives on the internet. Their primary mode of communication is through online chat. However, online chatting can never substitute for face - to - face interactions with friends. Online relationships lack authenticity. By relying solely on the internet for communication, we are neglecting the development of real - world communication skills. The internet is not worth sacrificing genuine human interaction. In conclusion, it is evident that computers do not offer significant benefits to society. Thank you.
795	797	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers represent a remarkable technological advancement with substantial societal benefits. They serve as a means for family members to maintain contact, simplify flight bookings, and aid children in their academic pursuits. They have the power to bring people closer together. Firstly, computers are an excellent tool for staying connected. In my personal experience, my brother is at college, and when I miss him or need to communicate, I can easily send him an email or engage in a video chat. Do you have someone you don't see on a daily basis? Utilizing a computer can strengthen family bonds as it encourages more frequent communication with relatives and friends. Friends may move away, but you can always reach out to them when needed. During difficult times, the support of a friend is invaluable. Even when friends are physically distant, a computer can bridge the gap. Booking flights without a computer can be a cumbersome process, involving hours of waiting on the phone. With a computer, however, the entire process can be completed in approximately five minutes. I once experienced a flight cancellation and was unaware until I checked on the computer. I was able to quickly switch my flight and proceed with my journey. Imagine arriving at the airport the next day only to discover that your flight was canceled and spending the entire day trying to secure a new flight, with no guarantee of success. With a computer, you can monitor flight statuses at regular intervals. It even provides information on flight delays, saving you from unnecessary waiting at the airport. When it comes to travel, computers are an essential asset. Have you ever encountered a similar situation? Chances are, you have, and you were likely grateful to have a computer. On the educational front, computers also play a vital role. At the end of a class, when teachers are rushing to assign homework, students are often more focused on leaving. As a result, approximately nine out of ten students may not be aware of the assignment when they get home. I have personally experienced this. As an eighth - grader, I may have simply forgotten about the assignment or chosen to ignore it. However, a computer can be a valuable solution. Most schools utilize some form of digital platform where teachers post grades, upcoming tests and quizzes, and homework. At @CAPS2, all the necessary information is just a click away. It is conveniently organized in one place. Parents are likely to be more satisfied when their children complete their homework. Wouldn't you agree? From school fundraisers to the lunch menu, all the relevant information is accessible on the computer. In conclusion, computers are beneficial in both daily and special circumstances. They strengthen family ties, facilitate seamless travel, and assist students in obtaining their school assignments. Computers are a valuable asset to society, offering great convenience and utility.
796	798	1	1	"One night, I entered my living room and observed my mother engrossed in the computer. I mused to myself, ""She is perpetually on that computer. Does she not have any work to attend to?"" I then addressed my mother, stating, ""I believe we should each be allocated one or two hours of computer usage per night, or perhaps forgo it altogether."" I conveyed to her my conviction that computers are an unwise choice, as one cannot discern who is on the internet attempting to engage in conversation. Moreover, it impedes physical exercise and quality time spent with family and friends. In contemporary times, the internet and computers pose significant risks. One can never be certain whether someone is a genuine friend or a predator with malicious intent. For instance, if you were conversing with someone and assumed it was your friend, you cannot be absolutely sure. It could potentially be an older individual seeking to make contact, possibly with the intention of kidnapping or stealing from you, or even worse. Nowadays, when I peruse the news, I frequently encounter reports of kidnappings resulting from children interacting with strangers online without knowing their identities or appearances. Consider the case of a girl who was chatting with a man, believing him to be her friend. It turned out that he was not, and she found herself in a great deal of trouble. Had she met him in person, she might have suffered severe harm and been haunted by the memory for the remainder of her life. Family holds great significance for most households today. I have heard that spending time with family can enhance academic performance, as engaging in conversations with them exposes one to new knowledge. Regrettably, this is not occurring as people are so consumed by their computers that they neglect to spend even a single moment with their loved ones or friends. I have a friend who is constantly glued to the computer. She never makes time for her family or friends. She is so fixated on the computer screen that she fails to notice what is happening around her. Recently, she has started to reduce her computer usage and allocate more time to her family and friends. Even her grades have begun to improve as she now studies with her parents instead of wasting time on platforms like @CAPS1 or MySpace without completing any schoolwork. In essence, she is now leading a happier life and has undergone a positive transformation as a result of this experience. Many individuals believe that using one's brain for intellectual pursuits can be considered a form of exercise. While this is one perspective, it does not substitute for physical activity. People spend so much time with their eyes fixed on the computer screen that they neglect to go outside and engage in physical activities or visit the gym. The prevalence of obesity in our country is on the rise for various reasons, and a lack of exercise is one of the primary factors. This is because people spend an excessive amount of time watching television and using the computer. I have a young cousin who is overweight and should be participating in sports and physical activities. However, she spends her free time in a stuffy room, glued to the computer, instead of enjoying the fresh air outdoors. She frequently inquires about how I maintain my fitness and at what age I started. I consistently inform her that I engage in regular exercise and sports, but she never heeds my advice. To this day, she remains unchanged as she has not taken my suggestion to disconnect from the computer and go outside to play. I firmly advocate for a limit of two hours of computer usage per night or, ideally, complete abstinence. This is crucial for the safety of children from potential threats in the world, for fostering meaningful relationships with family and friends, and for maintaining physical fitness. I earnestly hope that people will comprehend my message and take proactive steps to implement these changes in their own lives and encourage others to do the same."
797	799	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2, the editor of the local @CAPS4 newspaper, I am penning this letter to expound upon the impact of computers on society. In my view, computers facilitate societal learning and enable individuals to communicate with others across the globe. They empower society to acquire knowledge about distant regions of the world, delve into the history of specific areas, and study animals and their habitats without the need for extensive travel. Computers simplify the process of researching challenging areas, such as @PERSON1 and the cliffs of the @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS6, and aid in exploring the history of ancient cities like @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION2 of @CAPS5. They also assist in the study of animal species and their habitats, including the @CAPS9 @CAPS10, the hasin in @CAPS9, or the species known as the @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Computers serve as a valuable resource for society to gain insights into all these aspects. Additionally, computers enable people to interact with others worldwide. For instance, one can conduct a conference on their computer while at home, making it easier to communicate and pose questions to others during a vacation without incurring travel expenses. Moreover, when one is unable to physically attend a meeting, they can hold a conference on their computer from the comfort of their home. It is also more convenient to discuss important business matters and seek answers to queries. One can engage in conversations with others on the computer without the need to spend money on travel. This is how computers facilitate global communication and contribute to societal learning. @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2, the editor of the local newspaper.
798	800	1	1	Dear Newspaper, the utilization of computers has become an integral part of people's daily lives, and it has become a common practice for many individuals throughout @LOCATION1. We rely on computers for research, academic writing, and entertainment purposes, and in all these aspects, computers prove to be highly beneficial. However, like all good things, excessive computer usage can have detrimental effects. Undoubtedly, computers enrich our lives by providing knowledge, information about the outside world, and connections with people from diverse locations. Nevertheless, some individuals become overly attached to the virtual world, neglecting their real lives. This phenomenon affects numerous people, and some may not even be aware of the impact computers are having on them. For most individuals, life can be challenging, and the real world can be stressful. Consequently, they seek solace in the computer for a while, which is understandable. However, when this behavior becomes habitual, it can develop into an addiction. Instead of unwinding through activities such as taking a walk or reading a book, they turn to the computer, which can have a negative impact on their social life and mental well - being. In my opinion, the mind requires stimulation and exercise through activities that involve problem - solving and critical thinking. While one may assume that playing challenging computer games engages the brain, although it does to some extent, the brain can reach its full potential through activities that do not strain the eyes as much. Computers can be advantageous, but they should not dominate every aspect of one's life. Now, let's consider the impact on social life. Computers can be a valuable resource in many ways, but they can also become a distraction if not used appropriately. This can occur when the computer becomes one's constant companion. Nowadays, online games have emerged, allowing people to interact with others. While this is not inherently bad, it becomes problematic when one's entire social life revolves around these online acquaintances whom they do not truly know, rather than real - life interactions with people they meet at school or on the streets. Therefore, communicating with people online is acceptable as long as these relationships are secondary to real - life friendships. As I mentioned earlier, computers are an inevitable part of our daily lives, and this is not necessarily a negative thing as they offer numerous benefits. However, it is essential to manage our computer usage and ensure that we control the time spent on them. By doing so, we are more likely to lead a balanced lifestyle, which will bring greater happiness to ourselves, our friends, and our families.
799	801	1	1	"Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1, you may have witnessed on the @ORGANIZATION1 news that an increasing number of individuals perceive computers as a boon to society. I personally concur with this view. However, I believe that they are causing people to miss out on novel experiences, opportunities to meet new people, and physical exercise. Time passes swiftly, and many things can go unnoticed. Have you ever spent an hour on the computer? It may seem as if only @NUM1 minutes have elapsed. There are people who spend an entire day on it, potentially missing out on a year's worth of experiences. For example, new technological marvels like the iPod Nano with a camera may be introduced, and they would remain oblivious. Moreover, the iPod allows for the downloading and reading of books. There are also exciting adventures to be had, such as skydiving, bungee jumping, traveling to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, or even exploring underwater. One could visit @LOCATION2 and savor a delicious, freshly - baked cheese pizza. Just the thought of it makes my mouth water. How many people do you know in real life? And what about those on Facebook or MySpace? Instead, you should venture to the park and meet new people. Even a visit to a family member's house provides an opportunity for interaction. Everyone should engage with others. Even toddlers need to interact with their peers to learn how to share. @CAPS2, you are no longer a toddler, but it is still beneficial to know others and understand their perspectives. You may think your way of thinking is superior, but that's where interaction comes in. You can discuss and learn from others. @CAPS1, you may have seen on the news that many families have members struggling with weight issues. Shows like ""The Biggest Loser"" on various channels are attempting to assist these individuals in losing weight. But what causes this? It could be due to poor diet or lack of exercise. However, the problem may also be related to computer usage. Many people spend @NUM2 minutes on the computer while allocating only @NUM3 minutes to exercise. A simple walk around the block can help burn at least @NUM4 calories, yet some prefer to stay on the computer and gain those calories. Some deaths are caused by heart attacks, which can result from plaque buildup or excessive weight gain. Instead of reaching for a healthy apple, many Americans opt for unhealthy foods. I believe we should continue to use computers, but we should reduce our usage time, increase physical activity, and improve our diet. You may doubt that people will heed the advice about exercising, meeting new people, or exploring new places. However, the least we can do is inspire one person. That person can then inspire another, and this chain reaction can continue. Gradually, we can help people discover what they can achieve without excessive computer reliance."
800	802	1	1	Dear local newspaper, the question that has been on everyone's mind is whether computers are beneficial to society. I once held the view that they were not, but I have since changed my stance. I believe that computers offer several advantages. Firstly, they serve as an excellent source of information. Secondly, we live in a technologically advanced era, and proficiency in computer usage is essential to keep pace. Thirdly, they enable us to maintain contact with people across the globe. So, do computers truly benefit our society? Computers are an invaluable resource for me when I need to gather information. For example, during a recent social studies project, I relied on the computer to research topics that were otherwise difficult to access. Additionally, when I need facts and cannot visit the library, the computer provides the same information. It is also useful for finding maps of specific locations or phone numbers of stores. Computers have always been and will continue to be a great source of knowledge. In the @DATE1, technology plays a pivotal role in society. Consider the evolution of computers from large, bulky machines to thin, portable devices. Therefore, understanding how to use a computer is crucial to stay relevant in the @DATE1. Are you willing to let technology pass you by? Computers are one of the most effective means of staying connected. For instance, making international phone calls can result in exorbitant phone bills. However, platforms like Facebook allow for free communication. Another option is A.I.M., which also offers free chatting. Who wouldn't want to communicate with their friends and family around the world without incurring any costs? The reasons I have presented are well - founded and supported by details. Technology is like a moving train. Are you going to miss it?
801	803	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I contend that computers do not confer benefits upon society. In my perspective, they cause more harm than good. Individuals do not utilize the computer for researching others. Instead, they log on to check @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5. They ought to venture outdoors and experience the external world; people should engage in interaction with family and friends. Humans possess an excessive amount of leisure time. Consequently, they may become bored and create a @CAPS3 account. Alternatively, if they already have one, they might play one of the games available on it. Eventually, they become addicted to @CAPS3 and never disengage from it. Our society must encourage people to go outside and only use their computers to check emails, add content to their iPods, and perhaps verify if they have any notifications on @CAPS3. If one desires to lead a truly fulfilling life, sitting in front of a computer throughout one's entire life will not facilitate such enjoyment. One must live life as if each day were one's last. Go outside, watch the major game with all one's companions. Embark on a vacation and spend time away with one's family. Travel the world and cherish every moment of it. Would one not prefer to engage in these activities rather than sitting in front of a computer? We must inform our state about this issue. There is a reason why we are becoming one of the least active countries! People are not leaving their homes and are not engaging in physical activity. If people abstain from using their computers, we could become one of the fittest countries.
802	804	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, the impacts that computers have on individuals are unfavorable. They can instigate numerous problems in one's life. When one is using a computer, is one engaging in physical exertion? No, one is merely seated; utilizing a computer involves minimal physical movement. One ought to be actively moving, such as dancing, walking with friends, or engaging in other forms of physical activity! Prolonged sitting and continuous computer use can lead to significant weight gain. Another issue associated with computer use is social isolation. One can become addicted to a game or social media platforms like Facebook/@CAPS1 and spend excessive amounts of time on them. As a result, one may communicate less with friends at school and refrain from socializing with them because all one desires is to use the computer. One becomes preoccupied with the computer and neglects other aspects of life. Moreover, computers can pose significant risks. When interacting with strangers online, they may obtain personal information and potentially cause harm. It is extremely perilous to communicate with unknown individuals online. These are among the numerous problems caused by computers. Trust me, I have previously become addicted to a game.
803	805	1	1	"School, family, and sports are priorities that my parents consistently emphasize. Nowadays, children are overly reliant on computers. @PERCENT1 of students return home from school and immediately turn to the computer. Students should allocate more time to their families, engage in regular exercise, and prioritize their academic performance. My primary reason for concurring is that most children rarely spend quality time with their families. Children often prefer to return home and spend the entire day on the computer. This is regrettable as it prevents them from bonding with their families and expressing gratitude for their parents' efforts. For instance, I often wonder if young children express appreciation to their parents daily. They should indeed do so. Additionally, my second reason for agreement is that students need to invest more time and effort in their studies. Children should reduce the time spent on social media platforms such as Facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of browsing these websites, they should utilize educational resources like @ORGANIZATION1 for research. @PERCENT2 of students have accounts on Facebook, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2. For example, I frequently overhear students discussing computer - related events during school hours. It is astonishing how many students fail to complete their homework on time. Lastly, my third and final reason for agreement is that students severely lack physical exercise. A renowned baseball player once stated, ""You do not have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic."" This implies that one must maintain a healthy physical condition. @PERCENT3 of students are overweight or obese due to a lack of exercise. The only physical activity students engage in nowadays is during their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then, students tire easily and become short - of - breath because they are sedentary and overly reliant on computers. They should engage in activities such as push - ups, sit - ups, and other forms of exercise. For example, I complete my homework after school and then go for a one - mile run. Furthermore, students need to pass their @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion, students should limit their computer usage, spend more time with their families, focus on their studies, and engage in regular exercise to maintain good health."
804	806	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2's perspective on computers is valid. I opine that computers can assist individuals in fulfilling their requirements. They also enable people to communicate with others. All computers are beneficial and do not necessarily have negative implications when used. Computers are valuable tools for teachers, students, employees, and parents. Their utility extends beyond mere assistance; they can also be a source of entertainment. Games, music, and videos are readily accessible on the internet. The ability to communicate with others is another compelling reason why computers are advantageous. People can maintain email accounts for both business and personal purposes. Myspace, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all platforms that facilitate communication among individuals. Owning a computer is not inherently negative. When writing an article for a newspaper, is it hand - written? In most cases, a computer is used for such tasks. Computers are not always detrimental. People need to learn to manage their computer usage time. They can have a positive impact on individuals when needed. Information on any subject is available on the internet. Computers have been in use for decades, and I believe they will continue to be utilized for many more years. In the past, computers were primarily used for work. Currently, people of all ages can use them for a wide range of activities.
805	807	1	1	"Computers represent a remarkable achievement of technology and science that have enhanced our lives in numerous ways. They allow us to explore the world with a single click and communicate with friends. However, I believe that computers are having a detrimental impact on our society. Now, I am not opposed to computers; I appreciate their utility, but they can have negative consequences. People often become engrossed in computer use and find it difficult to disengage. Moreover, when chatting online, one can never be certain of the identity of the person on the other end, and excessive computer use can result in significant stress. Let me elaborate on how computers can disrupt lives. When the computer was invented, its intended purpose was not for individuals to spend hours playing mindless games or aimlessly browsing the web. Some scientific studies have indicated that the more time one spends online, the higher the likelihood of becoming obese. This is not what @LOCATION1 needs. One may intend to use the computer briefly but end up spending days playing games like ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2."" People with important tasks to complete may be unable to access the computer. Additionally, it is a blatant waste of time when one could be outdoors participating in a meaningful activity. My second concern is the issue of online identity. When chatting or ""@CAPS4'ing"" with someone, one cannot be sure of their true identity. A study has shown that when one believes they are communicating with a friend, it could actually be a @NUM1 - year - old with malicious intentions. This is truly alarming! Moreover, when communicating online, there is a risk of a virus being embedded in one's system, which can be costly to repair. Imagine the frustration of one's parents! This threat exists with every keystroke. Finally, whether the person is a stranger or not, some individuals may share links to inappropriate websites that one hopes their parents will never discover. My final point is that computers have been proven to increase stress levels. When using platforms like @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, conflicts between friends can arise, which can negatively impact one's academic performance and grades. For every @NUM2 people who join a social media platform, @NUM1 experience a decline in academic performance due to this issue. Additionally, when parents spend excessive time online, they may be tired and rushed in the morning, which can affect the quality of their work. In the current economic climate, we cannot afford more job losses. Even minor issues such as a virus or slow upload speed can cause significant stress. In fact, @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 residents experience stress related to computer use. I have outlined the reasons why computers can be harmful. People can become addicted, stressed, and vulnerable to online threats. However, computers are not entirely bad; one simply needs to use them responsibly. These are the reasons why I believe computers can have negative effects."
806	808	1	1	"Hello, esteemed @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. Do you think computers wield a profound influence on individuals? Well, I firmly believe that utilizing a computer indeed has a substantial impact on people. I assert this because individuals are likely squandering an entire day on platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, and other websites, looking up definitions of words, directions to locations, and so forth. When one contemplates this, the effect on people can undermine their eyesight and social skills. These individuals are spending a maximum of approximately @NUM1 hours on the computer. Gazing at that @NUM2 - inch diminutive screen can impair your eyesight. This may lead you to require glasses or potentially result in blindness. How would your life be if you refrained from interacting with a girl or guy, or even your own family? If you fritter away your time on those websites, for instance, Facebook, all you do is instant - message the person. Perhaps you should venture out and engage in something enjoyable with that person. What's this I hear about MapIt.com? Don't be indolent and waste @NUM3 minutes of your day merely obtaining directions. Utilize a real map! Also, relying on free @LOCATION1? Come on! Employ a real dictionary. Thus, I conclude by stating that these computers do have a so - called ""great effect"" on people. It offers them shortcuts through life."
807	809	1	1	Dear The @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, computers do not contribute positively to society. They render individuals antisocial, unwell, and encourage detrimental behavior. The internet is highly addictive. I once spent three hours online daily. I did not engage in any exercise whatsoever. Moreover, I was enticed to consume unhealthy snacks while online. This rendered me extremely unwell; I gained nine pounds in a single week. Now, I suffer from dietary issues. I cannot relish things like sweets or running. I will probably develop arthritis in my hands when I am older because I spent hours typing. I used the computer in the dark, so now I require contact lenses. Using the computer is among the most unwholesome choices one can make. I spent so much time on the computer that I was unable to socialize. I missed out on numerous activities with my friends and family because I was preoccupied online. I scarcely conversed with anyone unless it was via email. I lost many friends and close family members. My pets perished because I did not care for them. I had little inclination to do anything other than access the internet. I fumbled my college and job interviews. To this day, I have no social life and no employment because I spent more time interacting with the computer than with people. Computers have ruined my life. Computers encourage extremely adverse behaviors. Not only do they promote unhealthy choices and antisocial conduct, but they also encourage illegal activities. A significant number of drugs and weapons are purchased online. People kill others or themselves due to online gossip. People disregard nature and destroy it. People steal to acquire additional technology. Many car robberies occur because someone left technology in their vehicle. People gamble through online poker. People hack bank accounts via the computer. Prostitution occurs as a result of online chats. There are sex offenders who pose as individuals seeking a date when they are rapists. Terrorists can communicate via the internet. Computers are a menace to society. They transform people into low - life scoundrels and criminals. Computers should be disposed of before they bring about the end of the world.
808	810	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers exert a highly positive influence on individuals. Computers can assist children with their academic assignments. Additionally, they enable people to acquire new knowledge. One can even communicate with friends. There are numerous excellent applications for a computer. Children are burdened with a substantial amount of homework, and without computers, it would be nearly insurmountable to complete it all. At @ORGANIZATION1, students receive a project almost every month. They need pictures, information, and the work must be presented neatly. Computers are virtually the sole means to obtain pictures, information, and ensure the work is presentable. Children also receive a large quantity of homework, and computers are of utmost importance for this purpose. In science class, we receive a packet of homework for each new unit, and without a computer, it would be extremely arduous to finish. One can also learn a multitude of things previously unknown through the use of a computer. There are numerous educational websites available on computers. If you are traveling to a particular place and wish to learn more about it, you can search for information on the internet. Even if you encounter an unfamiliar word while reading a book, you can look it up and find its meaning. Communicating with friends is also significant, and computers offer a variety of methods to achieve this. There are platforms like Facebook, @CAPS1, and video - chat. You can use Facebook if you want to converse with friends, or video - chat as well. These are excellent options if you want to share pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country. These are all outstanding ways to utilize computers. I am absolutely certain that computers have a positive impact on people. They aid with projects and homework, facilitate learning new things, and enable communication with friends. Computers are truly remarkable.
809	811	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, while computers are useful, they have a negative impact on people. Owing to the advancements in computer technology, many individuals no longer venture outdoors as frequently. People are so engrossed in computers that they no longer spend quality time with their friends and family. Obesity is also a significant concern. Computers are undermining people's experiences of the great outdoors. Many individuals, predominantly children, remain indoors all day playing video games on computers. Outside, there are wonderful activities to engage in, such as visiting the park or playing sports. Computers are simply depriving children of these experiences, and nowadays, kids in the @DATE1 stay indoors all day instead of attending fun outdoor camps. Families are being fragmented due to computers. Parents or even children are not spending sufficient time together because of computers. Consequently, the family begins to lose the bond between its members. Families can also adopt such patterns; the youth are highly likely to be attracted to computers, so it is often either the son or daughter who fails to have emotional or physical contact with the family, which is a problem. Health is a major issue when it comes to computers. What is happening is that teenagers or even adults are sitting at the computer, playing games or surfing the web, then having dinner, and continuing to surf the web or play games. Over time, their health deteriorates, and the children gain weight and continue to do so until they become obese and unhealthy. This is a widespread problem across America. As technology continues to advance, the youth will become increasingly unhealthy. In conclusion, computers have a very negative impact on people. People are not going outside as often. Family relationships are being destroyed, and people's health is at stake! If this situation does not change, America's future will be at risk.
810	812	1	1	"Some individuals learn about distant places, stay abreast of the latest updates on significant news, and make sloppy work and handwriting appear neat and presentable. All these are some of the positive benefits that people derive from computers. People worldwide utilize computers to research other locations; computers provide photographs of the place they are researching. For example, I recall when I had a social studies project on the @PERSON1. I had to explain why it is an excellent place to visit due to its historical significance. Mind you, I had never even heard of a place called the @PERSON1 @PERSON1, but thanks to computers, I searched for ""@PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1"" on Google, and the computer provided me with all the information and photos about the mountain @CAPS1. Now, I know where and what the @PERSON1 @PERSON1 mountains look like. Secondly, computers offer all the latest news from around the world. I remember when the earthquake in Haiti first occurred; my grandmother was unaware until she went online to check @ORGANIZATION1 for details such as when, where, and the magnitude of the earthquake on the Richter scale. Another aspect of computers is that I was not the most proficient hand - writer in class. When given the option to either write an assignment by hand or do it on the computer, and considering that we were being graded on neatness, elaboration, and fluency, I chose to do it on the computer. It turned out neat and included pictures. Computers have a very positive impact on people globally, regardless of whether it is for information, news, or to make things neater. There is no doubt that computers bring about a multitude of advantages in our lives."
811	813	1	1	Dear local newspaper, is there any child or adolescent aged between eight and seventeen who does not relish using the computer? Well, MySpace, Facebook, and AIM serve as virtual social hubs. Children across the globe log in and remain online until their parents intervene. I firmly contend that computers exert a substantial influence on individuals. My three rationales are as follows: people lack physical exertion, they fail to engage with others, and children are prone to surreptitiously accessing the internet, even when ostensibly conducting research. Online platforms and games possess a hypnotic allure, enticing users to remain logged in for extended periods. Most parents believe that allowing their children to use the computer for an hour of research is beneficial; however, children often surreptitiously engage in online gaming or visit unauthorized websites. Sometimes, the most prudent course of action is to step outside, breathe in the fresh air, and interact with others. Regrettably, with websites that entice users to remain connected for more than two hours, individuals neither enjoy the outdoors nor engage in social interactions. Frequently, people become so engrossed in computer use that they lose touch with reality, knowing little beyond the digital realm. People grow up rapidly, and some even eat, drink, and occasionally sleep in front of the computer. By remaining sedentary at the computer, they fail to engage in sufficient exercise, leading to weight gain. Eventually, they become so reliant on the computer that they are reluctant to leave it, as they have not burned off the accumulated fat through physical activity. Can you now perceive how computers significantly impact individuals by impeding social interaction, limiting physical activity, and enabling children to access unauthorized websites when their parents are absent?
812	814	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I opine that computers are not something individuals should utilize @NUM1. Computers possess an inherent quality that renders them addictive. There are individuals who gain weight daily as they spend hours sitting at the computer, engaging in online conversations. Moreover, there are malevolent individuals on the internet who disguise themselves, presenting as @NUM2 - year - old boys while actually being middle - aged men. Lastly, contemporary individuals increasingly rely on computers as a source of reading, eschewing traditional books. I firmly believe that computers are undermining the lives of numerous people. To begin with, a significant portion of the population today is becoming overweight, either due to excessive @CAPS2 viewing or spending the day sitting at the computer while consuming food. Once one becomes accustomed to computer use, it is challenging to discontinue, especially when multitasking by eating and using the computer simultaneously. The crux of the problem is that people perceive staying at home as a preferable option to venturing outdoors and engaging in physical activity. It is truly detrimental that individuals fail to disconnect from the computer and embrace life. Secondly, not everyone online is who they claim to be. There are individuals who create false accounts on platforms such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. Men may pose as others, and there is a risk of encountering individuals with malicious intent. With the prevalence of picture - sharing, one must exercise caution. Lastly, in modern times, people use computers to read books instead of visiting libraries or @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 (or any bookstore). I anticipate that many bookstores will face closure due to the advancement of technology. In my youth, when I stated that I was going to read a book, I meant a physical book, not an online version. People need to curtail their use of electronic devices. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a waste of time. There is no valid reason for individuals to be on the computer instead of engaging in physical exercise. Everyone should steer clear of the malevolent individuals online. Additionally, we should revert to using traditional books instead of online ones. Computers should cease to dominate our lives and instead be used only when necessary.
813	815	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, contemporary computers exert a detrimental influence on individuals. The time allocated for daily physical exercise is diminished, family interactions are reduced, and the associated costs can be exorbitant. Owning a computer is, therefore, not a prudent decision. Is sitting idle all day your concept of a workout? A computer can have a profoundly negative impact on one's physical well - being. The act of clicking a mouse and typing merely engages the hands, not the entire body. An individual who uses the computer sparingly or infrequently is likely to be healthier than someone who is constantly glued to the screen. I recall a commercial that depicted the long - term consequences of computer use among @NUM1 children during their pre - teen years. Not only does excessive computer use lead to poor health, but it also increases the likelihood of social isolation. Many children, and even adults, squander precious family time playing games like The Sims @NUM2, creating their ideal virtual families. However, this behavior is unacceptable. Spending time with family is a precious and irreplaceable experience. When questioned about computer use, @PERSON1 remarked, ""One can easily become addicted after just @NUM2 sessions!"" Once addiction sets in, both the individual and their family suffer. Family members may stop inviting the addicted person to social events. You would not want to lose the support and companionship of your loved ones. ""@CAPS2!"" your computer alerts you. You have contracted a virus that is deleting your hardware, including all your academic essays, important bookmarked websites, and sentimental photographs. Do you have any inkling of the cost involved in attempting to retrieve this data? It would be substantial. You may think, ""This could never happen to me,"" but in reality, it can. Storing data on a computer is far riskier than maintaining a hard copy, and it can also save you money. Furthermore, computers consume electricity even when plugged into an outlet. When you receive your electricity bill, do not be surprised, as computers can be quite costly. In essence, computers are an unnecessary addition to our lives. They compromise our health, reduce family time, and incur significant expenses. It is a well - established fact that one can survive without a computer, but without good health, life would be severely compromised. I urge you to consider my perspective."
814	816	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a student at @ORGANIZATION3 Middle School in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. Recently, you published an article discussing whether computers are beneficial or detrimental to people. I am writing today to assert that computers are advantageous for individuals worldwide. This is because computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination, facilitate advanced learning in educational institutions, and enable seamless communication. @CAPS7, please consider the following points. Firstly, computers significantly enhance hand - eye coordination in the long term. This is evident as individuals who play computer games become more proficient in coordinating their hands and eyes. According to @ORGANIZATION1 researchers from @ORGANIZATION4 @LOCATION1, ""Computers improve hand - eye coordination @PERCENT1 more effectively than enrolling your child in a football team."" Computer games can enhance the accuracy of skills applicable to various sports. @CAPS7, you now understand how computers assist in the development of better hand - eye coordination. Secondly, computers aid people in acquiring new knowledge. Although some may doubt this, it is indeed true. A recent study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION2 reveals that @PERCENT2 of schools in @CAPS6 utilize computers for research purposes. Recently, when I needed information about @PERSON2, I immediately thought of Wikipedia on the internet, as it is faster than searching for a book. @CAPS7, you now recognize that the computer is a valuable learning tool. Finally, the computer is an excellent medium for online communication. It surpasses @CAPS10 as it is faster and more efficient than making phone calls. Moreover, it is considerably more cost - effective than @CAPS10, as you only have a single @NUM1 monthly payment, unlike phone bills that can accumulate quickly. @PERSON1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 of @LOCATION1 stated in a recent study that ""@CAPS10 are obsolete in the age of the internet, as people can chat at lightning speed."" Using email or Facebook is far superior to playing phone tag. On Facebook, you can engage in real - time conversations. @CAPS7, these are the reasons why the computer is ideal for communication. @CAPS7, you can now see that computers are indispensable as they foster hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning, and provide an excellent means of communication."
815	817	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, a recent concern has emerged among experts regarding the negative impact of computers @MONTH1 on society. I firmly disagree with this view. Computers simplify life, educate individuals about distant places and people, and enable global communication. I believe that computers can only bring benefits to society. As previously mentioned, computers alleviate the burdens of daily life. With computers, one can utilize @CAPS1 output to plan their schedule. This program allows users to input information about their appointments and reminds them when it is time to attend. With this tool, one will never forget their commitments. Additionally, computers enable users to gather information at an incredibly rapid pace. Suppose you are conducting a school research project on different types of cars. By simply entering the query on @ORGANIZATION3, you can obtain millions of results, saving a significant amount of time compared to visiting a library and searching for a relevant book. This process can be time - consuming, depending on the availability of resources. Finally, computers offer specialized programs for individuals with special needs. New software such as @ORGANIZATION2 Word features a voice - command function. This allows individuals who are unable to write due to blindness or other disabilities to dictate their thoughts to the computer, which will instantly display the text on the screen. Computers revolutionize the lives of people, making them significantly easier. In addition to simplifying life, computers educate users about distant places and people. Computer - displayed pictures provide a firsthand account of what a far - off location is like. Instead of relying solely on written descriptions, one can visually experience the place. According to Time Magazine, individuals learn @PERCENT1 more about a place by seeing it than by reading an encyclopedia. Similarly, blogs offer insights into the daily lives and perspectives of people in a particular location, providing another form of firsthand information. Moreover, e - books on the internet offer a wealth of knowledge. E - books are digital versions of traditional books, including encyclopedias that contain statistics, facts, and events related to distant places. For example, if you are planning a trip, you can learn about local dining and entertainment options. Computers empower individuals to learn about far - flung places and their inhabitants. Lastly, computers facilitate global communication. You can connect with friends regardless of geographical distance. Have you ever moved and wished to stay in touch with friends from your previous location? With video chat, this is now easily achievable. Not only can you hear their voices, but you can also see them. I recall @NUM1 years ago when I moved to @LOCATION1; I missed my friends in @LOCATION2, so I used video chat to stay connected. In addition to personal communication, businesses can conduct meetings worldwide without the need for travel. For instance, if a company wishes to establish a trading agreement with a firm in @LOCATION3, they can do so with a simple click of a mouse, saving both time and money on travel expenses. Furthermore, you can engage in online conversations to gain insights into current events. For example, @CAPS2 a few weeks ago, I video - chatted with numerous people in @LOCATION4 to understand the situation after an earthquake. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to society. They simplify life, educate us about the world, and enable seamless communication. Computers open up new horizons and contribute significantly to the betterment of society.
816	818	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, you contend that computers are detrimental to society. It has come to my notice that numerous individuals are worried that computers are not particularly beneficial. In my view, I believe computers are advantageous as they aid in developing typing skills. Moreover, computers are highly useful for cropping and editing pictures, and they facilitate the process of finding information. Firstly, computers are extremely helpful in enhancing typing skills. Other individuals who do not use computers take six years to achieve what younger people with proficient typing skills can accomplish very rapidly. In fact, @PERCENT1 of teens can type in a minute what others take @NUM1 minutes to type. Computers have a significant impact on many people's typing skills. Computers also make it possible to edit a multitude of pictures at no cost, unlike using an expensive digital @CAPS2. A computer enables one to quickly access information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. With a computer, you can search for information more efficiently. For instance, if you have to complete a project on @CAPS4, instead of going to the library and spending money on a book about @CAPS4, you can visit google.com and type in @CAPS4. You will find an abundance of information much more quickly. Keep up with the digital age; computers are here to stay. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a remarkable invention. They simplify the process of finding information and improving typing skills. Additionally, they make it considerably easier to crop and edit photos. Please consider my suggestions seriously.
817	819	1	1	Some experts express concerns that individuals are allocating excessive time to their computers and reducing the time spent on physical exercise, appreciating nature, and interacting with family and friends. However, I hold the opposite view. I think this way because there will inevitably come a day when you need to look something up on the computer. Some occupations require job applications to be submitted via computer. Furthermore, a computer enables you to engage in online conversations with others. The primary reason I believe computer usage is beneficial for people is that there will be occasions when you have to conduct online searches. This could involve looking for a job, planning a vacation, or paying a bill. The second reason is that certain jobs necessitate online applications, such as those at Stop and Shop, Price Rite, and Save - A - Lot. This practice is also environmentally friendly as it reduces paper consumption, thereby conserving trees. The third reason is that a computer allows you to communicate with others online. Whether you need to contact a family member, an old friend, meet new people, or prefer not to talk on the phone, the computer provides a convenient alternative. I have now presented all the reasons why I believe using a computer is advantageous: the need for online searches, the requirement for online job applications, and the ability to communicate online. These are significant benefits. I hope you will take my opinion into consideration.
818	820	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and I wish to convey my partial opposition to excessive computer use. There are numerous activities one can engage in the real world, such as visiting places and embarking on cruise ship journeys. Firstly, I would like to elaborate on the various activities available. You can participate in sports like basketball and handball, or simply spend quality time with your friends. Additionally, you can take your car for a morning drive and relish the gentle breeze. Secondly, I want to discuss the places you can visit. You can visit the homes of your friends, your romantic partner, or your family members. Stop being idle; computers do not contribute to a fulfilling life. Finally, I would like to mention the allure of cruise ships. You can travel to distant locations such as @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, and many more. A cruise ship offers a delightful experience, including captain's dinners, opportunities to meet new people, and the chance to behold captivating sights. In conclusion, I advocate that people should cease being overly reliant on computers and seize the opportunity to enjoy the world while it endures.
819	821	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are of utmost importance to our society in the contemporary era. Computers facilitate communication among people, enabling them to stay connected with family and friends online. Secondly, I consider computers essential because they support learning, including online education. Lastly, computers serve as a source of entertainment for individuals. Computers are among the most widely utilized tools on the planet. Nearly every family owns one, and some individuals even possess more than @NUM1. Let's acknowledge the fact that many people travel the world to earn a decent living for their families. Computers assist them in maintaining contact, whether through email or video chat. This not only brings people joy but also keeps them informed about the activities of their family members and friends. For some, it can even reunite long - separated family members, such as by helping someone find their long - lost brother. Computers strengthen family bonds and may even bring unexpected surprises. In addition, computers can be a great source of fun. If you're looking for funny videos, simply conduct a search, and you'll be entertained for hours. I enjoy downloading music, and I'm sure others do too. If a song is stuck in your head, you can easily find it on the computer. You might be cooking and need a recipe; your computer will readily provide the information you need. In summary, computers are one of the most crucial tools in our modern world. We rely on them for various purposes, including staying in touch with family, facilitating learning, and providing entertainment. Computers can offer countless benefits.
820	822	1	1	I am of the opinion that one can never devote an excessive amount of time to using a computer. I believe there are no adverse effects that computers can have on individuals; instead, they only enhance one's quality of life. For instance, if you need to acquire an important fact, date, or time, you can simply search for it on the computer. The internet is an inexhaustible source of knowledge, and you can learn almost anything you desire by conducting a search on the computer. Another valuable function of the computer is its ability to enable communication with others. You can use either @CAPS1 - mail, @CAPS2, or chat rooms to meet new people, converse with distant friends or relatives. You can even connect a webcam and actually see the person as they speak to you, a feature that a phone lacks. Additionally, the computer serves as an excellent source of entertainment. You can play a variety of games available on the internet, and you can even download console games onto your computer. Moreover, you can watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies. If you are following a television series and miss an episode, you can easily look it up. YouTube is also a favorite of mine. Whether you watch random videos, follow famous YouTube stars, or post your own videos, there is always an element of fun. Finally, the computer offers an endless array of programs. These programs can be for entertainment, such as Paint and Flash, or they can be important, like Word or Notepad. Every program the computer provides is both useful and enjoyable to use, and you can utilize most of these programs to assist you in real - life situations. I have now mentioned several reasons why you can never spend too much time on the computer. While exercise and nature are beneficial for health, you can still engage in these activities, such as taking a nature walk. Don't you agree that computers enhance our lives more than they pose any health risks?
821	823	1	1	Some experts express concerns regarding individuals who excessively use computers, thereby neglecting the enjoyment of nature and outdoor activities. In my view, people should utilize computers, yet in moderation. It is beneficial to use the computer for chatting with friends and searching for information that one has never encountered. I assert this because some individuals become addicted to computer games or spend the entire day conversing with friends online. Another reason to venture outside is the opportunity to partake in a wider array of activities, such as sports, tag, and other pastimes. Instead of chatting with a friend on the computer, one could visit the park for a conversation or invite them over to one's residence. Another reason why I believe the experts are correct about the issue of people and computers is the chance to learn about nature and acquire practical skills. I trust that you have found my introduction satisfactory and will continue reading. My first reason is that some people become addicted to computer games and other computer features. I state this because some individuals do indeed become addicted to computers. While it is acceptable to use them occasionally, excessive use should be avoided. It is preferable to go outside, where one can enjoy fresh, cool air. If one owns a dog, they should take it for a walk or stroll with friends. My next reason is the enjoyment of outdoor activities such as playing sports or running around while playing tag. Instead of using the computer, one could go to the park to play basketball or baseball. There are numerous enjoyable activities that can be done outdoors. One should visit their school and try out for any sport in which they excel. In this way, when one becomes bored, there is always something to do, rather than staying at home all day. The final reason why I prefer nature over computers is the opportunity to learn practical skills. It is more beneficial to learn in real - life situations than through computers. One's father can teach them how to stack bricks to build a chimney or how to use a lawnmower to cut other people's yards for money.
822	824	1	1	"Dear editor, I have learned that you are soliciting the opinions of your citizens regarding whether computers are beneficial or detrimental. In my opinion, computers are harmful. I believe that computers have negative impacts in three aspects, and I wish to convey these to you, hoping to persuade you to side with me. The outdoors emits a delightful fragrance today. I can detect the scents of flowers, grass, and much more. My first reason for considering computers harmful is that excessive computer use prevents individuals from fully appreciating nature. Nature is magnificent, boasting colorful foliage, lush green grass, and occasionally rainbows. One can take a leisurely stroll under the moonlight, being at peace with oneself. In other words, nature is truly wonderful, and one should venture out to enjoy it. If one fails to appreciate nature, it may be too late, as soon it will turn rainy. After autumn, with its vibrant colors, winter arrives. Winter is unpleasant; it is cold. One has to engage in laborious tasks such as shoveling the driveway and clearing snow off the car, which can be extremely exhausting. The silver lining is that these chores can be completed. This leads me to my next point about why computers are bad. When was the last time you had a refreshing run? My next reason for deeming computers harmful is that people spend all their time working on computers and have no time for exercise. Exercise is an extremely enjoyable activity that encourages one to go outside, socialize with friends, and so on. Exercise is a crucial means of maintaining good health. Without it, one can become extremely unhealthy, fall ill, and even face serious consequences. I have a friend who spends all his time on the computer. As a result, his body has become weaker and weaker. Therefore, exercise is a vital component of maintaining good health. There are numerous ways to stay fit, such as cycling, running, walking, rowing, climbing a mountain, etc. The possibilities are endless. While exercising in the park, one may unexpectedly meet new people. For instance, your friend might say, ""Hey, what's up?"" ""Not much, just looking for some exercise."" ""Same here."" You never know who you might encounter in the park. That was my friend. He is always there. I wouldn't have met him if I had been inside on the computer. As I mentioned, that's my friend. Since I go there every day, I might meet a new friend every day. So, my final reason for believing that computers are bad is that they deprive one of sufficient interaction time with friends and family. I love my family, but if I am on the computer while they are exercising, there is no opportunity for interaction. In conclusion, I believe that computers are harmful because they prevent one from getting enough exercise, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with family and friends."
823	825	1	1	Dear local [CAPS1], I believe that computers are advantageous for individuals to possess. My first rationale is that children may be required to write an essay for school. Teachers generally prefer that students type their essays. When children write essays, they need to gather information on their chosen topic. My second reason is that children may need to look up important information. They may have to complete an online application as they grow older. For example, high - school students in grades [NUM1] or [NUM2] often search for colleges they wish to attend. My third reason is that children may have emails. When children check their emails, they are likely trying to see if their parents have sent them a message. Additionally, some children who do not live near their family communicate with them via email. My first reason is that children may have to write an essay for school. My second reason is that children may have to look up important things. My third reason is that children may have an email. I sincerely hope that you appreciate the reasons I have presented regarding why computers are beneficial to have.
824	826	1	1	"Dear [CAPS1], As a student from the local middle school, I recognize that technology is being maximally utilized. Computers have facilitated our ability to write essays more effectively and complete research assignments. However, I personally believe that the constant use of computers has a negative impact on individuals. Firstly, computers impede interpersonal relationships. Although platforms like [ORGANIZATION1] assist in maintaining contact with old college friends, no computer can substitute face - to - face communication. From cold, impersonal text, one cannot discern subtle nuances or humor. Moreover, people are increasingly replacing in - person meetings with online networking. With the technological revolution, games such as [ORGANIZATION2] have emerged. These games are highly addictive. Although our society often mocks ""nerds"" for spending excessive time on these seemingly trivial games, it is, in fact, a serious problem. For example, a recent study conducted by [ORGANIZATION3] students revealed that "" [NUM1] out of [NUM2] teenagers who play computer games do not achieve the recommended daily amount of exercise."" This is because these games are so engrossing. The time dedicated to gaming ultimately consumes all of one's free time. This is perilous because a gaming addiction can lead to delusions, a sense of inadequacy, and obesity. As a society, we are rapidly realizing that what was once considered ingenious is actually hazardous. If one were to stare at a backlit screen for extended periods, their eyesight would undoubtedly begin to decline. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative health impacts of computers. As previously mentioned, obesity is also an issue. When combined with poor eyesight, vitamin deficiency, and a negative outlook, a significant problem arises. All of the health problems caused by computers can be mitigated by reducing computer usage and engaging in exercise. Naturally, as a species, we were not meant to spend long hours in a stationary position. This sedentary lifestyle is a new phenomenon that is causing major health problems. The overuse of computers essentially robs us of our time, damages our health, and hinders our social interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people and their well - being."
825	827	1	1	I believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals. Computers are of great significance to society. One can still maintain communication with family and friends through online chat or video calls. Computers are also useful for job applications, as one can search for jobs that they are interested in. They can be used for performing various exercises and are beneficial for writing essays. If one owns a laptop, it can be carried anywhere, as it can connect wirelessly to the internet. One can search for information on the internet for homework and other purposes. One can also purchase items without having to visit a physical store. These are the reasons why I believe that computers have a positive impact on people.
826	828	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have proven to be an invaluable asset to numerous individuals as they progress in knowledge. However, a significant number of people fail to consider the adverse effects of computers. Computers facilitate research by making information more accessible, and they efficiently organize data in a timely manner. Additionally, computers simplify communication; yet, they present both positive and negative aspects. Chat rooms on computers offer a rapid means of communication, but they also pose potential risks. An increasing number of children are spending their time on computers instead of engaging in outdoor activities and interacting with friends and family. Chat rooms are frequented by both children and adults. Children utilize them to converse with friends, make plans, and catch up with relatives. Nevertheless, children are not the sole users of chat rooms; adults also participate. Some do so for beneficial purposes, while others have malicious intent. Adults sometimes use chat rooms for work-related discussions with their colleagues. They can easily communicate completed tasks and upcoming office requirements, such as which bills have been paid. This enables workers to stay informed about office affairs even when away. There are numerous other useful advantages of computers. One such advantage lies in their functions. Computers are highly effective in quickly retrieving information. They are useful for school projects, as they can gather information and present it in graphs or through software like Microsoft PowerPoint. Another benefit is that computers can enhance hand-eye coordination. Typing plays a significant role in this regard. Typing is also advantageous for those with poor penmanship, as they can use computers to type essays, homework, and school projects. This makes it easier for both students and teachers to read the assignments. Despite the many advantages of computers, there are also disadvantages. An increasing number of children are spending their free time on computers rather than engaging in outdoor exercise, leading to a decrease in physical activity. Spending excessive time in chat rooms is also a drawback. Children today are using a new language in chat rooms and while texting, employing abbreviations for words and phrases, such as ""idk"" for ""I don't know."" This language is having a detrimental impact on children's reading and writing abilities. Although chat rooms on computers can be useful, they can also be dangerous. Both children and adults enter chat rooms and provide false information about themselves, such as their age. Some adults pretend to be teenagers in chat rooms and interact with children until they obtain personal information like addresses, phone numbers, schools, and districts. Once they acquire such information, they can learn a great deal about the children. This is extremely dangerous, and unfortunately, it has occurred. As evident, computers offer both advantages and disadvantages. I believe that if people can strike a balance between them, there will be greater consensus regarding computers. In my opinion, computers are useful but also pose risks. If children are more cautious online and spend more time outdoors, there will be less controversy. Parents will be less concerned about their children's safety and health if children use computers solely for homework and are careful about whom they interact with online. Additionally, the content children post in their profiles should be carefully considered. If these measures are taken, a balance will be achieved, and over time, people will become less extreme in their views, and they will feel more at ease."
827	829	1	1	Computers are an extraordinary technological advancement in life. Their significance lies in the fact that they assist a multitude of individuals and occupations. Among those benefited are school - children, who can use computers to research areas relevant to worksheet questions. Moreover, the police, @CAPS1.W.A.T, and the @ORGANIZATION1 also rely on computers. The police and @CAPS1.W.A.T utilize computers to track the whereabouts of individuals and predict their future locations. The @ORGANIZATION1 employs computers to determine attack or defense positions. Without computers, it would have been impossible to locate @CAPS3 @CAPS4. However, there are negative aspects associated with computers. Hackers and individuals overly addicted to computers are a concern. These individuals are so obsessed that they seem inseparable from their computers. This situation can be attributed to parental negligence. These are the primary drawbacks of computers. Excessive computer use can lead to physical inactivity and weight gain as people prefer to stay on the computer rather than engage in physical activities. On the positive side, computers offer a means to reconnect with family and friends over the years. They also control a wide range of crucial aspects, including nuclear bombs, security systems, secret - files, satellites, all of @CAPS5.A.@CAPS1.A., and more. In essence, they play a major role in controlling various aspects of life. People should not overly worry about children who spend excessive time on computers, as it is primarily the fault of the individuals themselves and their parents. Parents often fail to limit their children's computer use or encourage them to participate in sports. This can have a detrimental impact on a child's social life, as they may have few friends at school and focus solely on the computer. It is ironic when a father, who was once a popular and active person in his youth, realizes that his son has become a computer - dependent nerd. In such cases, a responsible father will attempt to help his son, and these efforts can sometimes yield positive results. This is an example of good parenting, as it involves intervening when a child shows excessive computer - related behavior. In contrast, some parents allow their children unrestricted computer use. These are my perspectives on the positive and negative aspects of computers.
828	830	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers exert a positive influence on individuals. Despite the fact that people may be less physically active outdoors, computers offer numerous benefits. Computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination, are convenient, and enable interaction with diverse individuals online. Undoubtedly, computers play a role in teaching hand - eye coordination. The internet hosts numerous websites that teach children to type. Typing helps children familiarize themselves with the alphabet, recognize the appearance of letters, and learn the location of keys on the keyboard. Additionally, there are other websites where the computer interacts with users. Moreover, there are many children and even adults with dyslexia who struggle with letter recognition, but there are software programs that can identify the letters they type. Thus, computers effectively teach hand - eye coordination. Have you ever been a student who received a poor grade on a paper due to messy handwriting? Using a computer is a more convenient option, as it can make your assignment as neat as possible. Firstly, computers are convenient because answers to any question are just a click away. Secondly, there is no need to spend money on purchasing books for research; one can conduct free online research. Finally, it is convenient for teachers and employers, as papers can be submitted via email. Receiving a paper by email is much easier than dealing with hand - written samples. Computers offer convenience in multiple ways. Computers also enable people to engage in video chats and online conversations. Firstly, many families have members living in different locations, and computers allow them to see each other online without leaving their state. Secondly, there are families with military members who have not seen each other in person for years but can communicate online. Lastly, many students and teachers participate in online learning and teaching, which is convenient for those with busy schedules. Therefore, online interaction is made possible through computers. As can be seen, computers have a positive impact. They teach hand - eye coordination, facilitate online chatting, and are highly convenient. So, the next time you plan to visit the library to research a book, consider staying at home and conducting the same research online.
829	831	1	1	I am of the opinion that having computers in a household is a prudent idea. They offer opportunities for gaming, learning, and communication, among other things. Here are three reasons to support this view. Firstly, computers are excellent for gaming. There is a vast array of games to choose from, including card games, board games, and even @NUM1 games. One can play alone, but it is often more enjoyable and easier to play with friends. However, gaming is not the only activity available on computers. Secondly, using a computer for learning is highly beneficial. Computers can transport users to places they have never seen, heard of, or visited, or to locations that may be unaffordable to reach physically. For instance, one can learn that some places have constant sunshine while others do not. Additionally, computers can teach about animals. Animals have existed long before humans, and there is still much to learn about them. Many scientists have dedicated their lives to studying animals and have made their findings available on the internet for self - education. Computers can also improve hand - eye coordination. This skill is essential for sports such as football, baseball, and basketball. Moreover, one never knows when the ability to catch something may come in handy. My final reason is equally important. The ability to communicate on computers is advantageous. Whether using voice chat or instant messaging is a matter of personal choice. While communicating on computers, one may make new friends who share similar interests and hobbies. One can chat with them as long as they are online. During these conversations, individuals can express their ideas and feelings. Sometimes, people just need to relieve stress, or they may post an idea that could potentially become famous. As is evident, gaming, learning, and communication are more accessible on computers. This is why I believe that having computers in a household is a good idea.
830	832	1	1	Dear editor, computers are beneficial to people as they significantly assist with work, homework, and other tasks.
831	833	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Are you squandering all your valuable time in front of a computer? On the computer, you are likely frittering away every second searching aimlessly or indulging in games. You ought not to devote an excessive amount of time to the computer as it will merely erode your mental faculties. You should refrain from using computers for extended periods because instead, you should be engaging in physical exercise, relishing the beauty of nature, and interacting with fellow human beings.  First and foremost, spending an inordinate amount of time on the computer is detrimental to your well - being as you should be outdoors engaging in physical activity. On a computer, you cannot jog off the excess fat accumulated from consuming food. By choosing to jog instead of using the computer, you can shed weight and experience the real world rather than the virtual one on the computer screen.  Nevertheless, computers can be entertaining, such as when playing addictive games. However, isn't it more rewarding to participate in a real - life sport like soccer? In soccer, you have to utilize your intellect extensively, making it far superior to sitting or lying in a daze in front of a computer screen for a long duration. Don't you relish playing outdoor games? For instance, playing tag or hide - and - seek is surely more enjoyable than playing an addictive game on the computer screen. In my opinion, it most certainly is. These are the reasons why I believe you should exercise rather than stare blankly at the computer screen.  Secondly, you should not be glued to the computer for long stretches because you should be savoring the wonders of nature. Nature is resplendent and invigorating, unlike a computer. I am aware that computers offer numerous features, but do they offer the fresh outdoor air, the gentle warm breeze, and the living creatures on Earth? I think not, and neither should you. Instead of using your computer when it's raining, you should play with your pets. If you don't have any, don a raincoat and grab an umbrella and head outside. Especially on @DATE1, you should be outdoors enjoying nature, perhaps going for a swim or taking your rambunctious little siblings to the park. There is far more to experience than spending time on the computer.  More importantly, you should avoid excessive computer use as you would be better off interacting with real people in person. When communicating with others on the computer, it is impossible to discern someone's facial expressions. So, step away from the computer and spend time with your family and friends. Engage in a lively conversation or a stimulating debate. Make new acquaintances when you're at the mall or exploring a new trail in a park. Do anything but interact solely on the computer when all you see are typed words in response. Immerse yourself in the real world, interacting not only with people but also with the environment, not just the computer screen.  In conclusion, you should not expend the majority of your precious time on the computer. It is not necessary to spend all your time on the computer when you could be exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with others. I firmly believe that people should be outdoors rather than in front of a computer. So, what are you waiting for? Turn off the computer and go for a walk!  ### Revised Item 2 Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, The average adolescent spends @NUM1 hours on a computer each day! People allocate an excessive amount of time to their computers, resulting in a significant decline in physical activity. Moreover, they fail to appreciate the magnificent wonders that nature has to offer. Most importantly, individuals who spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer neglect their relationships with family and friends. These are the compelling reasons why people should curtail their computer usage.  Since people invest an excessive amount of time in computer activities, they exercise less and less. A recent survey reveals that @NUM2 out of every @NUM3 @CAPS5 is overweight. If our contemporary society were not inundated with distractions like computers, perhaps people would be more inclined to venture outdoors. In @DATE5, only @PERCENT2 of the @CAPS6 population was obese. So, why has this figure skyrocketed to @PERCENT1 in @DATE6? Back then, electronic devices were not as prevalent, and children regularly engaged in outdoor games with their peers. Nowadays, it is rare for a child to be motivated to put down the mouse and play kickball with neighborhood friends. Children would rather remain in an air - conditioned house than go outside and engage in healthy, invigorating activities. Computers impede people from exercising, thus exerting a negative influence on their physical well - being.  With the widespread popularity of computers, people are becoming increasingly detached from nature. Our society fails to take the time to appreciate the gentle breeze on an @DATE4 @TIME1 or the crashing waves on a sweltering @DATE3 @TIME1. They do not pause to admire the beautiful foliage in @DATE2 or the exhilarating feeling of being showered with snow on a frigid @DATE1 @TIME1. People would rather spend @NUM4 hours in front of a computer, oblivious to the wonders of the natural world. They do not respect the natural beauty that nature so generously provides. Computers detract from people's ability to enjoy the pleasures of nature.  Computers also have a detrimental impact on people's relationships with family and friends. A @NUM5 - year - old @CAPS7 would rather communicate with his girlfriend on the computer than spend quality time with his @CAPS8. Children do not prioritize their time effectively, and the addition of a computer only exacerbates the problem. People have accounts on social networking sites such as Facebook, which can often be filled with drama and cause misunderstandings. Friendships are easily shattered, usually due to some form of miscommunication. It is truly disheartening but true that children would rather watch silly videos than visit their grandparents. Computers have a negative effect on people as they undermine their relationships with loved ones.  People should reduce their computer usage. Computers are a major contributing factor to the significant increase in obesity rates. Children need to regain their health before it is too late! Additionally, people of all ages should recognize the natural beauty of the world, but computers act as a barrier to this appreciation. Most importantly, computers damage many relationships with friends and family, causing stress and unnecessary drama. As is evident, computers have a negative impact on people.  ### Revised Item 3 When you were a child, did your parents permit you to spend the entire day on the computer? Well, my parents do not allow me to do so, and I believe it is unjust. I consider it unfair because using the computer offers numerous advantages, such as enhancing hand - eye coordination. Another benefit is that when you are on the computer, you can engage in video chats with others via webcams. Additionally, with a computer, you can complete homework assignments that require research. Of course, when you are using a computer, you can watch your favorite movies or TV shows, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Aren't these remarkable advantages?  As an adult, @CAPS5, I am certain that you appreciate the convenience of being able to accomplish many tasks from the comfort of your own home. Well, a computer enables you to do just that. One way to stay in touch with others is through online chatting, such as via webcam or my preferred method, @CAPS6, which stands for AOL Instant Messaging. Surprisingly, you can also work online. You can set it up yourself or instruct your boss on how to do it. By the way, if you are an adult who did not attend college at @NUM1 because you had to work, having a computer or laptop allows you to pursue an education online. The best part is that you can study comfortably in your warm bed without any concerns. Don't you think that is an ideal way to spend your @DATE1 @TIME1?  When you are a child of my age, having a computer makes you eager to play online games with friends. This is what most of us kids do these days, but our parents restrict our gaming time. They only allow us to use the computer for extended periods when we are working on a school project. However, as kids, besides playing games all day, we also have a thirst for knowledge about places like @LOCATION1 or the @CAPS7 @CAPS8.  Most people would concur that having a computer allows you to book a hotel online rather than making a trip to the hotel. This is precisely what my parents do. Whenever they plan a vacation, they research everything online, including the hotel, the itinerary, and other details. Indeed, having a computer is extremely useful. Another activity you can engage in is watching movies online while on a plane during a vacation, which is what I do with my laptop. What I enjoy the most is watching TV shows. Every time I watch different episodes of @CAPS9 @PERSON1, time seems to fly by, and a @NUM2 - hour flight feels like only @NUM3 hours.  Finally, I have explained to you why having a computer is a beneficial thing. Firstly, you can perform a wide range of tasks on the computer itself. Secondly, you can complete a substantial amount of schoolwork using it, such as writing a research paper or attending online classes. Lastly, you can make online bookings without having to travel anywhere, thus saving on fuel. So, now it is your turn to decide whether having a computer is a good or bad thing.  ### Revised Item 4 Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that children should be allowed to use their computers. This way, they can communicate with their relatives across the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 whenever they desire. I have family members in @LOCATION1, and I converse with them daily because I own a laptop. They have informed me about my mother residing in @LOCATION2. I inquired with her, and she confirmed that it is true. Thanks to the computer, I was also able to look up the location where my mother lives. Additionally, I learned that @LOCATION3 has one of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in the @CAPS5.  I asked my mother if I could visit @LOCATION3, and she gave her consent. So, I went with my sister, and we even visited our family members. The @CAPS6 that I can describe to you looked exactly as I had imagined. It was very tall, covered with trees. Birds were chirping, and squirrels were climbing the trees. What surprised me the most was the presence of a house for sale on top of the mountain. I wished that my mother had been there because I knew she would have loved it. Every time we visit, we rent that house, all thanks to the computer.  Lastly, you can even search for people on the internet. I heard that Chris Rock almost died. When I got home, I logged on to my laptop and searched for information. There was no mention of him almost dying, but I did discover something that shocked me. It stated that he was getting a divorce from his wife. I think the person who said he almost died probably misread the information.  Now, thanks to computers, we have the opportunity to learn about the @CAPS5 or simply consider what others say. It is time to accept that people should have access to computers for learning and exploration. So, I hope you make a prudent choice. But before you decide, take some time to reflect on it.  ### Revised Item 5 Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, the large rectangular - shaped black or white box with lights and beeps, the computer, was a brilliant innovation! But you may wonder why. Let me elucidate. This device can instruct you in a new language. Skype enables you to communicate with @CAPS1 via the web or phone (although you still have to pay @MONEY1). You can browse the web or have a good laugh on YouTube. Why go out and purchase items when you can simply place an order on eBay or Amazon and be done with it (although you still have to wait for delivery)? Why visit Blockbuster to rent movies when you can access Netflix, order a movie, and keep it for as long as you like, without any late fees or the hassle of driving to the movie store? No more of that inconvenience, please!  Next, let's return to the web. If you own a @CAPS3 or have a built - in camera on your laptop or netbook, you can engage in video chats with @CAPS1 and family members across the globe. If you are the type of person who enjoys video games, then you will surely love this! @CAPS5 ~~@CAPS6's users can download games such as The Sims, Spore, etc. You will also appreciate the @CAPS6. MACs also offer excellent features such as the Finder, Safari, Dashboard, etc. So, that's all I have to say about @CAPS8.  Now, you are probably wondering which computer you should purchase. @CAPS9 @CAPS12 friends at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, you have the ability to choose between @CAPS8 and @CAPS6. However, it is not @CAPS12's decision to select your computer; it is yours. So, go out and make an investment in a computer today!  But I'm not finished yet. You can also choose a laptop, a desktop, or a netbook. I can provide information about all of them, and I will. A laptop is ideal if you are frequently on the move and if you are in the office or have numerous business trips. It is a good idea to have a laptop at hand. A desktop is suitable if you spend a lot of time at home and your work is online or if you simply prefer the comfort of home. Then a desktop is the right choice for you. And last but not least, the netbook. It is perfect if you are often on the go, especially when you are on vacation. It fits neatly on your lap or on a table. If you don't want to get up to use the computer, just grab your netbook and you're ready to go. I almost
832	834	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, The average teenager spends @NUM1 hours on a computer daily! People spend too much time on their computers. They don't exercise as much nowadays. Also, they don't enjoy all the wonderful nature the has to offer. Most importantly, people who spend too much time on the computer don't see their family and friends. These are the reasons why people shouldn't spend so much of their time on a computer. Since people spend too much time on the computer, the exercise less and less. A recent poll shwos that @NUM2 in every @NUM3 @CAPS5 is overweight. If our modern society didn't have so many distractions like computers than maybe people would be bore & maybe fo outside. Back in @DATE5 only @PERCENT2 of the @CAPS6 population was obese. So, why in @DATE6 has this number skyrocketted to @PERCENT1? Back then electronics weren't popular so for fun, kids played games with eachother outside on a regular basis. Now it's rare for a kids to be motivated to put down the mouse, and go play kickball with neighborhood) friends. The kids would rather sit inside a airconditioned hoose thatn go outside & have some good healthy fun & work up a sweat. Computers keep people from exercising so their affect on people is negative. With computers being so popular, people are less involved with nature. Our society doesn't take the time to notice the cool breeze on an @DATE4 @TIME1, or the waves crashing on a hot @DATE3 @TIME1. They don't take time to appreciate has beautiful the follage is in @DATE2, or now it feels to be showered with snow on a chilly @DATE1 @TIME1. People would rather sit at a computer for @NUM4 hours doing wonders of our world. People don't respect the natural beauties that nature has to offer. Computers take away from people enjoying nature's joy. Computers run people's relationships with family and friend. @NUM5 year old @CAPS7 would rather talk to his girlfriend on the computer than spen time with this @CAPS8. Kids don't organize their priorities we enough. as it is, adding a computer into the mix just makes it worse. Peple have accounts on social networking sites like facebook and sometimes they are very drame filled and cause problems. Friendships are easily ruined and usually the cause of this is some kind of misunderstanding. It is very sad but true that kids would rather watch goofy vidoes than visit a grandparent. Computers are negative to people since they ruin their relationships with friends and family. People should spend less time on the computer. Computers are a main factor in the vast increase in obesity rates. Kids need to regain healthyness before it's too late! Also, people of all ages should realize the natural beauty of naturel, but computers get in the way of that. Most importantly, computers ruin many relationships with friends and family. The cause stress and unnecessary drama. As you can see, computer have a negative affect on people.
833	835	1	1	When your were a kid, did your parents let you play all day on the computer? Well my parents don't let me and I think thats not fair. I think it's not fair because being on the computer has a lot of benefits, like teaching you hand-eye cordination. Another advantage is that when your on the computer you can chat with people through webcams. Also with a computer you can do homework assignments for something that requires you to do research. And of course when your on a computer, you can watch your favorite movie or t.v show, like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Now aren't these some great advantages? As an adult @CAPS5 pretty sure that you like to do a lot of things from the comfort of your own home, well when you have a computer you can. One way you can keep in touch is by online chatting like through the webcam or my favorite @CAPS6 which stands for aol instant messaging. Surprisingly, another thing you can do is work online by setting it up at work or telling your boss how to do it. By the way your an adult who didn't go to college when you were @NUM1 because you had to work well. If you have a computer or laptop you can go to school online and the best thing is that you'll be in your bed nice and warm without any worries. Now don't you thinkg that is a nice way to spend your @DATE1 @TIME1? When your a kid my age when you have a computer all you want to do is play games online with friends. Well that is what must of us kids do nowadays but our parents don't let us play to much. The only time they let us stay long is when we maybe doing a project for school. But when your a kid besides playing games all day, we also want to learn about things like @LOCATION1 or the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 that's what you. Most people would agree that when you have a computer you can just book a hotel online of going all the way to the hotel. Of course that what my parents do, everytime a vacation they look everything online like the hotel, the, and the. yes having a computer is helpful. Another thing you can do is watch movies online when you are on a plane going to the vacation, because that's what I do with my laptop. But the thing I like the most is watching shows because everytime I watch different episodes of @CAPS9 @PERSON1 the time goes by so quick that a @NUM2 hour flight only seems like @NUM3 hours. Finally, I have explained to you why having a computer is a good thing. One reason is because you can do a lot of things on the computer itself. A second reason is that you can do alot of school work with it like doing a research paper or going to school online. And my final reason was that you can book things online without going anywhere, wasting gas. So now it's your turn to decide whether having a computer is a good thing or a bad thing.
834	836	1	1	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1 I think that kid's should be alowed to go on here computers. So they can talk to there relitives across. The @CAPS5 @CAPS2 they want to.

836	838	1	1	Dear Newspaper Writers, I believe that different websites exert distinct effects on individuals. For instance, @ORGANIZATION1 provides news regarding global events. Other websites featuring various types of games may prove detrimental to some people, as certain games are not entirely appropriate. Most educational websites are designed to assist individuals in learning. One can acquire a substantial amount of knowledge using a computer. One can buy and sell an item one owns and obtain numerous things all on a single website. A computer can serve multiple purposes.
837	839	1	1	Computers stand as one of the most remarkable technological advancements to date. Not only are they engaging, but they also confer significant benefits upon society. Firstly, computers offer an excellent means of communication with others, whether through instant - messaging, email, video - messaging, or services like @ORGANIZATION1. Moreover, computers present numerous learning opportunities. There exist thousands of websites containing information relevant to one's search, whether it pertains to simple matters such as baking cookies or more complex inquiries like the number of stars in the sky. Lastly, computers simplify daily life by fulfilling everyday needs. To commence, computers are an outstanding communication source. I recall a time when my father traveled to @LOCATION1 on business. Due to the high cost of international cellphone service, my father could not use his cell phone for calls. Instead, he utilized @ORGANIZATION1, which was conveniently accessible on the computer. Apart from facilitating real - time communication, computers also aid in disseminating news and weather information. A few weeks ago, our cable service was out. Since it was @DATE1, my family had no way to obtain information. As computers are more reliable than our cable provider, we were able to look up the necessary details. We learned that school was indeed closed. Through our computer, we were connected to the world. Additionally, computers offer enhanced learning opportunities. Beyond being an exceptional communication tool, computers are ideal for searching and research. For nearly all my school assignments requiring research, I have employed a computer. Sometimes, one can even find articles from library books online. Some assert that the library is always the optimal place to find information, but I dissent. More often than not, the internet provides an ample amount of information for my requirements. Studies indicate that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals claim that computers answer their questions more effectively than library books. Furthermore, computers simplify life considerably. From typing and research to communication and travel arrangements, computers ease daily chores. When my cousin was in high school, she was assigned a @NUM3 - word essay for homework. Manually counting every word is arduous, and writing such a long essay is unappealing. Hence, my cousin opted to type it. It saved time and was neater. She completed her typed essay in @NUM4 hour, while her friend took @NUM4 @NUM4/2 hours to finish by hand - writing. Clearly, using computers is more efficient. In conclusion, computers are beneficial as they are an excellent communication source, offer abundant learning opportunities, and simplify life significantly. Thank you for reading, and I hope I have convinced you that computers are one of the greatest technological advancements and their benefits to society are immense.
838	840	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I concur that computers have a positive influence on individuals. This is because using a computer enhances hand - eye coordination, facilitates the acquisition of knowledge about distant places and people, and enables communication with others. Operating a computer contributes to the development of hand - eye coordination. Specifically, the use of the mouse and keyboard aids in this regard. For example, when using a computer, one can operate the mouse without constantly looking at one's hands. This enhances hand - eye coordination as one can perceive the position of one's hand without visual inspection. Similarly, when learning the layout of the keyboard, one can eventually type without looking. Moreover, computers facilitate learning. The internet, a primary feature of computers, provides access to information about remote locations and individuals. Given the multitude of links and websites available on computers, both children and adults can quickly obtain information. Without computers, one would have to visit a library, and if the required information is unavailable, one would need to search extensively for a relevant book. This is why computers are invaluable. Additionally, computers enable individuals to maintain contact with those at a distance. Chat rooms and groups are examples of this functionality. Whether a relative or friend is far away or nearby, chat rooms simplify communication. These platforms also bring joy to many, as they allow people to stay connected with old friends and relatives, preventing the loss of these relationships. In conclusion, the examples of computers enhancing hand - eye coordination, facilitating information acquisition, and enabling communication demonstrate their positive impact.
839	841	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers do not detract from opportunities for exercise, appreciation of nature, or interaction with friends and family. Families can impose time limits on computer usage if they believe an individual is spending excessive time on it. By setting time limits, individuals will have a specific schedule for using and discontinuing computer use. For example, if a child is engrossed in the computer for @NUM1 and cannot be persuaded to stop, time limits can resolve this issue. If a child is playing a game and time limits are in place, the computer will automatically log off when the allotted time expires. This ensures that the child cannot resume using the computer until the next permitted time. Computers offer a variety of functions, including playing online games and chatting with friends. Chatting via computer allows individuals to communicate with friends without the need for phone calls. Online games not only enable interaction with friends but also provide an opportunity for creativity through the customization of avatars. For instance, an online game can facilitate chatting and friendship - building.
840	842	1	1	"@CAPS1. The computer is an extraordinary invention! Nevertheless, its effects on people can be adverse. Consider this: it possesses magnetic allure that draws people in and holds them captive for hours. These alluring forces prevent people from exercising, spending time with family and friends, and, most importantly, if they are not vigilant, can expose them to cyber - related risks. I conversed with the @CAPS2 of @PERSON2, and he stated, ""There are so many people glued to their computers that they aren't getting enough exercise!"" When people do not engage in sufficient physical activity, their bodies expand, leading to obesity. This is a common occurrence among the general population. The @CAPS2 and I brainstormed some excellent ideas during our discussion, and we have decided that for one week in @DATE1, we will live without electricity! Computers are highly useful; they rapidly disseminate important information and simplify communication with friends and family. However, although one can communicate with others via computer, one does not develop new social skills. Typing on a computer differs significantly from face - to - face conversation. Typically, one might type ""u"" instead of ""you"" or ""r"" instead of ""are"". @PERSON1 remarks, ""Talking over the computer is great, but actually seeing my family and having in - person conversations is far superior."" Furthermore, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, @CAPS8, and numerous other websites can expose users to cyber danger. Cyber danger refers to situations where one encounters trouble on the computer. This can occur when one posts inappropriate pictures of oneself or others, communicates with strangers, or says something offensive. These scenarios can place one in a difficult situation. Even if one has a private webpage, there is always a way for unauthorized access. There is also the issue of cyberbullying, which occurs when one is bullied or bullies others over the computer. Do not assume that no one will discover such behavior, as there are methods to track conversations. I sincerely hope that you all consider these points when contemplating spending time at your computer! Go outside, spend time with your family and friends, and be cautious of cyber danger! ""@NUM1"" bye!"
841	843	1	1	A substantial number of individuals would contend that computers do not confer benefits upon people. However, I am of the opinion that computers are exceedingly advantageous as they serve as an excellent means of learning, offer an enjoyable user experience, and provide an effective avenue for reconnecting with old friends. I am cognizant that there are some individuals who spend an excessive amount of time on computers; nonetheless, computers remain highly beneficial.  Computers represent an outstanding method of learning because one can effortlessly ascertain the @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 on a computer. Conversely, if one were to eschew the use of a computer and visit a library, it could consume hours to locate the relevant information and determine its position within the book. Additionally, one can stay abreast of the news more promptly without having to wait for it to be broadcast on the news channel.  Computers are far superior to making a trip to a library since with just a few clicks, one can find the desired information and conclude the search. Computers are also entertaining as one can engage in small games on the internet, which can readily occupy an additional @NUM1 minutes during a work break or before school. Moreover, some games, such as solitaire, not only provide amusement but also stimulate the mind.  Nonetheless, there are certain games to which people may become overly addicted. Nevertheless, the majority of individuals have either never played such games or do so only occasionally. Lastly, computers are an ideal way to maintain contact with old friends as there are numerous online communication platforms. For instance, if one's best friends from high school have moved away, one can still communicate with them in a chat room through text or via a video chat to have a face - to - face conversation.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are helpful as they facilitate learning, entertainment, and communication. Overall, computers are highly beneficial.
842	844	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 local @CAPS2, I believe that computers exert a positive influence on people. Do you concur that they have a positive impact? Well, I shall present @NUM1 reasons why you should affirm, ""@CAPS8"". Firstly, computers teach hand - eye coordination. Secondly, they endow the ability to learn and obtain your @CAPS3 online. Thirdly, you can communicate with people across the globe. These are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons.  The first reason pertains to hand - eye coordination. Possessing hand - eye coordination empowers you to accomplish anything. This skill can enhance your employability and even assist you in excelling at a sport you favor. Hand - eye coordination is crucial because in @DATE1, the world revolves around computers and cell phones. This is @CAPS1 first reason.  The second reason relates to how computers can educate people. The internet hosts a plethora of websites offering guidance on obtaining your @CAPS3 online. Moreover, you can enroll in online classes. There is a @PERCENT1 drop - out rate, and @PERCENT2 of those students lack their @CAPS3, so they turn to online classes. Computers can truly be of great help. This is @CAPS1 second reason.  Finally, people frequent online chat rooms to converse and meet new individuals. Meeting new people is a worthwhile endeavor. You can gain insights into their lifestyle and place of residence. Chat rooms are also appealing. You can interact with your friends online without expending your phone minutes. This is @CAPS1 last reason.  Now, I have concluded, but do you recall the question I posed? (Do you think computers have a positive effect on people?) What is your stance? I sincerely hope you respond, ""@CAPS8, they are a positive influence"". In any case, those are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons. P.S. I sincerely hope you purchase a computer after reading this!"
843	845	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, as @CAPS1 everyone recognizes, technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace each day. This is a favorable development that can assist people in resolving everyday challenges such as @CAPS19, finding solutions to problems, and @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 work. The more sophisticated computers become, the more advanced people become in turn.  To commence, computers facilitate communication. Just envision someone on the opposite side of the world. You can utilize platforms like @CAPS3 and email to communicate rapidly through typing. I @CAPS4, like @ORGANIZATION2, can promptly transmit live videos of oneself across the globe. Without these technologies, we would be restricted to using only telephones and would never be able to see each other's faces.  With @CAPS5 book, you can also @CAPS6 @CAPS7 as never before. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you couldn't @CAPS15 @CAPS6 @CAPS7? Well, I have. @CAPS7 can be effortlessly uploaded within minutes. In the past, @CAPS10 dissemination was extremely slow. Presently, thanks to computers, we can be informed of an event only a few minutes after it occurs. Computers can relay information at nearly the speed of light.  It is also significantly easier to access @CAPS10. You merely need to manipulate the mouse a few times, and you will discover the largest repository of @CAPS10 ever. There is international @CAPS10, @CAPS11 @CAPS10, and much more at your fingertips. @CAPS10 also spreads more rapidly on the internet than on @CAPS10 @CAPS14 or @CAPS15.V. There are also online @CAPS10 @CAPS14 such as the @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18 and magazines like Time.  Have you ever felt ill and not wanted to leave your home? Well, you can now conduct all your @CAPS19 online. There is no longer a need to visit a store to purchase furniture, clothes, or even groceries. You can log on to a computer and access almost every store with ease. You can buy an entire @CAPS16 @CAPS20, a @CAPS16 couch, and even your groceries in just ten minutes. You can even search for houses or cars online. @CAPS19 on the internet has genuinely transformed the world in ways that no one could have imagined fifteen years ago.  In summary, computers have made life more convenient for almost everyone who owns one. As @CAPS1 computers become more intelligent, perhaps they will be capable of performing extraordinary tasks such as working for us and automatically purchasing items when we are running out of @CAPS22. The possibilities are endless.
844	846	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I have become aware of the issue regarding people spending excessive time on their computers. In my view, I believe that people should curtail their computer usage and allocate more time outdoors for several compelling reasons.  One reason is that spending more time outdoors enables people to engage in physical activity and obtain more exercise. When one exercises, it can lead to weight loss, a feeling of lightness, and an enhanced self - image. Moreover, regular exercise makes one more active and energetic.  Another reason is that excessive computer use can lead to lethargy. If one fails to venture outside to play or exercise, they will become fatigued, irritable, and less likely to comply with their parents' requests as their attention will be fixated on the computer screen.  My final but equally important reason is that excessive computer use causes people to miss out on family - oriented fun. Since many individuals are engrossed in their computers, they often miss parties, social events, family dinners, and movie nights. If you do not wish to forgo these enjoyable experiences, I recommend that you increase your outdoor activities and refrain from being a sedentary individual.  As is evident, there are numerous reasons to spend more time outdoors participating in activities such as cycling, dining out, or taking a leisurely stroll while walking the dog. I sincerely hope that my viewpoints hold significance for you and that you will concur with me. Thank you for your time.
845	847	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, ""@CAPS1 isn't technology advancing?"" queries four - year - old @PERSON2. There are innumerable reasons, chief among them being that people are squandering an inordinate amount of time on existing technology, such as computers. Instead of using this time productively, people are neglecting exercise, the appreciation of nature, and quality time with friends and family.  Consider this: when you spend an hour on the computer, how many calories do you think you burn? According to a study conducted at @ORGANIZATION2, one of the world's premier colleges, you burn only @NUM1 calories. To maintain a healthy weight, one must burn at least @NUM1,000 calories per day. The average citizen in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 spends @NUM3 hours on the computer, which amounts to @NUM4 calories. Even if they engage in aerobic exercise for the remainder of the day, they cannot burn enough calories as one can only burn @NUM5 calories per hour in an average aerobics class.  If people cannot maintain a healthy weight, they are at risk of becoming obese. Obesity can lead to heart attacks, and a heart attack can be fatal. @PERCENT2 of the obese population in the @LOCATION4 die from a heart attack. Undoubtedly, computers can be likened to poison; moderate use may cause harm, but excessive use can be life - threatening.  Imagine the idyllic scene of birds chirping in the trees, deer sipping water from a cold pond, and a fox playfully chasing a butterfly in the distance. If you are among the @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 who have witnessed such a sight firsthand, you are fortunate. ""@CAPS3 fellow @CAPS2, I sorrowfully state that the rainforest in @LOCATION3 is being decimated as we speak. This is because the @CAPS5 never venture outside to breathe fresh air and behold the true beauty of the rainforest. We must put an end to this!"" pleads former @CAPS6 @PERSON3 in an internationally televised speech.  Regrettably, only @NUM6 out of every @NUM7 @CAPS2 can relate to this message. @PERCENT3 of @CAPS2 have never experienced nature. As a result, people are indifferent to nature and the rainforest. Consequently, the rainforest is being mercilessly destroyed, and animals are losing their habitats. When a poll was conducted among the @PERCENT3 of people who rarely go outdoors to enjoy nature, @PERCENT1 of them attributed their lack of outdoor activity to being too preoccupied with computer use.  The computer is a menace; it is destroying our planet. ""I love @CAPS3 mommy. I miss her every day before dinner,"" laments eight - year - old @PERSON1. Using computers squanders time that could be spent with loved ones, even if you are communicating with them online. When a @NUM5 - year - old cancer patient, @ORGANIZATION3, was on his deathbed, he expressed his regret, saying, ""I wish I hadn't used the computer so much; I would have gotten to know @CAPS3 family and friends better."" @ORGANIZATION3 passed away later that day.  Do you want to carry the burden of such regret until your own death? Certainly not. In a drug rehab center, when the @ORGANIZATION4 asked patients why they started using drugs, @PERCENT4 replied that they felt unloved by their families. When further questioned about the cause of this feeling, @PERCENT5 of them attributed it to their loved ones being too engrossed in computers.  Unless you want to endanger the well - being of your loved ones, refrain from excessive computer use. Clearly, computers are detrimental technological devices. While they may aid in coordination, would you prefer to be proficient at catching a ball but forgo family time and the appreciation of nature, or would you rather be healthy, loved, and loving?"
846	848	1	1	Computers offer substantial assistance in numerous aspects. I am convinced that computers can exert a highly significant and necessary influence on you. @CAPS5 can enable you to @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and obtain inexpensive @CAPS3. The computer can @CAPS1 you in a multitude of engaging ways. The swift manner in which @CAPS5 can @CAPS1 is by @CAPS4 assisting others in planning @CAPS4 vacations and providing them with funds. Additionally, @CAPS5 can @CAPS1 by possessing knowledge of diverse things, such as @CAPS6 if you become lost or showing you the way there. The second way it helps is by offering @CAPS2. The computer can furnish you with an abundance of @CAPS2. I utilize the computer @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS7 of. @CAPS5 also supplies me with @CAPS2 regarding a @CAPS8 college that I would @CAPS9 and desire to attend. The final way the computer is helpful is in the matter of purchasing. If you @CAPS10 online, you can do so via the computer. I @CAPS9 this device because you need not purchase something that has just been released @CAPS4 at a prohibitively expensive @CAPS12; you can simply @CAPS10 online and @CAPS11 @CAPS5 @CAPS4 at a more affordable @CAPS12. Moreover, when @CAPS13 mom wished to @CAPS11 a new @CAPS15 from the dealer but @CAPS5 was costly, she went online and bought @CAPS5 at a lower price than they would have sold it to us. This is how the computer can prove useful when you require @CAPS5. This is why I believe that the computer is beneficial to you.
847	849	1	1	Dear Local @ORGANIZATION1 Publication, I firmly contend that computers confer benefits upon society. For instance, if a student needs to compose a report on Europe, a computer can readily provide accessible information, enabling them to complete their project at home. Computers serve as excellent means to interact with people online, thereby facilitating social engagement. They also enhance hand - eye coordination, enabling individuals to perceive their surroundings more effectively. I further opine that computers are advantageous to society as they can motivate students to succeed in their tests, progress through the school year, and gain proficiency in using them. Computers are a rich source of knowledge and can enhance students' understanding of subjects such as history or science. You should concur with me because local @ORGANIZATION1 papers often source their information from the internet. Without computers, the operations of @ORGANIZATION1 would be sluggish. Moreover, computers have positive impacts on individuals as they educate them about potential hazards, fostering greater awareness. They also strengthen finger grip, thereby increasing typing speed. Additionally, computers offer the quickest way to stay informed about @ORGANIZATION1 - related matters or the weather. For example, if there is a forecast of a snowstorm, you can check whether school will be in session.
848	850	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever contemplated the effects of computers on human beings, including their impacts, outcomes, and influence on education? I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. Computers empower people to communicate with others online, offer educational opportunities in specific domains, and cultivate hand - eye coordination. Who asserts that the sole means of contacting or communicating with someone is through letters or the telephone? The technological advancements associated with computers enable people to engage in online conversations with others in a rapid, effortless, and enjoyable manner. Suppose you have a question for a friend, but the phone is occupied. Writing a letter is an option, yet letters can be time - consuming, especially when your question is urgent. The computer presents an accessible alternative for communication. Imagine you are a talented singer with a melodious voice and are eager to find an agent. Thanks to the advanced technology of computers, you can locate an agent promptly. Email, websites, @CAPS1, and other platforms offer various avenues to contact that agent. Computers are indeed an outstanding medium for communication. The human mind is an extraordinary entity. It can amass knowledge while retaining the capacity to learn and comprehend more. Reading books is an excellent way to acquire knowledge, but the internet offers a wealth of additional resources, allowing you to access the works of numerous great authors. The computer enables you to explore distant places and learn about important figures without having to visit the library. Have you heard of online colleges? They are frequently advertised on @CAPS2.V. Some individuals may perceive learning from home, while lying in bed with a laptop, as a distracting approach. However, consider the comfort and the absence of intimidation from others. Computers can facilitate the attainment of a college degree in a comfortable environment. Hand - eye coordination is a remarkable skill. Alongside video games, computer games can effectively develop this ability. Parents may assume that children are wasting time playing computer games, but in reality, they are challenging their minds and enhancing their hand - eye coordination. Computers play a crucial role in psychological learning. Hand - eye coordination is subtly imparted through the games we play, often without our conscious awareness. This skill enables us to catch a ball or participate in sports, and computers contribute to its development.
849	851	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, Over the past few years, extensive studies have been conducted, revealing that individuals of all ages allocate @PERCENT1 of their leisure time to using computers. This phenomenon has emerged as a widespread issue across our state and country. Computers are increasingly consuming people's lives. An anonymous source claims to use their computer to reconnect with old friends. Research indicates that phone usage has declined as adults and teenagers prefer to communicate via email or instant messaging. This often results in individuals sitting in front of a computer screen, awaiting a response. @PERSON1, a student at @ORGANIZATION2, remarks, ""I access the computer once or twice a week. I don't use it extensively because I prefer to socialize with my friends outdoors rather than remain confined in a room alone."" Some individuals believe that computers facilitate social interaction, yet in reality, it often involves sitting in front of a screen and communicating with people one may not know well. When one sits down at the computer and begins sending emails, they engage in little to no physical activity. The most common movement individuals make is to get up and use the restroom, after which they promptly return to their chair, making minimal movements. @PERCENT2 of those who spend prolonged periods in front of a computer become obese due to a lack of calorie - burning activity. Moreover, since they do not release sufficient endorphins, they often experience low levels of happiness. If they were to engage in outdoor physical activities, they would likely be fitter and happier. Teenagers often feel a sense of power when using a computer, which may lead them to disobey parental rules more easily. They also find it easier to engage in cyberbullying through the internet or social networks. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION2 Middle @ORGANIZATION2 admit to being victims of online bullying. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 acknowledge being bullied and are understandably reluctant to be targeted on platforms like Facebook or MySpace, where personal information is publicly accessible to peers. Teenagers should have limited computer access to avoid actions they may regret in the future. Therefore, both adults and teenagers should recognize that while using a computer is acceptable, it should not be over - indulged. This generation needs to be reminded that life should not revolve around the computer. Ideally, one should spend less than @NUM5 minutes a day checking emails or instant messaging friends and then engage in outdoor activities and spend time with family and friends."
850	852	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, In light of the recent technological advancements in contemporary society, there is a significant degree of controversy surrounding computers. While many individuals advocate that computers have a positive impact on society, others hold a contrary view. I believe that technology can be both beneficial and detrimental. On one hand, technology has facilitated remarkable progress in various fields. For example, modern medicine would be severely limited without computer technology, and the military relies heavily on computers to operate effectively. The potential for further societal advancement with the aid of computers is immense. On the other hand, excessive immersion in technology often results in individuals having less interaction with the outside world. I am of the opinion that a balance can be struck between these two perspectives. Computers have undeniably contributed to significant advancements in modern society. Consider the fields of medicine and the military; they have been revolutionized by computer technology. However, it is also important to recognize the drawbacks. It is reported that @CAPS1 individuals spend an average of @NUM1 hours per week on computers, which reduces their exposure to the real world. Our state invests a substantial amount of money in parks each year, yet many people neglect to utilize them. Additionally, increased computer usage often leads to a sedentary lifestyle, as individuals engage in minimal physical activity. This lack of exercise can result in obesity and a decrease in endorphin production, leading to unhappiness. Moreover, excessive computer use can also strain family relationships, as individuals miss out on valuable interactions. Although computers are extremely useful, it is essential to be able to disconnect and appreciate the important aspects of life beyond the digital realm. Computers can be a double - edged sword, but I believe that a balance can be achieved. While entire companies depend on computers, and many people would lose their jobs if computers ceased to function, individuals, particularly teenagers, should limit their computer time. For example, for every hour spent on the computer, one should spend an equal amount of time outdoors or with family. In conclusion, computers are instrumental in driving societal progress, but we must learn to use them in moderation.
851	853	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are potent machines in our contemporary world. A significant portion of the populace is so engrossed with computers that it seems as if they ""eat, sleep, and drink"" them. This is often the case for those in their forties still living with their mothers. However, for the most part, computers are predominantly utilized by teenagers and business professionals. Computers are an indispensable tool in daily life. We all recall feigning illness just to accompany our parents to the office, where we would draw pictures and spin in office chairs. Meanwhile, our parents were diligently engaged in their work. They conversed with their supervisors, made copies, attended meetings, sipped coffee, and, most importantly, spent half of their day working on the computer. This could involve creating spreadsheets, designing logos, editing documents, or acquiring new clients. Approximately ninety percent of workers rely on computers to perform their jobs, whether it's sending work to overseas companies or those just down the hallway. In @LOCATION1, computers are essential for most occupations. Moreover, modern computers are remarkable as they are equipped with the internet. The internet enables us to communicate with individuals worldwide and access a wealth of information, such as the news, the nearest bridal shop, the largest shopping mall, the closest race - car track, and nearby pizza places. The internet offers a plethora of possibilities. I'm aware that in Granby, one has to purchase the newspaper, but instead, one can simply access the news on their computer. One can look up the weather, celebrity gossip, and details about the plane crash your mother mentioned. Computers can provide valuable information, but only if one knows how to use them effectively. One notable advantage is the ability to watch television and movies directly on the computer. This eliminates the need to subscribe to expensive cable channels. You can enjoy your favorite shows and movies. Teenagers, in particular, spend a substantial amount of time on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or MySpace. These online platforms offer several benefits, such as the opportunity to chat with old friends and share family photos. You can update others on your activities or express your grief when your pet passes away. The internet can be used for virtually anything. Lastly, you can purchase music on computers. Instead of spending @MONEY1 on an album, you can now buy a single song for a dollar. You can also buy a variety of items online, including clothes and food. That's the power of the computer."
852	854	1	1	"In my view, the more time we spend on the computer, the more lethargic we become. Firstly, a computer is, in essence, an extremely convenient ""assistant"" as it can perform most tasks that a human can. This can lead individuals to develop a high level of indolence, simply sitting at home browsing websites. The influence of computer technology has a profound impact on a large segment of the population, causing them to squander a significant portion of their day. Secondly, people often choose to stay at home in front of the computer rather than engaging in physical exercise. It is highly detrimental to one's health to remain seated at a computer all day. Since people need to eat, they typically consume food and then resume sitting at the computer. This situation can quickly get out of control as the computer allows people to order food online. This is a prime example of how people avoid exercise and become lazy. Regular exercise is essential, and those who are not currently exercising should start. Instead of spending the entire day sitting at the computer, one should get up and move. Thirdly, many people around the world have loved ones whom they cherish deeply. However, they fail to spend quality time with them because they are constantly glued to the computer. The computer should not supplant our outdoor activities and face - to - face interactions. Although we can communicate with friends and family over the computer, it can never replace the experience of meeting them in person. We should go outside and create happy memories with our families. After all, computer communication is just a series of text messages, lacking the warmth and authenticity of spoken words. I guarantee that once you spend quality time with your family, you will want to do it again. While outdoors, you can exercise and engage in meaningful interactions. In conclusion, excessive computer use is not advisable. One should set aside a few hours each day for exercise and outdoor activities. Enjoy a wonderful day outside because the computer only serves to make us lazier (@CAPS1 YOU). If you are a frequent computer user, ensure that you get enough exercise and spend time with your family. This will contribute to your personal growth and well - being."
853	855	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers exert both negative and positive influences on individuals. Prior generations managed to lead fulfilling lives without the aid of computers. Although computers offer numerous benefits, the negative impacts far outweigh them. For instance, previous generations thrived and passed away without computers, and their lives were not adversely affected. Moreover, in this century, a significant number of children and adults are obese due to the rapid advancement of technology. Many individuals become obese because they are born into a technological era and spend excessive amounts of time sitting in front of computers, which leads to a sedentary lifestyle. They regard computers as a necessity rather than a form of entertainment. While computers facilitate communication and keep people informed about their lives, this is merely their primary function. As a student, I use my computer primarily for academic purposes, such as writing essays, printing research materials. However, these tasks can also be accomplished using pen and paper and by seeking information from others. This highlights the fact that people do not need to be overly reliant on computers as they can perform essential tasks independently. Additionally, with the widespread availability of cell phones, computers are not indispensable for communication. Cell phones are a safer alternative as they are less susceptible to viruses, and personal information is more secure, reducing the risk of strangers accessing private details. In conclusion, computers are not conducive to a healthy lifestyle as they encourage a sedentary existence without sufficient exercise, and they are not essential for daily life.
854	856	1	1	When utilizing technology, it is typically for work - related purposes. Computers are employed in the workplace to write essays, create presentations, and conduct research. However, when people use them for platforms like Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS1, and other live - chat services such as Oovoo and various websites, it is more for personal enjoyment. I only access Facebook to check my hockey schedule, while most children use it for socializing. Similarly, Oovoo and other online video - chat services are used for chatting with friends, but one might wonder why not simply make a phone call. When I think of Facebook, Oovoo, or MySpace, I am reminded of the inappropriate pictures posted by both children and adults. I believe this is highly unethical and dangerous because once such content is posted online, it can never be completely removed. For example, during warm weather, I prefer to be outdoors socializing. In winter, I can understand using Facebook, but during the @DATE1, there is no excuse not to go outside and have fun. Children often wonder why they gain weight. Well, if they were to step away from the computer and stop consuming junk food like Twinkies, they would realize the importance of being active. Some parents seem indifferent to what their children do all day. They do not care if their child weighs @NUM1 lbs at the age of @NUM2 or if they spend the entire day sitting at the computer, eating. If I could describe the feeling of being a couch potato, I would, but I only use the computer for homework. I used the computer just @TIME1 to type up all my homework, except for math. I did not play any games, check my email, or browse the internet; I simply focused on my work and completed it. In conclusion, using a computer is not inherently bad, but excessive use without physical activity is. A computer is not designed for mere entertainment; it is intended to simplify our lives. People spend a significant amount of money on expensive computers, monitors, and other high - tech accessories to streamline their lives. Nowhere in this essay did I suggest using a computer for gaming because that is not its primary purpose. Games can be played outdoors, and there is no need to be confined to a computer. To enhance everyone's quality of life, children should be more active, stop overeating junk food, and reduce their computer usage.
855	857	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, Have you ever yearned to see your @CAPS3 residing across the country? Computers can make this possible. They have a positive impact on people in multiple ways. For instance, they enable individuals to communicate with family and friends globally and facilitate easy access to information they seek. While some may argue that computers lead to social isolation, in fact, they help people stay connected by allowing them to chat or type with their loved ones. People can now converse with relatives in the comfort of their homes without being concerned about their appearance. Moreover, computers can reduce phone bills. Instead of calling your mother in @LOCATION1, you can simply use an online chat service, which is as effective as a phone call, and you can even see each other on some platforms. Some individuals believe that computers provide excessive access to information, but in reality, they offer the opportunity to gain knowledge. This is particularly beneficial for students conducting research. In my experience, during the fall semester (@NUM1), or for people @CAPS6, computers allow you to quickly find the information you need. There is no evidence to suggest that computers cause isolation or keep people away from their families. In conclusion, computers are valuable tools that enhance our lives by connecting us with others and providing access to a vast amount of information.
856	858	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, I opine that we ought to apprise the denizens of @LOCATION1 regarding the perils of excessive computer usage. For instance, individuals who utilize the computer incessantly tend to allocate less time to other activities in general. Moreover, the longer one remains engaged with it, the more entrenched this habit becomes, leading to an addiction that may prove arduous to overcome. Ultimately, those who habitually play video games on computers commence to lose touch with reality. Computers are transforming this nation into a cohort of indolent individuals. If you have offspring, contemplate what they predominantly do throughout their lives. Perhaps they venture outdoors for physical exertion, or alternatively, their minds could become ensnared by a computer screen. The majority of children by the age of @NUM1 have already employed a computer for over @NUM2 hours. This indicates that children expend more time using the computer than engaging in any other activity. I had an acquaintance named @CAPS1 who used the computer @NUM3, and eventually, he became so frail and emaciated due to a lack of exercise that one could snap his arm like a twig. Please, if you do not desire your children to resemble @CAPS1, exhort them to rise and play outdoors. You may presume that daily computer usage cannot engender an addiction, yet computers can be as addictive as narcotics. Scientists have discovered that daily computer usage for one hour suffices to develop an addiction. In fact, if we were to screen individuals for addiction, @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION2 population would be addicted to computers. This implies that @NUM4 years hence, the global addiction to computers could reach @PERCENT2 or higher. Do you wish to reside in a world where nearly everyone uses their computers @NUM3? I do not. Video games represent one of the most remarkable advancements in computer technology, yet they are also among the most pernicious. If you possess a computer, you will have access to video games. Moderate usage can be acceptable, but incessant play can give rise to severe issues. Owing to the fantastical content, individuals may begin to lose sight of reality. For example, scientists conducted a test on children using a video game, and now @PERCENT1 of them believe in zombies. Consequently, they can no longer play the game as it may cause severe brain damage. To ensure that you comprehend my stance, let us recapitulate. Excessive computer usage equates to a dearth of exercise and social interaction, facilitates easy addiction, and can erode one's sense of reality. I trust that you do not wish to witness your or your children's brilliant minds reduced to mush by computers.
857	859	1	1	The invention of computers marked a significant stride in human discovery. Regrettably, the adverse aspects of this remarkable innovation overshadow its novelty. Alongside the advent of computers emerged a phenomenon of physical inactivity and a disinterest, or even an inability, to appreciate nature. In addition to this mental deterioration, this technological behemoth is the insidious cause of numerous deteriorating relationships, as who has the time for friends and family while engrossed in an online game? Despite the computer's uniqueness and allure, it is gradually corroding the human mind. An escalating fascination with a computer monitor often results in a diminishing concern for physical exercise and a decline in the daily amount of physical activity. While engaged in computer use, the mind may be racing, yet the body remains immobile, with little to no physical activity taking place. Indeed, for some, the addiction is so severe that an individual only moves to obtain food, use the restroom, retire to bed, or when compelled by a parent. All of the day's sustenance accumulates in the stomach, with little to none of it being burned off. Meanwhile, in more extreme cases, individuals become so captivated that their bedtimes are postponed. Sleep is essential for both the body and the mind, and sleep deprivation can be detrimental. Nowadays, computers impede the sleep and exercise that the body requires. Even nature has suffered as a consequence of the rise of computers. Fewer individuals venture outdoors to admire its splendor. Nature serves as an excellent educator about the cycle of life and the natural order of the world. Often, parallels can be drawn between the wild and the domesticated. As people become increasingly attached to computers, they are unable to fully experience the world. Some contend that flora and fauna can be found online, but viewing a picture is fundamentally different, almost a form of deception, compared to being in the presence of the plant, able to examine it from all angles rather than in a static image. The experience is not the same. Moreover, computers are typically used indoors, thus obscuring the real world from view. Even with the advent of laptops, if one were to be taken outside, the user would likely be fixated on the screen rather than their surroundings. Computers have significantly diminished the appreciation of nature. Even family and friends are adversely affected when computers are present. Many individuals pay scant attention to conversations while focusing on the screen. They often feign listening only half of the time. Even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is fragmented because their attention is likely diverted to another part of the internet. Frequently, during face - to - face conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is preoccupied with something from earlier in the day. Relationships are suffering, and computers are to blame. Computers are gradually consuming society, with an increasing portion being absorbed each day. Much of what is accomplished on computers, such as the study of distant locations, can readily be found in books. Computers have led to a lack of exercise, reduced time spent in nature, strained relationships, and an overall unhealthy lifestyle. Despite this, they have contributed relatively little to society. Why does the world continue to tolerate the negative impact of computers on humanity?
858	860	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, an increasing number of individuals are utilizing computers, yet this need not be a negative development. Students return home from school fatigued, bored, and disinclined to engage in outdoor physical activity. Instead, they prefer to access the computer. When students use the computer, they can communicate with their friends, listen to music, or acquire knowledge about distant places. Firstly, students can engage in conversations with their friends on the computer. During the winter months, when outdoor exercise is restricted, students can retrieve their laptops and settle on a warm and comfortable bed to chat with their friends. Perhaps a friend can offer assistance with homework. Venturing outside in winter can render students susceptible to illness and cause them to miss school days. Secondly, students have a penchant for listening to music. Music plays a crucial role in a student's life as song lyrics can serve as a means of self - expression. Students may find themselves dancing to their favorite tunes. Dancing constitutes a form of exercise, and adults often emphasize the importance of physical activity. Additionally, students can listen to soft music while completing their homework instead of remaining idle. Thirdly, students can explore and learn about distant locations. When I access the computer, I visit www.google.com to learn about places I aspire to visit. Other students may be interested in learning about destinations they have never visited, such as Italy, France, @LOCATION1, and numerous other places that people may wish to explore. They may desire to acquire knowledge about these places before embarking on a journey. In conclusion, @CAPS1, although an increasing number of people are using computers, this does not necessarily have to be a negative phenomenon. It is true that students should engage in physical exercise, but not exclusively. When students use the computer, they can communicate with friends, listen to music, and learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing for students to use the computer.
859	861	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I am aware that the debate regarding whether computers benefit society is highly contentious, yet to me, the answer is evident. The internet is an extremely valuable invention, widely utilized in all educational institutions, and it only becomes inconvenient when misused. I am not suggesting that it is absolutely necessary for every household to possess a computer, but rather that it has become a luxury that most people enjoy. The combination of computers and the internet is probably one of the most ingenious concepts ever conceived. It provides instant access to virtually any information. Websites such as MySpace and Facebook enable users to connect and reconnect with both old and new friends. Moreover, the ability to create one's own web page is extremely useful when promoting a business or a company. Not only that, but the internet also facilitates online shopping, eliminating the need to visit physical stores. I am certain that this is beneficial for parents, many of whom detest driving to the mall. Secondly, I can guarantee that almost every school in the country has a functional computer with internet access. The computer has been a significant advancement in the field of education. There are numerous websites dedicated solely to educational purposes. These websites cater to individuals of all ages, both children and adults. Nowadays, many teachers assign homework that requires internet access. Additionally, tests such as the Blue Ribbon test are administered online. I can assert that many teachers would be severely handicapped without the use of computers. Lastly, one of the most crucial issues pertains to the drawbacks of the internet. Although MySpace and Facebook are intended for positive purposes, they also have a darker side.
860	862	1	1	Dear @PERSON1 editor, I believe that computers exert both positive and negative influences, with the positive aspects outweighing the negative. For example, upon returning home from work or school, individuals immediately turn to the computer to check their emails, complete work tasks, or play games. I consider it beneficial to connect with friends and gain knowledge about distant cultures and natural phenomena that we may not otherwise encounter. However, excessive computer use can be detrimental. I am cognizant of its potential harm as it can lead to a lack of physical exercise and isolate individuals from their family and friends if they spend an inordinate amount of time on it. I advocate for using the computer for a limited duration each day while also spending quality time outdoors with loved ones. The computer is advantageous due to the extraordinary resources it offers and the wealth of knowledge it provides. I personally enjoy playing video games such as Bubble Spinner on the computer. Simultaneously, I use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family. Bubble Spinner enhances hand - eye coordination, while Facebook facilitates social interaction. When working on projects, I typically conduct all my research on the computer, gathering information from various websites. I also use it for writing to ensure that my work appears neat and professional. The computer also offers access to a vast array of videos, similar to those found on television, through platforms such as YouTube and Google Videos. It allows me to explore nature, communicate with friends and family, and view content that is not available in traditional books. These examples illustrate that the positive impact of computers far exceeds the negative, and we should capitalize on this new technology rather than allowing it to go to waste. The computer serves as a pleasant outlet for relaxation after a long day. Some argue that computer use leads to insufficient exercise, but we engage in physical activity during gym classes and recess at school, and we often become exhausted from work, which provides an adequate amount of exercise for the day. Computers are a valuable device that is used daily by almost everyone. Therefore, it cannot be entirely negative as it allows us to experience aspects of nature and maintain social connections. The effects of computers on people are positive due to the knowledge and communication they facilitate. I hope you can appreciate my perspective.
861	863	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 pose a significant threat to contemporary society and our connections within it. Thus, I firmly believe that these abhorrent entities should be thoroughly eliminated. There are compelling justifications for such a stance. In this era of environmental degradation, we must draw closer to nature while it still endures. Presently, our in - person interaction is alarmingly scarce. Due to computers, @CAPS3 have become increasingly indolent, idly sitting around. Moreover, the @CAPS2 is both detrimental and costly, not to mention the fact that the environment is already in a state of disrepair. Given the current trajectory of nature, we will all ultimately perish, thanks in no small part to computers. Firstly, it is astonishingly harmful that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers. In America, only @PERCENT2 remains as pristine natural forests, but as the population grows, more will vanish forever due to expansion. So, be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 who, instead of staying indoors, appreciates the wonders the earth has to offer. Additionally, these computers, our miniature robots, are gradually taking over the world, and the situation is becoming perilous as they erode humanity's ability to breathe. This occurs because all computers contain a hypnotic disk that keeps us close, suffocating us like a lethal drug; it is a dreadful addiction. Lastly, @PERCENT3 of deaths are attributed to @CAPS2 overloads. Imagine the countless lives that could be saved if people simply took a breath every @NUM3 minutes. On average, spending @NUM4 hours a day on a @CAPS2 is excessive. Set a goal, say, to limit it to @NUM5 hours. This addiction will claim our lives, yet no one knows how to address it. Secondly, millions upon millions in the @LOCATION1 @NUM6 spend hours glued to their computers. One would assume they are alone, but in every @NUM7 people, some are already affected, and the rest are being consumed by chatting on the @CAPS2, allowing their lives to slip away. Now, interaction, as you are aware, can be harmful, but you may have overlooked that @NUM8 people engage in illegal activities on the internet daily, such as downloading music, for which they could face up to @NUM9 years in prison. That's quite an ""interaction"" with the police. Lastly, web interactions like MySpace harbor convicted sexual offenders who could show up at your home at any time and abduct you. Would you want that to happen? You might never see your family again. In every @NUM10 people, @PERCENT4 are kidnapped solely due to MySpace. Stand up and avoid this danger. It is a truly harmful phenomenon. Finally, the perils of a world where the government seems intent on causing trouble are real. These individuals are regarded as deranged and dangerous, with lawyers eager to ensnare you. One in every @NUM11 people struggles to keep up with payments. Next, don't forget about those @PERCENT3 who don't own computers; they are living a life of authenticity, walking on the edge of a myth with @CAPS4. Unfortunately, those @PERCENT1 persistent computer users are likely to die within the next @NUM12 years due to a deadly poison delivered to their brains by the computer. In conclusion, this world can be an extremely hostile place. So, come together, find a friend, and go for a run now and then. If you have no friends, visit your family instead of engaging in virtual meetings. Always bear in mind the dangers of the @CAPS2 world and its insatiable appetite for your money. Now, we must fight back against these robots. People should go for a run, shed some of the obesity caused by prolonged sitting, and lose @NUM9 pounds or more. Remember, the world would thrive if you abandon that zombie - like @CAPS2 room. Get outside, embark on a road trip, and save lives, humanity, your neighbors, and your family."
862	864	1	1	"Dear Readers, it has come to my attention that there is an ongoing debate regarding whether computers are beneficial to society. This matter is indeed debatable, yet I firmly believe that computers do not contribute positively to the broader picture. I contend that they do not enhance our health or social interactions, as they confine us indoors when we could be outside. Every day after school, I find myself heading straight inside and logging onto @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Consequently, my only form of exercise in the next @NUM1 hours is the movement of my fingers. My point is that there is a vast world beyond our computers, and if we only stepped away, we could enjoy it. Statistics indicate that @NUM2 kids now spend more time indoors throughout the year than outdoors. ""@CAPS1 is truly absurd how much things have changed in just @NUM3 years,"" remarks @PERSON1, a pediatrician in @LOCATION1. ""They all need their exercise."" It is outrageous how much time people now spend on computers. @CAPS1 begins to influence their attitudes and dominate their lives. Sometimes, checking notifications on @CAPS3 can take precedence over spending time with family or friends. A mother of @NUM4 teens states, ""They all retreat to their rooms, close their doors, and immerse themselves in @CAPS3 and @CAPS6 until dinner. Afterward, they return to their screens."" In such cases, they become so engrossed in their computers that they forget about everyone else. I believe @CAPS1 has spiraled out of control, especially among people and teenagers who are addicted to computers. One out of @NUM4 mothers reports seeing her child growing distant from the family due to a computer. You may argue that when on your computer, you are communicating with someone, and while pen - pals are wonderful, you should really venture outside and engage in activities. Although you are chatting with your friends, it is not the same as being in their physical presence. During my recent skiing trip to @LOCATION2, I discovered that some of my friend's jokes were far funnier when we were together rather than when I was sitting in front of a computer. We had an amazing time! Now, I regret not spending more in - person time with her. Additionally, @NUM6 arguments nowadays stem from misunderstandings via the computer. People often misinterpret messages or take @CAPS1 the wrong way. The truth is, computers are starting to have a negative impact on our society and even destroy relationships. If we simply disconnect from our computers and go outside, we can reverse this trend."
863	865	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am penning this letter to elucidate why I believe computers are not advantageous. My three supporting arguments are as follows: Firstly, excessive computer use increases the risk of weight gain and obesity. Secondly, individuals tend to prioritize computer time over spending quality moments with their families. Lastly, it can lead to a lack of real - life friendships. Please continue reading to learn more about my perspective. Firstly, if one is constantly glued to the computer, the motivation to step outside diminishes significantly. Moreover, when excitement builds up during computer use, it often leads to increased food consumption. As a result, without regular exercise, weight gain becomes inevitable. Secondly, computer addiction causes people to spend less time with their families. They may assume that they will catch up later, but as they become more engrossed in the virtual world, they grow apart from their loved ones. This isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness as they sacrifice family bonds for the sake of computer games. My final point is that excessive computer use can result in a dearth of friends. Since individuals spend all their time on the computer, they rarely engage in outdoor activities such as going to the park or the gym. Consequently, they miss opportunities to meet new people and develop real - life friendships. The only friends they are likely to have are those they meet online, whom they may never encounter in person and with whom they cannot have meaningful social interactions. In conclusion, I firmly believe that owning a computer is not a prudent decision as it can lead to obesity, reduce family time, and result in a lack of real - life friendships. I hope you find this letter insightful and take my concerns into consideration.
864	866	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, in my view, computers are multifaceted marvels that offer a plethora of activities, such as playing chess, listening to music, and downloading favorite movies. Firstly, computers serve as an excellent means of communication. If you have a long - distance relative residing in @LOCATION1, you can stay in touch with them online through various channels, including email, instant messaging, and @CAPS1. Secondly, computers enable web searching. Whether you need directions to a destination or wish to gather information about far - flung places like @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4, or my beloved @CAPS2 @CAPS3, the internet provides the necessary resources. Thirdly, computers are a remarkable source of entertainment. You can watch episodes of your favorite @CAPS4.V. shows or music videos. Additionally, you can enjoy personalized music listening as a form of entertainment. I wholeheartedly believe that computers are invaluable. I, myself, am an avid user. For instance, I love downloading music from my computer to my iPod and then enjoying the melodies on the go. Last but not least, @CAPS5 computers have a profound impact on a vast majority of people. I am convinced that without computers, our world would be an entirely different place. Therefore, I advocate for their continued presence as they enrich our lives in countless ways.
865	867	1	1	I am of the opinion that computers exert a detrimental influence on individuals, and I shall enumerate several reasons to support this claim. One reason is the lack of exercise. Spending all day on the computer will only exacerbate the situation. Suppose you are @NUM1 years old and purchase a computer as soon as it becomes available. Instead of maintaining a fit lifestyle, you spend every day on it. Without regular physical activity, you will gradually gain weight. Another reason is the improper use of computers. If computers are solely used for research, it is justifiable. However, there is no valid reason to be on the computer all day for non - essential activities like using Facebook or MySpace. A legitimate reason to use a computer would be for school projects or work - related tasks. Moreover, repetitive computer use can lead to certain diseases. Engaging in the same computer - related actions repeatedly is not advisable. Instead, one should participate in sports such as football or baseball. Otherwise, one may require surgery on a hand, which would severely limit one's ability to perform daily tasks. My final reason pertains to the risks associated with computer use. When using the computer, there is a high probability of encountering viruses. If this occurs, your computer may lose all its data, and you will have to purchase a new one. Even after getting a new computer, there is a risk of being hacked, and your personal information may fall into the wrong hands. If you don't know the hacker, you have no idea what they might do with your data. Therefore, it is crucial to be cautious and avoid computers with severe virus threats. In conclusion, there are numerous reasons to limit computer use. Apart from using them for research or work - related purposes, excessive computer use offers little benefit and can cause significant harm.
866	868	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, an increasing number of individuals utilize computers @DATE1; however, this is not necessarily advantageous. Excessive time spent on computers impacts one's activity level. Moreover, children are now staying up late using the computer, consequently leading to lower grades. Finally, spending an inordinate amount of time on the computer reduces the time spent with friends and family. Firstly, excessive computer use affects one's activity level. The more time a person devotes to a computer, the less time they have for physical activities such as exercise. @PERCENT1 of people spend more than @NUM1 @NUM2 hours on the computer per day. According to a recent study, if @NUM3 or so hours were dedicated to exercise or sports, that percentage would decrease to @PERCENT2. Doctors have stated that at least @PERCENT3 of overweight parents spend most of their time on the computer, thus restricting their exercise time. The amount of time spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity levels and influence the number of overweight and obese individuals globally. If we aspire to become a healthier nation, we should start regulating the time spent on computers. Secondly, children now stay up late on computers, which negatively impacts their grades. More time spent on @CAPS1 or anywhere on the @CAPS2 means less time for studying, resulting in lower grades. Kids spend an average of @NUM3 @NUM2 hours on the computer each day, while they spend @NUM6 @NUM2 hours studying. A student in @PERSON2 witnessed their grades improve from a @CAPS3+ to a @CAPS4+ simply by spending less time on the computer and more on studying. That student also felt more energized as they got more rest. This is evident in their tests and quizzes. Computers clearly have a negative effect on grades and schoolwork. Finally, computers limit the time spent with family and friends. A student, @PERSON1, stated that she now spends more time going out with friends since the computer no longer consumes all her time. ""By doing this, I have a better relationship with all my friends than before,"" she said. A child who uses the computer throughout their free time spends @PERCENT4 less time with friends than someone who uses it in moderation. Families also suffer from this issue. If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have a weaker relationship with them as they do not interact or engage in activities together and are likely unaware of what is happening in their life or if something is amiss. As is evident, computers also have a negative impact on relationships with family and friends. The overuse of computers does not benefit society. They affect a person's activity level, students' grades, and most importantly, a person's relationships with family and friends. In order to make our country a better and healthier place, we must regulate the time spent on computers."
867	869	1	1	In my perspective, computers offer substantial benefits to society, and here are my justifications. I can communicate with my friends, complete my homework, or engage in other activities on the computer. Firstly, I can interact with my friends or family on platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, or MSN. The webcam on MSN is extremely helpful as my family resides in @LOCATION1. I chat with them every @DATE1 instead of sending pictures and videos or traveling to @LOCATION1 to visit them. Secondly, I can perform my homework on the computer. I can write lengthy letters and complete a significant amount of work with ease. Lastly, I can undertake numerous tasks on the computer, such as searching for answers to questions or working on projects. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset to society, providing a multitude of benefits in communication, education, and various other aspects.
868	870	1	1	Computers are a valuable possession; however, they can be detrimental if one fails to manage their time effectively. In contemporary times, numerous individuals do not engage in sufficient physical activity, and the prevalence of unhealthy individuals is imposing a significant financial burden on @CAPS1 taxpayers, amounting to millions. Additionally, people are not fully relishing life as they would if they did not spend excessive time on computers. Moreover, a considerable number of individuals have completely isolated themselves from their families and friends. I am confident that upon concluding this reading, you will be thoroughly convinced that the effects of computers on people are adverse. To commence, many individuals allocate an excessive amount of time to using computers instead of engaging in outdoor activities or exercising. This phenomenon is a matter that requires immediate attention as a large number of people are overweight and do not engage in sufficient physical activity to maintain good health. The high prevalence of obesity is imposing a substantial financial burden on taxpayers. For instance, @CAPS2 @PERSON1 has emphasized the significance of healthcare, and a straightforward solution to reduce costs is to encourage people to exercise more frequently to maintain their well - being. As technology continues to shape our lives, we must remember that prioritizing health is more crucial than spending excessive time on a computer. In addition to the health concerns, people are not fully enjoying life. Life is a precious and unique experience, so why spend it sitting in front of a computer all day? There are numerous activities in life that can bring joy and fulfillment, far more than simply playing on a computer. I can attest that a life spent solely on a computer will not be a fulfilling one. Lastly, computers have had a profound impact on people's relationships with family and friends. Although computers provide a convenient means of communication, they should not be the sole mode of interaction. Too many people have adopted a narrow perspective when it comes to relationships. While computers offer an easy way to connect with others, they should not replace face - to - face interactions. As is evident, computers are contributing to the development of unhealthy lifestyles as our priorities regarding health are significantly skewed. They also prevent us from fully experiencing the joys of life and can lead to social isolation when not used in moderation. I am certain that I have persuaded you to reduce the amount of time you spend on computers. Therefore, the next time you use a computer, consider all the opportunities for a fulfilling life that you may be missing out on.
869	871	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, In my view, computers offer us a plethora of benefits in diverse domains. They serve as a source of entertainment, aid in education, and contribute significantly to health and safety. People have an innate love for entertainment, and computers are a veritable treasure trove of fun. At electronic stores, a wide array of computer games is available for purchase. These games are generally of high quality. Unlike some games that are detrimental to the brain, most computer games do not have such negative effects. My friend @PERSON2 purchased a computer game last week. @CAPS4 claims that @CAPS3 is highly engaging and does not cause any harm to cognitive functions. Everyone enjoys watching @CAPS1.V. Thanks to computers, people can now watch @CAPS1.V. on their devices. This not only provides entertainment but also helps save money as there is no need to purchase a @CAPS1.V. set. Instead, people can download @CAPS1.V. shows and movies onto their computers. @PERSON1 received a new computer for his birthday last week. ""@CAPS3 is incredibly enjoyable for watching @CAPS1.V., and it is so effortless,"" @CAPS4 explained. From @PERSON1's experience, I hope you can appreciate the entertainment value that computers offer. Computers play an indispensable role in education. At school, we rely on computers constantly. Without them, our learning experience would be severely compromised. On his new computer, @PERSON1 can complete all his projects and homework. Prior to having a computer, @CAPS4 had to painstakingly write out all his papers, and by the time @CAPS4 finished, there was insufficient time to complete the rest of the homework. Now, @CAPS4 can type @CAPS3 out efficiently and still manage to finish all other tasks. Research conducted by @ORGANIZATION1 has revealed that @PERCENT1 of children with access to computers have demonstrated improved intelligence compared to before they had computers. ""@I was consistently receiving @CAPS5's when I did not have a computer. Now, I am on the honor roll of my report card thanks to my computer,"" @PERSON1 stated. I sincerely hope that more people will follow @PERSON1's example and invest in computers. Computers have also opened up a new frontier in health and safety. You can learn about genetics. It would have taken approximately @NUM1 years longer to decipher the genetic code without the aid of computers. All the knowledge that scientists have gained from the human genome project has the potential to cure cancer and other diseases. Computers also ensure the safety of children. New technology enables the tracking of children. In the unfortunate event that a child goes missing, a computer can assist in locating them. A new mother lost her child last @DATE1 while having lunch at a park. Thanks to the tracking technology on her computer, she was able to find her child. In conclusion, computers are invaluable assets that enhance our lives in terms of entertainment, education, and health and safety. They have the potential to make the world a smarter and safer place."
870	872	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, The purpose of this letter is to elucidate how computers have transformed our lives for the better. They have enhanced our society, revolutionized our way of life, and simplified various tasks. I firmly believe that computers are among the most remarkable inventions of all time, having exerted a highly significant and positive influence on society. For instance, the advent of computers has led to a substantial expansion of education. Both educators and students have reaped the benefits. Students can now explore the Internet to learn about different geographical locations, historical events, and improve their reading and writing skills, among other things. Furthermore, computers have emerged as a prominent aspect of entertainment. From perusing online news to watching movies and listening to music, computers offer a diverse range of entertainment options for all. Additionally, they facilitate our connection with friends and enable us to meet new people. Apart from entertainment and social interaction, computers have streamlined our lives. People can obtain degrees through online learning and acquire new knowledge. Research has also become more accessible with the aid of computers. One can access a vast amount of information on virtually any subject. Some individuals contend that computers impede face - to - face interactions with family members. However, platforms such as Facebook allow us to maintain connections. Computers have also had a profound impact on various aspects of our lives. They have contributed to the growth of small businesses by simplifying the process of placing and receiving orders. Moreover, they have facilitated the global dissemination of information. As demonstrated, computers have conferred numerous benefits on society and have had a positive impact on human beings. From educating individuals to enabling us to stay in touch with relatives, computers have left an indelible mark on improving our quality of life. I sincerely hope that this letter will convince you that computers are an indispensable part of the twenty - first century.
871	873	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I opine that possessing a computer is highly advantageous. I am cognizant that teenagers spend a substantial amount of time on the computer. However, if it genuinely irks the parents, then why do they have computers in their residences? @CAPS3, I can proffer @NUM1 reason. They are excellent repositories of information. It is an efficacious means to communicate with your friends, and it furnishes you with details about places that you might be oblivious to. Primarily, I wish to assert that computers are a remarkable source of information. They can disclose anything! This is also beneficial because if you are engaged in a project, and your mother cannot permit you to retrieve books from the library, then there you have it! A computer is simply a more facile way to search for information. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of parents who procured a computer for their family do not regret their decision? That's nearly all the parents in @LOCATION2! @CAPS6, as you can discern, it would assist kids with whatever they are studying. Secondly, we teenagers nowadays utilize computers to converse with our friends via @ORGANIZATION1 email @CAPS3. I deem this to be far superior to sending @CAPS4! Why would you await a letter from your cousin in @LOCATION1 when you can communicate with them instantaneously! And it saves paper if you merely @CAPS5 to purchase. I would like to state that on one such occasion, I was working on a project. We were seeking a hotel to stay in when we traveled. We ultimately discovered a superb hotel at a reasonable price. You can also consult a map if you @CAPS5 to someone. @CAPS6, for all those individuals out there who do not recognize the significance of computers, have you ever contemplated... In conclusion, I believe that having a computer is an extremely crucial matter for @NUM1 reason. They are outstanding sources of knowledge. They aid us in communicating with friends and offer comprehensive information. For @CAPS6, I am leaving this opinion with you. Hopefully, you will glean something of greater value and make the appropriate choice.
872	874	1	1	Nearly every family has access to a computer. They have become an integral part of life and a means to engage with the world beyond one's home, even when confined indoors. Computers serve as a wellspring of extensive knowledge, drawing from millions of sources. They have already spurred exponential progress. Overall, computers exert a positive influence. On a rainy day, @NUM1 students will devote time to their computers. Among those students, @PERCENT1 will be on platforms such as A.I.M. (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3), @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or @ORGANIZATION2. Even if they are unable to use their phones or venture outside, they can interact with friends, both old and new. Teens and adults utilize the @CAPS6 to communicate with friends they haven't seen for up to @NUM2 years. People will engage in more conversations, fostering stronger relationships and enhanced conversational skills. Over @NUM3 of the sites frequented by teens are centered around @CAPS8 networking. The ability to effortlessly converse with someone miles away is a testament to remarkable advancement. @ORGANIZATION1 is a multi - million - dollar enterprise. @PERSON1, an employee of @ORGANIZATION1, asserts that sites like @ORGANIZATION1 have witnessed a meteoric rise in popularity over the @DATE1. Increasingly, people are eschewing their @PERSON2 dictionaries in favor of typing words into @LOCATION1, where they are accompanied by pronunciations and are more readily accessible. Students employ computers to gather information for school reports in @CAPS7, @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, or @CAPS11. Information can be obtained on any subject. A survey was conducted to determine which is used more frequently: books on a specific subject or computers for information on various subjects. Computers are used far more often. They are swifter than books, and it is easier to search for a particular resource on the @CAPS6. Moreover, a site of particular interest or exceptional utility can be added to your favorites. Computers are more practical than books. Pictures of scientific laboratories where space shuttles are launched to the moon feature @NUM4 main component: computers. Advertisements from @ORGANIZATION3 indicate that computers are becoming increasingly compact. There is a laptop that can fit in an envelope and a handheld touch - screen computer that can almost fit in your pocket. You can type papers and assignments to make them more legible. Computers can even grade tests. Advancement is centered around computers. Prior to the advent of computers, many of the things we do today would have seemed implausible. However, computers open up a realm of possibilities. Typing is, in some instances, faster than handwriting, and papers can be saved electronically. If our country continues to progress at this rate, it is feasible to have computers that perform mundane chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. There could be computers that engage in real - like conversations. People can acquire more and more knowledge and personally develop in intelligence. When I behold a computer, I envision progress. Although there are aspects of computers that are less than ideal, overall, computers are beneficial to society. With a computer, you have access to friends, old and new, and information from millions of sources. Most importantly, computers symbolize progress and advancement. I perceive no direct harm from computers.
873	875	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The utilization of computers confers benefits upon society due to their positive impact on individuals. This includes enhancing hand - eye coordination, enabling the exploration of distant places and people, and facilitating online communication with family and friends. Did you know that teenagers who frequently use computers, when compared to those who do not, exhibit higher test scores? This is because they can rapidly look up definitions, conduct research, and acquire any necessary information at their fingertips. Furthermore, families and friends residing across the country can maintain contact through email, video chats, and Facebook. It is astonishing to realize that the use of computers can improve hand - eye coordination. You may be wondering how this is possible and think I am mad, but there are valid reasons. As I participate in basketball, volleyball, and softball, hand - eye coordination is of utmost importance. On a cold, wintry @DATE1 @TIME1, I was working on a lengthy history paper and a @CAPS1 essay, which entailed numerous hours of typing on the computer. At five o'clock, I headed to my basketball practice, where I played the best game of my life. Then, a week later, we had another game, but this time I went straight from church. Consequently, I did not perform as well; I missed many passes and shots. This convinced me that through the use of computers, my hand - eye coordination had improved. Can you fathom being able to learn about people in far - flung places, their cultures, ethnicities, and religions? Well, now this is not only possible but also more accessible through technological advancements. In history class, we were researching the world hunger crisis in our allied countries. Through this knowledge, I was able to initiate a fundraiser at my church. @PERSON1; @CAPS2 teenagers like myself refrain from eating for @NUM1 hours. Research has demonstrated that @NUM2 children in African countries die daily from malnutrition. Now that this has come to my attention, I am going to work four hours a day to provide these innocent children with at least a portion of what I consume. Thus, through the use of computers, I was able to learn about the suffering of those children, and now it is my responsibility. Do you have family members across the country whom you rarely get to see? My aunt and uncle live in @LOCATION3, and they were recently blessed with a beautiful baby boy, @LOCATION4. Since we only have the pleasure of their company about once a year, we start to miss them. But now, through Skype, email, and Facebook, we can stay updated on @LOCATION4's growth and achievements, as well as the places @CAPS2 they have recently visited. Also, @PERCENT1 of the teenage population in the @CAPS3.S spends at least four hours a day @CAPS4, tweeting, or using Facebook to stay in touch with their friends. Recently, I moved from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, and staying in contact with my friends there is extremely important to me. Those are the people I grew up with and have known since childhood. The use of computers has enabled me to maintain connections with distant friends and relatives. In conclusion, due to the improvement of hand - eye coordination, the ability to learn about far - off places and people, and the capacity to communicate online with others, the use of computers is beneficial to society. Through the internet, people can discover @LOCATION2 places for travel, cycling, and exercise while enjoying nature. Moreover, when family and friends wish to spend time together, they need to plan the logistics, and without email and online platforms, this becomes nearly impossible. I appreciate you taking the time to read this, and hopefully, you will consider my opinion when deliberating on the topic of computers.
874	876	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I believe you are mistaken! I vehemently disagree with this letter. People require computers for research purposes. Additionally, they assist us in staying in touch with others. Another aspect is that @CAPS1 can obtain anything they need. Firstly, @CAPS1 need computers. @CAPS1 rely on computers to aid in research. Instead of perusing a book, one can access the internet. It is quicker and more convenient. Moreover, you can search for information on any location or project, and it will be of assistance. That is the remarkable aspect; the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 contains any information. Secondly, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 web is also employed for maintaining communication. For instance, instant messaging. You can also engage in chats on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. You can even join a chat room. However, always be mindful of whom you are conversing with, as it could be a stranger. In any case, you can utilize the internet as an effortless way to communicate with people or to ""keep in touch"". Lastly, @CAPS7, you are aware that the internet is used for research and communication, but it is also for obtaining anything you desire. You can access the internet to acquire pictures, games, videos, music, or even directions to a place. Additionally, the internet is a source of entertainment. I primarily use it for YouTube, @CAPS5, and for searching for pictures. You can essentially find anything online, and it will most likely be available to you. In conclusion, the web serves for research, chatting, and essentially any purpose you have in mind. That is why @CAPS1 should have internet access because you can still go online while also enjoying outdoor activities. However, perhaps people should curtail their @CAPS8.V usage a bit. Now, do you understand why I have taken this stance? Maybe in the future, there will be a way to use the computer while remaining active."
875	877	1	1	"Dear editor, I am of the opinion that computers are an indispensable part of modern life and prove their worth on a daily basis. Often, we do not even consciously consider using computers; they simply become an inherent part of our daily routine. We employ computers daily in numerous ways, such as staying in touch with distant friends, exploring and experiencing far - off places, or even enhancing hand - eye coordination. Computers are so advantageous to our lives that we might find it difficult to exist without them. Most people have experienced a friend or relative moving away. When this occurs, all is not lost because with the use of computers, you can maintain contact. Many modern computers are equipped with built - in webcams, which allow you to receive more than just an email. With these systems, you can actually see an image of your friend or relative. Even Oprah Winfrey utilizes the webcam feature on computers to have people ""Skype"" onto her show. In addition to this, there are numerous other ways to stay connected, even if your computer is older. These relatively new ""social networking platforms"" include Facebook, Twitter, and many more. Every morning when I wake up and watch SportsCenter, I always learn about what famous people are posting on their Twitter pages. This is yet another excellent application of computers. In this economic climate, not many people can afford to spend thousands of dollars to visit a beach paradise. However, with the use of computers, you can visit such places virtually. Computers are remarkable in this regard as they enable you to learn about and experience many expensive things at no cost. For example, if you wanted to learn something about India, you wouldn't have to visit the local library and borrow a book; you could simply type in the relevant information. There are numerous such examples that provide you with access to any information you might require. This also proves valuable if you are studying a far - off place while writing a paper. The computer is an excellent means to gather information without ever having to leave your home. Hand - eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It enables you to throw a baseball, play video games, or even drive a car. Many computer skeptics believe that you do not benefit from using computers, but a recent study conducted by @LOCATION1 news and reports reveals that people who use computers have @PERCENT1 better hand - eye coordination than non - computer users. When driving, you often need to operate the car, adjust the radio volume, and distribute snacks to your kids simultaneously, so improved hand - eye coordination can be quite useful. Hand - eye coordination is a crucial skill, and its development is furthered by the use of computers. In conclusion, computers are beneficial in terms of hand - eye coordination, communication, and information acquisition. Computers are one of the most significant inventions and are valuable in countless ways."
876	878	1	1	I opine that the utilization of computers is remarkable. You ought to heed my counsel; individuals should employ computers. Computers represent an excellent means of communication. People can establish connections with others from across the globe. My father relocated to Brazil, so we have been communicating via @CAPS1 - mail, @CAPS2, and even Facebook. It is the easiest and most cost - effective way to communicate. If I were to call someone from a different country, it would cost me significantly more, but if I send them an @CAPS1 - mail, it is more economical. Studies from the University of @LOCATION1 indicate that @PERCENT1 of people consider it easier to use a computer for communication. Moreover, one can do so instantaneously, enabling information to reach anywhere within milliseconds. Computers are indeed the optimal way to communicate. Additionally, computers are employed for learning purposes. Numerous individuals from around the world have learned different languages from websites or programs that offer excellent instruction and lessons. I learned to play the guitar through numerous programs and online lessons. Many people rely on computers to acquire information and learn about various things. My mother is a secretary at an insurance brokerage company. Without computers, customers would be unable to learn about the different policies available and might end up spending more money than necessary on insurance. Without computers, scientists would be unable to conduct extensive research or learn about plants or rocks. Computers facilitate their study and exploration of @LOCATION2 and everything else. Doctors would be unable to perform half of what they can without a computer. They learn about different illnesses and broken bones by using computers. @PERSON2 stated that she would be unable to assist as many people without the use and assistance of a computer, claiming that she learned @PERCENT2 of what she knows from websites containing information about the human body. Even teachers assert that they have enhanced their teaching skills from websites. Builder and modern designer @PERSON1 says he learned about different building designs that are sturdier and have stronger shapes, which he applied in his current building projects. I hope you can now perceive how remarkable computers are and how much they aid our contemporary citizens.
877	879	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you believe that the computer is the most outstanding technology developed thus far? Undoubtedly, it is the computer! They are the preeminent technology as one can accomplish anything on a computer. My friends contend that computers are among @ORGANIZATION1 the finest technologies because the internet can be of great assistance @ORGANIZATION1 in various matters, such as when working on a research paper. Research has substantiated that computers have a positive impact on people. My mother asserts that computers are among @ORGANIZATION1 the most robust tools in the world. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 of my friends state that computers are among @ORGANIZATION1 the best because one can obtain help from the internet for homework assignments. They also mention that it allows people to engage in online conversations with others. They claim that they can interact with family members residing in distant locations. They further note that the prevalence of computer use has drawn more teenagers away from the streets and into their homes. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 has conducted comprehensive research and has proven that using a computer enhances hand - eye coordination. Another aspect he has verified is that since the invention of computers, the violence rate has declined because more people spend time at home on their computers rather than being out on the streets. He has also demonstrated that since schools started incorporating computers, academic success rates have significantly increased. He attributes this rise to the fact that instead @ORGANIZATION1 of students reading long and tedious articles about someone or something, they can simply search for information on the internet. He also points out that using the internet saves time. My mother says that when she was younger, the computer enabled her to learn about far - off places. She also mentions that the internet allows one to learn about people's customs rather than relying solely on books, as some books may not be up - to - date, and one may wish to learn about the latest customs. My mother believes that using computers has a positive influence on the world. @CAPS1, you are doing an excellent job in your writing at work. My friends affirm that computers are helpful, research has shown that computers have reduced the violence rate, and my mother also believes that computers have a positive impact on us. I am certain you will concur with me when I say that having computers has had a profound effect on people, making their lives easier.
878	880	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1, @PERCENT2 of the populace would concur that computers are useful, and possessing them enhances the ability to learn about distant places. Additionally, they enable individuals to communicate with others online. Lastly, computers are crucial @CAPS2 for those who work with them. There are numerous reasons why I believe computers are beneficial to our society. Are you aware that computers endow people with the ability to learn about far - flung locations? Sometimes, people are uncertain when they plan to travel abroad. With a computer, one can organize everything. Some individuals, like my family, enjoy visiting relatives in other places. @CAPS2, for instance, once my mother informed me that we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 to visit our family, and she said she had already booked the tickets on the computer. I was overjoyed when we went, and I witnessed the beauty of @LOCATION1. Some people have a penchant for exploring new and scenic places, such as @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, and even @LOCATION4. Allow me to elaborate on how computers facilitate online communication between people. Most individuals have MySpace, which enables kids my age to stay in touch. Moreover, Facebook allows one to reconnect with people one may not have seen in a long time. @CAPS2, for example, once I was browsing Facebook and discovered my former best friend @PERSON1. I was ecstatic because when she moved, I thought I would never communicate with her again. I am @PERCENT1 confident that everyone in the world has a Yahoo account, which makes it easy to find and talk to people quickly. Would you believe that there are numerous jobs and responsibilities that necessitate the use of a computer? Scientists, for example, must have computers; otherwise, they would be unable to invent all the remarkable things they create. Secretaries also have to manage dates @CAPS2 for their bosses. @CAPS2, for example, a secretary @CAPS2 for a doctor must be able to schedule and modify appointments. Lastly, students, especially those in college, would be unable to complete their homework without computers. Most people would agree that computers have a positive impact on people. @CAPS2, due to their ability to help people learn about far - off places and communicate with others online, computers are extremely important to those who use them.
879	881	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, the ability to access information about anything with ease is a remarkable feature of computers. Computers are advantageous to people as they enable online communication with others. Additionally, individuals can learn about distant locations. Lastly, computers allow for the rapid and effortless acquisition of a vast amount of information. Computers significantly benefit society. Furthermore, computers facilitate seamless online communication among people. All @ORGANIZATION1 students use computers daily for video - chatting with friends or instant - messaging their parents. @ORGANIZATION2 has found that computers help keep families closer as they can visually connect when someone is away. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 use their computers to communicate with others online. While one might argue that computers have drawbacks, @CAPS5 they benefit a large number of people on a daily basis. @CAPS1, upon entering a room where people of all ages are learning about computers, one realizes that they are beneficial to @CAPS6 individuals as they can learn about different places. A computer is described as ""a compact source of information."" @CAPS3 out of @CAPS4 people use computers to learn about far - off places. Residents of @LOCATION1 have found that using a computer to learn about distant locations is more efficient than using multiple resources. Some may question the use of books, but @CAPS5 computers offer a more convenient alternative. Lastly, computers are excellent as they improve @CAPS6's hand - eye coordination. @PERCENT2 of people noticed an improvement in their coordination after using a computer for an hour. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, remarks, ""The computer can help develop stronger reflexes."" @CAPS6 may understand why some think computers slow down reflexes, but @CAPS5 they actually enhance them. Computers bring great benefits to society. They assist people in communicating online, enable learning about far - off places, and strengthen hand - eye coordination."
880	882	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, do @CAPS2 people use computers more? In fact, they should not. Although computers offer numerous benefits to society, they also have several adverse effects on users. People are allocating more time to computer use and less to physical exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Firstly, people are spending less time on physical activity. Most athletes need to maintain fitness and health to perform well in their sports. I am a wrestler and a baseball player, and if I do not dedicate some time each day to working out or staying active, I will become out of shape and weaker by the time of my next match or game. I am certain that Olympic athletes exercise and stay active daily to be stronger and faster than their competitors. Hence, I am puzzled as to why people sit at home on the computer all day. Secondly, people are not taking the time to appreciate nature. Nature is one of the most magnificent phenomena on this planet. Whether one is hiking a mountain or beside a lake, nature surrounds us. Personally, I adore hunting and fishing. I make time every summer, @DATE1, fall, and sometimes winter to go outdoors, enjoy nature, and have a good time, as do many others around the world. Those who sit at home on the computer cannot relish this precious gift. Thirdly, people are neglecting to spend time with family or friends. If one is occupied with the computer all day, one cannot go out and be active with friends or go for a bike ride with a sibling. When on the computer, one is sacrificing quality time with family and friends that could be spent on a fishing trip or a walk in the woods. If one fails to spend time with family due to computer use, one is missing out on the most valuable aspect of life. One should always make time for family. Finally, do @CAPS2 people use computers more? No, they should not. Computers deprive people of time for exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. While computers have their merits, the less time one spends on them, the better it is for everyone.
881	883	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, in @DATE1, an increasing amount of the latest technology is being introduced to the public. Computers, @CAPS1 - bars, telephones, and more are being equipped with the most high - tech software and machinery to enable some of the most miraculous things to occur. There exists a cell - phone that allows one to turn off the lights in one's house from thousands of miles away. This technology can be the most remarkable thing that has ever happened to the world. Some may argue otherwise. However, I am here to refute the @CAPS2 - sayers. With the new computers, individuals are capable of communicating with people across the globe. Moreover, dreams can be realized for those who never had the opportunity to pursue them. Additionally, questions that have been posed can now be answered. I have a number of cousins in @LOCATION3 whom I only converse with when I visit them, which is extremely rare. Thanks to some of the programs like @CAPS4, or @CAPS5 @CAPS6, I am able to engage in conversation with my cousins. Some people claim that @ORGANIZATION2 can make kids like me miss out on some quality time with their family. Well, my brother is going to @CAPS10 in six months and I will want to talk with him. With phone companies burdening their customers with exorbitant prices, my family will not want to spend @NUM1 hours on the phone with him and dip into their savings. On my @ORGANIZATION2, there is an application called i - chat which enables me to talk with my brother and see him as if he were at home with me. My dad learned about @CAPS4 and decided to give it a try. As of now, he has reconnected with numerous of his high - school friends and reentered the social scene. Maybe you can find a special friend you almost forgot about. Or you can find out what is happening with your sister who resides in @LOCATION1. The @ORGANIZATION2 also allows those less fortunate who can never afford a plane ride to explore a place they've always desired to visit. The internet offers virtual tours of places like the @LOCATION2 or even @LOCATION4 - such exotic places can be explored without leaving one's house. Also, @CAPS15, a website that offers millions of videos, includes tutorials for dances, sports, tricks, and more so that you don't have to spend a fortune on paid lessons. Another advantage of the @ORGANIZATION2 is that it offers mostly reliable information. Apologies for not completing the @NUM2 paragraph and conclusion.
882	884	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I have learned that you are conducting a survey to determine whether people believe in the utility of computers. I am a firm believer because computers allow individuals to communicate with their family and friends on platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, and AIM. They can also engage in physical exercise via the internet; by visiting YouTube, one can discover various exercise positions. Currently, over @NUM1 people utilize computers, and it appears that @PERCENT1 adults and @PERCENT2 children use them, indicating that more children today are participating in athletic sports. Adults employ computers for work - related tasks and in educational institutions. At newspaper offices, computers are essential for typing daily papers; without them, how would employees complete their work? When people return home and have not obtained the daily paper, they can access it online. For students, computers are of utmost importance as they facilitate communication with friends and provide a means to conduct research. In some schools, students are required to carry large textbooks for different classes, which can be detrimental to their backs. Hence, schools have introduced online textbooks. For sports enthusiasts, one can search for their favorite team and check if they won that week's game. There are also virtual sports games available on the computer. When one moves to a new location outside of town, they can use Google to identify a suitable town to live in and a good school system for their child. There are numerous activities that can be performed online and on computers. Thank you for allowing me to contribute to your decision - making process.
883	885	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I recently heard the claim that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers rather than with their families and friends. This assertion is unfounded; allow me to present the reasons. Through a computer, one can find individuals they are seeking. Moreover, it can always assist with tasks that require help and enable one to engage in various activities. If you continue reading, you will discover the typical reasons why I believe people are not spending an inordinate amount of time on computers compared to with their families. (1) The primary reason I believe people are not spending excessive time on computers is that a computer can aid in locating a family member or friend. My second reason is that perhaps one has never met a particular family member and wishes to get acquainted with them. My final reason is that this person is someone one truly loves and needs in their personal life. These are the reasons why I think they are not spending too much time on computers. (2) Another reason I believe people are not spending too much time on computers is that it can assist with numerous tasks that require help. My second reason is that one can complete their homework on the computer, and it can offer support. My last reason is that if one encounters something extremely difficult and does not know how to proceed, the computer provides assistance. (3) I believe people are not spending too much time on computers because one can engage in various activities on it. My second reason is that when hosting a @CAPS5 party and in need of invitations, the computer can be of help. My final reason is that if one intends to move to a different state or country, they can view the place on the website before visiting. These are the reasons why I believe the computer is highly useful. (4) I hope that after reading these typical reasons regarding the computer, such as its ability to assist with many things, help find people, and enable different activities, I have convinced you. Additionally, I hope you have enjoyed reading my letter.
884	886	1	1	Debates have arisen regarding whether computers are beneficial or detrimental to society. In fact, computers only serve to promote the growth of society. Computers enable people to interact with others, explore and discover new people and places, and develop hand - eye coordination. The positive impact of computers on people far outweighs the negative. Firstly, computers allow individuals to meet and communicate with others. There are numerous popular websites that facilitate chatting and communication at any time. Prior to the invention of computers, in order to converse with someone, one had to meet them in person or send a letter and wait an extended period for a response. Now, people can simply compose an email and click send. Just like that, their message is transmitted to another computer for others to read and appreciate. Another advancement in computer technology is picture sharing. All one needs to do to showcase their pictures to others is connect a camera, upload the pictures to their computer, and post them on a site like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 bucket. Any rational person would acknowledge that computers are extremely useful. Secondly, computers are significant as they provide people with the opportunity to learn about and discover new people and places. In the past, if one was unaware of something or someone, such as a movie, it was nearly impossible to obtain any information about them. Computers offer internet websites and search engines like @ORGANIZATION1, which allow one to type in any query and instantly access all the relevant information, pictures, and details about that subject. These technological advancements have equipped many people with the general knowledge they may require in any given situation. If one missed the best part of a movie, they could easily use a computer to look it up, highlighting the importance of computers in daily society. Lastly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination, which is essential for daily life. Typing on a computer during leisure time is a skill that is highly sought after. In fact, many employers may hire someone based on their keyboarding skills. Once one is proficient enough, they can even teach themselves to type without looking at the keyboard. Although computers are not intended to replace friends, family, and real - life experiences, they are invaluable tools that impart skills one will utilize throughout their life. Any well - educated individual would recognize the advantages of computer usage. In conclusion, computers are essential for functioning effectively in many situations. They enable one to chat with and send pictures to loved ones, educate one about distant people and places that they might otherwise be unaware of, and help improve hand - eye coordination. Computers are truly useful pieces of equipment.
885	887	1	1	Computers have a profound impact on a large number of people. I wholeheartedly support the advancements in technology. I do so because computers enable individuals to communicate with family and friends who are geographically distant. Moreover, computers foster the development of hand - eye coordination. Additionally, they allow people to acquire knowledge about countries around the world. In summary, electronics, especially computers, should continue to be advanced. Suppose your best friend has moved to @LOCATION4. You may not see them in person, but you can communicate with them via the computer. Nowadays, there are numerous websites that facilitate chatting, and one can even engage in webcam chats, such as through Ovoo. For instance, in seventh grade, I relocated from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. I was deeply distressed about leaving my old friends. However, it turned out that I adapted well. I made new friends after the move and used Facebook chat to make plans with my friends. Evidently, computers greatly assist in maintaining contact with friends worldwide. Computers enhance various skills. Hand - eye coordination is the most prominent skill that computers cultivate. When observing an adult type, most can do so without looking at the keyboard. This is a prime example of hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is also highly beneficial in sports. In basketball, one should dribble the ball while looking ahead, similar to typing. As can be seen, computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. Google provides answers to any query. When conducting research, most people rely on Google, which is accessible via the computer. One can learn about @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4; simply type the name into Google, and comprehensive information about that country can be obtained. For example, last year, students were required to select a state and learn specific details about it. Most students utilized computers for this task. Computers are truly the most remarkable electronic devices in the world. There are numerous electronics that influence people, but computers have the most significant impact. They allow people to communicate with family and friends globally, teach hand - eye coordination skills, and provide knowledge about many countries. In conclusion, computers should undergo further advancement.
886	888	1	1	Dear residents of @LOCATION1, it has come to my attention that there has been some contention regarding whether computers are beneficial and helpful to society. I firmly believe that computers are an extremely valuable resource that simplifies daily life. Computers can assist us in numerous ways, including facilitating learning, enabling students to perform better in @CAPS4, and serving as an excellent teaching tool. One reason I advocate for computers is that they make learning more accessible. You might wonder how a screen and a keyboard can enhance learning; it may seem implausible, yet it is true! Suppose you are a middle @CAPS4 student assigned to write a paper on a specific topic. Instead of spending countless hours searching for relevant information in a library, you can simply conduct a Google search, and voila! You have precisely the information you need within seconds. Quite remarkable, isn't it? Still skeptical about the usefulness of computers? What if I told you that computers enable students to excel in @CAPS4? That's right. Computers empower students to achieve better results in @CAPS4. Websites such as Edline allow teachers to promptly post their students' grades. How is this advantageous? When you take a quiz, your teacher has to grade over @NUM1 quizzes. Considering factors like absentees, weekends, and vacations, the time it takes for you to receive your quiz results is often delayed. Sometimes, students don't get their quizzes back for two weeks after taking them! By the time you receive your results, it's time for a chapter test that accounts for @PERCENT1 of your grade, and you've just discovered that you didn't perform well in one of the sections. This diminishes your ability to do well on the test. However, if your grade were posted online days earlier, you would have more time to study, know what to focus on, and perform better on the test. As you can see, computers are highly beneficial for students, but are they also advantageous for teachers? The answer is yes. Computers are an excellent teaching tool. Has this ever happened to you? No matter how thoroughly your teacher explains a concept, it just seems as if they are speaking a foreign language. What if they showed you an engaging YouTube video explaining the concept? Would you learn more effectively with a visual aid? I certainly would. Computers are also advantageous for teachers because they allow them to email other teachers if there is an issue and obtain the latest information about the @CAPS4 curriculum and current events. Do you now understand why computers are useful? I hope you recognize the immense utility of computers as they simplify learning, enable students to perform better in @CAPS4, and serve as a great learning tool. These are just a few of the many reasons why computers are valuable, and I hope you continue to utilize them in our community.
887	889	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, computers offer substantial benefits to our society. Whether it is due to their ability to assist individuals in completing their work, enabling people to communicate without relying on telephone numbers, or aiding students in their studies, computers are truly enhancing our society. Have you ever been assigned a paper one day and expected to submit it the next? If you reflect on what helped you complete the paper, it was most likely a computer. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of college students stated that they would not be achieving the high grades they currently have if they did not have access to a computer. However, computers do not solely benefit students; they can also support adults in the workforce. I have made friends over the years who have relocated, and I have lost contact with them. With a computer, it is easier to locate these individuals and resume communication. Through various programs, it is highly likely that you can find anyone, whether it's @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. Nine out of ten adults reported that they were able to reconnect with many of their high school friends thanks to computers. Furthermore, computers provide a means for students to study. Students can utilize search engines to research papers or engage in educational games. If a student forgets their homework, they can likely use a computer to find out what the assignment is. When I conducted a survey at the middle school, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students said that they would check the computer before asking a friend. As you can see, computers offer numerous benefits to our society today. Three notable advantages are that they enable people to complete work more efficiently, help maintain connections with friends, and support students in their studies.
888	890	1	1	I opine that computers exert positive influences on individuals. People can access crucial news online, and they can establish connections with those they rarely encounter. Additionally, they can procure any item in the world through online platforms. These are three compelling reasons why I believe computers have a positive impact on people. Computers keep people informed about significant news. In the event of a blizzard, people can be forewarned and stock up on provisions. If there is a burglar on the loose, people can be alerted and secure all doors and windows. By being aware of such information, it aids people in planning events, such as birthday parties. Staying informed about important news is highly advantageous and convenient. Moreover, @PERCENT1 of people are less likely to encounter inconveniences if they are well - informed about the news. Another way in which computers positively affect people is by enabling them to connect with those they seldom see. This provides an effortless means to share experiences and engage in face - to - face conversations. With video chat, one can showcase a new acquisition or a newborn baby. One can share their desires with individuals they scarcely meet. Experts assert that friendships endure longer when people communicate frequently, and computers make this possible. A third way computers are helpful is by allowing people to order any product in the world online. If you need a Japanese souvenir for someone in Ohio, you can place an online order. If you are elderly and unable to visit the grocery store, you can order groceries online. I have observed that individuals who can order everything online do not have to undertake extensive driving, which saves time, money, and fuel. This is also extremely convenient and less stressful than waiting in lines to purchase an item. These are just three ways in which computers have had a positive impact on people: the ability to access important news, connect with infrequently seen individuals, and order any item in the world. That is why I believe computers have a positive effect on people.
889	891	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, computers wield a colossal positive influence on people. I endorse technological advancements. It is @DATE1; we should no longer be scouring books for information or writing everything by hand. Life has become more convenient for everyone. Everyone can utilize the computer for communication with friends or family. We are capable of acquiring knowledge more rapidly through the use of computers. Working professionals rely on computers to assist them with their important tasks! Everything is accomplished on computers! Computers serve as an excellent medium for communication. Having a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 account enables you to converse with individuals across the globe. It is far more convenient to engage in long - term online conversations as you do not have to incur phone charges! Even @CAPS4 chats are accessible to computer users. Having an @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS5 account allows you to conduct a video chat with someone, making you feel as if they are physically present in the same room. If you have a close friend who has moved to another part of the country, these communication methods would be extremely beneficial to you! You cannot have these accounts without a computer; hence, we require computers! Computers have rendered our generation highly intelligent. We can effortlessly search for facts about anything on the computer. Now, if we are curious about something, we can simply conduct a Google search. In the past, we would often abandon our curiosity rather than search through a book. Kids can obtain homework assistance online if they are too timid to ask someone else. At present, we can even enroll in online college courses! The ability to pursue a college education from home can be extremely advantageous for some individuals. Computers contribute to our education. Adults who work daily rely heavily on computers! Professionals in the medical field use computers to monitor all their patients. Now, @CAPS6 use computers to organize lesson plans and print out reminders for their students. Scientists employ computers to conduct research for their experiments. Engineers utilize computer programs to design the structures they intend to build. Computers even allow you to promote your small business or company to the entire world. Computers have a profoundly positive impact on jobs in our society, which is beneficial for our economy! Computers benefit us physically, mentally, and socially. Certain computer games can enhance our hand - eye coordination. We can learn a multitude of things from computers! They truly make us more intelligent! Computers provide a means for us to communicate with friends and family who are far away. Websites like @CAPS7 - @CAPS8 even offer adults the opportunity to find their soulmate online! The positive effects of computers on people are limitless, but we must learn not to take them for granted.
890	892	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I frequently contemplate the impact of technology on humanity. The human race has made numerous discoveries, but our most significant advancement is technology. New machines and robots are continuously being developed, and our understanding of machines and artificial intelligence is expanding rapidly. The most widely utilized machine is the computer. People employ it for various purposes, including communication, information - gathering, learning, and entertainment. Some experts are concerned that people spend an excessive amount of time on computers, and I wholeheartedly concur. Although computers may be useful, they are overused. People spend more time fixated on the screen than engaging in physical exercise or interacting with friends and family. Computers are also not always reliable or secure. Firstly, adolescents are the most frequent computer users. Young adults spend hours on websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 communicating with their friends. At their young age, physical activity is of utmost importance. Obesity among children due to lack of exercise is becoming increasingly prevalent, and it is because young people are overly attached to their computer screens. The average child requires @NUM1 minutes of exercise per day, yet many get very little or none at all. I believe that computer use is acceptable, but only in moderation. The developing mind and body need movement and exercise. If internet use among children and teenagers is not curbed, some fear that there will be a significant increase in health problems in the future. Although it is extremely convenient to communicate quickly via the internet, it can sometimes cause more harm than good. Kids who spend hours @CAPS4 or emailing their peers spend less time with their families. I have heard parents say that they rarely see their children because they are always either doing homework. Additionally, face - to - face conversations are dwindling. Due to the internet, people no longer need to meet in person to talk; instead, they turn on their computers, which is a waste of energy. Why not visit your friend instead of typing all day? Lastly, computers have as many drawbacks as they do advantages. There are numerous hazards in @LOCATION1. Online predators lurk on many platforms, and your personal information and identity can be easily stolen. The likelihood of any of these things occurring is quite high. It is better to be safe than sorry. So, when you think about it, we do not actually need computers to survive. You need to engage in physical exercise; do not neglect it for online chat. Moreover, it is crucial to interact with your family, and reducing internet use will lower the risk of identity theft or any other problems or viruses. It is your choice now. Go outside, have a face - to - face conversation with a friend, and interact with your family. You can be healthy, happy, and safe without constantly typing at the keyboard.
891	893	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I opine that computers are advantageous. People utilize computers for business purposes. Computers enable individuals to interact with those at a great distance. They also facilitate research. This is the reason I deem computers beneficial. Computers can serve numerous diverse functions. They can be employed for business. Some individuals conduct their work from home using computers. They can also be used to communicate with people far away. One can interact with someone whom they do not encounter on a daily basis. Computers can also be utilized for research. One can conduct research on a school project or on other businesses with which they interact. Computers are indeed good. Some people use computers for business. One can also interact with people far away. One can even conduct research on a computer, which is why computers are advantageous.
892	894	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been requested to pen a letter expressing my opinion on the impacts computers have on people. Some experts have been concerned that people are not spending sufficient time outdoors. However, most individuals support technological advancements. During this era, computers are growing increasingly popular. They are highly beneficial in numerous aspects. They enable one to acquire new knowledge, are extremely useful for school and work, and can keep family and friends connected. Computers exert a positive and helpful influence on people. To commence, computers assist in learning new things. Whenever there is a question to which no one knows the answer, ""Google it!"" Google, along with numerous other search engines, offers an effortless means to find what one is seeking. For instance, one day, several of my family friends visited, and we were having dinner. The discussion led to the question of ""who is the actor that plays [character] in the [movie]?"" My little sister typed ""[actor] of [character] in the movie the [movie]"" and voila! There it was, [actor's name]. Just like that, computers help to obtain answers to questions promptly. Computers also aid in learning new skills such as typing. Merely learning how to operate them constitutes a new skill. A recent poll reveals that [X]% of people in nursing homes who learn to use the computer exhibit significantly better brain function. Although, there are far more compelling reasons as to why computers have a positive effect on people. Furthermore, computers assist people with work and school. Computers facilitate sending emails for work, creating slide - shows for presentations, and maintaining calendars to ensure organization and punctuality. [X]% of people utilize computers in some manner to benefit at work."
893	895	1	1	"To Whom It May Concern, I firmly believe that computers confer benefits upon society. Computers are a remarkable household item that simplifies life in numerous ways. Computers empower the average family to explore new places via online photos and connect with people through the internet. Computers also establish a social network spanning a community, state, or even a country! Lastly, a computer serves as an additional resource when attempting to achieve a goal, as there is always something on the internet that can offer assistance. There is a well - known quote that states, ""the largest room in the world is the room for improvement."" In my view, computers can make that room somewhat smaller. While experts claim that computers are causing people to spend excessive time indoors and insufficient time appreciating the wonders of nature outside, the computer can refute this claim. The internet is a vast expanse of pictures, words, and sounds. The computer is the device that organizes it for one's entertainment. There are pictures of virtually anything imaginable on the internet; from the palm - shaped islands of [location] to the frozen [region] tundra in [location]. One can observe penguins in the southern ice cap and the rice fields of [location] from a bird's - eye view simply by moving one's fingers. It is also feasible not only to view places but also to connect with people regardless of the distance! Nowadays, people are exchanging pictures via emails. People are actually sharing their memories with one another, all thanks to the computer. I hope what I have just elaborated helps to convey my point. Computers are here solely to enhance our lives. Imagine conversing with your friends without ever leaving your room. This would have been an impossibility fifty or seventy years ago, but it is now a reality. People's social relationships have advanced significantly, and it only continues to progress. The computer has enabled people to stay in touch with their family and friends. I will always regard the computer as a positive force when used appropriately. Having to individually tell your friends about your trip to Disney World is such a hassle. If you simply upload the pictures to a social networking platform like Facebook or Twitter, memories will be preserved through literally the click of a button. Memories are shared thanks to the social networking capabilities of the computer. Planning a vacation is a laborious task, but what if that task could be accomplished from the comfort of your home? An entire vacation can be planned, confirmed, and paid for thanks to the computer. Tasks that would typically require hours of research and phone calls can be completed in minutes at a lower cost using the computer. This allows people more time to enjoy their lives without having to worry about planning. Computers enable people to condense hours of work into a matter of minutes. Experts claim that computers are ""taking away people's lives."" I would disagree because people are discovering new places and people, social networking has become more sophisticated, and the time that could have been spent planning is now being used for living."
894	896	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer age has arrived. Wherever one goes, one will encounter people with laptops or other portable computer devices. While some individuals oppose the widespread use of computers, I, on the contrary, believe that the computer is an excellent medium to disseminate and acquire information. I also consider it a great medium for people to communicate with their family and friends residing far away. Lastly, I think that computers offer us enjoyable activities, entertainment, and a means to relax. What do you do when you want to know the capital of @LOCATION3? You can either rummage through the old atlas or, with a simple click on the computer, find out that the capital is @LOCATION4. My point is that with computers, obtaining information is quick and effortless. Moreover, with computers, one can both share and receive information. Suppose you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold using items found in every household. What do you do? Well, you could approach the media and participate in numerous interviews and conferences, or you could simply post it on @CAPS1. It is evident that the computer plays a crucial role in the process of information exchange. ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, but we can't fly to @LOCATION1 to see @CAPS2 @PERSON1. We don't have enough money."" I think everyone has heard a similar statement at least once. But the computer comes to the rescue! With computers, seeing @CAPS2 @PERSON1 in @LOCATION2 is just a click (and or screen) away. By using webcams, one can converse with someone across the world without fretting about the high costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! One can send a message to someone far away via email or instant messaging. Bid farewell to expensive plane rides, hefty phone bills, or long periods without seeing a loved one. Computers are not merely tools used strictly for work; they can also be used for other purposes. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does this make computers have a creative impact on society? I'll explain. Many @CAPS4 are workaholics, or people who worry too much. After a long day of signing papers and dealing with budgets, wouldn't it be nice to simply sit down and play some solitaire? That's possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are filled with fun games like solitaire and chess. These games offer a great way to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. Having some downtime can truly contribute to a person's health and happiness. Aren't computers great? They allow us to exchange information, talk to family and friends across the globe (without a large price tag), and provide us with entertainment. So, to everyone who dislikes the impact of computers on the public, please reconsider. Computers are truly a helpful, fun, and useful tool for society."
895	897	1	1	Dear local Newspaper, I am writing to express my views on the effects of computers. In my opinion, computers are remarkable. They enable interaction with family and friends, facilitate learning about global events, and assist with schoolwork. Firstly, computers are invaluable for social interaction. One can access platforms such as Facebook, [another platform], or MySpace to engage in conversations, share pictures, and comment on others' posts. There are numerous groups available for joining, which allows individuals to meet new people and make friends. Additionally, one can communicate with family members who have accounts on these platforms. Secondly, computers are a rich source of information. There are countless websites offering knowledge on various subjects, including science, math, history, and more. One can explore a wide range of topics, from weather forecasts to family genealogy. Finally, computers play a vital role in education. Many students complete their homework using computers. If people claim that computers are harmful, parents may restrict their children's access to computers for educational purposes such as homework and projects. There are numerous other reasons why computers have a positive impact on people. In essence, social interaction, learning, and education all rely on computers.
896	898	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I contend that computers exert an influence on individuals. Firstly, they endow people with the capacity to learn from distant locales. Secondly, they enable individuals to engage in online conversations with friends. Thirdly, they offer online games to young children. Lastly, one can view videos that impart a variety of exotic knowledge. My initial rationale for believing that computers have an impact on people is that they bestow upon individuals the ability to learn from far - off places. For instance, if I wish to visit @LOCATION4 on @DATE1 and am entirely unaware of the place, I can access the internet and look up their cuisine, culture, villages, and even their landscapes. Moreover, the computer proves useful for book reports. If your teacher assigns a book report on @LOCATION5, instead of referring to textbooks, you can go online and research their culture, food, location, economic situation, the types of schools children attend, and the festivals they celebrate, among other things. My second reason for computers having an impact on people is that they allow individuals to converse online with others at their convenience. For example, there are @NUM1 platforms that facilitate computer - based communication, such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These two enable you to communicate with friends residing far away. My friend lives in @LOCATION1 while I live in @LOCATION2. Since we don't have cell phones, we use either @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 to stay in touch. Isn't that remarkable? The computer also enables communication from afar. For example, if you live in @LOCATION3, you can talk to someone in @LOCATION6. My third reason for believing that computers have an impact on people is that they provide online games for young children. When I mention games, I am referring to educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of children learn more on the computer than in school, which is a significant percentage even for kids. Additionally, when kids play computer games, they find it more enjoyable than sitting in class all day.
897	899	1	1	Dear newspaper, Do you not relish using your computer? Do you not accomplish a great deal with it? Well, I firmly believe that they exert a positive influence on people. I wholeheartedly concur that computers have a beneficial impact on our society. The following are my three reasons: you can engage in online chats with friends and family, assist individuals in conducting research for projects, and aid people in fulfilling their work requirements in daily life. So, dear local newspaper, kindly continue reading, and I will persuade you to change your perspective on the effects of computers on people. Do you have family members or friends who do not reside nearby and with whom you wish to maintain contact? Utilizing the computer for email or a chat platform like Facebook can achieve this. I have cousins living in @LOCATION2. The only cost - effective way for my family to stay in touch with them is through email. My mother and her sister are constantly exchanging emails. In my opinion, this is a positive effect of computers. Have you ever conducted research using a computer? I know I have! For a school project in @CAPS2, I had to research @LOCATION1. I conducted all my research on the computer and received an A+! I would not have attained that grade if I had not used the computer for research. Do you use a computer in your job? Even if you do not, I know many people who do. For example, my father uses a computer for nearly the entire workday. He is a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, which means he manages portfolios. He has to use @ORGANIZATION1 to monitor the stock chart. Another example is my mother, a teacher. She uses the computer to email parents if a student requires assistance or has an update. As you can see, computers have a positive impact on our society. These are my reasons: you can chat online with friends and family, help people conduct research on projects, and help people complete their work in daily life. I hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. Support the positive effects of computers!
898	900	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am cognizant that some individuals believe computers have a detrimental influence on others, yet I hold the contrary view. Computers have revolutionized the world. People can store work on them, visually experience things they have never witnessed before, or even reconnect with old acquaintances. In my estimation, computers have a positive impact on people. With computers, one can create documents, pictures, and even movies that will be permanently stored on the device. Consider your newspaper company. Does someone hand - write every issue? Without computers, hundreds of copies of your newspaper could not be produced daily. Moreover, what would happen if you did not use computers and a fire broke out? All your painstaking efforts would turn to ashes, but if the work were stored on the computer, you could retrieve it. You can save anything on a computer. Another reason why computers have a positive impact on people is that through the internet, you can visually experience places or things that were previously inaccessible. If I were planning to book a vacation, I would not solely rely on a book. I would prefer to use the computer to view pictures, videos, or numerous other articles that are unavailable elsewhere. This applies to other items such as furniture, instruments, or even clothing. Computers offer alternative perspectives that books do not. Not only can computers store data and provide visual content, but they also offer an opportunity to reconnect with old friends and relatives or even meet new people! Instead of laboriously searching through phone books, you can simply type in their names and are likely to find them on the internet. Popular websites like @CAPS1 make this extremely convenient. When my father was searching for his childhood friend, he typed his name on @CAPS1 and ended up calling him @NUM1 minutes later! This would not have been possible without computers. Computers truly have a positive impact on people everywhere. Without them, many things today would be unfeasible. Hopefully, others will concur with me as well.
899	901	1	1	Dear local newspaper, In my opinion, those who manufacture computers should incorporate timers into the devices. There should be a regulation stipulating that people must engage in outdoor exercise before and after using computers. Finally, I believe that children should use computers less than adults for health reasons. My first opinion is that computer manufacturers should install timers to measure the amount of time people spend, depending on their activities. For example, when someone is playing a game, they may spend hours on it instead of engaging in other activities. Similarly, when a person is doing homework, they may become distracted, take their time, and end up with poor results. My second opinion is that there should be a law requiring people to exercise outdoors before and after using computers. A significant proportion of people are obese because they sit in front of computers for hours, eating while playing games or watching videos without taking a break to go outside. My third and final opinion is that children should use computers less than adults for health reasons. Children often stare at computer screens, causing their eyes to redden and their vision to deteriorate. Eventually, they may need glasses or a stronger prescription. Additionally, children often visit chat sites and talk to strangers, which may lead to them being raped or kidnapped. So, dear local newspaper, will you advocate for this change for the sake of society and children? I certainly would.
900	902	1	1	I opine that computers assist people in their daily lives. They simply render tasks far more convenient. Computers enable us to obtain information that we require. They facilitate hotel and airline bookings and even allow us to interact with friends. Although it may reduce time for other activities such as exercise, we can devise a way to balance both. Every day, I spend some time on the computer and then go outside for an hour to play basketball. People merely need to figure out a solution. Computers are invaluable when you need to find information on any topic. All you have to do is type in your query, and within seconds, you will have hundreds of relevant links at your disposal. For instance, if you are in @CAPS1 school and are deciding which college to attend, the computer is an excellent resource for gathering information. People worldwide utilize it for this purpose on a daily basis. It is also ideal when you are working on a school project and need additional information on your subject. I assert that it simplifies matters significantly. There is no better example than making hotel reservations or purchasing plane tickets. Both can be done on a computer; otherwise, the odds are against you. If we did not have computers, you would have to visit the hotel in person to secure a room. If there were no available rooms, you would be out of luck. On a computer, it will indicate whether rooms are available. The same applies to ticket purchases. Computers can inform you whether there are available flights to your destination and the corresponding fares. So, when you arrive at the airport, you will not be caught off - guard. Another compelling reason why computers are beneficial for people is that they help you interact with friends and family when you cannot see them. There are numerous ways to achieve this. Platforms like @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and MySpace all assist you in staying in touch with your friends. Nowadays, there are even features that allow you to see the person you are conversing with over the computer. So, if you have no immediate prospects of meeting in person, you can still communicate. I even do this with my brother. He is in college, and I don't see him often, so I simply start chatting with him on the computer. These are some of the reasons why I believe computers are an integral part of our lives. Activities such as finding information, booking hotels and flights, etc., all contribute to making our lives more convenient at times. And communicating with others via the computer brings us joy. Now, these are the reasons why I consider computers to be a wonderful addition to our lives.
901	903	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I opine that individuals ought to remain engaged with computers. I possess three rationales for this matter, namely @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. I deem these reasons to be apt for this issue as every human being can undertake these three activities on a computer. One of the reasons I advocate people staying with computers is that they can acquire knowledge. People can learn by utilizing computers; for instance, if a child has an interest in animals, they can access the internet to look up relevant information. Children can also learn on the computer by inputting their first - grade data into the drive. In this manner, children can gain knowledge. My second reason for people to stay with computers is @CAPS2. I hold the view of @CAPS2 because one can converse with friends. They can also discuss whether they wish to engage in enjoyable activities, such as beneficial exercise. Another reason I support @CAPS2 is when a friend is explaining something to you. I also believe @CAPS2 can be relevant to others as well. The final reason I believe people should adhere to computers is that they can discover diverse things. Some of these discoveries can be unfavorable, while others can be advantageous. For example, a positive discovery could be identifying and fixing an issue with one's computer, which would be beneficial and enhance one's computer knowledge. Conversely, a negative aspect of @CAPS3 on the computer is encountering a virus that one cannot eliminate, ultimately resulting in the computer malfunctioning. In conclusion, Local newspaper, this is why I firmly believe that we should retain our computers. Since numerous individuals, including young children, can learn and will likely remember what they have learned.
902	904	1	1	Dear Town of Southington, Computers in our town are of utmost significance. For example, all our banks utilize computers, and nearly every occupation requires them. Computers are essential for our lives, and they do not render us indolent and forgetful; instead, they keep us occupied. The only scenario where someone online appears lazy is when a teenager is engrossed in playing games. However, the reason some children do this is not that they do not want to exercise or play with their family, whom they see daily, but because they desire to communicate with friends, make plans, and interact while playing together. If someone is neglecting their family or becoming more lethargic, it is a personal choice to remain idle. I concur that people are becoming overweight, but I attribute this to the fact that some individuals consider a workout to be an hour of weight - lifting and running once a week, which is incorrect. I suggest that this newspaper should publish advertisements about gyms, which may reduce the obesity rate in our town. Alternatively, if it is believed that people are neglecting their families, they should work fewer hours to spend time with their loved ones. Regarding teenagers, I believe parents should establish rules, such as allowing @NUM1 hours of gaming per day, @NUM2 hours on @DATE1, and if they do not comply, confiscate the games for a day or two. Although this may cause them to be angry, it will encourage them to be more active and prevent them from spending all day watching @CAPS1.V. or playing video games. I speak from experience as a teenager; when my parents take away my games, I always go outside and engage in physical activities. Please heed my advice, and your happy and caring family will remain together, active, and not constantly sitting at the computer, stressed about work or playing video games.
903	905	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I, a member of the public, am writing this letter to convey my thoughts on whether people spend excessive time on the computer. My initial observation is that at times, people do spend more time on the computer than is typical. This is a concern because some individuals start to gain weight and lose control over their eating habits. My second point is that while computers perform numerous functions for us, there are still many tasks they cannot teach us. Thus, although computers are useful, they cannot replace the need to find activities outside. My final point is that people become overly attached to their computers and lose sight of what truly matters, such as physical exercise and maintaining good health. When their computers crash, people become frustrated and may forget how to perform tasks independently due to their excessive reliance on computers. These are my perspectives on the issue of whether people spend too much time on the computer at the expense of time with friends and family.
904	906	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I invite you to envision a beautiful @DATE1 day, where the birds are singing melodiously and the air is filled with the fragrance of lovely flowers. Yet, instead of playing outdoors with neighbors, one is indoors attempting to master the unbeatable game Cubefield on the computer. Computers have exerted a detrimental influence on contemporary society. When individuals are deeply engrossed in their computer activities, they become extremely lethargic, lose the motivation to engage in outdoor exercise, and also lose interest in contributing to the community. This is precisely why computers have a negative impact on today's society. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT1 of people prefer to remain indoors using the computer rather than going out to assist and work within their neighborhood. The negative impact of computers is so profound that it compels people to remain seated, fixated on their monitors. While computers have contributed significantly to technological advancements, what is the price we pay for these developments? Many children are becoming obese and lack the motivation to leave their rooms and the computer. Computers are making society extremely indolent, which is why they have a negative impact on us. Moreover, computers have caused society to lack the motivation to exercise. A close family friend was severely obese. She was lethargic and had no inclination to exercise. Instead of taking action, she spent weeks in her room on Facebook. Although the computer was not the sole cause of her obesity, it was used as a means to avoid addressing the real issues. It is disheartening that @PERCENT2 of teenagers claim they would rather stay indoors on MySpace than go for a jog. It is true that computers can help us learn new things, but so can books, newspapers, and magazines. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Contributing to the community offers numerous opportunities to meet new people and provides a sense of achievement. However, the temptation to stay indoors on the computer clouds our better judgment. I firmly believe that I would rather assist the elementary school across the street in building a new garden than stay indoors on Twitter. If one is indoors surfing the web, how can they know if the elderly lady across the street needs help with her groceries? Helping in the community demonstrates that we care about what is happening. Therefore, do not let the computer consume another moment of your time. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Both teenagers and adults have become extremely lazy, lacking the motivation to exercise and contribute to the community. Now, it is your turn. Do not simply stare blankly at your computer screen. Go outside and play with the neighbor's dog. You have heard the facts; now, make the right decision.
905	907	1	1	"Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1. I have recently been informed about the debate regarding computer use, and I find it rather absurd. We rely on computers in our lives to perform various tasks, such as facilitating our jobs, enabling communication with family or friends traveling abroad, and assisting with homework research. Firstly, without computers, many individuals would encounter difficulties. My father utilizes a computer for his job, and he would be unable to fulfill his duties without it. Admittedly, some people spend an excessive amount of time on their computers, but others use them to store information or conduct research. I am aware that some argue for reduced computer use, but could you manage a week without using a single computer? Most people would find it challenging, especially if they own a business. Additionally, apart from using computers for work, some individuals enjoy chatting online with friends who have moved away. Imagine if a family member or friend frequently travels to areas with no cell - phone reception; the only way to communicate with them would be through online chat. I am certain that everyone has used a computer at least once to communicate with a friend or for business - related purposes, highlighting their greater utility than people realize. Lastly, as children, we need to be able to use computers, not only to communicate with friends but also for homework. Some homework assignments require us to create PowerPoint presentations or write papers on historical facts, which can only be accomplished with the help of computers. Without computers, children would struggle to gather information for their papers, and reducing computer use for kids could potentially lower their grades. My teacher often says, ""Grades are of the utmost importance."" I am confident that all parents would concur. In conclusion, we cannot reduce computer use as it would have a detrimental impact on people's lives. Consider those who travel frequently, children with schoolwork, and parents whose jobs rely on computers. Do not inconvenience these individuals by reducing computer time. Thank you for your time."
906	908	1	1	"Knowledge is one of the most significant pursuits for humanity, constantly endeavoring to comprehend the mechanisms and reasons behind occurrences. Owing to this innate curiosity, we have achieved remarkable progress in technology. Years ago, what seemed unattainable is now feasible. Among those numerous feats once considered impossible was the ability to find anything one desires within mere seconds. I believe that computers are a substantial boon to society because one can acquire knowledge about the world instantaneously, communicate with individuals globally, and improve hand - eye coordination. The primary reason I think computers are excellent for modern society is that we can immediately learn about foreign countries. Years ago, the sole means of learning about distant places was by reading newspapers, many of which provided little information about far - off lands. Now, with the internet, we can learn about what is happening anywhere in the world. ""Thanks to our modern technology, people are now more informed about the rest of the world than ever before,"" stated a well - known expert from a prestigious university. ""Due to computers and the ability to gather information rapidly compared to years ago,"" Without computers, we would have known nothing about the recent earthquake in a particular region. Moreover, with computers, we can now communicate instantaneously with people via the internet. A century ago, instant communication with others seemed nearly impossible. But thanks to technology, such a thing has become an ordinary part of our lives. ""Many of our advancements and decisions are made during online conversations. Even some of the world's most influential leaders make difficult decisions because of these technological advancements,"" stated a reporter for a well - known newspaper. ""Without this technology, many of the decisions made in certain locations would not have been possible, and many soldiers would have perished as a result."" The final reason I support the use of computers is that they assist in teaching hand - eye coordination. One way computers achieve this is through video games and simulations. In video games, players are required to react to movements and cues to complete their objectives. In military computer simulations, soldiers are taught how to respond to various situations. Through these scenarios, many soldiers have learned how to survive in combat and save their comrades. ""The simulations we have invested in have enhanced combat effectiveness by over a significant percentage,"" stated a general of a military unit. ""Without these simulations, many more American lives would have been lost in recent wars."" Now that you have heard all the reasons why I support computers, I hope you are more informed about this topic. Without computers, we would be unable to learn about foreign lands, communicate instantly, or have good hand - eye coordination. I hope everyone else will recognize these reasons for supporting computers."
907	909	1	1	"Dear [LOCATION1], As you all are aware, in our town, there has been considerable debate regarding computers. Some individuals advocate for computer usage, while others are less enthusiastic. In my view, computers represent an outstanding technology. One way computers benefit our society is through the ability to access abundant information, images, and news. Additionally, one can engage in conversations with new or old friends. Another advantage of computers is the opportunity to have entertainment on the web, such as watching movies or even shopping. Have you ever conducted a report on a distant country? Perhaps you've never heard of [LOCATION2] or a particular place. So, what do you do? Search the web! Instead of making a trip to the library, simply utilize one of the many search engines, such as [ORGANIZATION1], [CAPS4], [ORGANIZATION2], or [CAPS5]! A significant percentage of people nowadays possess at least one, or perhaps two, computers in their households. Another percentage of people can access the web via their cell phones! Can you believe it? Pictures are also accessible on the web. You can find almost anything in the picture search engine. Have you ever wondered about current events in our country or others? On certain websites, you can access live newsfeeds or read an article about something notable, such as the earthquake in [LOCATION4] that recently occurred. The internet is currently benefiting our society. Aim is just one of the numerous private chat rooms available to people. On these open chat rooms, you can converse with individuals who are thousands of miles away. ""I was on [CAPS6] searching for my friend [CAPS7], and I found her page. Before this year, we didn't communicate much, but now we can talk through Facebook. We hang out and chat all the time!"" commented an avid [CAPS6] user from [LOCATION3]. Dating websites are also available. There, you can meet new people and develop relationships with them. Entertainment abounds on the internet. You can play a diverse range of games, watch missed episodes of your favorite TV show, stream live movies, watch videos on [CAPS9], and much more! Many people assume that there are only trivial games on the computer, but there are also educational and fun games, such as [CAPS10], [CAPS11], and [CAPS12], for learning purposes. Did you know that more than a certain percentage of shopping for clothes, car parts, and other items is conducted at auctions like eBay and Amazon? I recall a time when my dad and I were going to watch a movie, but we weren't sure what was playing or the start times. So, we simply checked the cinema's website. Now, you know where I stand on the issue of computers. Computers serve as an excellent reference point and enable you to chat with others."
908	910	1	1	"[ORGANIZATION1], Since the invention of computers, they have undergone remarkable development, leading a large number of people to use them more frequently. Although an increasing number of individuals are using computers, not everyone concurs that this is beneficial to society. Those who support technological advancements believe that computers have a positive impact on people, yet there are also negative effects. I am of the opinion that computers have a negative influence on people because individuals spend excessive time on computers, resulting in less exercise, exposing them to numerous dangers, and reducing interaction with family and friends. Firstly, a negative consequence of computers on people is that they devote too much time to using them, which leads to a lack of physical activity. Recently, [CAPS3] had a conversation with a local [CAPS2] about this issue, and she stated, ""We have one family computer, and my son is always on it right after school until late at night."" This indicates that many children spend an inordinate amount of time on computers. I must admit that I myself sometimes sit in front of my computer and don't even realize that two hours have passed. I attempt to reduce my computer usage, but it doesn't seem to be very effective. Spending hours on the computer every day also means forgoing exercise. The time spent on the computer could be utilized for physical activity. One's health is of great importance at present. Spending too much time on the computer and not getting enough exercise is a major negative impact that computers have on people. Secondly, the primary concern that parents have regarding computers is the multitude of dangers, which is another negative effect on people. Recently, Facebook has become the most popular website. Many people are addicted to it. However, it is not always safe. Another new phenomenon is Oovoo or Skype, which allows users to communicate with others via webcam. There may be instances where a teenager ""meets"" someone online and agrees to perform certain actions on the webcam for someone they don't really know. These websites are not secure, and considering the vulnerability of young people, they can be at risk. [CAPS3] consulted some researchers about this, and they agreed that these websites are a certain percentage dangerous to young teens. All these dangerous risks are another negative impact that computers have on people. Lastly, another negative effect of computers on people is the decrease in interaction with family and friends. Instead of meeting up with a friend in person, people simply use the computer to communicate. This is not the same as an actual gathering. I genuinely enjoy family parties. Seeing all my aunts, uncles, and cousins is much more enjoyable. I do send emails to my family and friends when I don't see them, but I get excited when we have get - togethers. Nowadays, this is not the case for many people. Many individuals work long hours and spend too much time on the computer, which takes away time from interacting with others, and this interaction should be more highly valued. The computer also has a negative impact on people's ability to interact with family and friends. In conclusion, I perceive computers as having a negative influence on people. Computers cause people to spend a great deal of time, expose them to dangerous risks, and reduce interaction with others. I strongly recommend that you consider these points."
909	911	1	1	In my estimation, computers exert a favorable influence on people. I hold this view because millions of individuals utilize computers on a daily basis. The effects on them are that people can acquire knowledge more easily. There are millions of job - related platforms that are associated with learning. Approximately [NUM1] of college students go online to undertake challenges. If one were a college student taking online courses, they would be able to see their family more often, avoid the hassle of commuting to college, and find it easier to concentrate while studying alone. Moreover, there are also popular language - learning tools available on computers. My second reason is related to communication. A certain percentage of our daily communication occurs online. You can also engage in various forms of interaction. I have a Facebook account, and I believe it is a great way to connect. In conclusion, I think that computers have positive effects on those who use them. Additionally, when people use their computers, they can still enjoy nature and communicate with their families. Therefore, if you don't have a computer, you should acquire one and engage in other enjoyable activities that you like.
910	912	1	1	"[ORGANIZATION1], Since the invention of computers, they have witnessed remarkable growth, which has led a significant number of people to use them more extensively. Although more and more individuals are embracing computers, not everyone believes that this trend is beneficial to society. Those who support technological advancements argue that computers have a positive impact on people, yet there are also adverse effects. I firmly believe that computers have a negative influence on people as they cause individuals to spend excessive time on them, resulting in reduced physical activity, exposure to numerous hazards, and diminished interaction with family and friends. First and foremost, a detrimental effect of computers on people is the excessive time they spend using them, which leads to a lack of exercise. Recently, [CAPS3] had a discussion with a local [CAPS2] about this matter, and she revealed, ""We have one family computer, and my son is constantly on it from right after school until late at night."" This clearly shows that many children are spending an inordinate amount of time on computers. I must confess that I myself sometimes lose track of time while sitting in front of my computer, and two hours can pass by unnoticed. I try to cut down on my computer usage, but it proves to be quite challenging. Spending hours on the computer every day means sacrificing time that could be spent on physical exercise. In today's world, one's health is of utmost importance. Spending too much time on the computer and neglecting exercise is a major negative consequence of computer use. Secondly, the most pressing concern that parents have regarding computers is the numerous dangers associated with them, which is yet another negative impact on people. Recently, Facebook has emerged as the most popular social media platform, and many people are addicted to it. However, it is not always a safe environment. Another new development is the use of video - conferencing tools like Oovoo or Skype, which allow users to communicate with others via webcam. There have been instances where teenagers ""meet"" strangers online and agree to engage in inappropriate activities on the webcam, putting themselves at risk. These platforms are not secure, and considering the naivety of young people, they can easily get into trouble. [CAPS3] consulted some researchers about this issue, and they agreed that these platforms are [PERCENT1] dangerous to young teens. All these risks pose a significant negative impact on people. Lastly, another negative effect of computers on people is the reduction in face - to - face interaction with family and friends. Instead of meeting up with friends in person, people prefer to communicate with them online. This is not the same as having an actual gathering. I personally enjoy family parties. Meeting all my relatives is a much more fulfilling and enjoyable experience. Although I do keep in touch with my family and friends via email when we are apart, I always look forward to real - life get - togethers. Nowadays, this is not the case for many people. Many individuals work long hours and spend too much time on the computer, which takes away from the time they could spend interacting with others, and this interaction is of great importance. The computer, therefore, has a negative impact on people's ability to interact with their loved ones. In conclusion, I am of the opinion that computers have a negative influence on people. They cause people to waste a great deal of time, expose them to dangerous situations, and reduce social interaction. I strongly encourage you to take these points into consideration."
911	913	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I oppose the notion that computers offer any benefits to society. Undoubtedly, computers serve as an excellent means to acquire knowledge about various aspects of the world. However, individuals ought to prioritize the matters directly in front of them. Devoting excessive time to computers reduces opportunities for physical exercise, limits the appreciation of nature, and diminishes interactions with family and friends.  Computers do not confer advantages on everyone, primarily because they curtail time available for exercise. When individuals neglect physical activity due to preoccupation with less significant tasks, they tend to experience chronic fatigue. Subsequently, they lose motivation to engage in any activity and prefer to remain sedentary, which fosters a sedentary lifestyle. Lack of exercise weakens the body, leading to decreased bone strength. Moreover, the body fails to obtain the necessary calories, calcium, and vitamins required for optimal health. Consequently, individuals gain weight and fall out of shape, as the accumulated fat remains due to the absence of physical exertion.  Using computers also hinders the proper appreciation of nature. One never gets to witness the world in its true essence and misses out on enjoyable outdoor activities. When others discuss their memorable experiences, one will regret not being part of them. Being confined indoors continuously becomes monotonous, and there is little to do for amusement.  If one is constantly engrossed in computers, interactions with family and friends become virtually non - existent. These relationships are far more important than computers, as family and friends are always there to provide support. One will miss out on important and enjoyable family occasions due to computer addiction. Additionally, friends may distance themselves as they feel neglected.  In conclusion, computers do not benefit ordinary people, as they cause individuals to miss out on the most valuable aspects of life, such as exercise, nature, and, most importantly, family and friends. Eventually, one will regret not having spent more time with them instead of being consumed by computer use.
912	914	1	1	"The question of whether computers truly benefit society has been a subject of debate for years. Some individuals assert that computers are extremely helpful, enabling us to view the world from a different perspective and facilitating the acquisition of knowledge through the rapid advancement of technology. Conversely, others argue that computers are addictive and represent an insecure and unsafe device, especially when personal files are stored on them while connected to the internet. Moreover, people are spending more time on computers than ever before, causing them to miss out on interactions with family and friends and preventing them from appreciating nature and other simple pleasures of life.  In my honest opinion, computers should solely be utilized as tools. As @PERSON2 states, ""Many people regard computers as personal diaries, file - storage devices, or gaming platforms, overlooking the fundamental fact that computers are designed to simplify life."" Whether it is a basic @CAPS1 (@ORGANIZATION1) or a sophisticated supercomputer, the primary function remains the same: to make life easier. Even after upgrades, computers continue to serve this purpose, yet people still perceive them as the next big thing in entertainment.  However, computers can have negative consequences. Since @PERSON1 introduced @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS2 popular disk @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, computer usage has soared. @ORGANIZATION2 is widely sold for businesses, small companies, schools, and the entertainment industry. For example, the creation of the xbox @NUM1 a few years ago revolutionized gaming and the public's perception of it. The problem is that @ORGANIZATION2 has contributed to an increased addiction to entertainment. As a result, people become dependent on computers. With @CAPS2 computers having internet access, those who rely on them are at risk of being hacked and having their personal information stolen.  Another constant issue with computers is the impact on communication. Family and friends find it difficult to interact with individuals who spend excessive time on computers. As @CAPS3 @PERSON3 remarks, ""@CAPS2 of those without real - life friends engage in online chats without knowing the true identities of the people they are talking to."" Making friends online is highly unsafe, as over @PERCENT1 of online users are not who they claim to be. People often abandon their real - life friends in pursuit of these virtual connections.  In conclusion, while computers have their uses, it is essential to be aware of their potential negative impacts, such as addiction, security risks, and the disruption of real - life relationships."
913	915	1	1	"Dear @LOCATION2, there exists a dilemma, @CAPS2, where some people support computer technology while others oppose it. I firmly contend that computers generally have a positive impact. This is because numerous jobs rely on computers daily, as they enhance efficiency. Additionally, computers enable people to connect with others, perform editing tasks that other technologies cannot, and offer a source of entertainment. Moreover, educational websites, games, and articles accessible via computers contribute to the educational growth of children and help adults find suitable and fulfilling employment.  Primarily, computers exert a positive influence on people because they are widely used in various jobs. Occupations such as those at @ORGANIZATION1 and in police work provide essential services to people across the United States and other parts of the world. My father often said, ""Computers save lives every day."" Even schools utilize computers to store educational information about students. At my school, @LOCATION1 school, computers are used regularly. For instance, I see my teacher, Mr. @CAPS4, using his computer every morning in homeroom. Nearly @PERCENT1 of all jobs involve computers for information storage or other necessary functions. One must consider whether it is acceptable for so many people to lose their jobs due to a lack of computer - related skills. I, for one, firmly believe it is not. Computers contribute to a safe and healthy life for many individuals.  Secondly, computers have a positive impact as they can perform tasks that no other device can. They facilitate long - distance communication and photo editing. Even playing a game on the computer can be a relaxing activity for most people. @CAPS6 serves as an excellent example of maintaining communication. For me, @CAPS6 was a lifesaver as it allowed me to communicate with my brother during his chaotic college life. In fact, nearly @PERCENT2 of people have accounts on public websites such as @CAPS7, @CAPS6, or @CAPS9. Computers also store photos that can be edited or simply admired. I do not want to lose my pictures and @CAPS6 memories, as no other device can rival the computer's ability to provide an enjoyable and entertaining experience.  Thirdly, computers have a positive influence on people as they provide unrestricted access to education. I recall that in my elementary school, we used to play engaging math games. These games significantly contributed to my educational development. Such games are widely used around the world. In the current economic climate, many jobs have been lost, but adults are increasingly finding decent jobs online with the help of computers. Computers have saved people from losing their homes by enabling them to earn income.  In conclusion, I earnestly implore you to recognize that computer technology has a profound positive impact on people. Computers are as essential as a pencil is to a student. They are integral to daily job operations, facilitate human connections, and promote educational growth. Therefore, computer technology has a beneficial effect on people."
914	916	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that the influence of computers on individuals is positive. This conviction stems from the fact that computers enable people to develop hand - eye coordination, offer insights into distant places and individuals, and facilitate communication with people across the globe.  Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people as they help in the development of hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is valuable in numerous situations, enhancing motor skills and overall dexterity.  Secondly, the ability of computers to provide information about far - off places and people is of great significance. Through computers, individuals can learn about history and important figures, which enriches their knowledge and understanding of the world. This exposure broadens perspectives and fosters a more comprehensive worldview.  Lastly, computers allow people to communicate with others from all corners of the world. This is highly useful as it enables individuals to learn about different cultures, customs, religions, and heritages. Such cross - cultural exchanges promote tolerance, understanding, and a more interconnected global community.  In summary, I am convinced that computers have a positive influence on people. They contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination, offer access to knowledge about distant places and people, and facilitate global communication. These benefits make computers an invaluable tool in modern society.
915	917	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects computers have on people are good. I believe this because people can learn hand-eye coordination, they give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and they even allow people to talk with people from around the world. Firstly, effects computers have on people are good because the people can learn hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is good in many occations. Secondly, computers effects on people are good because computers give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people is important becuase people can learn about history and important figures in life. Lastly, the effects people have from computers are good because computers allow people to talk with people from all around the world. This is usefull because the people can learn about each other, their customs and religious and also their cultures and heritage. All-in-all, I believe that computers have good effects on people because they can learn hand-eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and computers even allow people to talk with people online from all parts of the world.
916	918	1	1	"To whom this @MONTH1 pertains, in my view, computers have significantly enhanced our lives. Thus, I am convinced that owning and utilizing a computer serves the greater good. Three rationales that underpin my stance are that computers have bestowed upon us the capacity to rapidly and effortlessly access information, they enable us to establish connections with individuals in distant locales, and they assist us in acquiring a deeper understanding of life and the planet we inhabit. Kindly take my reasons into account when reaching your decision. My initial reason is that computers have endowed us with the ability to find information swiftly and with ease. This, in turn, enables us to accomplish more. For instance, suppose you are crafting a report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could venture to the library and sift through hundreds of books and newspapers, or you could simply settle at your computer, launch a web browser, and enter ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" into the search bar. Within mere seconds, you will have scoured hundreds more libraries, newspapers, and even other computers to obtain information on your topic. You can also search for information in videos, such as old newscasts, interviews, and documentaries - you name it. It's all readily accessible at your fingertips. My second reason is that it facilitates connections among people in far - flung places. If I were to mention this to my mother, she would likely advise me to use the phone, yet computers can perform all that a phone can and more. You can share photos, videos, games - virtually anything. Recently, I joined Facebook and can now converse with individuals I haven't seen in years, who moved away around the time I was born. Over the @DATE1, I visited my @CAPS3. My father introduced me to his uncle, who shares my name. Then, about a month later, I received a friend request from a @CAPS4 who resides in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live and currently reside. After chatting with him for a while, I discovered that he is the son of my dad's uncle. Had it not been for my computer, I would never have met him. Additionally, I've recently been learning and am making good progress. One day, my friends and I used a device that has all the necessary features. We began video - taping and posting. So, the computer has also allowed us to engage in activities without others having to be physically present. My third and final reason is that the computer empowers us to learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many assert that spending excessive time on the computer will render you obese and indolent, but this is not always the case. In fact, I've managed to enhance my exercise routine by using the computer. Whenever I go for a run, I can return home and precisely determine how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and any other information I desire. I've also been able to discover new, more effective exercises that target different muscle groups. Now, let's discuss what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to identify weather patterns, which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also utilize it to stay informed about global news. For example, on the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened my homepage, and there the news was, enabling me to learn about what had transpired. In conclusion, computers have substantially improved the lives of humanity. They have enabled us to enhance our lives and acquire knowledge. I hope this letter aids you in making a decision regarding the impact of computers on people's lives."
917	919	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I comprehend this focal situation. The influence of computers on our society and people's reactions to them are less than satisfactory, and my query is: who is to blame? Computers exert a highly beneficial impact on our town specifically. Computers aid in developing hand - eye coordination. They offer people the opportunity to observe things and communicate with those who have traveled here, and they can deplete one's finances more rapidly than imaginable. @CAPS2 also possess the capability to assist people in tidying up spaces that are in a state of disarray. Allow me to elaborate further on these reasons. Computers are highly advantageous for our society as they assist both children and adults in developing hand - eye coordination. To help you understand why @CAPS2 are so effective in teaching hand - eye coordination, there are numerous activities that not only facilitate learning but also yield positive results. In football, catching a ball helps teach this skill, yet it may cause you to end up on the ground after being tackled, potentially by yourself. In baseball, swinging at a pitch teaches this skill, but if the pitch is too close, it could harm you, and if you miss the ball, it could strike someone else and cause injury. Computers provide an excellent means to develop this skill in a safe environment. Even @CAPS1 @PERSON1 in our town has noted an improvement in children's hand - eye coordination due to computer usage. Do we have a positive situation in our town? Well, computers enable people to communicate with relatives in distant locations without the need for travel. I'm certain you're wondering if I have another reason. Computers can perform certain tasks electronically with great speed and ease. When you search on a computer's hard drive, @CAPS2 offer a vast amount of information that can clear a room of clutter. Before my family had a computer dedicated to storing papers and files that were extremely important and couldn't be lost, our storage space was filled. When we got a computer, we could take pictures, type up papers, and save our data, and our storage space became empty! I hope this letter demonstrates to you the positive impact of computers on our society. Computers assist in developing hand - eye coordination and enable tasks to be completed more efficiently than in real - life scenarios. They also facilitate electronic transactions more effectively. So, after reading this letter, I encourage you to spread the word about the positive effects of computers. Once again, thank you for reading this letter.
918	920	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2, are you aware of the impact computers are having on the people of @LOCATION1? Well, I am. People are in a concerning state. We need to @CAPS2 take action regarding these computers. They are preventing people from exercising, going outdoors, and are simply causing them to remain indoors all day. One reason I advocate for getting rid of computers is that they are causing people to neglect their physical activity. The computer, along with the @LOCATION2, is likely the primary factor contributing to people becoming overweight. Children sometimes spend the entire day on the computer, consuming snacks and junk food instead of healthy fruits and vegetables. You can @CAPS2 perform almost any activity on the computer that you would in your daily life, which showcases the advanced nature of technology. The computer is the culprit that makes people addicted to something. It offers games, internet access, and means of communication that draw people in. A second reason is that computers continuously drain money from your wallet. When purchasing a computer, most individuals opt for the most expensive one because salespeople persuade them to do so. Most people are unaware of the type of computer they should buy, so they choose the priciest one, believing that the higher the cost, the better the quality. Moreover, buying the computer is not the only expense. Downloading software, games, and mobile applications all incur costs. Downloading a single item can cost up to one hundred dollars. Additionally, most people cannot afford these downloads after purchasing an expensive computer. My third view is that the computer is a complete waste of time. People spend hours on the computer engaging in trivial activities such as playing games and chatting, when they should be outdoors enjoying the fresh air. Going outside is crucial for your health. The next time you find yourself on the computer doing something unimportant, step outside. Consider this: how often do you go outside? My assumption is not very often. Now, are you aware of the impact computers are having on the people of @LOCATION1? They are making people overweight, preventing them from exercising, causing them to consume junk food, and making them spend all day playing games on this useless piece of technology. Instead of spending all day on the computer, why not consider going outside and getting the fresh air you need? Also, you don't want to squander all your hard - earned money on a useless piece of technology. Furthermore, you don't want to deal with software and its associated viruses. My advice is that computers are dreadful.
919	921	1	1	I am of the opinion that computers are beneficial to society and assist people in comprehending things more lucidly. Computers facilitate people's studies, learning, and even communication with others. The following are some compelling reasons why computers are helpful in solving people's problems. Firstly, computers provide information on matters that cannot be found in books. People can search for vacation destinations, check their children's school grades, and find healthy food recipes. Without computers, people would be at a loss as to what to do. Secondly, computers enable communication with friends. You can discuss topics such as the weather, share ideas, and even plan exercise days. What if something important occurs and the person doesn't have their phone? What can they do? They can use the computer to inform their friend. This would be far more convenient than driving to the person's house and then driving back. Finally, computers can enhance hand - eye coordination. They can teach you to type without looking at the keyboard. This skill can be utilized to pursue a promising career in the carpentry field. Computers can also aid in preparing for a new job and understanding its requirements. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers simplify people's lives by providing vital information at their fingertips. They can also support people in achieving their goals, such as communicating with friends, accessing information, and learning new skills.
920	922	1	1	To whom it @MONTH1 concerns, as @CAPS1 more individuals become engaged in using computers, while I consider this a positive development, others do not. I firmly believe that using a computer is advantageous because technology is advancing, and computers will serve as the foundation. Additionally, computers are now more secure due to privacy options and virus blockers. Finally, computers help you amass knowledge that no single book can provide. Although technology is evolving, computers represent only the basics. Sooner or later, everything, including jobs, education, and even the medical field, will be computer - based. Jobs will incorporate more computers and touch - screen devices as they are more user - friendly and technologically advanced. In the educational realm, @CAPS1 students are required to take computer classes to learn how to create brochures and build websites. The medical field is now employing more advanced ultrasounds that generate three - dimensional images. So, if the world around you is changing, why do you wish to remain stuck in the past? Although some people are concerned about internet safety and viruses, there are ways to mitigate these risks. Regarding social networking sites, do not make your profile visible to the entire world. Set it to be viewable only by your friends. Also, ensure that you know who your friends are. As for viruses, avoid visiting websites that are likely to cause infections. Moreover, you can install a virus blocker to eliminate them. Computers also help you acquire and expand your knowledge. You can learn about contemporary civilizations or modern - day life without leaving your home. The internet also offers virtual simulations that allow you to experience different cultures and time periods. Computers provide knowledge that is invaluable throughout your life, especially if you do not have access to a library. Even though some people disagree, I firmly believe that computers are the cornerstone of technology, are secure, and are brimming with knowledge. Yes, they have some drawbacks, but they are an excellent learning tool.
921	923	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, Experts express apprehensions regarding the utilization of computers. They assert that individuals spend protracted hours on the computer, allocating less time to physical exercise, appreciating nature, and engaging with family and friends. I concur. When people use computers, they fail to interact and meet new acquaintances in person. They remain indoors and do not engage in physical activity, and children may converse with strangers. When we utilize computers, we chat with friends online and do not genuinely interact with others. We befriend new individuals online and chat with them but never meet or socialize with them in person, which is one drawback of computers. Another issue is the lack of physical exercise. While we are on the computer, we expend a significant amount of time, and sometimes this even causes us to forget to exercise. Subsequently, we gradually start to become unhealthy. Another major problem with computers is communicating or chatting with strangers. Some individuals may encounter random people online and disclose personal information to them. Children may even meet some of the strangers they have conversed with online and sustain harm. Well, thank you for perusing my perspectives on computers. I hope you take them into account. Children and even adults fail to interact with friends, lack physical exercise, and divulge personal information to strangers.
922	924	1	1	Dear Newspaper, Some individuals are inquiring about the impacts computers have on people. Certain experts are concerned that people are devoting excessive time to their computers and less time to physical exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. However, in my view, the computer is excellent and does not deter people from other activities. Firstly, the computer does not impede people from engaging in other activities because there are @NUM1 hours in a day, and it is the individual's fault if they do not disengage from the computer and pursue other activities. Even though the computer offers numerous features and is highly engaging, people should still possess the common sense to step away and engage in other pursuits. Thus, I believe it is their fault if they do not leave the computer. Additionally, there are numerous reasons why people do not venture out and engage in other activities, so why single out computers? Secondly, the computer does not prevent people from participating in other activities because there are numerous distractions that divert people from other endeavors, so why blame computers? For instance, television distracts people from other activities, yet there is no discussion about eliminating it. Moreover, the computer educates you about a multitude of things and can reveal a great deal of information you are unaware of and seeking. For example, you can research your family's history on the computer. Lastly, the computer does not hinder people from engaging in other activities because if people were genuinely concerned about their other activities, they would disengage from the computer and attend to their tasks. For example, if they have to go to the gym, they should leave the computer and go to the gym because the computer does not cause obesity; you are responsible for your own weight. Therefore, they should be reasonable enough to go to the gym and not remain on the computer all day. Additionally, if you intend to spend time with your family, how can the computer prevent you from doing so? You should already be aware of your responsibilities, and I do not believe the computer would cause you to forget such things. Hence, it would be the individual's fault if they forget, not the computer's. In conclusion, computers do not deter people from other activities because it is their responsibility to remember their tasks, not the computer's, and there are numerous distractions other than computers. However, it is still not the computer's fault; it is yours.
923	925	1	1	To Whom It @MONTH1 Concerns, I was at home when I realized that this situation must cease! The computer business has estranged my mother and step - father from me. I mean, when they are on Facebook, they seem to be in an entirely different universe. The family spends absolutely no time together. Moreover, they argue, do not get enough sleep, and once again, we do not spend any time in each other's company! Not spending time with family is not beneficial. Social interaction is advantageous for everyone. Even if the time is not spent with family, socialization plays a crucial role in our lives. Conversely, arguing is not. Arguing merely reduces the amount of social time spent. In my family, arguing creates such friction that we become anti - social and turn to the computer. Now, if we are arguing about the computer, we have a significant problem. The arguing will never end! However, the lack of sleep is my greatest concern. When they stay up all night on that foolish device, oh, goodness, I can't even begin to describe it. I believe they do not have productive days during school. In fact, I know they do not because they are exhausted. Computers cause my parents to squander family time, engage in disputes, and lose sleep. They spend more time on the personal computer than they should. @CITY1 @PERSON1, I believe we have a very serious problem.
924	926	1	1	I am of the opinion that people allocate an excessive amount of time to computers. If individuals spend hours on the computer, it will lead to impaired eyesight. They do not engage in sufficient physical exercise. Most teenagers are failing to complete their homework due to this @CAPS1. When people sit in front of the computer for countless hours, their eyesight gradually deteriorates. The intense brightness of the screen renders their vision unclear. It is said that more people lose their eyesight from looking at a computer than from staring at a light. When sitting in front of the screen, one does not engage in any physical activity. One mainly moves only their hands and fingers. If people do not exercise for at least @NUM1 minutes a day, we will all become weak. Lastly, teenagers are likely not to do their homework. When they are in their rooms, they are most likely on the computers. If they spend too much time on the computer, they are more likely to fail their classes, which means they will probably repeat a grade. In other words, people spend too much time on the computer. If we continue this trend, most people will lose their eyesight. If people keep sitting in front of the computer, we will become unhealthy. And finally, more teenagers will neglect their homework and will not achieve success.
925	927	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I concur with some professionals who believe that computers prevent people from exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some individuals consider it fashionable to be on the computer @NUM1 @NUM2. The reality is that a computer with internet access is like having @CAPS1 at one's fingertips, along with distractions and more. Nowadays, one can find almost anything on the internet. Some people use the internet for doing homework. Sometimes, people can find the exact answers to an assignment. This indicates that they are becoming more reliant on technology. If the world becomes increasingly dependent on computers and the like, it could have far - reaching consequences. The world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to attempt to halt @ORGANIZATION2. Instead of taking action, most people will be on the computer. People are becoming increasingly indolent these days. As I have stated, most people are becoming more and more lazy because all they need to do to have fun is sit with minimal movement. Consequently, people are neglecting to exercise and eat a balanced diet. They are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of texting or @CAPS2 someone, try calling them. Or perhaps, when you are free, you can make plans to visit your family. All I ask is that you, in particular, spend time with your family because you can always make new friends or acquire a new computer, but you cannot replace your family.
926	928	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am firmly convinced that computers bestow substantial benefits upon society. Personally, I own a computer, which holds immense significance and utility for me. In our town, over @PERCENT1 of families possess at least one computer. Computers serve as an excellent repository of information. Moreover, they enable communication with individuals, regardless of their geographical distance. In my view, they are also highly convenient and user - friendly. Given these advantages, would you not concur with my perspective? Computers are an outstanding source of information. Unlike books, which require effort to locate and purchase, a vast amount of information is accessible with a mere mouse click. Through computers, one can acquire knowledge about distant places and people without the need for physical visits or direct conversations. Let me draw a comparison with a book. Suppose you wished to conduct research on @PERSON1. You would have to visit the library and search for a relevant book. And what if you failed to find one? With a computer, you could enter ""@CAPS2 of @PERSON1"" into a search engine and obtain a wealth of information within a minute. I cherish time - saving, and computers facilitate this. They also enrich the information I utilize. Another remarkable advancement in computer technology is the ability to communicate with others, regardless of their location. Email is significantly faster than letter - writing and obviates the need for costly travel. Who would not appreciate that? Computers are extremely convenient. You can browse the internet, communicate with people, and perform numerous other tasks from the comfort of your bedroom. There are jobs that can be accomplished from home using a computer, eliminating the need to commute. My uncle is one such individual. He is a stockbroker and manages his entire job from the computer in his residence. It is a convenient and well - remunerated occupation. I inquired about his opinion of his job, and he stated, ""I adore my job because I can work at my preferred time and from the comfort of my home."" Would you not desire to have his job? I certainly would. In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial to us. Did you know that computers were initially invented by @ORGANIZATION1 to perform lengthy calculations? Observe what they have evolved into by @DATE1. They provide us with information at astonishing speeds, enable us to communicate with people worldwide, and are extremely convenient. These are significant boons to society, and everyone should embrace computers."
927	929	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I opine that computers exert a positive influence on individuals as they facilitate interaction, learning, and coordination. Through computers, one can interact with distant friends or make new acquaintances. When friends are far away, it is an ideal means to exchange photos and keep abreast of each other's well - being. Family is a crucial aspect in the context of computers; if you have not seen a family member, you can discern their life progress. Alternatively, you can meet new people, thereby expanding your social connections and building trust with more individuals. Learning is a valuable pursuit for both adults and children. Computers can educate children by introducing them to new words, colors, shapes, and sizes. For adults, they can reveal the meanings of words or present new vocabulary. All these elements of learning, such as words, colors, and sizes, can be found on a computer. Computers not only have a mental impact but also a physical one, particularly on coordination. Typing on a computer can strengthen your hands, which play a vital role in daily life. Sitting upright in a computer chair throughout the day can enhance your posture. Prolonged sitting can straighten your back. Focusing on the computer screen can also improve your concentration. It is true that some people recognize the benefits of computers. However, there are also those who hold negative views.
928	930	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have both positive and negative impacts on people. Some individuals spend their entire day idly playing games, exhibiting a lack of productivity. In contrast, others utilize computers for essential tasks. Additionally, some people rely on computers for their occupations. I concur that individuals who spend excessive time in front of computers engage in less physical exercise. Would you prefer to play games all day rather than spending quality time with family and friends? I certainly would not; I would much rather be outdoors with friends or having a family picnic at a park or lake. However, for many others, the situation is quite different. Some people depend on computers and other technological advancements in their daily lives. Many contemporary jobs necessitate the use of computers; for instance, bank employees use computers throughout the day. I also observe that students rely on computers for their academic work. A large number of students type up reports and conduct research on their computers. The internet serves as an excellent resource for students. For me, the internet has been invaluable for school projects and simple tasks like looking up a word. I can understand why some people are indifferent to technological advancements or computers. Some individuals have no need for them, and others may think that people are overly reliant on them. Personally, I find computers useful as I can communicate online with my family in @LOCATION1. I hope you appreciate my perspective on computers. Remember, they are beneficial to some, but not to all.
929	931	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and individuals of all ages in this society are overly preoccupied with the latest technology. One device that is significantly influencing people's lives is the computer. We must break this habit and engage in diverse activities! People are allocating excessive time to computers and less time enjoying nature, exercising, and interacting with friends and family. I urge you to concur with me as I address how the computer is encroaching upon our lives. Is time slipping by unnoticed? Are you overwhelmed by how swiftly life passes? If so, halt the computer - induced frenzy and venture outdoors! You are missing out on the beauty of nature. Nature is as enchanting as a magnificent scene of @CAPS3 @CAPS4, where there are oceans with pink sand. Who would want to forgo such a sight? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 lament that they rarely savor the experiences that life offers outside their homes. Consider this: you won't be able to witness the spectacular changing of the seasons without stepping outdoors. ""@CAPS5 expressed her desire for her daughter, @CAPS6, to experience the diverse wonders of nature as she grows older."" However, I would add that if @CAPS6 does not divert her attention from the computer screen, she will have limited exposure to nature. Yes, computers are highly intelligent and offer numerous functions. But if you choose to miss out on the discovery of new trees every day, that is your choice. @PERCENT2 of the population in the @LOCATION2 is overweight due to the introduction of technology into our lives, with the computer having the most significant impact. Renowned physicians attempt to educate parents at an early stage to encourage their children to engage in sports and exercise rather than staying home to play video games. Now, I ask you, would you prefer to engage in a healthy workout and have abundant energy or gradually accumulate health issues while surfing the internet? I recall on @DATE1, I laced up my Nike high - tops, grabbed my pink iPod, and began jogging at a leisurely pace while listening to my favorite song. Naturally, I felt invigorated upon completing my run. Regular jogging is as beneficial as consuming a banana, @NUM1 apples, and cheese every morning; they are all healthy choices. ""@CAPS8 @PERSON1 informed the press, 'Since technology became a part of my life, my two daughters have not visited their grandparents in over @NUM1 years! This situation must change!'"" Although computers have ""online - talking"" tools like @CAPS9, if you never spend quality time with family, it is a detrimental habit. On @DATE3, @DATE2, my brother and I were so engrossed in the computer that we missed a family birthday party. We are addicted to this device and need to spend more time with our loved ones. @PERCENT3 of all therapy cases indicate that computers have plunged @CAPS2 into depression due to the excessive time spent on them and the lack of bonding with family members. Who would prefer to play on an old, gray computer when they could have enjoyable conversations about their day and life with their family? It is a definite no! What will you choose? Do you agree that computers are taking over our lives? If you attempt to refute my claim, just remember that nature offers numerous benefits, and many people are missing out. Technology is disrupting people's exercise habits, and families are bonding less. The choice is yours; ensure the well - being of the population in @LOCATION1."
930	932	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, a segment of @CAPS2 individuals contends that the drawbacks of computers outweigh their advantages. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that computers offer far more assistance than harm. Although there are a few minor instances where computers have had adverse effects on people, there are significantly more occurrences in which they have been beneficial to @CAPS2 individuals. There are cases where accident victims recover with the aid of computers. Similarly, computers also enable close family members or friends to communicate with each other via the @CAPS3. Moreover, people can acquire knowledge about remarkable places. Thus, computers are of utmost importance to us. Computers are vital as they enhance our reflexes. In my capacity as a computer engineer, I have learned that engaging with a computer can assist victims of accidents that have damaged their reflexes. A computer helps the victim by providing a better perception of their surroundings. The victim can precisely observe their actions, and so can their doctors. Similar to physical treatment, computers can also offer relief. As a result, the patient becomes stronger both physically and mentally. Therefore, computers improve human life by enhancing reflexes. In addition to enhancing reflexes, computers, in conjunction with the @CAPS3, facilitate connections between people who are geographically separated. One notable example is the connection between soldiers and their families. During my military service, nothing was more comforting than communication. The simplest way to achieve this was through the @CAPS3, which brought me great solace. Likewise, computers enable us to explore amazing places. For instance, when a @NUM1 - year - old boy visits a website that details the wonders of the @LOCATION1 rainforest, he then shares this information with his science class, who in turn spread the message about forest preservation. Subsequently, the boy grows up to become an explorer of the @LOCATION1, discovering new species. All of this is made possible because of his interaction with a computer. Computers allow us to perceive the unseen. In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial when used appropriately. They aid in the recovery of victims, enable soldiers to connect with their families, and inspire the youth. Computers are an indispensable source of knowledge and progress for humanity.
931	933	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I opine that computers are detrimental to society. There are three reasons for this stance, as follows: Firstly, individuals fail to allocate sufficient time for their families. Secondly, one may misspell words when using instant messaging. When engaged in homework, one can easily be distracted by the computer. The primary reason computers are adverse to society is that people do not spend an adequate amount of time with their families; I am a case in point. I spend at least half of my day fixated on a screen, while I could be outdoors walking my dog with friends. Moreover, instant messaging is highly addictive. When I type, I use abbreviations for words. A professor at @LOCATION1 states that at least @PERCENT1 of students spell abbreviated words in tests. For instance, if one wishes to spell “what,” @PERCENT1 of them would spell “@CAPS2.” Finally, my last reason for believing computers are not beneficial to society is that they can cause significant distraction. I am well - aware of this because I am drawn into the world of computers. Whenever I do my homework, I cannot keep my eyes off the screen. This clearly demonstrates that computers are not good for society. In conclusion, computers prevent you from spending time with your family, lead students to misspell words, and distract you from doing your homework. I hope you concur with me on this.
932	934	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly contend that computers exert positive influences on individuals and society. My justifications are that one can learn and discover novel information on any subject, communicate with people in distant locations, and acquire skills applicable in the future. I shall now elaborate on these reasons in greater detail. Firstly, browsing the internet and utilizing search engines facilitates learning and information - gathering on any topic of interest. On the internet, one can pose questions and likely receive answers. One may even utilize computer - based information for reports; statistics indicate that @PERCENT1 of people conducting reports source their facts from the internet. Search engines like Google, Yahoo, and others have piqued children's interest in learning. Additionally, using a computer enables communication with individuals from far - flung places or friends one hasn't seen in a while. One can even engage in webcam conversations. I recall a few weeks ago, when my best friend relocated to Florida, and now we webchat daily! Online communication can also reduce telephone bills. Chatting online incurs no cost, whereas international telephone calls are expensive. Computers allow you to converse with your best friend while saving money. Last but not least, computers impart skills that can be utilized later in life. Currently, many jobs require computer proficiency, and technology is advancing rapidly. Before long, one will have to know how to operate a computer. Moreover, a computer is likely necessary in college. Professor @CAPS2 even remarked, “Every single student in my courses owns some type of computer.” In college, one takes notes and completes assignments, and using computers simplifies these tasks and eases one's life. As is evident, I believe computers significantly benefit people and society. My reasons are the ability to learn and find information, communicate with distant individuals, and the acquisition of useful life skills. Technology is evolving, and we will inevitably have to use computers sooner or later.
933	935	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, Are computers truly as excellent as they appear? It seems to me that they are overused in people's lives, and they serve as distractions that impede people from accomplishing certain tasks that they would otherwise do if not constantly engrossed in the computer. People's lives are increasingly centered around using the computer, checking Facebook, and watching new videos on @CAPS2.com. From personal experience, I know that Facebook or MySpace can be extremely addictive. I've spent hours commenting on pictures or wall posts, only to realize at @NUM1 pm that I haven't even started my extensive homework. This occurs frequently, and I often stay awake until around @NUM2. The following morning, I wake up at @NUM3 am, utterly exhausted. I'm not exaggerating; this happens to many of my friends. If you have children, ask them because I'm @PERCENT1 certain they're on Facebook or @CAPS3 all night. This isn't limited to kids; my mom just joined Facebook and is even more hooked than I am. Sometimes, it becomes a competition to see who has the most pictures or friends. Kids start adding strangers as friends. Computers aren't just distractions; they're also highly dangerous. At my school, we had an assembly demonstrating how easily one's personal information can be obtained. Even if you don't list your address or phone number, there are numerous ways to track you down. If you take a picture after winning a championship soccer game in your jersey, that single picture reveals your team name, last name, and number. Anyone could search for this information online and know your next game's location. As the local newspaper @CAPS1, I'm sure you're concerned about the town's safety or your own children. Some people in @MONTH1 say, “That would never happen to me,” but it could, especially if you're constantly on your computer. I've noticed that many teens my age are becoming obsessed with being on the computer. In families, instead of spending time together, siblings fight over computer access. One sibling in @MONTH1 needs it for homework, while the other wants to chat with friends on @CAPS3, and each believes they're entitled to it. Computers are negatively impacting people's lives. They're distracting, dangerous, and harm families. Computers harm society more than they help. You should monitor how much time your kids spend on the computer.
934	936	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 newspaper, I believe that computers present both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, they cause some people to stay indoors more than usual. On the other hand, they enable communication with long - unseen family members, the search for upcoming events and their cancellation status, and the retrieval of other information such as movie showtimes. Computers are also integral to school; without them, studying would be challenging, and many teachers' assignments require computer use. However, there are also drawbacks to computers. For example, my friend spends most of the day playing video games on his computer. When he's on the computer, he ignores everyone, including his parents. He rarely goes downstairs for dinner, and when he does, he has his laptop beside him. His parents grew weary of this and confiscated his TV and laptop to encourage him to play outside with friends. After some time, he started going outside frequently, especially on nice days. They later returned his computer and TV, and now he only uses them on rainy days.
935	937	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, an increasing number of people in our proud and valiant country of @LOCATION1 have been relying on computers. Computers were designed to simplify complex situations, such as typing, information - finding, and maintaining financial records. Despite their primary functions, many @CAPS3 citizens have been using computers for non - essential purposes, resulting in a neglect of activities crucial for a healthy, social life. These activities include exercise and spending time with family and friends. Please continue reading so that you, the @CAPS4, can comprehend why computer usage has spiraled out of control and relay my message to your readers. One aspect of a healthy life is exercise. In the era of modern computers, exercise remains the cornerstone of well - being. Personally, I know at least several young children in my school who are victims of the cruel disease of obesity. The cause of this among children is straightforward—they overuse computers and disregard the natural limits of usage. Practically every day, these unfortunate children start using their computers from the moment they return home until they fall asleep. This excessive number of hours reduces the time available for exercise, causing their bodies to adapt to a sedentary lifestyle of sleeping, eating, and using the computer. This sedentary behavior makes these children targets of bullying for being overweight, yet they lack the strength to defend themselves as they have no muscle power. Thus, overusing computers can lead to overweight children with no exercise and no means of self - defense. Another reason computers are negatively affecting @LOCATION1's youth is the lack of quality time spent with others. Every day, I choose to walk home from school to enjoy the sounds of nature, regardless of the weather. I hope you understand the importance of spending time with friends and family, yet people who abuse computer usage fail to recognize this. Around two years ago, I was constantly on the computer, primarily playing video games and engaging in various computer - related activities. For about a year, I came home and immediately started using the computer, as if in a trance. This led to a loss of time spent with my family. Moreover, when I needed to contact friends, I simply messaged them instead of having in - person conversations. As a result, both my family and friends grew distant due to this electronic device, the computer. Fortunately, I've changed now. However, I hope you see the negative side of computers and how they can cause you to lose your family and friends. In conclusion, @ORGANIZATION1 assures you that based on all the information about the adverse effects of computer overuse, hopefully, you will approach the editorial board of @CAPS1 of our newspaper and demand a column on how computers cause you to lose valuable time for exercise, nature, and family & friends. Thank you for reading this letter, and I will write an article related to this subject.
936	938	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a denizen of the tech generation, an era in which technology has assumed a novel significance—life itself. Our existence orbits around technology, much as the @LOCATION3 revolves around the sun. The preeminent technological preference, computers, is eminently beneficial, contrary to the speculations of many, and aids us in thriving within this arduous world. If you wish to disparage computers, by all means, proceed. However, if you do so without first considering all aspects, you, my friend, have no valid stance on the matter. You might claim they are a nuisance, yet you likely have never used one properly. You could argue they can be used to detonate bombs, but let's be pragmatic. How many ordinary individuals wake up, contemplate the dreariness of life, and then input a command to detonate a bomb? A significant benefit you have evidently chosen to overlook is the invaluable information it adeptly presents on a @NUM1 - inch screen. You can peruse book reviews, read books, purchase items, and access the latest news, to name but a few of its potential merits. Moreover, not everything you deem bad is necessarily so just because you say it is. When you think of @CAPS3, do you always envision vulgar, inappropriate pictures, and illegal images? That's amusing, as @CAPS3 facilitates family connections, provides activities for people, and keeps friends in different states connected on the same platform. YouTube is not solely filled with profanity and poor - quality videos. My family casts actors for shows, and one way they assess an actor's capabilities is by visiting their channel and viewing their created videos. My mother even contacts actors in videos to gauge their interest in becoming professionals. This is about scouting talent where it is scarce. Lastly, did you even consider that computers are employed to establish companies and save lives? You probably were unaware that astronomers monitor images of the universe captured by the Hubble Space Telescope using a computer, and meteorologists track cloud formations from satellites via a computer. Perhaps you neglected to mention that surgeons can direct operations from their office in @LOCATION1 on a patient in @LOCATION2. You also failed to note that seismologists use computers to track the movement of tectonic plates to determine the epicenter of a major earthquake. You simply didn't know. So, let's face it, computers are essential. You probably used one to conduct whatever limited research you did. In fact, forgive me. You probably didn't conduct the research at all; instead, you unjustly pointed fingers at the innocent. Clever move, buddy.
937	939	1	1	I opine that possessing a computer is advantageous as it enables you to conduct research and interact with people through communication. Computers are of great significance to society as they assist in maintaining records such as doctor appointments and criminal records for law enforcement to reference. Owning a computer is beneficial; however, excessive usage can be detrimental to your eyesight. A computer can facilitate communication with friends who have relocated, offering platforms like MySpace, Facebook, or Yahoo Chat. In life, a computer is highly useful and can contribute in numerous domains. Nevertheless, computers can also pose problems, such as excessive usage leading to insufficient sleep for school. Additionally, sitting too close to the computer or spending excessive time on it can harm your eyes and necessitate the use of glasses. In my view, moderation is key, so I believe that spending a reasonable amount of time on the computer is beneficial. Do you concur?
938	940	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I dissent because the availability of computers may prompt children to engage in negative behaviors, such as being discourteous, disobedient, boisterous, and neglecting their homework. Allow me to elucidate the reasons for my disagreement. I am aware that when I am on the computer, my mother checks on me every @NUM1 minutes because there are inappropriate contents on the computer that children might access. One can never be certain; they could potentially learn harmful acts just by using the computer. I admit that I become impolite and disrespectful when I am engrossed in the computer, as my attention is completely fixated on it. That is why restrictions should be imposed on computer usage, as it can easily distract one's attention. While on the computer, I often ignore my mother's instructions. When she tells me to get off, I retort with ""@CAPS1"" and insist on being left alone because I am focused on the computer. Moreover, I keep the computer volume high so that no one can divert my attention, as my primary focus is the computer, and I postpone other tasks. I even forget what is happening around me when I am on the computer. Regarding schoolwork, I often tell my mother that I need to use the computer to do my homework, but instead, I engage in other activities. When my mother questions me, I claim to have finished my homework even though I know I haven't, simply because my attention is on the computer. These are the reasons why society should reevaluate the unrestricted use of computers. I hope you understand the rationale behind my stance, as society should have been more cautious about distributing computers in the first place. If you have a child and they have made similar statements, you now know that they have been untruthful. I am only allowed to use the computer for @NUM2 minutes each day. Therefore, it is advisable to limit computer access."
939	941	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, the question of whether @CAPS1 computers benefit our society has been a vigorously debated topic among the citizens of our town. While many contend that computers offer rapid and effortless communication, support learning for both children and adults, and even instill a sense of balance in our generation, I firmly assert that computers are indispensable in our society. ""@CAPS2, @CAPS3! I miss you!"" are the words uttered by @ORGANIZATION1's @NUM1 - year - old @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been working overseas in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 for two years. For @PERSON1, one of the few means of contacting her father is through @ORGANIZATION3. Communication is of utmost importance in our society as it strengthens the bonds between families and friends. Computers offer a diverse range of communication forms, including @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS5, and instant messaging. ""@ORGANIZATION3"" enables what can be described as a ""visual phone conversation."" A tearful @PERSON2 remarks, ""@CAPS4 since @CAPS7 wife passed away, @CAPS7 daughter has been @CAPS7 sole companion. With @ORGANIZATION3, I can not only hear her voice daily but also see her face, which always brings a smile to my face."" @CAPS5 and instant messaging also provide our society with swift and convenient communication. Invitations, announcements, and simple greetings can all be conveyed via @CAPS5. Thus, computers play a crucial role in facilitating communication in our society. Have you ever witnessed the expression of a child when they learn something new? Computers offer an outstanding array of educational resources in our society. For instance, toddlers and children can utilize programs like @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS6). @CAPS6 programs instruct children in reading, writing, and speaking. ""@CAPS7 child used @CAPS6 when he was a toddler,"" says @PERSON3, a resident of @LOCATION1. ""Now, his teachers are highly impressed by his reading and writing skills, and I couldn't be prouder."" Computers are not limited to teaching children; they also educate adults. Did you know that adults acquire @PERCENT1 of their knowledge about the environment, politics, and other fundamental information from the computer? Computers are essential for promoting learning in our society. Finally, computers teach the art of balance. A mother from @LOCATION1 states, ""@CAPS7 teenager @PERSON4 has learned to balance computer use with real - life activities, and I can clearly observe how this skill extends to other aspects of balance."" When teenagers learn to manage their computer time, they also learn to balance extracurricular activities at school. This indicates that students actually develop a sense of responsibility through the use of computers. I hope that our society will recognize the necessity of computers. Given that they facilitate communication, provide education, and assist children in learning balance, what do we have to lose? Computers can undoubtedly enhance our society."
940	942	1	1	"Dear local newspaper committee, I am writing to bring to your attention a substantial dilemma regarding computer use. Based on the data I have gathered, computers have both merits and demerits. However, I believe that there are more compelling ""arguments against"" computer use. In my view, computers are highly addictive, leading to a lack of exercise and a deterioration of one's social environment. Although computers may seem helpful, they are merely one way to conduct research, and books remain a viable alternative. The prevalence of computer use has reached a critical level due to its addictive nature. For example, the well - known platform ""@CAPS2"" is a place for social interaction. When a child has access to @CAPS2 and is supposed to be doing homework on the computer, there is a @PERCENT1 probability that they will end up on @CAPS2 instead of completing their homework. This significant finding was discovered at an @ORGANIZATION1 on @DATE1. Computers are also addictive because of online games. While these games can be entertaining, they are a waste of electricity and serve no productive purpose for children. In terms of @CAPS2 and online games, computers are extremely addictive. Although computers have some benefits, they are detrimental to health. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of the population in @LOCATION1 has gained weight due to video games and computer use? Over time, excessive computer use leads to weight gain as it reduces the time spent on physical activity and fitness. This is also related to addiction, as long - term computer use becomes a habit. In conclusion, computers pose a hazard to physical fitness. When it comes to friendships, computers are equally problematic. Friends are those with whom we spend time and interact. However, excessive computer use makes us believe that computers are all we need. Eventually, our friends will drift away as we neglect them, and this is also a consequence of addiction. Addiction to computers damages our social environment. Although computers may seem ""fun,"" they are ultimately harmful to our social lives. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a waste because they are addictive, make us unhealthy, and damage our social environment. The facts I have presented support my stance. Computers are not the ideal solution, so consider using books instead."
941	943	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, computers serve as an indispensable asset for every household. In today's fast - paced world, having a computer at home simplifies daily life. It can be employed for research, organization, and business affairs. I am at a loss as to how I could manage without one. Education holds paramount importance, especially in our contemporary economy. The computer streamlines work and study, making them more efficient and straightforward. When conducting school research, upon turning on the computer, an inexhaustible repository of information awaits. While one can obtain information from books and encyclopedias, it is often impractical to visit a local library due to time constraints. Moreover, when faced with a school project that requires typing, having a home computer eliminates the need to rely on limited resources. This allows for more time to seek additional guidance from teachers @CAPS3 regarding musical instruments in the school band. I am certain that my academic performance would suffer if I lacked access to the internet of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 at home. Have you ever lost a document? Owning a computer enables you to create backups. Imagine writing a five - page essay; the process may seem tedious, but it is worthwhile when it saves hours of writing. For some, a computer can be a source of income. Who wouldn't desire additional earnings? One can operate an online business, circumventing the challenges and expenses associated with maintaining a @CAPS8. Running a business from one's own space or building can be both costly and time - consuming. Additionally, online shopping eliminates the need for store visits, with items delivered directly to your doorstep, saving both time and money on gas. In today's economy, any means of saving money is valuable. A computer can enhance education, facilitate organization, and save money. While it also offers recreational benefits, its practical utility in daily life is undeniable. And surely, it is perfectly acceptable to chat with friends online occasionally, isn't it?
942	944	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I opine that an increasing number of individuals are turning to computers as they can be instrumental in job - hunting, particularly in the face of job losses. Currently, certain industries are experiencing economic decline, leaving parents unable to support their loved ones due to unemployment. Additionally, the escalating prices of cars make online purchasing an attractive option for those on a budget. Online platforms offer cars and trucks at competitive prices, enabling significant savings. Furthermore, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals have a penchant for traveling to distant destinations such as @CAPS2 or @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. When visiting these places, accommodation and dining are essential. A well - appointed hotel with excellent cuisine, comfortable beds, and recreational facilities like pools can enhance the vacation experience. Moreover, if parents insist on sending their children to a public school, but the children have reservations based on hearsay, online resources can help identify alternative educational institutions. Schools such as @CAPS4, cap pre, classicle, and brizzal are renowned for their quality education and offer a fulfilling learning environment. In conclusion, the multifaceted benefits of computers, from job - seeking to travel planning and education, make them an indispensable tool in modern life. Embracing technology can empower individuals to navigate various aspects of life more effectively.
943	945	1	1	Dear Newspaper, in my perspective, computers exert a profoundly positive influence on individuals. They facilitate learning about remote locations, enable online communication, and even assist in job - hunting. These factors collectively underscore the positive impact of computers. Undoubtedly, computers serve as a gateway to knowledge about far - flung destinations. For instance, if someone intends to visit @LOCATION1, they can conduct in - depth research, learn the local language, purchase tickets, and discover captivating attractions in that country. These capabilities highlight the computer as a valuable technological asset. Another compelling reason for the positive influence of computers is their role in enabling online communication. This feature helps maintain family connections and allows individuals to reconnect with old friends, as exemplified by platforms like Facebook. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to forge new friendships. These aspects further illustrate the positive nature of computers. Lastly, computers play a crucial role in the professional sphere. They aid in job - searching, support job - related tasks, and can even contribute to career advancement. These benefits emphasize the importance and positive impact of computers on individuals. In conclusion, the ability of computers to facilitate online communication, impart knowledge about distant places, and support career development firmly establishes them as an outstanding and positive technology. The numerous advantages they offer make them an indispensable part of modern life.
944	946	1	1	According to the @ORGANIZATION1 government, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 spend @NUM1 hours or more on a computer daily. Research indicates that this excessive computer usage is associated with a lack of physical activity, limited family interaction, and a diminished quality of life. Currently, individuals are more inclined to be on the computer than engage in other activities. As computer usage has increased, the level of physical exercise among these individuals has declined. Consequently, @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 have become obese due to their sedentary computer - based lifestyles. Consider the case of @CAPS6, who was once fit and healthy. A friend introduced him to a website within the @CAPS5, and within @NUM2 minutes, his life changed. After @NUM1 months of excessive computer use, accompanied by a diet of junk food, the formerly fit @CAPS6 became obese. When @DATE1 arrived, @CAPS7 attempted to join the school baseball team but failed due to being out of shape. Subsequently, @CAPS7 reverted to a healthy lifestyle of proper nutrition and exercise and is now in good physical condition for any sport. Moreover, excessive computer use has led to a decrease in family time. Many occupations require individuals to be on the computer, causing them to lose sight of what truly matters. A few years ago, @CAPS6 had a crucial championship game. Despite repeated reminders to his father, the father was absent from the game. @CAPS6 searched the crowd in vain, and after the game, he was deeply disappointed. His team lost the game, and since then, his father has reduced computer usage and now attends all his games. Finally, people are sacrificing their enjoyment of life by choosing to be on the computer rather than engaging in activities they love. One @CAPS6, who used to play basketball regularly with friends, declined invitations after becoming engrossed in the computer. When he tried out for the @CAPS8 school team, he failed due to lack of practice. After this setback, he returned to playing basketball. In conclusion, the excessive use of computers has detrimental effects on physical health, family relationships, and overall life enjoyment. It is imperative to strike a balance between computer use and other aspects of life.
945	947	1	1	Dear Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has an essay on plants due for science tomorrow. Having been absent on @DATE1, she was unaware of the assignment. If she had access to a computer, she could visit the relevant website to check, but unfortunately, the town has removed them. Another student, @LOCATION1, is working on the same essay. Her poor handwriting may impede the teacher's ability to assess it. What should they do? Despite the view of some that computers are detrimental to society, the majority recognize that life without them would be a catastrophe. The authorities in New @CAPS1 are currently contemplating removing computers from the town, which would pose significant challenges for everyone. Firstly, computers are essential for accessing information through search engines such as Google and Yahoo. They also serve as a means of communication via platforms like Facebook and AIM. Removing computers would have a profound impact on daily life. Society relies on computers to obtain information. Whenever I encounter a knowledge gap, I turn to the internet. Without this resource, my homework would lack the depth and detail that a computer provides. Moreover, during the earthquake in @LOCATION2, people were able to access information within seconds, leading to numerous bake sales and fund - raisers. Additionally, when kids miss their favorite @CAPS2 shows, they can catch up the next day, which is an important aspect of teenage life. Secondly, the internet is widely used for communication. In my family, email is the linchpin that holds our plans together. My mother organizes her schedule via email and even emails herself from work to remember important tasks. Without it, our family would struggle to function. Facebook is another popular communication platform. My friends and I use it to discuss daily events, eliminating the need for phone calls. AIM, a messaging tool with video - chatting capabilities, allows us to interact with friends in real - time and share items like outfits. Both teenagers and adults rely on computers for communication. In conclusion, society depends on computers to access information and communicate with friends and colleagues. Therefore, the idea of removing computers from the town should be firmly dismissed.
946	948	1	1	"I am elated as I have just completed my school report on @PERSON1 without even having to leave my residence. I was able to engage in a dialogue with my classmate and pose inquiries to her online. Moreover, I managed to acquire all the necessary information solely from my computer. Additionally, I learned how to row a boat to demonstrate to my class how @LOCATION1 crossed the @CAPS1 river. I achieved this by enrolling in an online course. This is a prime example of how computers exert remarkable effects on individuals in their daily lives. Local research indicates that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 planning their vacations utilize the internet. The rationale behind these citizens' internet usage is to obtain information about hotels and vacation destinations. This is one way in which computers prove to be beneficial and positive devices, as it simplifies the process for busy @CAPS2 to prepare for a trip by perusing online hotel pictures and gathering all the requisite information. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS4 university states, ""Computers now offer programs enabling busy @CAPS2 to acquire a new skill. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 currently utilize this software."" In modern times, @CAPS2 often lack the time to venture out and join a group or class to learn new skills. This is precisely why computers are so invaluable, and people simply adore them. Instead of leaving home, they can engage in activities such as cooking, practicing yoga, or learning a new language, all from the comfort of their home computer. This is yet another reason why computers are highly useful in numerous positive ways. Imagine forgetting your homework at school and being unable to secure an A in that class. Thanks to computers, forgetful students can communicate with a classmate online to obtain the homework and complete it. Alternatively, they can utilize the internet to access the school website, locate the homework, and print it out. Many students across the country occasionally forget their homework, but with the assistance of computers, they can effortlessly resolve their issues. To summarize, students or adults can retrieve information from the internet for projects or even vacations. Busy @CAPS2 who lack the time to leave their homes can take a class or learn a new skill directly on the computer. Anyone can use the internet to communicate or chat online to obtain schoolwork or connect with long - distance friends. This is why the impact of computers on people is entirely positive. Now, what can you do? It is crucial that computers remain an integral part of our lives. They are helpful, and we have grown accustomed to living with them, which is why they must stay. This benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers, ensuring the smooth operation of your business."
947	949	1	1	Numerous individuals within society hold the view that computers are detrimental; however, I firmly believe that computers are excellent. Computers facilitate communication with friends, family, and relatives. With a computer, one can complete homework at an accelerated pace, eliminating the need to visit the library for research. Computers also provide an outlet for releasing pent - up anger through digital means. Many experts, such as @ORGANIZATION1, are concerned that people will interact with strangers on websites like Facebook and MySpace. If parents carefully manage their children's presence on these websites and restrict profile access to friends only, the online experience will be significantly safer. Communications engineer @PERSON1 asserts that it is preferable for people to communicate online rather than not at all. I concur with his assessment because I have relatives in @LOCATION1 whom I cherish conversing with, yet they reside @NUM1 miles away, making communication challenging. However, after joining Facebook, it feels as though they are right next door. @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 points out that @PERCENT1 of strangers who are potential molesters or thugs target individuals who do not safeguard their profiles. Therefore, it is essential to protect your profile and ensure your safety. Computers are a superior alternative to visiting the library. This is because going to the library requires rounding up the children, getting in the car, and making the journey. With a computer, one can simply enter their office and conduct research, which saves money on gas. If you have a project, you can directly send it to your teacher. Currently, many so - called experts, such as those from @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2, are conducting rigged experiments. They claim that violence is caused by video games, but they use test subjects who are undesirable individuals. I have discovered that video games serve as an effective means of relieving stress accumulated throughout the day. Many of my friends share the same sentiment. Video games also stimulate cognitive thinking, which is another reason for their positive attributes. In conclusion, computers are truly excellent. They enable communication with friends and offer an avenue for releasing anger. What's not to love? Get a computer now!
948	950	1	1	Each year, the world experiences a greater degree of technological advancement. Technology offers positive assistance and benefits to all. Computers are an integral part of this positive technological landscape and undoubtedly contribute to the betterment of society. Computers enable us to explore places and things we have never encountered before and educate us about them. Additionally, computers have a positive influence on families, bringing them closer together. They also facilitate communication among people of various age groups, from adults long out of college to teenagers in high school, allowing them to connect with their friends. Thus, computers play a positive role in our lives, making it easier and more enjoyable. To commence, computers aid in the expansion of our knowledge. They enable us to quickly access facts and the latest news. For example, recently, the @DATE1 @CAPS1 event took place and usually lasted late into the night, preventing me from witnessing the entire competition. I was able to effortlessly search on the computer to find out who won which medals. Computers were instrumental in quickly providing this information, sparing me the need to wonder about the medal winners. Computers constantly assist us in expanding our knowledge. They help us gather facts for reports, research places we wish to visit, and learn about the advantages of owning a particular pet, with endless possibilities. Furthermore, computers strengthen family bonds. A family member might come across a funny video on YouTube or @ORGANIZATION1 and want the whole family to watch it. Moreover, as many stores now sell clothes online, mothers and daughters can sit together and shop without leaving home. In my family, we rent movies from @LOCATION1 on the computer, which brings us together when selecting a movie. It also creates an opportunity for a family movie night. As a result, these computer - related activities spark discussions within the family, providing a common topic that everyone can relate to and engage in. Another significant benefit of computers is their ability to unite people. There are numerous ways to communicate via computers today, such as Facebook, Twitter, email, AIM, and more. Although they differ in form, they share the common goal of bringing old and new friends together. For instance, my mother recently joined Facebook to reconnect with her high - school friends. She found an old friend she hadn't seen in years, which made her extremely happy. This demonstrates that computers are not only for meeting new people but also for rekindling old friendships.
949	951	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I concur with the experts who assert that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. There are several reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, individuals are not getting sufficient exercise. Secondly, new websites have emerged, piquing people's curiosity about how @CAPS1 operates. Thirdly, an increasing number of teenage children have access to the latest technology. They are constantly on @CAPS1 and fail to realize that they are neglecting to spend time with their families. Now that the reasons have been introduced, let's delve into the first one. Firstly, as people devote a substantial amount of time to the computer, they lack the time to venture outside and engage in physical activity. Many individuals may assume that they do not need to go outside, but in reality, it is essential for them to get their bodies moving and their blood flowing. Moreover, we do not always have to rely on the computer to find answers. It is relatively easy to find friends and engage in a game with them. We should seek alternative activities rather than solely playing games on the computer. Having discussed the first reason, let's move on to the second one. Secondly, the computer network has introduced novel concepts for the computer. The emergence of Facebook has led to a growing number of users. This trend indicates that people are less likely to go outside and play, and many children may neglect their homework. Parents should either set a time limit for computer use or restrict access. There is only a certain amount of time one can spend on the computer without getting bored. Now, let's proceed to the final reason. Thirdly, I would like to emphasize that people are spending more time on the computer than with their own families. The reason for this is that it is crucial to allocate quality time to family and friends instead of being glued to the computer @NUM1. We also need to stay informed about our daily lives. Additionally, our families are far more important than any computer game. We should go outside with our families and play a game of wiffle ball. In conclusion, you have read an essay highlighting how people spend excessive time on the computer instead of going outside for exercise, how new websites keep them engaged for longer periods, and how they neglect to spend enough time with their family and friends. It is vital to establish a time limit for computer use and get active. We should not be idle and spend all day on the computer. Instead, we should go out and spend time with our family and friends. I hope you share my viewpoint.
950	952	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I concur with the concerned experts, and I am certain that many others hold the same opinion. I am confident that as you continue reading, you will understand the rationale behind my agreement. Firstly, an excessive number of people are spending an inordinate amount of time communicating with friends online. I believe that once an online conversation commences, it should ideally be concluded through face - to - face interaction or a telephone call. While online communication is an excellent way to reconnect with friends and those we haven't seen in a long time, overindulgence can lead to problems. For example, it can give rise to rumors. In my opinion, when friends get overly excited online, they may start spreading rumors about others, which can quickly circulate among a large number of people. Another issue is online arguing, which can escalate into real - life conflicts, such as fights when back at school. Imagine turning on your computer and discovering that someone has been talking negatively about you or trying to pick a fight. Undoubtedly, you would not appreciate such an experience, and your feelings would be hurt. Secondly, excessive computer use can have a detrimental impact on most people's academic performance. Many individuals are returning home and immediately turning on their computers instead of doing their homework or studying. At my school, there are numerous students whose grades have declined due to excessive online activity. Eventually, many may face academic probation or even fail the school year. For instance, envision yourself as a parent receiving your child's report card and finding that they have all @CAPS1's or mostly @CAPS2's. You would not be pleased with such results. Finally, computers have contributed to the problem of bullying. A significant number of children are being bullied online, and they are suffering emotionally. The bullies seem to enjoy this behavior, while the victims feel sad and isolated, believing that no one cares about them. Bullying has led to severe consequences, including death. Imagine being a victim of bullying, with your feelings deeply hurt, and instead of confiding in an adult or a parent, you resort to self - harm. Consider the heartbreak of parents who discover that their child has been bullied to death. If you were one of those parents, you would undoubtedly be devastated. In conclusion, excessive online activity has a negative impact on everyone. We must be aware of these consequences and take steps to moderate our online usage.
951	953	1	1	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, the prevalence of computers is causing detrimental effects on individuals' lives. Excessive computer usage often leads to a significant reduction in physical activity, time spent in nature, and social interaction with family and friends. I firmly believe that the issue of computers overwhelming people's lives should be addressed seriously.  Exercise is an indispensable aspect of everyone's life. Since the advent of the internet forty years ago, the average body mass index of individuals has increased by fifteen percent. This is not a coincidence; computers are dissuading people from challenging themselves, such as running an extra mile or swimming an extra lap. Instead, they choose to stay at home and engage with their computers. This not only contributes to weight gain but also forces exercise equipment store owners to close their businesses due to the decline in customers who should be working out regularly.  Our children are also being negatively impacted by this addictive phenomenon. Childhood obesity is one of the primary consequences, as children often abandon physical activities in favor of video - games. The annual attendance at @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 used to be around @NUM1, but since the invention of the computer, it has dropped to @NUM2. Fewer people are enjoying the fresh air on @DATE1 and are instead spending time indoors. This not only harms people but also affects the surrounding wildlife. In @DATE2, the year the computer was invented, the ratio of squirrels to people in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was @NUM3. However, just ten years later, the situation has changed drastically, and there are fewer squirrels. This is because with fewer people feeding them, squirrels have to venture out to find food on their own. Tour guides in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 are being laid off as there is less demand for tours.  Family relationships are also suffering. Scientists conducted an experiment where three people read a book for an hour, another spent an hour on a computer, and a third spent three hours on a computer. They then measured how long each person could stay in a conversation with their mother. The person who read a book talked to their mother for twenty minutes, the one who spent an hour on the computer for ten minutes, and the one who spent three hours on the computer for only five minutes. This clearly shows that the more time spent on a computer, the less interaction there is between family members, which is crucial in anyone's life. Mothers worry that their children, like @PERSON1, will be in their rooms playing on the computer instead of participating in family events. @PERSON2 was selected to conduct an experiment on...
952	954	1	1	I ventured outside to retrieve the mail and the newspaper. On the front - page, there was a discussion about computers. An article pointed out the issue of excessive computer usage. Initially, I assumed that computer sales would decline, but the article stated that people are using computers more and exercising less.  I believe that people would not find it overly difficult to reduce their computer usage. I have a friend who was initially unfamiliar with computers. He used to spend his time playing outdoors. On @DATE1, he tried out for @CAPS1 baseball. He is an outstanding athlete and also excels academically.   Conversely, some unemployed individuals are not seeking productive activities. Instead, they spend their days in front of the computer when they should be doing household chores. People who own computers should not be as addicted as my friend's acquaintance, who uses the computer every time he returns from school. As a result, he fails to complete his homework on time. He often avoids going outside to exercise his mind or soak up some sun, and sometimes even skips meals. He should give his brain a break and engage in physical activities that are beneficial.  Computer workers should write to computer users, highlighting the potential for computer addiction. They should encourage users to be more conscious of their usage and to use computers primarily for educational purposes, such as gathering information and for college - related tasks. There is a person who started using the computer to chat with others and ended up spending excessive time on it, neglecting her college studies.  I am convinced that computers have a significant impact on people. People should seek enjoyment and sunlight rather than remaining glued to the computer all the time. It is mainly teenagers and children who are heavy computer users, while many adults use them less. People should visit the gym to build strong muscles and take breaks from using computers. Advocating against excessive computer use is the right course of action.
953	955	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2's perspective on computers is that they have a positive influence on individuals. I concur with this view because I know several people who manage to exercise while also using computers regularly. I do not consider computers to be a negative factor.  Some individuals utilize computers as a learning tool. They can learn how to exercise through online resources. Additionally, some people use computers to chat and learn about distant places that they can potentially visit and explore the beauty and nature. I firmly believe that computers have a profound and positive impact on people as they offer substantial assistance.  I know @CAPS2's uncle, who hails from @LOCATION1. He learned to speak English using the computer. He acquired a great deal of knowledge, and we were all extremely proud of him. The positive effects of computers on people are numerous. Many people take online classes. For instance, single mothers with children can obtain their diplomas and degrees through online courses on the computer. Moreover, other relatives like @CAPS2's aunts and uncles attend English classes online and work remotely. A large number of people are enrolled in online classes. I frequently visit @PERSON1. It not only provides an enjoyable experience but also offers educational benefits as it teaches me how to type.  I am of the opinion that all computers have positive effects on people, and there should not be a single computer that has a negative impact. However, this is merely @CAPS2's opinion. Computers are like intelligent tools that perform a multitude of tasks for us. We can type reports, learn, and read online. There are also online games that are both entertaining and educational.  I believe that computers offer an abundance of resources. One can search for a wide range of topics, such as mysteries, animals, nature, and places. The number of search results that a computer can generate is truly astonishing. Therefore, it is difficult to understand why anyone would think that computers have negative effects. All that @CAPS4 is trying to do is to assist us in our education. It even helps me with my @CAPS2 Spanish on occasion.  So, why would anyone consider computers to be a bad idea? Computers are excellent for a variety of purposes. I can check the weather forecast for tomorrow, stay updated with the news, and communicate with @CAPS2's teachers through the computer. I am certain that computers will always have a positive influence on people.
954	956	1	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, I am delighted to pen this letter to you. It has come to my notice that proponents of technological advancements believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals. I wholeheartedly concur with their view for several reasons. Firstly, computers enable seamless communication with family and friends via email, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and other digital platforms. Secondly, they serve as powerful research tools. Thirdly, they can provide directions and information about restaurants or places one wishes to visit. I will now elaborate on these three aspects in greater detail.  Computers facilitate communication with loved ones. For example, my friend Amor, with whom I was very close in third grade, had to relocate to @LOCATION1. I was heart - broken on the day he left. However, within a week, I received an email from him, and since then, we have been able to maintain our friendship. He visits @LOCATION2 every @DATE2, and we have a great time together. I hope to visit him in @LOCATION3 someday, but I will first need to conduct research on the place.  With a computer, one can conduct extensive research. This year, in our language @CAPS4 class, we read a true - story book titled ""My Brother @CAPS5 is Dead."" We were required to research the book, and thanks to computers, I was able to find detailed information on the website, including descriptions and directions. Directions are of utmost importance as they guide us to our destinations. I recall a time when I had to attend a friend's birthday party, but we were unsure of the location. I went online on @DATE1, obtained the directions, printed them out, and we reached the place in @NUM1 minutes. Without a computer, it would have been extremely challenging to find the house.  I understand that some may disagree with me, arguing that computers can host inappropriate websites and be addictive. However, I firmly believe that the benefits of computers far outweigh these potential drawbacks. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. In conclusion, computers are invaluable for learning and research."
955	957	1	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, I am deligted to write this letter to you. It has come to my attention that the people who support advances in tecnology believe that computers have a positive efffect on people. I agree with those people. I agree with them because one: you can communicate with your family and friends via email, via @CAPS2, via @CAPS3 ets. Number two: you can use a computer for research, and number three: it can tell you directions or give you info. on a resteraunt or place you want to go. I will now get into more detail on these three topics. You can communicate with your family or friends via computer. For example my friend amor, when we were best freinds and we were in third grade, he had to move to @LOCATION1. I cried the first day he moved. then the next week or so I got an email from him and so now we can keep in touch with each other. He comes & to @LOCATION2 every @DATE2 and we hangout with each other. Maybe one day, I will like to go visit him now In @LOCATION3 becasue he moved again, but I will have to do some research on @LOCATION3 first. With a computer you can research alot of things like this year our language @CAPS4 class read a book called ""my brother @CAPS5 is dead"" and it was a true story. Se we had to some research on the book and I found out that without computers how would I be able to research anything on the website it shared where everything , a description of the thing, and how to get there (diretions). Directions are very important. The show you how to get to a certain destination. You can get directions off a computer. I remember one year I had to go to my friends birthday party and we didn't know how to get there. So I went online on @DATE1 and we got the directions from there and we printed them out and we found the place in @NUM1 minutes. Without a computer we would have been able to find the house easily. You @MONTH1 disagree with me on this because a computer can have bad websites and can also became very addicting to some people, but I think I am right. Thank you for reading this letter, once again computers are good for the study!"
956	958	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, are you aware that computers can impede you from engaging in numerous activities? Instead of indulging in computer usage, you can engage in more physical exercise, partake in outdoor activities, and allocate more time to socializing with family and friends. This is precisely why you should curtail your computer time. Physical exercise is of utmost importance for your well - being, while computers are not. You can acquire some weights and exercise within the confines of your room. A jog along the beach also seems like an appealing option. By merely doing so, you can shed a substantial amount of weight instead of gaining it through sedentary computer use. Therefore, embark on an exercise regimen and lose weight as it is highly beneficial to you! Computers also prevent you from inhaling fresh air and enjoying outdoor play. When you are outdoors, you will discover that engaging in physical play far surpasses the mere act of pressing buttons and clicking aimlessly on the computer. You need not even engage in outdoor play; you can simply take a stroll with someone or sit on the grass and engage in conversation. The computer acts as an obstacle to all these enjoyable outdoor activities. Spending quality time with your family is a significant activity that your computer is preventing you from undertaking. You spend an hour on the computer while your family is having a barbecue. Once you finally disengage from the computer, you will realize that spending time with them is infinitely more enjoyable than sitting and staring at the screen. This is why computers serve as a distraction to everyone, as they discourage you from exercising, playing outdoors, or spending time with your family. You can utilize the computer, but refrain from excessive usage as you are missing out on the fun.
957	959	1	1	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1's perspective on the effects of computers is that although there are certain advantages associated with them, I firmly believe that negative issues and circumstances predominantly arise from computer use, and these have a more profound and adverse impact on people. @CAPS1 posits three primary reasons why the negative impacts of computers outweigh the positive and constructive ones. Firstly, @CAPS2 - bullying is a significant concern. Additionally, there are numerous 'scams' and 'cons' prevalent on the @CAPS9. Lastly, there is a substantial amount of misleading or inaccurate information available online. Returning to @CAPS1's first reason, ""@CAPS2 - bullying"" can be defined as rude or malicious teasing conducted over the @CAPS9, particularly on social networking websites such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, etc. '@CAPS2 - bullying' encompasses teasing, hurtful remarks, offensive name - calling, and vulgar language. It is far more detrimental than conventional bullying, such as ""Give me your lunch money,"" because once words are posted on the @CAPS9, they cannot be retracted, regardless of how strenuously one attempts. '@CAPS2 - bullying' represents the new form of meanness in the digital age. Secondly, scamming and cons are prevalent outcomes of @CAPS9/computer use. When purchasing items online, one can never be certain of what they will receive. @CAPS1's father was deceived, or conned, on the @CAPS9. He was browsing what appeared to be a highly official website to purchase a large boat. He traveled all the way to @LOCATION1 to acquire it. When he took it out on the water in @LOCATION2, at their @DATE1 home, he discovered that the engine and motor were defective. This exemplifies the potential risks associated with online purchases. Lastly, misinformation can be another negative consequence of computer use. When conducting research on a topic, it is advisable to rely on the library. Although it may seem old - fashioned and time - consuming, when researching on the @CAPS9, one must remember that anyone can post anything, including misleading or false statements and 'information'. Researching topics is not the only avenue for obtaining false information. People can also pretend to be someone they are not in real life, which is why anonymous chat - rooms and instant messaging are both dangerous and unreliable. In conclusion, the @CAPS9 generally has more pronounced negative impacts and consequences than positive ones. Since @CAPS2 bullying, scamming or conning, and misinformation are all negative aspects of the @CAPS9, they outweigh the positives."
958	960	1	1	Dear Newspaper, computers do not confer benefits upon us as we tend to spend an excessive amount of time using them. Not everyone possesses a computer, and the cost of a computer is a significant factor. Moreover, not everyone is proficient in using it. If we were to quantify the number of hours people spend on the computer, individuals would be astounded by the results. People often spend their time looking up random information on the computer when they could be outdoors cycling or taking a walk. These activities cannot be accomplished with a computer. Not everyone owns a computer because they are quite expensive. A basic computer can cost upwards of @NUM1 and more, amounting to @MONEY1. Additionally, one has to pay for internet access, which can cost approximately @NUM2 per month. Furthermore, there are costs associated with certain applications such as (Windows, Microsoft, etc.). The expenses related to a computer accumulate over time, and people often fail to realize that when they pay for the internet, they do not receive the full extent of the services promised by the cable companies. Not everyone is well - versed in using a computer, especially older adults who have not had the opportunity to learn how to fully utilize its capabilities. This is because they have never received training on computer use. In conclusion, computers do not serve as a valuable asset to our society due to the time, cost, and lack of knowledge associated with them.
959	961	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, have you ever found yourself preoccupied with thoughts of the computer or longing to be using it? I understand that you are exploring whether computers have negative or positive effects on society. I am of the opinion that computers have a negative impact, primarily due to the reduction in time dedicated to exercise, limited interaction with family and friends, and the ease with which one can become addicted to them. Exercise is a crucial component for maintaining a healthy body and mind. However, @CAPS1 often struggles to find the time to engage in physical activity. Instead of utilizing their free time for exercise, they are likely to be on Facebook. Additionally, the maintenance of a computer can also consume time that could be better spent exercising. For instance, on @DATE1, my computer contracted a virus that required extensive time to fix. The time I spent resolving the issue could have been utilized for valuable exercise. Another significant aspect to consider is obesity. We should be actively engaged in physical movement rather than sitting idle and staring at a computer screen for @NUM1 hours at a stretch. I cherish spending time with my friends and family, and I believe most people share this sentiment. Computers often act as a barrier to such social interactions. Children, for example, may choose to be on Facebook instead of having a pleasant meal with their family. My @CAPS2 often reminisced about the enjoyable experiences he had with his friends. Nowadays, children seem to find it easier to isolate themselves in the digital world. I believe that it is essential to spend time with family and friends as we never know when we may lose them. Addiction is a serious concern, and computer addiction is no exception. Our generation has become overly reliant on computers. For example, when traveling in a car with the @CAPS4, we simply plug it in and rely on it to provide directions. However, what would happen if it malfunctions? We would be completely lost as we have not learned how to read a map. Similarly, if our computer breaks down, we may face difficulties. Children who are accustomed to typing may lose the skill of writing by hand. Once again, I emphasize the negative effects of computers on society.
960	962	1	1	"To whom it may concern, I hold the view that computers are a valuable asset. They offer several advantages, including the opportunity to learn about foreign places, maintain connections with family and friends, and provide a source of entertainment. Firstly, computers are an excellent tool for learning about foreign destinations. Through computers, one can conduct in - depth research on a place and view pictures before embarking on a journey. For example, if I were planning to visit a distant location such as @LOCATION3, I would use the computer to identify the most appealing areas and explore different hotels, taking into account their reviews. Moreover, if someone were tasked with writing a paper on a different country or state they have never visited, the computer would be their go - to resource. While books can provide similar information, the computer allows for more efficient filtering of unnecessary details. In my history class, I had to write a report on the state of @LOCATION2. Since I had never been there, I turned to the computer. Although books could have provided the same facts, computers offer up - to - date and accurate information. Secondly, computers facilitate communication with family and friends. There are numerous websites that enable users to share photos and engage in conversations with loved ones. I recently joined Facebook, which has allowed me to communicate with my friends without incurring excessive phone bills. My father also uses Facebook to reconnect with people he has not seen since he moved from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Other popular platforms include AIM, AOL, and MySpace. Lastly, computers serve as a great source of entertainment. They allow us to watch concerts we missed or movies that are not available on television. When I attended a skateboard demo at Skate Lair, I had a fantastic time. Later, I decided to revisit the experience by searching for ""Nike SB Skate Lair Demo"" on YouTube. To my excitement, I saw my own face in the video about halfway through. Computers also enable us to stay informed about the news and weather. This is particularly useful when traveling, as one can use a laptop to check the latest updates. In conclusion, I believe that computers are essential. Although some people may spend excessive amounts of time on them, the majority use them in moderation."
961	963	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I am firmly convinced that individuals do allocate a substantial amount of time to computers. A significant number of adolescents spend copious amounts of time on computers. I draw this conclusion from my personal experience and a survey I conducted among @PERSON1's @NUM1 - grade @CAPS4 class. First, I wish to elaborate on the notion that teens spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer. Some teens access the internet to complete homework or check their emails, while others spend hours on @CAPS1 and become addicted, thus foregoing outdoor activities or sports. In my own case, I once had a @CAPS1 account and would spend the entire day on it, missing out on time with my family and friends. Consequently, I deleted the account. However, I still feel addicted to the computer; I am constantly listening to music, chatting with friends, or checking my emails, much like most people. And finally, regarding @PERSON1's @NUM1 - grade @CAPS4 class, @PERCENT1 of the students spend a day on it, and @PERCENT2 stated that they spend @PERCENT3 of their time on the computer. This is just one @NUM1 - grade class, yet most students are addicted, regardless of age. This is why I believe that people spend too much time on it. Many students spend hours on @CAPS1 at a stretch, and from my own experience, I have been addicted to the computer. When I surveyed @PERSON1's @NUM1 - grade @CAPS4 class, a very high percentage of students said they were addicted to the computer. Therefore, parents, please advise your children to reduce their computer usage.
962	964	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever contemplated the vast offerings of the world - wide web? I wholeheartedly concur that computers exert a beneficial influence on individuals. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow people with the capacity to explore distant places, and afford people the opportunity to reconnect with others or make new acquaintances. The internet is replete with possibilities and is undoubtedly advantageous. Studies conducted by @PERSON1, a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1, indicated that @PERCENT1 of individuals who type on the computer possess superior hand - eye coordination compared to those who do not. You might be enhancing your coordination without even being aware of it! Erudite individuals would concur that using the computer is highly beneficial. There are numerous computer games that demand rapid reactions and prompt reflexes, thereby enhancing hand - eye coordination. I can attest personally that it has been beneficial to me. Since I started spending more time on the computer, I have noticed a remarkable improvement in my reaction time. Yes, I am aware that some people should engage in outdoor exercise, but you can either exercise or improve your hand - eye coordination; in either case, there is no wrong choice. Just as the colossal expanse of space holds captivating worlds, computers offer a technological means to learn about distant places. Kevin, a scientist, asserts that @PERCENT2 of our knowledge about space is derived from computers! For instance, consider Google Earth; it enables us to view clear images of any location on the planet! I believe you would concur that without computers, we would lack a great deal of knowledge about the wonderful world around us. Would you prefer not to have computers and remain ignorant of half of what exists in our world? Through these advanced computers, we can learn about extraterrestrial life, such as in space and other galaxies. Did you know that @NUM1 of the population uses the computer to communicate and reconnect with friends and family? I certainly do! I understand that people should not be overly reliant on the computer for social interaction, but it is an excellent way to stay in touch. There are remarkable websites like Skype and ooVoo that allow you to chat with others. Amicable, well - educated individuals concur that this is an ideal way to catch up with old friends from high school or even elementary school. Another remarkable aspect of online communication is that long - lasting friendships can be forged. To illustrate, some people who initially interacted online have become very close. Personally, I attend @DATE1 camp every year and make new friends. Internet platforms like Facebook have helped me maintain contact with them. Clearly, this is a valuable resource! The time has come to make a decision, and choosing to use computers would undoubtedly be a prudent one. Without a doubt, it will assist you in improving hand - eye coordination and keeping in touch with people. Most importantly, it empowers people to learn about the wonders of distant places. So, do not make the wrong choice; appreciate and utilize all that computers have to offer.
963	965	1	1	"Dear newspaper, Are you desirous of acquiring good hand - eye coordination? Do you wish to have the ability to learn about far - flung places? And do you want to engage in online communication with others? If you answered affirmatively to all these queries, then utilizing a computer is the optimal choice! While using a computer, you can accomplish numerous tasks. You can search for a nutritious recipe for your family or find a serene location to practice your daily yoga. Although some individuals claim that using a computer reduces the time available for exercise and enjoying nature, this is not necessarily the case. A recent poll conducted at the Planet Fitness in Newington @CAPS2 revealed that @PERCENT1 of the exercising individuals discovered Planet Fitness via the internet. @PERSON1 from the Department of Health and Wellness stated, ""@PERCENT2 of my clients enroll in online exercise courses to avoid public settings."" I understand that it may seem indolent to refrain from going to a gym, but some people are apprehensive about others' opinions. So, who wouldn't prefer to exercise in the comfort of their own home rather than visit a sweaty, old gym? All rational individuals would opt to stay at home and exercise using their computer instead of going to a malodorous gym. So, it's a matter of choice. Whether you choose to go to a dilapidated, sweaty gym or stay in your immaculate home with internet access? Imagine, upon waking up well - rested, instead of heading to an unappealing gym, you can stay at home and enjoy a relaxing walk in the comfort of your abode. Undoubtedly, you value your olfactory senses and would prefer to smell a pleasant, warm apple pie. But if that's not a concern for you, that's fine too. So, eschew the gym, stay at home, and relish your day with the internet! I advocate staying at home and embracing the internet!"
964	966	1	1	Dear the Daily Newspaper crew, I have noticed that some of you hold differing views regarding the use of computers. I, for one, firmly believe that using a computer is not as detrimental as it may seem. For instance, computers are actually beneficial for education. Many individuals utilize them to create @NUM1 images for school projects or science fair projects. Like most young teens and children, I use these machines to play video games to alleviate boredom. However, unlike many, I do not spend excessive time on it. I typically play for a couple of hours. There are, however, some drawbacks to having a computer at home. Firstly, these machines consume a significant amount of energy, causing the electricity bill to soar and reach @DATE1 levels. Additionally, on some websites, such as MySpace and Twitter, there are individuals with stalking tendencies. However, on the positive side, these individuals are usually promptly apprehended and incarcerated. Computers actually have a positive impact on the mind and motor skills. For example, children who have access to computers learn how to fly a kite or engage in activities under their parents' supervision, thereby developing hand - eye coordination. Many children who play sports and have access to computers are able to catch a ball more quickly than usual. So, as you can see, computers are not entirely negative. Therefore, please consider the consequences for children if computers were to be banned.
965	967	1	1	"I am of the opinion that computers have a positive impact on people. Computers, a relatively recent invention, have gained widespread popularity. They enable people to communicate online with one another. Moreover, they facilitate students in completing homework assignments and important projects. Computers also allow people to store crucial files and precious pictures in secure locations where they are unlikely to be lost. Computers are beneficial in numerous ways, and these are merely a few examples. Computers enable people to connect online, whether through email, instant messaging, or video chat, supplanting antiquated and cumbersome methods of communication. For example, instead of writing a letter to someone, mailing it, and waiting two days for them to receive it, you can simply send an email. Obtain an email address, compose a message, and click send. The recipient will receive the message instantaneously and can reply promptly. @PERSON1, the president of the @ORGANIZATION1, states, ""Computers are an integral part of technology. People use them daily."" Using them daily does not solely imply for entertainment purposes; they also assist with work. Three out of four adults who use computers claim that they enhance their work efficiency and social standing. Computers are an indispensable part of everyday life and can aid in almost every aspect. Computers enable students to complete homework and projects rapidly. Instead of painstakingly hand - writing a four - page essay on @PERSON2, students can utilize textbooks and the internet to gather information. Computers also allow students to email teachers in case they miss classes and assignments. @CAPS4 @PERSON3, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 who missed several days of school, remarks, ""All I had to do was email my teachers, and they sent me all the homework assignments. It was that effortless."" @CAPS4 is not the only one who acknowledges that computers are extremely helpful. Millions of children and adults concur. Computers not only enable students to write reports but also allow them to save them for future reference. They also safeguard important files and precious pictures. Everyone despises it when their camera or video camera malfunctions, and their cherished memories are lost. Well, simply save them to the computer, and they will be preserved indefinitely! @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who store their pictures on a computer agree that this is the optimal method. In conclusion, computers indeed have a positive impact on people. They enable people to communicate online, complete homework and projects, and store important files. I can reasonably assume that everyone shares my view that computers are an essential part of everyday life. We would be severely limited without them."
966	968	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I opine that computers serve as an excellent tool for everyone when utilized appropriately. Here are the rationales behind this view. Firstly, computers prove advantageous as news dissemination occurs at a rapid pace. Leveraging the internet, world - altering news can spread exponentially, informing individuals within seconds. This is highly beneficial for staying informed and acquainting oneself with essential information. This brings to mind the incident when a massive earthquake struck @LOCATION2, traumatizing its inhabitants. Mere moments after the event, the news was already circulating across the internet. This attracted widespread attention to @LOCATION2, prompting numerous individuals to donate essential items. Secondly, computers are also invaluable for researching academic topics and personal interests. When seeking facts for a school project, one can effortlessly search for the required information through the plethora of internet search engines, precisely pinpointing the desired details. Additionally, one can explore topics of personal interest. If one has a favorite sports team, band, or is intrigued by a famous figure, an abundance of information is readily accessible. All of this can be accomplished within the privacy of one's home, maintaining an air of secrecy akin to that of a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when one of my idols passed away. Within seconds of learning the tragic news, I was able to conduct a search and obtain an extensive amount of information regarding their demise. Finally, one can engage in conversations with individuals from around the globe if desired! Through social networking platforms such as Facebook and MySpace, one can connect with friends and engage in long - lasting conversations. One can also join chat rooms with like - minded individuals. Just as I converse with others about a band we both adore. I firmly believe that access to news, research capabilities, and the ability to stay in touch with friends are undoubtedly the most compelling reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Acquire one!
967	969	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am penning this letter to convey my stance on the impacts computers have on individuals. I dissent from the view that experts are correct in claiming that people are spending excessive time on their computers. The subsequent reasons will elucidate the basis of my disagreement. I also recognize that there are issues associated with computers. Please continue reading to comprehend my reasoning. Firstly, my reason for disagreeing with technology proponents is the lack of safety! While online chatting is appealing, it is fraught with danger. For instance, many children are targeted, typically in an online environment. This is because personal information is often disclosed to unknown individuals. Moreover, children can be exposed to perilous situations; for example, they may be kidnapped due to the information they share and the people they interact with online. Secondly, I disagree because it also leads to computer addiction. Most individuals become addicted to certain online activities. These habits can also pose risks. For example, some video games involve scenarios of killing and criminal behavior, which are unacceptable in the ""real"" world. Such games can also expose players to danger. Another example is that some students have resorted to violence, believing it to be a solution, due to their addiction to computer - related content. The addiction to computers is so severe that people lose the inclination to interact with the real world. Lastly, I disagree because it can lead to isolation. Many individuals who are overly engrossed in computers find themselves in a solitary existence as they do not truly enjoy life. For example, some people may even face health issues as a result. I hope this letter will influence others, and thank you for reading. Hopefully, people will understand why I disagree."
968	970	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, The society of @DATE1 has undergone a significant transformation compared to what it was twenty years ago. We now possess phones that enable seamless web browsing, similar to a computer. Our access to such an extensive network unites us, broadens our intellectual horizons, and keeps many @CAPS5 diligent workers focused, ensuring they are well - prepared when work commences. Not everyone concurs that technology is beneficial for our development, yet I believe it propels us forward and shields us from all forms of ignorance. Our construction workers toil diligently during their busy seasons. They vigorously construct towering skyscrapers, educational facilities, expansions to our health centers, and even our homes. However, when adverse weather conditions render construction hazardous in the long term, they must remain vigilant and ready to respond when duty calls. Recently, there has been a technological advancement that allows crane operators to maintain their skills virtually during their off - season. To the untrained observer, it may seem effortless. It might appear that all they do is sit in a seat, pull a few levers, and press a few buttons. However, there is a high degree of precision required for such a task. Pulling the lever too rapidly can cause the crane to veer sharply in the wrong direction, leading to a potential tip - over. One of our field reporters tried the @CAPS1 virtual trainer and developed a profound appreciation for the work of our builders. This demonstrates that if one fails to maintain these skills, it could result in a serious malfunction at a construction site. Personally, I find it both entertaining and educational to learn a language different from my own. In fact, I teach myself @CAPS4 at home. However, if I did not have a computer at home, my language studies would be nearly impossible. Given the economic situation of @DATE1, attending a language class outside of school or hiring a private tutor can significantly impact one's budget. The internet offers an efficient, cost - effective, or even free way to assist language learners. One can even obtain study tips from native speakers or those who have already acquired in - depth knowledge of the language. In @DATE1's society, not everyone has the time to visit the library and borrow a book about a country they are interested in. Some may claim that asking a neighbor about their homeland can be equally effective, but this can be awkward for those who are not comfortable in face - to - face interactions. However, having comprehensive information at one's fingertips can make the learning process enjoyable. One can find blog posts about someone's visit to their country of interest and even videos of their experiences there. Websites dedicated to specific cultures can also be highly beneficial. On the other hand, if someone is seeking a vacation spot recommended by locals, that information can also be found. Some people do not live in an area where they can easily connect with family through a simple phone call or a short drive. One may have to take a plane or incur expenses to visit relatives. Social networks on the web make it easier and more affordable to connect with loved ones. The speed of instant messaging can create the illusion that they are in the same room rather than across the ocean. I hope that the information I have shared can be useful to someone who has not yet recognized the benefits of technological advancements. Please remember that technology can serve as a tool for skill maintenance, an educational resource, and a means of connection for our foreign - born citizens. Thank you.
969	971	1	1	Dear Local newspaper, There are intense debates regarding whether computers are beneficial or detrimental. I contend that computers confer numerous advantages upon our society. Why? Because they facilitate social interaction, offer extensive educational opportunities, and contribute to business growth. Astonishingly, it has become incredibly easy to connect with others using computers. Computers enable families to communicate with one another and friends to stay in touch. They enhance socialization by eliminating the need for time - consuming paper - based messages. Additionally, if family members are on vacation, one can still maintain contact. Similarly, if a friend is unable to visit another's home, they can communicate via the computer. Moreover, computers provide an opportunity to interact with people from all corners of the world. It is truly remarkable how effortlessly one can engage in conversations with others using a computer. It is truly astonishing how much educational value we have derived from computers. Computers have opened up a vast array of learning avenues. Prior to the advent of computers, learning was primarily confined to books, many of which were not as effective as computers in imparting knowledge. With a computer, one can explore the mysteries of space, stars, and planets. One can also learn about other nations, their cultures, and landscapes without leaving home. Computers have undoubtedly played a crucial role in our educational development. Computers have achieved a great deal, but their impact on businesses is particularly significant. The computer industry itself has been a lucrative business, generating substantial revenue. It has assisted businesses in organizing their work and finances and has created numerous job opportunities in the computer field. Additionally, it has provided businesses with a faster and more efficient way to market their products to consumers. Computers have played a vital role in shaping our economy. Computers have simplified social interaction, enhanced our educational capabilities, and supported business growth. This is why I firmly believe that computers have benefited our society.
970	972	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, I am writing to express my thoughts on the effects of computers on people. One of my concerns is that individuals who spend excessive time on computers allow their lives to slip by. However, this does not apply to those who work on computers as part of their profession. My second point is that people using computers can still interact with their families as they share the same living space. My final concern is why some people choose to spend the majority of their time on computers. I am not referring to those with computer - related jobs. The reason I emphasize that excessive computer use causes one's life to pass by is that when one spends @NUM1 on the computer, they are essentially doing nothing productive. They are merely sitting in a chair, gradually gaining weight. If one is going to use the computer, they should at least attempt to find a job through it. But again, I am not talking about those whose jobs require computer use. That is one of my reasons. My second reason is that people using computers can still interact with their families. The rationale behind this is that one can be on the computer and still communicate with family members because they live under the same roof. Moreover, when not using the computer, one can spend quality time with their family. This is why I believe that computer use does not necessarily prevent family interaction. My final and most important point is why some people choose to spend the majority of their lives on the computer. I find it disheartening that some individuals waste their lives on the computer instead of seeking employment or enjoying life. If one has children, they should have fun with them, making them feel loved and creating positive memories. So, do not waste your life sitting in front of the computer, gaining weight, and neglecting your family. Instead, strive to achieve something meaningful. However, I am not referring to those who work on computers as part of their job. I am talking about those who do not have such a requirement. This is why I urge you not to let your life pass you by. I hope you find this letter thought - provoking and that you will not squander your life on the computer, doing nothing but getting fat and missing out on life's experiences. Once again, I am not talking about those who must work on computers. I am addressing those who do not.
971	973	1	1	I am penning this article to apprise you of how the majority of individuals are allocating their time on computers. In this piece, I shall elucidate upon computers and the current activities people engage in with them. Some individuals utilize their computers for business - related or work - associated purposes. However, there are also those who employ them for entertainment and other social pursuits. These are the individuals who remain seated at the computer throughout the day. Instead, they could be relishing life, stepping outside to breathe in fresh air. Yet, they opt to stay indoors all day long, glued to the computer. Now, the question arises as to why people desire to stay inside all day on the computer. Some individuals are perpetually on their social networking sites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They are infatuated; these are two websites that are highly addictive to certain people. And then there are those who simply enjoy conducting online searches. Finally, disengage from the computer, spend time with your family; the computer will always be there. Use the computer only when necessary. Although it is enjoyable to look up information for entertainment, all things should be done in moderation. I trust you will heed my advice and concur with me. I believe I have made my stance clear regarding the appropriate usage of computers. Thank you for your attention.
972	974	1	1	What computers impede you from accomplishing is your school homework. However, when you engage in an unauthorized activity on the computer, you may become entrapped on a website that you cannot exit from your screen. Thus, what I am attempting to convey is to limit your computer usage to no more than @NUM1 minutes.
973	975	1	1	Computers have become a ubiquitous household fixture in contemporary times. Owing to the extensive capabilities of computers, the majority of individuals allocate an excessive amount of time on them, which is exerting an impact on our society. Computers can be highly beneficial when seeking information on a particular topic; however, some individuals take this to an extreme. For some, their occupations are computer - based. Others, such as teenagers, indulge in gaming or utilize instant messaging, which at times detracts from outdoor activities. Another issue with computers is that adults may become deeply engrossed in online gambling, which is detrimental even in a casino setting, and now they can partake in it from the comfort of their living - room couch. Computers can also confine you indoors, preventing you from accessing fresh air and sunlight. While computers have their drawbacks, they also offer advantages. On occasion, computers serve as an ideal resource. For instance, when your history teacher assigns a @NUM1 - page essay on the Civil War and you have limited knowledge of the events, computers prove useful. Or when your boss instructs you to determine the number of teenage fatalities in car accidents caused by cellphones, computers seem to be a perfect solution. Thus far, you have learned that computers have their merits and demerits. However, if computer usage were restricted, individuals would be able to engage in more outdoor activities or read a book. Some individuals may misuse computers, while others may not. I firmly believe that if computer time were limited, numerous aspects of our society would be transformed.
974	976	1	1	Dear editor, I have observed an ongoing debate regarding whether computers are beneficial or detrimental. I believe that my perspective can contribute to your decision - making process. I am of the opinion that computers are advantageous. I hold this view because they enhance children's social skills, assist individuals with poor handwriting, and facilitate learning about the world. Firstly, computers aid children globally in developing social skills. They do so as there are numerous means of communicating with others via the computer, such as instant messaging and web - caming platforms. Moreover, a survey indicated that @PERCENT1 of parents reported a significant improvement in their children's social skills due to computer usage. Another area where computers are helpful is for individuals with illegible handwriting. Instead of penning a well - crafted report that is difficult to read, one can type it on Microsoft Word. Whenever I have a school paper where neatness is crucial, I always type my report. This can be extremely beneficial for those who struggle with writing, as on the computer, one can customize the font and other elements to make the document appear as presentable as desired. The final reason I advocate for the use of computers is that many individuals prefer not to read newspapers or watch the news. Instead, they like to conduct research on specific topics of interest to stay informed about global events. My mother, for example, lacks the time to watch the news or read the newspaper. However, when she checks her email, the most significant news of the day is the first thing that appears. People worldwide turn to the computer to access the latest news. I hope you will take my perspective into account when making your decision, considering the diverse groups of people that computers assist, including those with social challenges, poor handwriting, and busy individuals who cannot spare the time to watch an hour - long news broadcast. Thank you for your time.
975	977	1	1	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1's stance is that people are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer. I have @NUM1 compelling reasons to support my belief that people are overly reliant on computers. @CAPS1's first reason is that people are squandering valuable time. Secondly, they lack sufficient energy. Thirdly, they are essentially expending their lives on the computer. Continue reading to understand why I disagree that this benefits society. People are forfeiting the opportunity to have fun. They have no time for friends, family, pets, and other aspects of life. There is a prevalent addiction to websites such as Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS2, and others. People simply need to disconnect from the computer and engage in outdoor activities. Most individuals do not acquire an adequate amount of energy. Some people are constantly indoors and require an energy boost. Fresh air can be beneficial; perhaps going to the gym or going for a jog outside for a while. Staying indoors is not conducive to one's health. It can lead to weight gain. Moreover, if one is always indoors, there is no time for friends and other social interactions. Finally, people spend all their time at home on the computer. They have no time, energy, and are missing out on many aspects of life. While the computer is a remarkable technology, there is no need to be on it @NUM2. One should make time for friends and family. Now you are aware of @CAPS1's opinion on why excessive computer use does not benefit society. People are losing time, energy, and spending all their time on the computer. Goodbye for now.
976	978	1	1	"To Whom It May Concern, computers can serve as a substantial asset to our society; however, they prove to be an even more significant hindrance. Individuals are squandering their days in front of the computer. Scarcely anyone ventures outdoors for exercise or to relish nature. Perhaps the most detrimental effect is that scarcely anyone engages with their friends and family anymore. If you do not wish to succumb to the allure of computers, put down the mouse and step outside! Obesity in [LOCATION1] has reached an all - time high. Experts concur that computers and other forms of technology are to blame. People who spend copious amounts of time on the computer rarely exercise, which impacts them adversely. These individuals have a shorter lifespan! They may not be present in twenty years to witness their grandchildren grow up. Moreover, they encounter numerous medical problems. [PERSON1], an obesity expert, states, ""I have observed a positive correlation between the obesity rate and that of [CAPS1]."" [CAPS1] can be fatal! Obesity can also trigger heart attacks and infertility! If you can evade these diseases and health risks by disconnecting from the computer, why wouldn't you? Utilizing the computer is not a worthy sacrifice for your health! Do you possess fond childhood memories involving nature? I certainly do. Most people who spend excessive time on the computer do not have the opportunity to create such memories. They are too preoccupied with the computer to care. Many individuals will never visit any of our national parks! Drew [PERSON2], a park ranger, remarks, ""In the past few years, we have had fewer visitors than ever before."" If people cannot tear themselves away from the computer for even a moment to behold the splendor of our national parks, there is evidently something amiss. Disengage from your computers and venture outdoors! I share everything with my friends and family and endeavor to spend as much time with them as feasible. Nearly all frequent computer users claim that [PERCENT1] of the time, they use it as an excuse to avoid seeing friends and family. In reality, they are reluctant to part with it. As a society, we are becoming overly reliant on technology. A supervisor states, ""I have witnessed a definite decline in family enrollment. We rarely see kids with friends and family socializing."" She is correct. Now is the time to cease computer usage! Computers may not be entirely culpable for the aforementioned problems. Perhaps it is the people; nonetheless, computers do contribute to the issue. If we did not have computers, more people would be outdoors exercising and enjoying nature. Memories would be forged when we socialized with friends and family. Now is the time to power off the computer and step outside. Call a friend and take a stroll. If you do, you will realize that you can have fun without computers."
977	979	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, individuals allocate an excessive amount of time to computers. Instead of engaging in exercise, appreciating nature, and interacting with real people, they sit and play games, watch music, or view movies on the computer. Therefore, I dissent from those who assert that computers benefit society. In [LOCATION1], [LOCATION1], [LOCATION1], a significant number of people have flabby and overweight physiques due to computer usage. You may wonder why. People remain seated in front of their computers all day when they could be spending that time exercising. My father became extremely overweight when we acquired a new computer. All he did was sit and play games such as [CAPS1] Wars or [CAPS2]. I could not believe how obese he became, so my mother intervened, and now, instead of playing on the computer, he goes to the gym. You would be astounded by the amount of weight he lost. Additionally, did you know that America is one of the most obese countries because people do not exercise and merely play on their laptops and computers? Thus, it would greatly benefit America if people stopped using software and commenced exercising. Many individuals miss out on the magnificent works of nature. The cool, relaxing air at the beach is far more pleasant than a dark, stuffy room illuminated only by the glow of a computer. There is an abundance to discover and explore. Yes, you can find information about the geysers in Yellowstone online, but it is nothing compared to witnessing them in person. If computers had existed in the early [DATE1]'s, people would never have had the urge to discover new lands. Do you hear of many great explorers nowadays? I wager that if everyone took a break from computers, new species might be discovered, or perhaps even a cure for cancer. Who knows what one can achieve by stepping out of the digital realm and into the beautiful expanse of nature. ""[CAPS3], come down and converse with your grandparents."" ""[CAPS4], Mom, I'm playing on the computer!"" How many times has this scenario occurred to you? Has your son or daughter been engrossed in the computer when a beloved [PERSON1] has visited? They may have preferred to play on the computer at that time, but they do not realize that it could have been their last day with that person. Computers will endure, but people's time is finite. Therefore, spending time with relatives is far more important than playing on the computer. I know a child named [PERSON2] who was playing on the computer when his friend called and invited him over. [PERSON2] declined. His friend was extremely disappointed and angry. I would be too. Would you like a friend to choose a computer over you? I sincerely hope not. Therefore, computers are detrimental and not as valuable as real human interaction. In conclusion, quality time spent with people, nature, and engaging in exercise is of greater importance than a glowing screen. I hope you concur that computers do not always contribute positively to society."
978	980	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers do not confer benefits upon our society. I firmly believe that computers can be perilous as they render people indolent, and one can easily fall victim to scams on the computer. Firstly, I contend that computers are not beneficial to society because they pose a significant danger. Computers are hazardous as people can be kidnapped or harassed. The police [CAPS1] of the town of [LOCATION1] reports that over [PERCENT1] of kidnappings involve individuals met on social networks such as MySpace and Facebook. The police chief also notes that there are numerous cases of people being harassed by stalkers or those intent on causing harm. Secondly, I do not believe that computers are advantageous as one can be readily scammed on them. [PERCENT2] of people claim to have lost substantial sums of money due to credit - card scams on the computer. There are websites on computers that feign selling something, obtain your credit - card number and other personal information, and then use your card to make purchases, leaving you liable for the charges. Credit - card companies assert that most credit - card scams and frauds occur via the computer. Lastly, I am convinced that computers are not beneficial as they induce laziness. Computers are replete with a plethora of entertaining features such as video games, and one can watch videos, shop, and access almost anything on a computer. My research reveals that [PERCENT3] of overweight individuals have accounts on multiple computer - based sites. These are the reasons why I believe computers do not benefit us. I hope you will heed my advice.
979	981	1	1	"In my view, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to individuals. I hold this stance for several reasons. Firstly, computers facilitate communication with family members residing across the globe. Secondly, they enable one to learn new languages that one has long desired to master. Thirdly, they keep one informed about global events. Firstly, I am of the opinion that computers are advantageous as they allow you to communicate with long - lost relatives whom you rarely see. For instance, if you miss a family member, you can simply access your computer, search for them, and communicate via chat, thereby alleviating the sense of longing. Additionally, computers can teach you new languages such as [CAPS1], [CAPS2], or even [CAPS3] if you so desire. You can simply type ""language of [CAPS2]"" on your computer and learn from the information provided. Moreover, computers keep you abreast of global happenings. It is far superior to obtain information from computers than from televisions as computers offer more comprehensive details about events. You can click ""locate area"" on the computer to determine the location of an incident. You can also view videos, examine images, and identify the location of an event on the computer. Regrettably, my discourse has concluded. These are my three primary reasons why computers are beneficial to people: the ability to communicate with long - lost relatives, the opportunity to learn new languages, and the means to stay informed about global events. Wouldn't you wish to partake in these remarkable experiences?."
980	982	1	1	"Dear Readers, can you fathom a life without communicating with distant friends, being limited to knowledge of only your town, or even lacking a [CAPS3]? I certainly cannot. Some of the remarkable advantages of possessing a [CAPS3] include engaging in online conversations with friends, acquainting oneself with new places and phenomena worldwide, and having the ability to study for tests using the internet. Firstly, the [CAPS3] has made it effortless to communicate with distant friends and relatives. Statistics indicate that [PERCENT1] of families in [LOCATION1] have distant friends with [CAPS2], and now all these individuals can interact with one another! I will never forget the time when my close friend moved away, yet I was still able to communicate with him thanks to the [CAPS3]. Secondly, the [CAPS3] empowers you to explore new places and things across the globe. I would never have known about some of the places I've visited if it weren't for the computer. [ORGANIZATION1] states that [CAPS3] expert [PERSON1] remarks, ""[CAPS3] are the reason we are so well - informed; without them, we would be oblivious to many places."" Thirdly, it is now feasible to study using the [CAPS3]. All academic tasks can be accomplished online. I will never forget the time when I forgot my book, but I was still able to study using an online book. In conclusion, the [CAPS3] offers numerous benefits, such as online interaction with friends, learning about new places, and facilitating study. Computers are indeed a source of all - around advantages."
981	983	1	1	The computer serves as an excellent means to connect with family and friends. Individuals transmit messages across the globe or simply to loved ones. People enjoy engaging in video games or frequenting websites of their preference. Globally, people purchase laptops to facilitate travel from one location to another. Not everyone uses a computer as they believe it may not be worthwhile, yet some individuals do relish having one for sending messages, socializing, or discussing daily experiences. Many people desire a computer but lack the financial means to acquire one. Certain computers incur substantial costs, such as @MONEY3, @MONEY2, or even exceeding these amounts, depending on the model chosen. Throughout the world, numerous individuals sell their computers to obtain funds for purchasing various items, such as shoes, clothing, or games. They often sell goods on eBay to earn more or less money; however, they cannot return the computer to retrieve their funds or obtain a new one. Some individuals prefer classic computers, but new models, such as touch - screen devices, have emerged. Many people have been purchasing these new computers at @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @ORGANIZATION1. Since the release of the new computers, people have been making numerous purchases, and the company has been generating significant revenue from manufacturing touch - screen computers. Each year, the company introduces new computer models to attract customers and generate thousands or @MONEY1 in profit. Companies worldwide design diverse computers to present novel styles that appeal to consumers and prompt them to make purchases. The more innovative the styles, the greater the profit. Some individuals establish their own companies to generate income, similar to other enterprises. However, a portion of the earned money is allocated to the government. The funds provided to the government are utilized to assist the homeless. Computers are employed for educational purposes and entertainment. People share computers with others; it would be unfair not to do so. Some individuals take turns using the computer, while others dislike this arrangement. Everyone either shares a computer or owns one, and they can choose whether to use it. They cannot force the server to accommodate someone's access if they desire to use it. Some individuals may lie about their intention to use the computer. People enjoy joking with others. Parents often caution that a computer is not a toy, as it can be expensive to repair. Many people spill water on their computers, causing malfunctions and frustration, especially if they have recently acquired a new device. When computers were first introduced, people purchased them out of curiosity. Many individuals were impressed, and the popularity of computers spread globally. People began discussing them, and the company continued to produce more models until they were available in stores worldwide. The computer became highly popular, and the company developed newer styles to meet the demand. People purchased a large number of computers each time a new style was released. Many individuals owned @NUM1 or @NUM2 computers at home as they acquired them. Some companies' innovative designs made other companies envious. People started ordering new computers online, and the manufacturing companies reaped substantial profits. Some companies halted production until they developed a superior computer model, such as the @CAPS1 model. When a better model was introduced, some companies were disappointed. Some companies even joined forces to collaborate on new computer development.
982	984	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I firmly concur that computers offer comprehensive benefits. They empower individuals to explore the world and accomplish a wide array of tasks. Moreover, computers serve multiple purposes. Notably, @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 households possess at least one computer. Thus, computers enable us to achieve virtually anything. They assist most individuals in their professional endeavors, academic pursuits at college or school, and even facilitate online transactions for purchasing a house or a car. They are cost - effective and highly useful. One can search for necessary facts or engage in games during leisure time. They keep us connected with the global community. Additionally, numerous activities necessitate the use of a computer. For instance, to access Xbox Live, a computer with @CAPS1 is required. Xbox Live allows users to play video games with others, including friends. Some homework assignments mandate the use of a computer, and certain colleges offer online courses, enabling students to study from home. Whatever information one needs can be found on the computer. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 households own computers, or @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 residents do. I acknowledge that some individuals squander their time on computers, but life would be significantly more arduous without them. For example, instead of waiting @NUM5 days for postal mail, one can simply send an @CAPS2 - mail. Most individuals would be unemployed without computers. They save time and enable people to engage in other activities instead of traveling to deliver a letter. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers are of immense benefit. As previously mentioned, the possibilities are endless, such as @CAPS3. They help maintain connections with friends during school vacations. They are also utilized for various functions, such as downloading music onto a @CAPS4. Furthermore, it seems that @CAPS5 everyone owns a computer. If scientists are critical of computers, then why do they use them? I wholeheartedly believe that computers are remarkable! What is your opinion?
983	985	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, ""Computers are truly remarkable! They offer invaluable support to my family and me; I simply cannot envision life without a computer."" This sentiment is echoed by numerous locals in the town of @LOCATION1. For me, computers are a source of entertainment, providing access to a plethora of applications. Additionally, they serve as a powerful tool for researching any topic imaginable. I also recognize the significance of computers in the business realm, where they are indispensable for professionals. My favorite aspect of computers lies in applications such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and many others. These applications are exceptional. On @CAPS5, one can communicate with friends without a cellphone or interact with friends residing in other states, as with @CAPS3. Undoubtedly, @CAPS3 is my most beloved application, as it allows me to chat with friends, view their pictures, learn about their relationships, and engage in numerous other activities. One can also play and download games on the computer. It is always enjoyable to engage in activities one loves on the computer, rather than solely focusing on research. Another significant function of the computer is research. Research can be both engaging and tedious, depending on one's perspective. However, it is highly educational. I once asked a mother with a @NUM1 - year - old, a @NUM2 - year - old, and a @NUM3 - year - old, and she stated, ""The most crucial aspect of the computer for me is research. It is enjoyable, fulfilling, and, most importantly, educational!"" The beauty of research on the computer lies in the vast number of websites offering information for exploration and enjoyment. Individuals in the workforce, particularly those in professions such as business and design, spend a significant amount of time on the computer. Many of them conduct research while working and are essentially on the computer @NUM4. Computers are primarily used by workers for email communication. My father is constantly on the computer, checking emails, typing reports for his boss, and participating in video conferences. The possibilities for workers are endless, as computers are an integral part of their jobs. In my opinion, computers are one of the greatest inventions. They offer amazing applications for entertainment, provide educational opportunities through research, and are essential for individuals in the workplace. I believe that it is nearly impossible for anyone to live without these technological marvels."
984	986	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION1 claim that they spend the majority of their time on the computer. I am of the opinion that computers exert a detrimental influence on individuals, as they can give rise to safety concerns, health issues, and educational problems. With the advent of new technology, teenagers have become oblivious to their surroundings and the impact on themselves. Although adults also use computers, they do so less frequently than teenagers. It is high time we recognize the effects of computers on ourselves and the world. Computers can pose significant safety risks. Nowadays, people frequently use online platforms to communicate with friends. However, they may not be aware that the person on the other end may not be who they claim to be. Recently, news reports have highlighted cases of teenagers being raped or kidnapped because the individuals they interacted with online were not trustworthy. Malicious individuals lurk on the internet, and we must take measures to prevent them from contacting children. Moreover, computers can compromise privacy. It is possible for computers to disclose personal information to others, so we need to be vigilant. Computers not only cause safety issues but also have a negative impact on health. They play a major role in deteriorating our well - being. Approximately @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are overweight or obese. Previously, television was blamed for people's lack of exercise, but now computers are having the same effect. There are so many engaging activities on the computer that people rarely get bored, making it difficult to disengage. However, people need to exercise, and computers are preventing them from doing so. It is as if computers are hypnotizing us, as we are reluctant to get up. Computers can also affect vision. After spending a long time on the computer, I often experience severe headaches due to eye strain. Additionally, computers can reduce face - to - face communication. Social interaction is essential for building healthy relationships, but computers are hindering this process. In addition to interfering with health, computers also have a negative impact on education. They can be extremely detrimental to students' academic performance. Students often forget to complete their homework due to distractions. With so many appealing features on the computer, people who spend a long time on it tend to neglect other important tasks. They may also forget to study for exams, resulting in poor grades. Computers should be tools for assistance rather than distractions. It is understandable that people find it difficult to resist the allure of computers, given their numerous interesting features, such as the internet and websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. We already have enough distractions in our lives and do not need more. Clearly, computers do not have a positive effect on people. More and more people are acquiring computers every day. They should be aware of the impact on themselves and the world around them. Why not go outside and enjoy nature or visit the mall with friends? There are numerous alternatives to spending the whole day glued to the computer. People need to wake up and recognize the negative effects of computers.
985	987	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am penning this letter to express my perspective on computer usage. In my view, some individuals rely excessively on computers, whether for research projects, socializing with friends, or obtaining answers for homework. Every day, millions of people spend hours continuously on the computer. Merely moving fingers does not constitute exercise and wastes energy. Many people I know would be at a loss without a computer, as they use it to stay connected with friends and complete their academic tasks. These individuals should be educated on alternative ways to accomplish tasks, as technology may fail one day. Some students depend so heavily on their computers that they assume there are no other means to get things done. They should explore activities such as socializing with friends in person, reading books, and completing homework independently. Since students are so reliant on computers, they are constantly on them. I often observe people returning home and immediately logging on to @CAPS2 for the remainder of the day. They rarely engage in outdoor sports or physical activities. A significant number of children do not participate in any athletic sports. Obesity has become a severe problem in the @LOCATION1 area, and the numbers are increasing dramatically. While many attribute this to poor eating habits, over - reliance on computers is also a major contributing factor. Children in the @LOCATION1 area are glued to their computers all day, checking messages and arranging pictures. While using the computer, they mindlessly consume ""@CAPS3"". This excessive computer usage is becoming a significant concern, not only in terms of obesity but also in terms of the high level of dependence on computers for almost everything. We must take the initiative to address this issue before it worsens. This could potentially become a major problem in the future. Therefore, let us start reducing our computer usage time now."
986	988	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I opine that computers are not beneficial for individuals as they could utilize that time for physical activity, socializing with friends and family, and engaging in reading. The primary reason I believe computers are not advantageous for people is that they could allocate that time to exercise. Instead of @CAPS2 - ing, one could ride a bicycle or even take the dog for a walk. Although exercising may entail strenuous effort, it is far superior to fixating on a computer screen. Merely maintaining a healthy diet does not guarantee good health; exercise is also essential for well - being. Thus, engage in running, walking the dog, or visit a gym rather than remaining seated at the computer. Another rationale for my view that computers are not good for you is that during the time you spend on the computer, you could be interacting with your friends and family. Suppose your family is going to the beach, but you choose to stay home and play games on Facebook. When your family returns and recounts all the enjoyment they had, you will have missed out on being part of those memories. Now, consider the situation with your friends. It's movie night, and all your friends are going, yet you stay home to have a webcam conversation with your aunt. You stayed home on both occasions just to be on the computer, thereby missing out on numerous experiences. My final reason for deeming computers detrimental is that instead of spending time on the computer, it should be dedicated to reading. Reading from a computer screen differs significantly from reading a book. Reading books expands your vocabulary and allows you to learn about diverse forms of literature. Overall, reading books enhances mental acuity. When reading online, you primarily encounter what people say, often in the form of rumors. Read books! In conclusion, I advocate that people should allocate more time to exercise, socialize with family and friends, and read rather than being engrossed in computers.
987	989	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, In contemporary times, computers are ubiquitous and have proven to be extremely beneficial. They serve as an information superhighway, facilitating connections among people. The latest technological advancements have had a favorable impact on humanity across the globe. Firstly, computers offer an effortless means of accessing a vast repository of information. @PERCENT1 of students at @ORGANIZATION2 assert that when assigned a paper or project, their initial source of information is the internet. As student @PERSON1 stated, ""The internet is rapid, straightforward, and reliable when one knows how to utilize it."" Children aged @NUM1 and above are learning to leverage the internet's numerous online encyclopedias, magazines, news sites, and other resources to gather information. I recall my kindergarten computer class, where we explored dinosaurs and weather patterns on child - friendly websites. Now, in middle school, we rely on websites like @CAPS1 Online for up - to - date and trustworthy information. Moreover, I have witnessed my mother, a nurse and hospital manager, utilize the internet to access videos and articles regarding specific procedures and methods for organizing a productive hospital. The internet provides a convenient way to access a wealth of information at the mere touch of a button. Furthermore, computers serve as a medium for people to maintain contact. @PERCENT2 of teenagers claim that they communicate with their peers using @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. It is an excellent means of communication, especially considering our busy schedules when face - to - face meetings are not always feasible. Additionally, due to the economic downturn causing job losses among parents, children are frequently relocating. Last @DATE1, one of my closest friends moved to @LOCATION1. I feared that we would never communicate again and was deeply saddened to bid farewell. However, thanks to @CAPS6 and @CAPS5, we communicate constantly and have never been closer. Social networking is not exclusive to the younger generation; adults also utilize it. They connect for business purposes via the internet, discuss future deals or challenges, and even reconnect with old friends from college or childhood. As evident, the internet has had numerous positive impacts, ranging from expediting research to facilitating connections with old friends. Computers are indeed beneficial to everyone."
988	990	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I acknowledge that computers possess certain positive attributes; however, they also entail negative consequences. Firstly, excessive computer use leads to a decline in interpersonal interaction. Secondly, it results in a lack of physical exercise. Thirdly, it poses a threat to one's health. Initially, the use of computers causes a reduction in interaction with family and friends. Spending an inordinate amount of time on computers can have a detrimental impact on one's marriage if married and can also strain relationships with children. I am not advocating for the complete cessation of computer use, as I myself utilize them. Instead, I recommend not allowing computers to dominate one's life, as it is not conducive to well - being. Secondly, physical exercise is essential. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT1 of individuals who are overly reliant on computers gain weight more rapidly. As a @NUM1 - year - old, I have personally experienced a slight weight gain due to computer use. It is a well - established fact that most people tend to consume more @CAPS1 while using the computer. Since one cannot walk while holding a computer, physical movement ceases, which means a lack of exercise. Limiting computer time is crucial for reaping the benefits of computers. Lastly, one's health is significantly at risk. Spending @NUM2 hours at a time in front of a computer can have a negative impact on eyesight. My eyesight deteriorates after just half an hour on the computer, and I'm sure many people experience headaches after prolonged computer use. While computers are enjoyable and offer various activities, they also pose health risks. Prolonged computer use increases the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome, which is extremely painful. Although computers are entertaining and simplify life, they have drawbacks. Firstly, they reduce interpersonal interaction. Secondly, they lead to a lack of exercise. Thirdly, they endanger one's health. By limiting computer time, one can maintain a healthy balance.
989	991	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1, and I am writing to apprise you of the advantages of having computers. I believe that computers offer an excellent avenue for children like me to expand their knowledge about the world. Moreover, computers assist those in need and provide information about distant locations across the globe. I am convinced that without computers, our understanding of the world would be severely limited. Computers also enable the rapid transmission of emergency messages across the world within @NUM1. Some individuals contend that computers have no impact on society; however, I firmly believe that they have a highly positive influence on people. Some also argue that computers cause people to spend less time exercising, but I maintain that they can actually aid in exercise as they can provide different workout techniques. In conclusion, I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on society.
990	992	1	1	Computers are highly useful as they offer a wealth of information. For instance, if you require the contact number of a restaurant, you can easily obtain it from the computer. Additionally, when planning a vacation and wishing to know the cost, you can refer to the computer. Moreover, if you intend to travel to different places, you can access a map on the computer and print it out. Nevertheless, computers also have their drawbacks. When people visit chat websites, there is a risk that adults may interact with young children. In conclusion, while computers provide numerous benefits in terms of information access and travel planning, their potential for facilitating inappropriate interactions on chat sites cannot be overlooked.
991	993	1	1	"Have you ever contemplated what existence would be like devoid of computers? Certain experts are apprehensive that individuals are expending an excessive amount of time on computers. I am of the opinion that we ought to continue utilizing computers. Undoubtedly, employing a computer facilitates our learning. The computer enables us to acquire knowledge about other locales in the world. @PERCENT1 of individuals assert that they would relish viewing beautiful places globally. Computers can also instruct you on how to speak a language. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 states that ""taking Spanish online assisted her significantly in her class."" Computers currently offer online study groups that can aid us in gaining admission to a college. Numerous individuals would concur that using a computer helps us learn novel things. It is a fact that you interact with other people on computers. You encounter new individuals when you are on the computer. Most people enjoy meeting others online. You also develop social skills on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people claim that they learn social skills on the computer. People can also learn to cultivate a personality because they are engaged in its use. @PERSON2 remarks that ""because I started using the computer, I lacked a personality, but now I feel like a well - rounded individual."" As you interact with people on the computers. Did you know that a computer teacher in life says that if you need to use a computer in your future, you should already be proficient? @PERSON3 says that using a computer helped you with typing. Using a computer enhanced hand - eye coordination. You type numerous essays in college as well, so that can be beneficial to you. So now you are aware that a computer is advantageous to you in the future. Without a doubt, people should still use computers as they are helpful in numerous ways. So what are you waiting for? Go and access your computer today!"
992	994	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, Have you ever spent an inordinate amount of time on a computer, neglecting exercise or quality time with your family? Well, this poses a significant issue here in @LOCATION1. In my view, to ameliorate this problem, individuals should be permitted to use the computer only for a specified duration of @ORGANIZATION1 time. Subsequently, they should engage in a pleasant workout, spend time outdoors, and most importantly, interact with their families. I believe this approach will alleviate the problem, as it allows you to derive greater enjoyment rather than returning home from school and immediately gravitating towards your computer and remaining on it for the remainder of the @ORGANIZATION1 night. I also contend that this will help address the problem because it will enable you to achieve better academic grades. If you are constantly on the computer and have no time for exercise, outdoor activities, and bonding with your family, it most likely implies that you have insufficient time to complete your homework. By neglecting homework, your grades may decline, and you are likely to struggle to comprehend the material being taught in class. This single problem can also have far - reaching consequences in numerous other aspects. The issue with computers and the reason why people, particularly children, are so attached to them is due to @ORGANIZATION1 websites such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc., and children are addicted to them. This is part of the problem because children find it difficult to disengage from these platforms as they are highly appealing. This problem leads to the primary issue because when parents say, ""It's time to get off... go get some fresh air,"" the child often responds with ""one minute,"" and parents often allow this leniency. However, that ""one minute"" can stretch into an hour at most. This is detrimental because by the time the child finally leaves the computer, it is dark outside, and they are unable to engage in outdoor activities. I believe this matter is of great importance, and I propose that the use of Facebook and Twitter should be restricted to a limited amount of @ORGANIZATION1 time, and users should be logged off after @NUM1 minutes. In conclusion, this problem is a national concern, and in my opinion, it should be enshrined in a new law stipulating that children must engage in outdoor play and spend time with their families before using any computer. As can be seen, the presence of these excellent websites has given rise to a problem among children. Thank you for taking the time to read about my perspective on why computers are a significant problem here in @ORGANIZATION1."
993	995	1	1	I posit that computers are advantageous because some individuals do not possess phones, and thus, computers serve as an excellent means to connect with acquaintances and also to meet new people. Secondly, some individuals are planning to attend college upon completing high school. In such cases, one can utilize computers to search for a college that suits their preferences and budget and also find directions to the institution. The third reason is shopping. If a holiday is approaching, one can browse online to discover affordable and appealing items. Moreover, if one has limited time for physical shopping, they can conveniently order items online and have them delivered to their residence. These are some of the reasons why I believe online activities are beneficial. One can engage in chatting, find locations and prices, research colleges, and also shop online, which clearly demonstrates the advantages of the online realm.
994	996	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I have learned that a substantial number of individuals are allocating an excessive amount of time on computers, while reducing the time dedicated to exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. In my opinion, I believe you should recognize the value of computers as they are instrumental in assisting with school homework or projects, communicating with distant family members, and making new friends. My first rationale for retaining computers is that they can be highly beneficial for school homework or projects. This is my primary reason because they are extremely helpful and useful when needed. Additionally, if your computer malfunctions, you can visit a friend's house and utilize their computer. Once you have completed your work, you can save it on a hard drive and print it using your school's computers. My second reason for keeping computers is for communicating with family. Without computers, it would be challenging to maintain communication with family members. In my view, computers are highly effective tools for family communication. If your phone is not functioning, you can also rely on the computer to stay in touch with your family. My third reason is for making new friends and communicating. Without computers, it would be difficult to meet and interact with new people. You can communicate with your family through the computer, and even if you are running late, you can send them a message via the computer. In my opinion, the computer is an excellent medium for family communication. I am aware that some people claim that individuals spend an excessive amount of time on computers and that they are addictive. However, computers are beneficial for schoolwork such as projects and assignments. Some people may argue that computers are only for entertainment, but in my opinion, we should retain computers because they are not just for idly observing others. They are for completing schoolwork and communicating with family. I understand that some people spend too much time on computers, but this is not the case for everyone. In my opinion, we should not discard computers as they are valuable for schoolwork and family communication. I believe that the appropriate course of action is not to eliminate computers.
995	997	1	1	"Numerous families across the globe utilize computers, whether they are from @LOCATION1 or all the way to the deserts of @LOCATION2. However, from @CAPS21's perspective, it is believed that being on a computer can have negative effects such as a lack of exercise. I can concur with this view to some extent, yet I firmly believe that computers can have a positive impact on society if used appropriately. On the positive side of computers, I believe there are numerous beneficial aspects, such as a wide range of activities available, the ability to learn from the internet, and high entertainment value. If you own a computer, I am certain you would agree that there are countless positive things you can do. For instance, I am aware of many online colleges. Have you ever heard the commercial, ""@CAPS1 in your @CAPS2's?"" This is where students can obtain their @CAPS3.E.D and embark on a successful career. Not only that, but you can also secure discounts on numerous items by shopping online. There are numerous online shopping platforms, such as @ORGANIZATION1. Furthermore, many stores like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have an online catalog where you can shop efficiently. Lastly, if you have close relatives or friends residing far away, there are numerous options available today, such as @CAPS6, (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9). Webcam programs allow you to see and converse with each other using a webcam, and @CAPS10 enables you to find your friends and keep track of their daily activities. These are all compelling reasons why computers contribute to the success of the economy. Some computers are used for entertainment purposes. Online, there are numerous @CAPS16 games you can play, such as @CAPS11's (@CAPS12 @CAPS13 Online @CAPS14 - @CAPS15 @CAPS16). I play many of these games, including @CAPS16 such as @CAPS17. I adore these games because they offer a highly engaging virtual world. You can also watch many of your favorite movies and amusing videos on the internet via @CAPS18. @CAPS18 is a globally - used platform where you can watch or upload videos for the world to see. An example of a @CAPS18 video is ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22,"" where a young boy is bitten by his younger brother. This entertainment system is also an excellent way to pass the time when you are bored. I can understand how people can become addicted to it, but you simply need to use it judiciously and establish a plan to use the computer, perhaps for an hour a day. A computer also provides numerous valuable learning resources, such as an online website with fun @CAPS16 games called @CAPS23. With this, you can play many enjoyable games while learning interesting scientific facts. In @CAPS21's science class, we frequently use this website to enhance our understanding of motion and gravity. You can also conduct research on the web, which is beneficial for many projects. I know I rely on the web for almost every project I undertake."
996	998	1	1	"Envision your existence bereft of the advantages proffered by @ORGANIZATION2, the computer. Do you surmise that it would render life marginally more arduous? Computers exert positive influences on individuals for educational purposes and as a novel means to cultivate @CAPS3 skills. @ORGANIZATION2 holds great significance for our society. Computers can assist with our educational requirements. When a school project is underway, more than @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION2 students utilize a computer to access the information they need. I concur that students rely excessively on computers rather than books, yet the computer offers more information than the average book. The computer, @CAPS1, enables us, as students, to expand our horizons. @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""nearly @PERCENT2 of @ORGANIZATION2 students learn something novel from a computer that they did not previously know."" @CAPS1, in @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4, a student can discover more information about a specific country than they could with a book. I anticipate that as a consequence of the informational access the computer provides, grades will soon increase by at least @NUM1 to @PERCENT3. In a survey conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, it was found that @PERCENT4 of @ORGANIZATION2 students located more relevant information on a selected topic than in the entire school library. Next, the computer can aid in hand - eye coordination for young children. In school, students are observed to assess the development of their coordination. With @PERCENT3 of @ORGANIZATION2 students having minimal coordination, computer games reduced the @PERCENT3 to @PERCENT5. The computer indeed helps meet the educational needs of students in @LOCATION1. The computer is an excellent way to socialize with friends. It is a novel and inventive mode of communication. I am aware that some @MONTH1 claim that there is less face - to - face interaction, but interacting on the computer still constitutes interaction. With a phone, one can only chat, but a computer is equipped with a webcam. This device allows for communication with some human interaction. Approximately @NUM2 to @NUM3 million @CAPS5 possess this device for use. It, @CAPS1, is pre - installed in many @ORGANIZATION3 and @ORGANIZATION4 laptops, providing us with portable access for communication. The CEO at @ORGANIZATION3 said that ""@CAPS6, the laptops have come with a built - in webcam; one out of every two laptops with it installed uses it for social chatting and business."" The computer can facilitate our communication for @CAPS3 or business needs. The computer is a good avenue to initiate and develop @CAPS3 skills. More than @PERCENT6 of @ORGANIZATION2 children use a computer to commence the development of their @CAPS3 skills. Computers enable numerous individuals to connect with one another in new and effective ways. In conclusion, the average computer can benefit our lives in positive ways. From our educational needs to our @CAPS3 needs, the computer positively impacts us in these two highly important aspects."
997	999	1	1	Dear Newspaper, contemplate your life sans computers. Crafting articles on a typewriter or by hand would undoubtedly be a nuisance. The query of whether computers are advantageous to society has emerged in the media, where it is contended that people spend less time exercising, interacting with nature, and with their families. Nevertheless, computers represent a significant advancement in modern science and are beneficial to communities. Computers have significantly assisted educationally in schools and at home, not to mention the effortless way of staying connected with friends and family. Moreover, computers offer a plethora of entertainment options. Computers are a remarkable step forward and are entirely beneficial to our society. Firstly, computers have contributed academically in our schools and residences. I cannot even fathom the inconvenience of returning home with an assignment or having to write two essays, only to pen them by hand! The desire to complete it promptly would only prompt me to rush, resulting in a poor grade. Additionally, consider the handwriting aspect. Most students in my school do not have legible handwriting, and I presume that teachers encounter difficulty grading work they cannot decipher. With programs such as @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2, you have the option of various fonts, colors, bolding, pictures, symbols, and so forth. Another way computers have aided academically is in schools. Increasingly, teachers are leveraging computers to facilitate our learning. Tests are taken on computers, websites for research are visited, and other @ORGANIZATION1 programs like PowerPoint can be employed for projects. Computers are highly beneficial in school while enabling us to learn significantly more. Computers also facilitate staying in touch with friends and family. The era of brief letters has been supplanted by lengthy emails with attached pictures, dispatched within seconds, traversing the internet to reach your friend's screen. People can save money by not having pictures developed but instead storing them on their computers, ready to be printed on bond paper. There have been advancements in communication through computers. Features such as video chat (vchat), where you can literally see and converse with the other person, or audio chat, where you can talk to the individual, have been introduced. Such effortless communication methods encourage people to communicate with family and friends and maintain contact. Computers have had a positive impact on the community by providing straightforward ways to communicate with loved ones. Computers can also offer a delightful source of entertainment on the web. Websites have been created where you can play games, reconnect with people from your past, or simply view amusing videos. Whatever you type into your toolbar instantaneously transforms into a page of links to websites where you can find details on your topic or related content. One entertaining website is 'YouTube'. This website allows people to upload videos. The possibilities on the web are endless. Another engaging website is '@CAPS3'. This website enables you to 'friend' people from your past and interact with them. You can post videos, write messages, and so on. As you can see, entertainment abounds on the web. The time has come to recognize the full benefits of computers. Computers are beneficial to modern - day society as they assist academically, encourage staying in touch with family and friends, and provide entertainment. We should all acknowledge that computers are a substantial advancement in science, are highly useful, and also enjoyable!
998	1000	1	1	"The influence that computers exert on humans is decidedly positive, and the remarkable intelligence they offer must be embraced rather than feared and shunned. Whether we are amenable to it or not, computers will be indispensable for resolving future issues. Moreover, for personal use, computers are highly advantageous. The primary reason people are apprehensive about computers is the radiation they emit, which, upon closer examination, is not a rational concern. Refraining from using such a sophisticated and developed system as the computer is entirely illogical; the computer is the future, pure and simple. It is inevitable that the computer and related technologies depict the future of our world. Whether people accept the concept or not, computers will be essential for solving the problems and disasters that will afflict the world over time. Computers can predict natural disasters, and as a result, people in the path of the catastrophe can be evacuated. Lives can be saved. Computers can calculate pollution margins and propose solutions to the substantial amount of pollution humans release into the air and @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1, nature can be preserved. Much more can be achieved by fully utilizing the computer. People must adapt to @LOCATION1 technology; otherwise, we will lag behind and witness our @CAPS1 slip away. This demonstrates that the impact of computers on people is not only positive but also necessary for progress in an ever - evolving world. Shifting from a global - scale impact to a more personal level also reveals that computers are beneficial to humans. In most cases, computers perform tasks more effectively and with fewer errors than humans. Instead of sending humans to dangerous locations such as deep waters, computers can be deployed to explore previously inaccessible areas. Additionally, rapid communication is extremely valuable in certain circumstances, such as when a workplace incident renders an area off - limits. A workplace member can simply email their employer, informing them of the situation accurately and preventing them from endangering themselves or sparing them the trouble of commuting to work. Even from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, with just the press of ""@CAPS2"", people across the globe can be informed of an accident. International communication, particularly through instant messaging, can strengthen our ties with other nations in both business and government. Lastly, obtaining information is incredibly easy with a @CAPS3. Where would we be without computers to quickly access information? We would still be visiting libraries, checking out books, and poring over page after page to find information that would take less than a minute on a computer. Even a person skeptical of computers would have to admit that they are highly beneficial. As you can see, even on a less global scale of use, the computer still has a positive impact on its users. The factor that fuels the negative perception of computers, especially among parents, is safety and reliability. When these two aspects are analyzed, it is straightforward to dispel concerns about the computer's unreliability and danger. Installing a program (of which there are countless options) that allows access to ""good"" websites and blocks potentially dangerous @CAPS4 eliminates the risks associated with online interactions. Even without software to block dangerous websites, computers are generally safe. Only @NUM1 out of @NUM2 websites contain content considered ""detrimental"" to humans. Moreover, @NUM4 of those @NUM2 websites provide reliable, accurate information. These two statistics dispel the doubts regarding safety and reliability that some users may have. This shows that the negative aspects of computers can be eliminated, leaving only the positives. In conclusion, computers have a far more positive influence on users than negative ones. Computers are the future and have even proven to save lives. Why would anyone not want to save a life? Additionally, the benefits of @CAPS3, or personal computers, are too substantial and useful to overlook. Lastly, upon careful consideration, computers are highly reliable and can be made extremely safe, which alleviates the primary concerns about them. We have come a long way in creating such a safe, beneficial, and necessary device; we must put it to use and, in doing so, improve our own lives and those of @ORGANIZATION1."
999	1001	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I opine that individuals should utilize computers for specific purposes. One rationale is that many people lose touch with family members or, more precisely, with others. When both you and someone else possess a computer, you can interact with them. For other purposes, such as playing online with fellow students or friends, computers are requisite. Moreover, typing provides an exercise for your fingers. Many of us young individuals claim that MySpace and Facebook are undesirable platforms. In actuality, they are not, as most of your family members are on them. Doctors frequently employ computers to notify other doctors about a patient's condition or to provide a visual of the patient's breathing. Workers use them to check for available jobs and apply for them. Students use computers to showcase their assignments when teachers are absent. If I were a carpenter or a real - estate agent, I would carry a computer with me. The reason is that my team would be informed about available or sold houses. I could present them with different housing options and offer favorable deals. I would also bring a computer for GPS to determine my location. People use computers for diverse reasons, such as accessing POG, cheat codes, @CAPS1 cards, and other items. My motivation for using a computer is that my work is of great importance to me. I would complete it on the computer if I missed it. This is why you should always have a computer. You never know what might occur. In conclusion, this elucidates why computers are highly essential. The reasons include using a computer when something happens to you and you do not have a phone. Additionally, it is beneficial that everyone has tasks to accomplish, and computers are the optimal means to do so.
1000	1002	1	1	Dear Local newspaper, I believe that computers are excellent resources. They offer instantaneous assistance when we need to find information. Computers are highly useful and user - friendly. Once you have mastered the computer, it seems as though you can perform almost any task on it. Although computers are remarkable, they can also have adverse effects on us. I like computers, yet I must state that I am opposed to excessive use. When people engage with their computers, it is as if they enter another realm. When using a computer, one is significantly less social than when not using it. I am unsure about you, but many individuals are addicted to their computers. They log on and remain online indefinitely. They act as if being on the computer daily is a necessity. I do not need to frequent computer websites like @CAPS1, and here's why. Computers can be extremely irritating at times. They are highly distracting. For instance, the other day, my sister and I intended to go for a @NUM1 - mile walk, but we did not because she was preoccupied with the computer and would not accompany me for exercise. In this economic climate, it is crucial to possess social skills. Instant messaging does not equate to developing social skills. One must actually venture out and engage in face - to - face conversations. When I spend excessive time on the computer, I am aware of it because my eyes start to ache. This is detrimental to your eyesight. People sit in their homes and stare at the bright screen. They may not realize it, but this can cause vision impairment, so they should limit their computer usage. These are some reasons why you should curtail computer use. I am not suggesting that computers are evil contraptions; I am simply advocating using them for information and work rather than for games and other non - essential activities. You could be outdoors having fun instead of sitting at home. Go out and make real - life friends in person.
1001	1003	1	1	Dear Newspaper, individuals ought to engage in activities with their family and friends rather than remaining engrossed in the computer constantly. By doing so, people would attain better physical fitness, foster closer familial bonds, and achieve superior academic performance in school. Undoubtedly, individuals will expedite their fitness progress through exercise instead of being glued to the computer. Once the computer is unplugged, everyone has the opportunity to venture outdoors and partake in recreational activities. When people go outside to play with their friends, they engage in physical exertion, which facilitates weight loss. A number of scientists opine that it is more beneficial to go outside and socialize than to sit idly in front of a computer, watching monotonous videos. People would lead more active lifestyles if they abstained from using the computer and spent time outdoors, as this would contribute to their physical and mental well - being, preventing them from succumbing to serious diseases. Stronger family bonds would be forged if people limited their computer usage. Families would draw closer together rather than being fragmented by the influence of computers. One's family is always there to offer solace during difficult times. They will assist in overcoming any obstacles, enabling one to persevere. If one were to rely on the computer for support, all they would see is a person's face on the screen, unable to provide a comforting hug. Without the constant distraction of computers, families can develop deeper connections based on love and mutual support. Conversely, excessive computer use drives families apart. Moreover, closer - knit families also play a pivotal role in helping children excel academically. Families that eschew computer use and share meals together typically have children who achieve better grades. A significant number of scientists concur that children who have dinner and play with their families perform better in school. If children can improve their academic performance by staying off the computer and spending quality time with their families, it could potentially lead to remarkable inventions that benefit humanity in countless ways. All of these positive outcomes can be realized by simply reducing computer usage. Staying away from computers is an excellent means of self - improvement and a way to enhance the well - being of others. It promotes physical fitness, strengthens relationships, and nurtures a new generation of graduates capable of making groundbreaking inventions. Just imagine the possibilities that await if we all limit our computer time.
1002	1004	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, despite the prevalence of computers in many households, some individuals contend that computers offer limited assistance. There are indeed several advantages to using computers, such as the ability to conduct information searches, develop hand - eye coordination, and maintain organizational efficiency. However, computers also present certain drawbacks. For instance, children often spend excessive time on computers instead of engaging in outdoor activities, playing with friends, and maintaining physical fitness. I concur that computers have a positive impact on children. Not only do they enable children to stay in touch with distant family members, but they also facilitate the efficient completion of projects. It appears that while one is seemingly engaged in a single task on the computer, they can simultaneously upload pictures and movies, download music, and play games. Given all that I have shared with you on @DATE1, I sincerely hope that we share a similar perspective on the benefits of computers and their positive contributions.
1003	1005	1	1	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, while experts claim that computers are ""dominating people,"" I firmly disagree. Individuals allocate the necessary and desired amount of time to computer use and then engage in physical activities or spend quality time with family and friends. Computers empower people to learn and communicate with family and friends. Additionally, many professionals utilize computers for work - related purposes. I firmly believe that computers, like in my own experience, serve as valuable learning tools. One can acquire knowledge on a wide range of subjects using a computer. For example, one can explore different countries, read news articles, learn various languages, and gain insights into the world. Online platforms provide numerous opportunities for communication. Skype allows users to interact with others via webcam while connected to the internet. Instant messengers, such as @CAPS3, offer real - time conversations akin to face - to - face interactions. Email, on the other hand, enables the transmission of letters, photos, and comments. Many professionals rely on computers for work. Microsoft @CAPS4 facilitates the creation of stories and letters, and professionals often use it to generate job reports. The internet also proves invaluable for work, as websites and search engines offer a wealth of information. In conclusion, computers enable people to learn, communicate with friends and family, and assist professionals in their work and report - writing tasks. I hope this letter has influenced you to recognize the positive aspects of computers."
1004	1006	1	1	"I sauntered into my bedroom and noticed the computer perched on an exquisite desk. I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial. There is an ongoing debate regarding whether computers are advantageous or detrimental to society. In my view, computers are useful, and I wholeheartedly support this technology. Computers are outstanding tools that can aid students in their academic pursuits. For example, this year, I had a science project exploring the relationship between my hobbies and science. As reading is one of my interests, I needed to research how reading a simple book could be linked to science. I accessed the internet, typed in my query about reading, and within seconds, thousands of results appeared, accompanied by some pictures. A few days after submitting my project, I received it back with a @NUM1 grade! Clearly, the ability to use a computer significantly enhanced my science grade. Without the internet, achieving an A on this project would have been extremely challenging. As demonstrated, computers can support students in their school projects and other academic tasks. Moreover, this technology can help people reconnect with friends and family. In elementary school, my friend @PERSON1 moved to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2. I had no means of contacting her until I discovered an online chatting program. Both of us started using it, and we have been able to converse continuously. Although I don't see @PERSON1 as frequently as before, I can chat with her online almost daily with my computer in my bedroom. Computers can re - establish old relationships, and communicating through them is an added benefit. Using computers can also enrich people's minds. For instance, in school, we use a program called ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4."" This program involves playing games to improve certain skills and taking tests when ready. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4"" has been instrumental in helping us prepare for the @ORGANIZATION1's. After taking numerous tests in science, math, and language arts, I now feel confident about taking the @ORGANIZATION1's and believe I will perform well. As evident, the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 program on the computer can have a positive impact on school grades. In conclusion, computers have a beneficial effect on people and contribute to the betterment of society. I advocate that more citizens should own computers as they can expand one's knowledge. I am unequivocally in favor of owning and using computers."
1005	1007	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, in contemporary society, computers have brought about numerous positive changes in our daily lives. People have been able to forge stronger connections with family and friends and even establish new relationships. While social networks are highly beneficial, computers also streamline work processes and lend a professional touch to various tasks. Additionally, computer use can enhance hand - eye coordination. Nevertheless, the question remains: Is the computer a harmful or helpful device? At times, we wonder about the whereabouts and well - being of long - lost friends and relatives. Thanks to computers and internet access, we can effortlessly reach out to them through popular social networks like @CAPS1. I often hear stories of successful reunions and reconnections. Moreover, in addition to reuniting with old friends, one can easily make new ones with just a click of a button. Isn't it remarkable how simple it has become to expand our social circles? Computers today offer exceptional software from @ORGANIZATION2, which simplifies the creation of slideshows, projects, and reports. I recall working on a @CAPS2 with my best friend in @NUM1 grade. We simply took pictures, uploaded them to his laptop, and added captions. The result was a professional - looking project that earned us an A -. Although I acknowledge that excessive computer use may reduce the time people spend outdoors, this technological advancement can improve hand - eye coordination. Consider this scenario: You're at bat in a baseball game. With a count of @NUM2 strikes and @NUM3 balls, the crowd is cheering you on. The pitcher throws the ball, and you swing the bat, hitting a home run! The skill that enabled you to hit the ball is hand - eye coordination. As people deliberate on the impact of computers, recall how effortlessly I completed my project. Also, think of the baseball player who used hand - eye coordination to hit a home run. Most importantly, remember how easily you can stay in touch with your loved ones. The computer is an invaluable advancement in society, and everyone should recognize its positive contributions.
1006	1008	1	1	Dear Editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it is indeed true that an increasing number of individuals utilize computers, a fact of which you are surely cognizant. However, is @CAPS3 truly necessary? I, too, use my computer; I was once an incessant user. Nevertheless, I subsequently became engrossed in sports such as skateboarding and snowboarding, thus distancing myself from @CAPS3. Yet, there remain numerous individuals who continue to use them. I firmly believe that people should endeavor to curtail their computer usage, as excessive time spent on it can lead to significant weight gain, akin to @PERSON1. There are far more worthwhile activities than idling away on the computer all day, and it is highly beneficial to venture outdoors and breathe in the fresh air.  Firstly, prolonged computer use can result in substantial weight gain, which is decidedly detrimental. Obesity can be truly disheartening as those affected often have limited control over it, and I genuinely empathize with them. I have several friends who are overweight, similar to @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a severely overweight child; he weighed approximately @NUM1 lbs at the age of @NUM2. I haven't seen him in about a year, and we shared some wonderful moments. However, I feel deeply sorry for him as his excessive weight is truly unfortunate. @PERSON1 doesn't even know how to ride a bike, and no one would teach him anyway since he lacks a father, and his mother and sister are also overweight.  In essence, being overweight is undesirable, and excessive computer use exacerbates the situation. Secondly, there are infinitely more rewarding activities than spending the entire day in front of the computer. Wasting time on the computer all day is tantamount to squandering one's life. Instead of being glued to the screen, one could socialize with friends, whether it's shopping or engaging in sports. These activities involve physical movement, which is far superior to computer use. Trust me on this. Go for a walk or engage in some other enjoyable yet non - computer - related activity. While the computer does offer numerous amusements, there are countless other things to do.  Most importantly, spending time outdoors and inhaling fresh air is highly beneficial. Being outside is truly remarkable; one could be walking, bouncing on a trampoline, or skateboarding. Any of these activities surpasses computer use. Even simply sitting on a rock outside is beneficial for the body as it allows one to intake fresh air. So, all you computer enthusiasts, step away from the screen and have some fun outdoors with your friends and family. I earnestly hope you heed my advice. Remember, excessive computer use can lead to weight gain, there are better things to do than sit in front of the computer all day, and spending time outdoors and breathing fresh air is highly advantageous.
1007	1009	1	1	"Has your offspring ever inquired about obtaining a computer for school? Were you perplexed when they mentioned @CAPS2 in the school context, stating that it can enhance hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning from distant locations, or even enable communication with individuals worldwide? What were your thoughts on this? Did you concur? If so, you were likely focusing on the positive aspects while overlooking the negative ones. There are multiple reasons why I dissent. These include safety, cost, and health concerns.  Many individuals assert that interacting with others is beneficial, but not incessantly. If your child interacts with strangers, would you be apprehensive? They may be asked personal questions such as their identity and place of residence. Sometimes, they are even invited to meet in person. My acquaintance @PERSON2 recounted that her school acquired those computers, and her friend @PERSON3 was asked to meet someone she had never met before. @PERSON3 agreed, but @PERSON2 reported that she never showed up. Would you want such an incident to befall your child? This is merely the beginning.  Once your child's school procures computers, they may become addicted to @CAPS2. @PERSON1 opined that ""if a child fails to embrace their childhood and instead fixates solely on homework, spending all their time eating and using the computer, they will eventually become obese."" It is of utmost importance that your child ventures outdoors, has fun, and engages in physical activity; otherwise, they will be glued to the computers @NUM1. Have you ever contemplated this?  Another aspect is the financial burden. The school will have to allocate a substantial amount of funds, and if your child damages the computers, you will also be liable for a significant expense. Moreover, just because your child's school gets computers doesn't mean it will bring substantial benefits. I wholeheartedly and sincerely believe that students should not be provided with computers. Additionally, students' computers may @MONTH1 contract viruses due to inappropriate websites, and you will have to bear the cost of resolving these issues. Lastly, the school may face a shortage of funds for essential materials. What would you do then? Your child's purpose at school is education, not computer addiction. Do you still support the provision of computers? I sincerely hope not, as there is a @PERCENT1 chance that they may or may not get @CAPS2. Hopefully, I have provided you with sufficient information regarding safety, cost, and health concerns. This is a pressing matter, so please remain vigilant."
1008	1010	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I have recently been made aware that there is a view advocating for people to use computers. My three key arguments in support of this are that computers can enhance hand - eye coordination, enable individuals to learn about distant places and people, and even facilitate online communication.  Computers enhance hand - eye coordination because as individuals type on the keyboard, with increased frequency and speed of typing, their coordination improves. Initially, people become accustomed to typing, then they start typing more rapidly, and ultimately, this heightened typing proficiency leads to enhanced hand - eye coordination.  Using computers empowers people to learn about far - flung places and individuals. By conducting searches on platforms like Google, users can access a plethora of websites. When they enter a person's name and location on a particular website, it provides detailed information about that person and their place of origin.  Computers also enable people to communicate with others from different locations through platforms such as AIM, MySpace, or Facebook. Moreover, users can play games and interact simultaneously, which is why computers are extremely popular at present. The diverse functions that people can perform on these websites are the reasons why I believe people should use computers.  In conclusion, I have been informed that there are three compelling reasons for people to use computers: they enhance hand - eye coordination, enable learning about distant places and people, and facilitate online communication. Therefore, I recommend that people make use of computers.
1009	1011	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Do you own a computer at home? Currently, over @PERCENT1 of the population possesses at least one computer at home. While computers have become ubiquitous, there is an ongoing debate regarding their necessity in our society. In fact, computers can have adverse effects on individuals, including impaired eyesight, the risk of interacting with strangers online, and a lack of outdoor physical activity.  Presently, one in five individuals wears glasses or contact lenses, and the prevalence of this is increasing at an alarming rate. Both children and adults are spending excessive amounts of time on computers, which is contributing to the deterioration of eyesight. Prolonged computer use can cause eye pain and headaches. These are clear indicators of overexposure, yet people often disregard them, either to complete work or due to addiction to online video games. This clearly demonstrates the detrimental impact of computers on society.  When a person is online, there are few restrictions. The internet offers access to an infinite number of websites, not all of which are trustworthy. The online realm is populated by millions of unrelated individuals, i.e., strangers. Interacting with strangers can be extremely perilous as they may have a negative influence, and there is no guarantee of safety unless the person is a teacher or of a similar authoritative position. Unfortunately, it is impossible to fully trust anyone online as their true identity is often unknown. For example, on Facebook, users may believe their profiles are private, but in reality, much of the content they upload or post is accessible to the public. Even non - friends can view a person's profile, which poses a significant security risk.  The rate of internet addiction is also on the rise. Those addicted to the internet tend to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities. This lack of exercise is extremely unhealthy, and they often rely on fast food for meals, which further exacerbates the problem. As a result, people who spend excessive time on computers are prone to weight gain due to an unbalanced diet and a lack of interaction with the outside world and nature.  In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on society. They contribute to an increase in the number of people with impaired eyesight, create an unsafe online environment, and lead to unbalanced diets and a sedentary lifestyle.
1010	1012	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper Writer, I am writing to discuss the utility of computers. I firmly believe that computers offer substantial benefits to our communities. My rationale is threefold: they can alert us to natural disasters, provide comprehensive knowledge, and facilitate online communication.  Firstly, computers play a crucial role in warning us about natural disasters. They are capable of detecting impending disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. For instance, during Hurricane Katrina, computers were able to forecast the event, enabling many people to evacuate the city in time. Statistics indicate that computers can identify @PERCENT1 of natural disasters. This ability to predict and warn saves countless lives. Similarly, in the case of the recent earthquakes in @LOCATION1, computers provided timely information to the public.  Secondly, computers are an invaluable source of knowledge. They can teach us about virtually anything, from distant places to new words and current events in our own country. For example, when conducting research for a project, simply typing a person's name into a search engine can yield a wealth of information. The vast amount of data available on computers is truly astonishing. Whether it's information about a specific person or a wide range of other topics, computers have everything one needs.  Lastly, computers enable us to communicate online, which has both advantages and disadvantages. Online communication is highly enjoyable as there are numerous platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. It allows us to connect with old friends, family members, and a wide range of people. However, one must exercise caution as there are potential risks. For example, if it's not possible to meet a friend in person, one can use platforms like @ORGANIZATION1 or ooVoo for video communication. The computer can be a great companion, so we should make the most of it.  In conclusion, I believe that computers simplify our lives significantly. They alert us to natural disasters, educate us on a vast array of subjects, and enable us to communicate with others online.
1011	1013	1	1	I opine that individuals ought not to squander an excessive amount of time on the computer. There are three rationales for this stance. Firstly, if one remains on the computer for an extended period, it can impair one's vision. Secondly, one could be utilizing that time to engage with family and friends. Lastly, those who sit in front of a computer all day tend to gain more weight. Initially, I firmly believe people should refrain from spending the entire day on the computer. Prolonged computer use can disrupt one's vision because constantly gazing at a computer screen can cause eye damage. I contend that one should never spend more than an hour on a computer. Moreover, one can often discern when they have been on the computer too long as their eyes start to ache. My second reason for discouraging long - term computer use is that while one is sitting there engrossed in what they are doing, they are missing out on enjoyable activities that could be shared with family or friends. Regrettably, some individuals prefer to sit all day and stare at a computer screen, and as a result, they begin to dislike going out or even being sociable. My final reason is that some people simply sit at the computer and consume food throughout the day. This leads to weight gain, which can complicate their lives as they are no longer healthy, merely sitting idle all day. Instead, they should be outdoors, running around. These are the three reasons I believe people should not remain on the computer all day: it impairs vision, causes one to miss out on quality time with family, and leads to weight gain when sitting at the computer for extended periods.
1012	1014	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever contemplated people's perspectives on certain technologies? While some assert that others squander excessive time on their computers, I am of the view that computers can assist us in numerous ways. They can aid with homework, facilitate interaction with others, and even support us in our fitness endeavors. Ultimately, you will discover that computers prove to be advantageous for everyone. For numerous students, computers are indispensable for comprehending their academic subjects. There are specific websites that offer online lessons. Additionally, they provide online books, enabling students to complete their homework even if they forget their physical textbooks. My math teacher, @PERSON2, frequently instructs, ""@CAPS1 into the online site."" I have found this to be extremely beneficial when grappling with my schoolwork. Moreover, we can seek assistance from our friends if we still @CAPS4't understand. This is not all that computers can do. There are specific platforms like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 where we can interact with others. One can communicate with them when they are out of town and without a cell - phone. Additionally, when the phone is in use and there is something important to convey, such as helping with homework, these platforms can be utilized. Even when there is no telephone reception, over a million people in the @LOCATION1 use these sites to communicate. Those who claim that computers detract from exercise time are mistaken. Many websites offer excellent advice on weight loss. They present various dieting plans, such as those advocated by @PERSON3 or @PERSON1. Not only that, but they also provide exercise regimens. It is not the computer's fault; rather, it is the individuals who @CAPS4't ""adhere"" to an exercise routine. Furthermore, the computer recommends many outstanding gyms, such as @LOCATION2 fitness. @CAPS4't you consider this a favorable ""proposition?"" @CAPS4't heed those naysayers; adhere to my belief that computers are beneficial for everyone. They can assist us in countless ways, far beyond our expectations. I cannot envision life without them, as the majority of people utilize computers. Thank you for reading."
1013	1015	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I dissent from those who advocate for technological advancements and believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Would you prefer to vegetate in front of the computer or engage with friends, travel to places you once deemed unattainable, or even visit a gym to shed some pounds? I opt for spending time with friends! Individuals who relish traveling to distant locales and having adventures would undoubtedly choose that over squandering time on a computer. Although people enjoy perusing the fascinating places they discover on the internet, what is the point of merely sitting and staring at the screen when one could purchase a plane ticket and journey to the enchanting destination seen on the computer? I understand that traveling to far - off places can be intimidating, especially if you have never visited such an area. However, @CAPS3 is worth the attempt. If flying is not your preference, then why not attempt exercise? Perhaps @MONTH1 you have been striving to lose some excess weight. You could give it a try. Consider this: my mother used exercise to fit into a size @NUM1, and now she has achieved that goal. Why subject yourself to the tedium of computers that may offer inaccurate advice when you can seek counsel from a friend? A real, living, breathing friend! Losing weight can boost your confidence if you make the effort. As @PERSON1 from @CAPS2 lower stated, you must desire @CAPS3 if you wish to achieve your goal. Everyone can pursue this objective! Maybe you are not inclined to exercise; perhaps you prefer to spend time with your friends and family. If you waste your time chatting online, how will you engage with the people right in front of you? Just because you can communicate online does not necessarily mean you can interact effectively in real life. Some people can, while others cannot. I am an outgoing person, and I know how to communicate online if I choose to. So, why can't you? The time has come to decide. Do you want to spend your time on the computer or in the real world? Rise from your chair, turn off the computer, put on your shoes, and step outside. Use your voice instead of your hands. Communicate with people; it is not difficult. Trust me. If I can do it, you can too! It is now or never. I choose now, and so should you. Do not waste any more time. Go on a trip, hang out with friends. Just do it. Do not retreat to the computer. You can live without it.
1014	1016	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, An increasing number of individuals are utilizing computers; however, not everyone concurs that this trend is beneficial to society, and I am among those who oppose it. I dissent because spending excessive time on the computer causes one to neglect certain aspects of life. For instance, one forgets to exercise, overlooks the beauty of nature, and fails to interact with friends and family. I assure you that if you continue reading, you will comprehend and appreciate my perspective. People allocate an inordinate amount of time to computers and do not exercise as they should. Exercise is of utmost importance as it promotes growth and strengthens the body. If one spends the entire day on the computer, they will not exercise adequately and may not develop properly. Another reason I consider excessive computer use a poor idea is that it prevents one from enjoying nature. When one is glued to the computer, they cannot embark on a hike in the woods or go on a camping trip. They miss out on the pleasures of being in the refreshing natural environment. Last but not least, excessive computer use causes one to forget to interact with friends and family. This is crucial because while a computer can teach a great deal, it cannot express love and affection like family and friends can. For example, only your family and friends can say ""I love you"" in a meaningful way. Hopefully, you will understand and recognize my point of view. People should cease this behavior as it leads to neglect of exercise, nature, and quality time with friends and family. I sincerely thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts."
1015	1017	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I am of the conviction that individuals should not devote an excessive amount of time to computers because it leads to reduced physical activity, diminished interaction with friends and family, and is detrimental to their health. Spending too much time on computers means that people fail to savor the life outside their homes. My primary reason for opposing excessive computer use is its adverse impact on health. Prolonged computer use can strain the eyes. Some individuals, including myself, who suffer from seizures may experience an attack and lose focus. Extended computer sessions can also impair vision and harm the body. In my opinion, this is highly unwholesome. Another drawback of excessive computer use is the lack of interaction with family and friends. Constantly being on the computer can cause one to forget to spend quality time with loved ones. People may become addicted to the computer, neglecting to greet their family members or inquire about their well - being. As a result, friends may start to ignore them, believing that they do not care. This excessive computer use disrupts one's social activities. My final reason is that excessive computer use prevents one from enjoying nature. People fail to realize how much they are missing while being glued to the computer. Although the computer can be a source of knowledge, there is no substitute for firsthand experience. Spending too much time on the computer discourages exercise, which is essential for a healthy body. One may forget to go for a jog or explore new things. In fact, exploring nature is far more rewarding than merely observing it on a screen. These are the reasons I believe excessive computer use is harmful: it is unhealthy, disrupts social interaction with friends and family, and prevents one from enjoying nature. Therefore, one should step away from the computer and embrace the gifts of life.
1016	1018	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, if one were to cast their mind back a couple of decades, prior to the advent of computers, what would they behold? There were children outdoors engaging in physical activity, socializing with peers, and leading relatively peril - free lives. Then, the computer emerged. Computers are steering the next generation towards a hazardous existence of fixating on an array of pixels throughout the day, while simultaneously undermining any civilized relationships they once had. I firmly believe that computers exert a detrimental influence on society. Did you know that as the quantity of computers sold rises, the obesity rate has increased by @PERCENT1 since computers entered our lives? Why is this so? Because individuals spend an inordinate amount of time on computers and insufficient time exercising! Another consequence of the prolonged hours spent in front of a screen is a decline in eyesight. My family friend, @PERSON2, had to acquire glasses as his eyes were damaged by the computer. ""I'm anxious about my daughter's eyes... she gazes at that screen for hours on end!"" exclaimed @CAPS2 @PERSON3, a concerned parent at @ORGANIZATION1. How could something so deleterious possibly be beneficial for our society? Speaking of harm, the internet is highly unsafe. Predators prowl the web, seeking out young, innocent individuals to encounter and most likely exploit. @PERCENT2 of parents have been monitoring their children's computer usage, yet many are unaware that the internet facilitates communication with anyone in the world, from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2! Monitoring would also prove invaluable when it comes to inappropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is all too easy to be surfing the web and stumble upon content one should not be viewing! Lastly, people readily become ensnared in the anonymity of a computer and utter cruel, hurtful remarks that they would never dare to say in person. These unfortunate circumstances give rise to numerous interpersonal issues today. Speaking of which, computers have a profoundly negative impact on relationships in contemporary times. As I mentioned earlier, a multitude of disputes occur through computer - mediated communication. Even if online conversations are amicable, they accustom people to interacting ""@CAPS3"" through a computer, rather than face - to - face. After being involved in a computer - centric friendship, people tend to forget how to conduct themselves in person and find personal meetings awkward. @PERSON1, an eighth - grader at @ORGANIZATION1, lamented, ""I can't @CAPS5 merely communicating through computers, never behaving civilly with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is the direction in which computers are leading us..."" @CAPS5 never seeing your best friend in the flesh, only via technology! It @MONTH1 not even be your friend. It could be a dangerous impostor! This is yet another problem... through the internet, you @MONTH1 not even know the identity of those in such relationships! It could be a sham, and you'd have no inkling. Spending the entire day sedentary in front of a computer, endangering oneself and relationships, is, regrettably, the outcome of computer use. Computers are not worth the abysmal consequences that civilization must endure. I @CAPS6 earnestly implore you to halt the technological advancements now, before it's too late! Effect the change today."
1017	1019	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I extend my sincere gratitude in advance for dedicating your time to perusing this letter; it holds great significance for me. I am penning this missive because it has come to my attention that some individuals assert that computers do not contribute to the betterment of society. Those individuals are gravely mistaken! Computers are truly remarkable! They enable more efficient research; I can explore other countries and engage in online conversations. I partake in these activities almost daily! We are currently concluding a rather substantial research assignment for English and Social Studies. It entailed gathering note - cards from diverse sources. Fortunately, I was able to utilize the card catalog on the computer and locate numerous books on my topic simply by entering the keyword! We can refine our options with ease as we can conduct highly specific searches. After identifying our topic, we can assess the reliability of the information by reading a summary. All of this can be accomplished in approximately @NUM1 minutes or less. This would be nearly unfeasible without a computer. I have several relatives in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. Some time ago, my family and I were planning a trip to @LOCATION2 to visit them. We were able to employ a search engine and obtain directions from the airport to their residence. It provided us with the directions and an estimated travel time. I have also been able to conduct extensive research on other foreign countries at the mere press of a button. It is incredibly straightforward and convenient! My two uncles reside in @LOCATION1. On Thanksgiving, my mother was distraught because she missed them. I was then able to set up a video chat so that my mom could converse with them. This is truly wonderful; it is so convenient to be able to instant - message. I can communicate with people worldwide at no cost! In conclusion, computers are extremely useful as they allow us to learn about foreign countries, access research effortlessly, and engage in online communication. There is an extensive list of other attributes that make computers outstanding, but it would take an inordinate amount of time to enumerate them all. Thank you again for your attention.
1018	1020	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I opine that computers have a favorable influence on individuals. My initial rationale is that some college students are far from home, such as my sister, and my family communicates with her via the computer. Moreover, numerous individuals possess an email account! This informs them about sales at grocery stores or clothing outlets, and using those coupons saves people money. Statistics indicate that adults who use the computer at night feel more alert in the @TIME1. My second reason is that if someone is planning a vacation or relocating, they can access the internet to ascertain whether the destination is safe or if it has a good school. They can also conduct research on the place and visualize what it looks like. They can also gather information about colleges, assess their quality, determine if they are small institutions, and learn about the student population, among other things. My third and final reason is that when people use the computer, their hand - eye coordination improves. As they type, they are moving their fingers, developing a tactile sense, and increasing their typing speed. Additionally, they are not merely sitting idly; they are engaging their fingers and exercising their brains. Scholastic Kids reports that children who use the computer and the keyboard can improve their @CAPS1 by @NUM1 points. In conclusion, I do not believe that computers have a negative impact. After reading this, I hope you concur with me.
1019	1021	1	1	I contend that it is acceptable for people to spend a significant amount of time on the computer rather than engaging in exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends because it is an individual's prerogative to either remain on the computer all day or venture outdoors. Computers impact people's lives in both positive and negative ways. Some individuals stay indoors all day, doing nothing but clicking buttons. On the positive side, computers educate in numerous ways. When @CAPS1 one is on the computer, watching or reading engaging content, they may end up learning something before encountering it in school. It is beneficial to use the computer for a short period, but if @CAPS1 one is on it all day, they may lack exercise and become indolent and overweight. However, if @CAPS1 one goes outside occasionally, they need not worry as they are getting the exercise that benefits their body. I believe that computers are an excellent source of entertainment. One can chat with friends, and if @CAPS1 they have a webcam, they can engage in video chats. A computer is an outstanding means of communication. Millions of people utilize computers for work at their @CAPS2. Without computers, life would be exponentially more arduous for people in this world. Professionals like accountants rely on computers for their jobs. They store data in the computer to retain information that @CAPS1 could not be recorded on paper. People also create websites on the internet for educational purposes; for instance, if @CAPS1 one types in a word, it may provide a definition. People also develop @CAPS4 engines, which are search mechanisms on websites that look for the information one types in. If @CAPS1 one types in something, they will obtain what they are seeking. My overarching point in explaining this is that it is an individual's choice @CAPS1 whether they wish to be on the computer all the time. Since computers and internet connections are not free, and it does not harm one's brain; instead, it primarily educates it. People even pursue online education, learning and studying materials available on the internet. Additionally, one can secure @CAPS2 at places for working with computers, create programs, and achieve whatever they desire. Therefore, my stance is that it is acceptable to spend a great deal of time on the computer instead of exercising, visiting friends and family, and enjoying nature. I believe that computers are beneficial, and it does not matter how long one uses them, as long as @CAPS1 they are learning and not merely playing games all day and becoming lazy and overweight.
1020	1022	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: Are computers having a positive impact on society? As technology progresses, humans are becoming increasingly reliant on them; the majority of people use them on a daily basis. I am of the opinion that computers have a positive influence on people as they assist in writing papers, serve as a social tool, and facilitate research. After reading this letter, there will be no doubt that computers have a positive impact on individuals in society. My first reason for believing that computers have a positive effect on people is their aid in paper - writing. Whether it is crafting a resume, a science report, or a spreadsheet, none of these are typically hand - written nowadays. Everyone anticipates seeing the immaculately printed letters on the printer paper in any written work. This benefits the writers as writing often requires multiple drafts to perfect a piece; it is a laborious task to write each draft by hand. Additionally, it is easier to read someone's writing when @CAPS1 it is typed, especially when @CAPS1 the writer has poor penmanship. However, computers offer more than just assistance with writing papers. My second reason for believing that computers have a positive impact on people is their role as a social tool. Many online platforms today feature social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace. On these and numerous other websites, people can meet others through mutual friends and games. The advantage of meeting people online is that one does not need to schedule a meeting time; when @CAPS1 both parties are online, they can commence chatting. This chatting is also beneficial when @CAPS1 people have long - distance relationships, whether they are friendships, romantic partnerships, or family connections. Online chatting helps people stay in touch with those they may not see regularly. This significantly enhances everyone's social life. Moreover, online platforms like eHarmony or Match.com help individuals with limited time for dating find their ideal partners. This also enables shy people to get married and start families, contributing to happier lives, another positive outcome. Finally, computers have a positive impact on people by simplifying research. My father often remarks, ""You kids have it easy. When @CAPS1 I was growing up, we had to go to the library and spend hours researching before we could write our papers."" Nowadays, it is straightforward. Using the internet and a search engine, all one has to do is enter a topic, and they can access the latest articles within seconds. Libraries may not have the most up - to - date books, or the book on one's topic may be checked out. Then what can one do? The internet is also extremely useful when @CAPS1 the research topic is highly specific, such as a particular bacteria or species that a book @MONTH1 may only briefly mention. The internet has a much wider range of articles, making it easier to find information on any topic. With research taking less time to complete, people can spend more time enjoying the day, such as engaging in outdoor activities, rather than being stressed in the library because they cannot find the relevant book. This is a compelling reason why computers should not be regarded as having a negative impact on society. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on society as they assist in writing papers, serve as a social tool, and simplify research. Where would we be if we had to handwrite everything? Consider how many fewer friends or relationships we would have without social websites. And think about how hours of research are now just @CAPS3 two clicks away. Computers have improved our lives, and we should appreciate all that they do for us."
1021	1023	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you today to express my sentiments regarding the impact of computers on individuals. Computers wield a profound influence on people. They can lead to weight gain, cause eye - related issues, and even prevent one from paying bills. We are all aware that weight gain is a common occurrence in life, and it can be reversed. However, if one spends six hours a day on a computer, there is insufficient time to prepare a nutritious meal. Consequently, one tends to consume excessive junk food. Do you truly wish to be the cause of someone's obesity? Imagine gazing at a bright computer screen for six consecutive hours. Do you believe your eyes will remain unharmed? I beg to differ. When I make a real effort, I can scarcely keep my eyes open, and I am certain you cannot claim your eyes will be fine after staring at a bright screen in the dark. Can you envision quitting your job simply because you decide to work from home, yet fail to complete your tasks and get fired? How will you pay your bills without an income? Once your power is cut off, you are left with nothing to do, all because of your computer. Now, what will you do with your life? Well, that's all. I would like to thank you for your time. And I hope you concur with me on these three points: weight gain, eye problems, and the challenge of paying bills.
1022	1024	1	1	"You are the @NUM1 visitor. Click here to claim your prize! It is a common phenomenon that @CAPS4 ads appear on computers. These ads can introduce viruses and enable individuals to access your personal information. This is one reason why computers can be detrimental. Additionally, ""@CAPS1 @DATE1, more than @NUM2 kids are abducted each day!"" according to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of the missing child agency. Abductions occur when @CAPS1 kids enter @CAPS6 rooms and put themselves in jeopardy. Moreover, our excessive reliance on computers is unhealthy. ""@CAPS4 ads give rise to numerous problems,"" states @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 @CAPS5. More than @PERCENT1 @DATE1 of the world's population owns computers, as per a global poll in @DATE1. More than @PERCENT2 @DATE1 of these are kids. When children are on computers, they frequently click on @CAPS4 ads, which can lead to catastrophic consequences. People's computers become infected with viruses, identities are stolen, and credit card information is compromised. As a result, you may scold your children, but you cannot blame them as they merely thought they would receive a free Xbox @NUM3. Now that I have discussed @CAPS4 ads, let me talk about chatting. Chatting on a computer is like a ticking time - bomb. ""@CAPS6 rooms are the primary culprit."" Now, let me discuss our over - reliance on computers. Instead of searching for information about a book online, simply read it! Everyone assumes that a computer is the solution to every problem, but in reality, @PERCENT3 @DATE1 of the information on the internet is false, according to Technology @CAPS7, a magazine that focuses on the drawbacks of technology. I recall needing to check if my flight to @LOCATION1 was canceled. I searched on Google, and the website indicated it was canceled. However, when I called the airport to confirm, they informed me that the flight had departed as scheduled! Instead of sending an email, send a letter! Do you want your kids to be abducted because of @CAPS6 rooms? Of course not. And do you want to miss your vacation flight? I think not. Computers are often misused, and we should rely on them less and do things independently."
1023	1025	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers exert a positive influence on people. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow individuals with the ability to explore distant places and cultures, and even facilitate online communication with others. Computers are among the most remarkable technological inventions that have benefited society. Firstly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination. For example, when you are in a hurry to type a lengthy and outstanding essay, you won't have the luxury of constantly looking back and forth between your paper, the keyboard, and the screen. Therefore, you need to be familiar with the location of the keys. Conversely, it would be extremely troublesome if you lacked computer knowledge and were unaware of the key positions. Secondly, people can gain knowledge about far - off places. If someone wishes to embark on a relaxing vacation or honeymoon with their spouse, they need to know the weather forecast to pack appropriate clothing and determine the amount of money required to visit the finest restaurants and trendy stores in a densely populated city. Undoubtedly, I would love to take a vacation, but if it is prohibitively expensive, I may have to reconsider this wonderful trip. Lastly, you can engage in online conversations with others. On frigid days when you cannot go outside or call someone because you don't have a phone, you can use platforms like MySpace or Facebook as long as you have a @NUM1 and a unique email address. Now, it's time to make a decision! Do computers have a positive or negative impact on people? In my opinion, computers are invaluable to society, and we should continue to embrace them as they improve hand - eye coordination, enable us to learn about distant places and people, and allow us to communicate with friends and family online. This is truly a remarkable form of technology that people should possess.
1024	1026	1	1	"Dear trained @ORGANIZATION1 reader, @CAPS1! Ah, I relish the sound of my computer powering on when I wake up. It is such a delightful sound. Some individuals feel compelled to disagree and claim that computers are harmful to people. However, I consider the computer to be a magnificent invention. All forms of @CAPS2 can enhance hand - eye coordination. You can access any information in the world, and you can even meet new people and maintain contact with friends living far away. The world is just a click away! What if you need to write a paper on how to play baseball and improve your pitching skills simultaneously? There's no need to worry; you can simply type the paper on the computer. This is one of the many advantages of owning a computer. Typing a paper is significantly faster than writing it by hand. Studies indicate that typing a paper is @PERCENT1 faster than writing it out. Even @PERSON1, an advocate of handwriting, states, ""@CAPS2 is much easier than having to write! I type all my books instead of using proper handwriting."" It has been reported by experts that many handwriting enthusiasts are switching to @CAPS2 to improve their hand - eye coordination. If @CAPS2 is favored by those who initially opposed it, it must be excellent! Suppose you are working on a project about panda bears but have limited knowledge about them. What should you do? Naturally, search for it on @CAPS4.com! @CAPS4.com is a treasure trove of information, offering a plethora of links on any and every topic. I recall once having a major report to write but being completely unfamiliar with the subject. What solved my problem? @CAPS4! It has been proven that @PERCENT2 of the information found on @CAPS4 is accurate. Do you know what else on the computer can assist you in obtaining information? Just about any domain name on the web. Simply type in what you are looking for, add .com at the end, and @CAPS5! You will have access to all the information you need. Hmm, what other benefits does the computer offer? I know. You can send a message to your friend who has moved away and reconnect. Or, if you no longer like that friend, you can meet new people. For example, @LOCATION1 is a platform designed to match people for romantic relationships. So, perhaps you don't like computers. Oh well, all I can say is that you are missing out on a great deal. Excellent hand - eye coordination, vast amounts of information, and interesting people. As I said, the world is just a click away."
1025	1027	1	1	"Dear readers, while many people use computers, not a large number believe that @CAPS4 benefits society. Well, I firmly believe it does! I hold this view because the internet facilitates connections with the people you seek. It also provides the convenience of online shopping. If you do not have a @CAPS1 system, you can obtain directions online. If you continue reading, you will understand why I support these points. Have you ever heard of @CAPS2 or @CAPS3? In case you haven't, @CAPS4 is a social networking site that enables you to connect, chat, and find the people you are looking for. I have accounts on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, and they are quite enjoyable. There are games to play, quizzes to take, and you can chat with your friends. @CAPS4 is an excellent means of locating someone in another town or even further afield. This is one reason why the computer is a valuable resource. If there is a situation where you cannot drive to a store or any other place to make a purchase, you can shop online and buy @CAPS4! You simply need to enter the website address, browse the available items, and click to purchase. There is even online grocery shopping. So, the next time you are frustrated about not being able to go shopping, simply shop online. ""@CAPS4 may take some time to deliver your purchased items, but it is worth the wait."" Do you have a @CAPS1 system? If not, don't worry! You can visit a website such as www.mapquest.com. All you need to do is enter the starting address and the destination address. Then you can print out the directions to avoid getting lost! This is undoubtedly an advantage. So, don't you think the computer is a definite advantage for almost everyone? Well, I believe so! You can use @CAPS4 to find the people you need, shop online, and obtain directions in less than five minutes. This is why almost everyone should use a computer."
1026	1028	1	1	Dear Newspaper, are you aware that two out of three @CAPS2 possess a computer? Computers are an extremely valuable tool that confer benefits upon every member of society. They enable individuals to communicate with one another, acquire knowledge, and develop hand - eye coordination and other advantageous skills relevant to school. Computers are an eminently useful and beneficial component of society. The progress in technology has enhanced computers, now facilitating people to communicate via them. For instance, modern webcams allow individuals to actually see and converse with each other from their computer screens. This enables people, regardless of the distance, to communicate and maintain contact. With my webcam, I can stay in touch with my cousins in @LOCATION1. Another mode of communication is through email. Via the internet, people can exchange typed messages. It is highly rapid and convenient, enabling people to interact more frequently and effectively. In addition to webcams and email, computers provide access to communication websites such as @CAPS3 (instant messaging) or @CAPS4. On these websites, people can exchange messages swiftly and effortlessly. It is not as arduous as writing a letter, allowing people to communicate more efficiently and easily. Computers are extremely helpful for communication, along with @CAPS6. Computers represent an advancement that can assist people in learning more about anything. For example, they can learn about foreign places. All they need to do is access the internet, type what they are @CAPS5 for, and the information will appear on the screen. It allows people to learn about locations across the globe. Moreover, people can view pictures on the computer. For example, if someone intends to go on a distant vacation, they can type in the place and see what it looks like. However, the computer does not merely display places. People can also observe animals, other individuals, the environment, and anything else they wish to learn about. Additionally, with the creation of new websites, people can actually see what the earth looks like from space. They can view houses, the wonders of the world, and much more. Computers offer people the opportunity to learn about a vast amount of information. @CAPS6 more would be beneficial for people, especially students, to attain a better education. If you inquire of anyone in school, they will attest that computers are an extremely useful tool. Firstly, it allows them to type. Students can type a project or paper on the computer more rapidly and easily. It will also appear neater and more organized. Moreover, computers teach students hand - eye coordination. By typing or even simply clicking the mouse, students improve their coordination. This is because while they are @CAPS5 at the screen and typing or clicking, they have a sense of direction and know what to press or where to place their hands without even @CAPS5. Lastly, computers assist students because if they require help, they can simply consult one of their friends via the computer. Students will better comprehend the content they are @CAPS6, and when they go to school, they will already be familiar with it. Therefore, computers can lead to students achieving better grades. Computers play a significant role in society today. They serve as a means of communication, @CAPS6, and enable students to perform better in school. Overall, computers are an extremely beneficial tool in our society.
1027	1029	1	1	Dear Newspaper editor, do you own a computer at home? Do you utilize Facebook, @CAPS2, or any other form of social networking platform? Well, if you are akin to the majority of the esteemed, conscientious @CAPS3 in this country, you likely answered affirmatively to both of these queries; and you most probably also recognize that the computer is an excellent tool for developing hand - eye coordination, as well as an outstanding means of interacting with others online. Not only that, but you should also appreciate the remarkable potential of the computer in revealing distant lands and diverse cultures to us. What would we be capable of achieving without hand - eye coordination? Precisely nothing. Without the hand - eye coordination that computers and video games aid in cultivating, you would not even be able to venture outside and relish a tranquil game of tennis, baseball, or even basketball, all because without hand - eye coordination, you are clumsy and your depth perception is impaired. If it were not for hand - eye coordination, you would not even be able to pick up objects because your hands would not reach where your eyes are focused. Although the computer is not the sole method of learning hand - eye coordination, it remains an important strategy that requires minimal effort. If you are a sociable individual who enjoys conversing with others, then you absolutely must possess a computer! Computers, cell phones, PDAs - they are all fundamentally the same, as they all belong to the same category of computing devices. When you contemplate it, our country would be severely disadvantaged without these remarkable devices. These computers have contributed to the industrialization and growth of our great superpower nation. Can you envision having to drive to people's residences merely to engage in conversation with them? These machines can transmit our messages and voices to individuals who may be located on the other side of the world in just a few seconds. They represent a remarkable innovation in technology. Imagine having a college paper or a work assignment due tomorrow, and you have illegible handwriting. There is no way you will be able to complete it in time and have it be legible; and even worse, you may be fired or expelled if it is not submitted. But your savior has arrived! The computer enhances people's handwriting, speed, and research capabilities with just a few clicks of the buttons. With computers, there is no longer a need for long, tedious hours of handwriting or searching through books in the library. What would become of us without this wonderful invention? The time has come for you to make your own decision. Do you appreciate this time - saving, educational invention that allows you to socialize, or would you prefer to revert to the primitive era?
1028	1030	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Computers are an extraordinary invention that humanity has brought into existence. Some individuals express concerns that people are allocating an excessive amount of time on their computers and neglecting interactions with friends and family. While I concur with this view to some extent, spending time on the computer can actually yield positive outcomes. It can be advantageous because one can acquire new knowledge every minute, interact with friends, and even engage in activities that combine socializing and physical exercise simultaneously. Every moment spent on the computer presents an opportunity to learn something novel. For example, suppose you are on a gaming site and an advertisement suddenly appears. It is highly likely to provide you with information about the advertised product. Additionally, studies indicate that spending at least @NUM1 minutes on a computer can result in new learning experiences. Another effective way for people to communicate is through the internet and computers. This enables them to make arrangements efficiently. I am aware that excessive computer use is not entirely beneficial, but these are some of the advantages it offers. Please take these points into consideration.
1029	1031	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers exert both positive and negative influences on individuals. Even though I acknowledge that they have dual effects, I am of the opinion that the positive impact outweighs the negative. I hold this view because the internet provides people with the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of other places. It enables people to communicate with family members residing in distant locations and also facilitates the formation of new friendships. I support the advancements in technology. I do so because people can communicate with family members whom they are unable to meet in person. I have three cousins living in @LOCATION1 whom I rarely get to see, but thanks to computers, I can communicate with them regularly. We can exchange emails and @CAPS2 to chat with each other, inquiring about their recent activities, the progress of their schoolwork, and much more. My aunt enjoys sending and receiving pictures from them to observe how much they have changed since our last encounter. Without the latest technology, we would not be able to engage in such interactions. Computers also assist in learning about other countries and their inhabitants. Through the internet, one can discover the appearance of the country, the types of cuisine they consume, the language they speak, and a wealth of other information. Recently, I had to undertake a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. I was assigned @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3. With the aid of computers, I unearthed a vast amount of information about the country that I was previously unaware of. There were numerous remarkable places to visit and learn about the history of @LOCATION4. Learning so much about the place has kindled my desire to visit there someday. Without computers, I would never have acquired such extensive knowledge about that location. Another remarkable aspect of the new technology is that we can make new friends and interact with diverse individuals from all corners of the world. I recently read in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that at least @PERCENT1 of children have a MySpace or Facebook account, which facilitates their interaction with people globally. However, there can be risks associated with communicating with strangers. To ensure safety, one should refrain from divulging their phone number or residential address. Nevertheless, meeting new people can also be rewarding. For instance, my cousin has difficulty getting along with her schoolmates. However, after school, she uses her computer to communicate with people who share similar interests. Regardless, she should exercise caution. In conclusion, I reiterate my support for the technological advancements, albeit to a certain extent. Computers enable communication with family members one rarely sees, facilitate learning about new countries, and offer the opportunity to meet new people. Thank you for your time.
1030	1032	1	1	"Computers and other technological devices are highly beneficial for humans, particularly young individuals like myself, as they are advantageous for communication, maintaining attention, and providing previously unknown information. In this discussion, I will elaborate on these points. Communication is of utmost importance, and technology is nearly the most effective and rapid means of communication. Cell phones, of course, offer calling functionality, but they also allow users to send text messages. If you are dining with friends and running late, you can send them a text message, and they will receive it promptly. Email serves a similar purpose but allows for the exchange of longer messages. Video chat is an excellent method of communication. If you have a relative you haven't seen in a long time, you can engage in a video chat, enabling both parties to see and converse with each other, akin to an in - person conversation. Maintaining a person's attention is crucial. Technology achieves this through games, music from @NUM1's, computers, game systems, and the latest innovation, iPods, as well as by providing instructions. While teachers or parents can also fulfill this role, having or viewing instructions on a computer is far more engaging, which ties back to the topic of maintaining a person's attention. Technological devices are more captivating than teachers and certainly parents, but do they offer more? Information is perhaps the most common reason for using technology. If a child has a school project, they either turn to the computer or consult their parents. If the parents are unaware of the answer to their child's question, they often say, ""@CAPS1 it up on the computer"", if the child hasn't already done so. In a sense, the human race relies on technology; in fact, we do depend on it. Computers, cell phones, iPods, game systems, etc., all incorporate what I refer to as the internet. The internet has been in existence for some time, evolving from extremely slow speeds to high - speed connections, and it is a remarkable resource. It can provide you with directions, recipes, job offers, store locations, movie show times, and much more. Although technology is integral to daily life, from communication to information - seeking, it can gradually impede the human race. Most of us spend a significant amount of time on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when we should be engaging in physical activity, observing nature, and communicating with family face - to - face. Therefore, while computers and other devices are useful, are they worth the potential drawbacks of weight gain or losing touch with loved ones?"
1031	1033	1	1	"In recent years, @CAPS1 technology has experienced exponential growth. The utilization of computers, in particular, has soared. Nevertheless, I contend that this is not a cause for jubilation. The constant use of computers can impact people's health, relationships with family and friends, and their appreciation of nature. The excessive use of computers is a significant issue. Have you ever sat before a computer screen for extended periods? If so, you are familiar with the sensations of drowsiness and irritability. The lack of physical activity while using a computer affects people more than they recognize. Excessive computer use has been associated with obesity and high blood pressure. The more time people spend on the computer, the higher their blood pressure rises. Simply sitting in front of a screen is detrimental to people's physical well - being. To maintain good health, use the computer only when absolutely necessary. Spending excessive time on the computer can isolate individuals from others. In this generation, adolescents especially, use the computer to communicate with others more than engaging in face - to - face conversations. Communicating solely via the computer can lead to social isolation. Not to mention how rapidly rumors and secrets spread across the internet. Using the computer can damage relationships, even those with family members. Neglecting family by constantly being on the computer can drive people apart. Families can become insignificant. People cannot focus on their families while being engrossed in a computer screen. Computers are creating false substitutes for almost everything, including nature. Humans initially lived in the wild, gathering food from the land and replanting to give back. Our connection with nature was strong; we needed it to thrive. Nowadays, instead of listening to the sound of rain and the rustling of dry leaves, people prefer the high - pitched artificial beeping and the classic ""You've got mail."" People no longer appreciate nature as they once did and as they should. The beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if it were unremarkable. However, without it, we would not exist. Life cannot thrive without a source of sustenance. We can log on to our computers and view pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1.com, or we can put on our shoes and experience it firsthand. No one can truly experience the grandeur of nature while on the computer. No one can feel the cool lake water sliding over their skin or the heat of a @DATE1 day while emailing a friend. It is impossible. Computers have deprived us of our ability to experience creation. In conclusion, computers are extremely harmful to people. They can affect health, relationships with friends and family, and appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when necessary to stay healthy. Instead of going online, go outside."
1032	1034	1	1	I advocate for technological advancements because in the future, our world will be computer - driven. People can gain knowledge about places and individuals they could never afford to encounter in person. Moreover, it facilitates connections between people without direct face - to - face interaction. Have you ever contemplated the future? I certainly have. Typically, when one thinks of the future, images of automation and a lack of human presence come to mind. The reality is that the world is becoming increasingly technology - driven. As humans become more intelligent, so does technology. What good will the future be if we cannot operate a simple technological device like a computer? How will we use more complex technologies then? Believe it or not, within @NUM1 years, our world will be entirely computer - based, and we will have to rely on them. Without computers, how would we be aware of all the knowledge we possess today? How would people know what Egypt looked like @NUM2 years ago? They don't need to be physically present; they can simply search for information on the computer and learn as much as if they had visited. Additionally, computers enable us to learn about people who lived before our time. If you wanted to know something about a particular president, how would you find out? Before the advent of computers, you would have to visit a library. In today's society, computers are readily available sources of information. Our average lives have been enhanced because of the capabilities computers offer. I understand why some experts are concerned. However, for some people, computers are the only means of connecting with family and friends. Suppose there is a family member living in a different country who wants to communicate with you. How would you go about it? I would attempt to contact them via the computer. I have friends living out of state, and I enjoy conversing with them. If we did not have computers, would we really drive across the country to talk to them? In my opinion, that is extremely time - consuming and pointless. In conclusion, I hope you concur that integrating technology into our lives is crucial for the future, as it allows people to learn new things about places and people and communicate with friends and family. Although I understand your perspective that children are not getting enough exercise, many kids involved with computers also participate in sports.
1033	1035	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 - in - @CAPS2, computers are highly beneficial tools in contemporary society and culture. They cultivate cognitive skills and offer a vast reservoir of knowledge. I aim to make you aware of all the advantages a computer provides. Firstly, computers improve our hand - eye coordination. When typing, we look at the screen while using our hands to type. Over time, this becomes almost instinctive, demonstrating its positive impact on this cognitive skill. Good hand - eye coordination is essential for driving and many other daily activities. Secondly, consider the virtually limitless knowledge accessible through this tool. You can learn almost anything on the internet, and most of it is free. In fact, on websites like @CAPS3 alone, you can find web pages dedicated to just about any topic. Contrary to the counter - argument, a computer can actually enhance our social lives. With instant messengers like @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1, you can engage in real - time conversations with people worldwide. Social networks like @CAPS5 allow you to keep your friends informed about your activities. Please take my letter into consideration and publish it in your editorial. I firmly believe that computers assist us in developing cognitive skills, acquiring knowledge, and socializing. Thank you for your time.
1034	1036	1	1	Dear the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, some individuals assert that computers have a negative influence on society. In my opinion, computers have a positive impact on the world around us. I believe that computers enhance hand - eye coordination and provide a means of organization. Moreover, people can still interact with others through them. If you do not share my view currently, read the following details, and you may change your mind. When considering computers, they undoubtedly contribute to hand - eye coordination. It is impossible to use a computer without typing. Whether you are typing a short password or a @NUM1 - page essay, you will always need to type, and this process improves the dexterity of your hands. This enhanced hand - eye coordination can later prove beneficial in sports and physical activities. Since computers have become so prevalent, I anticipate that in the future, typing or using a computer will be a standard skill. This could be attributed to the hand - eye coordination that computers offer. My theory is that whatever you conceive, you can type. In addition to hand - eye coordination, computers offer organization, which is a significant concern in modern life. Do you have picture files scattered around your house? There is no need for such disorganization. With computers, you can store all your files neatly. You can easily retrieve and locate everything. Even doctors use computers to manage your medical records and provide timely care. Computers can bring order to various aspects of our lives. Furthermore, computers continue to facilitate social interaction. I can communicate with friends or family members who are far away. Computers keep us connected, although I am not suggesting that this is always ideal, as face - to - face interaction is essential. However, when face - to - face interaction is not possible, it is a valuable alternative. To conclude, computers have a positive impact on our lives. We can develop hand - eye coordination, stay organized, and computers can bring people together when they are physically apart. We can learn about new people and places from afar. Although some people may hold a different view, I am certain that computers benefit society.
1035	1037	1	1	Dear editor of @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter because I believe people are not getting sufficient exercise as they spend excessive time on the computer and visit various websites. Here are some issues I would like you to address so that people can become more aware. My first reason is that due to the large amount of time people spend on the computer, they do not engage in physical activity. They do not walk; instead, they sit and send messages to their friends all day. They are not concerned about the weight gain and the strain on their hearts caused by this sedentary lifestyle. As a result, it can lead to health problems that may limit their physical capabilities. My second reason is that some websites expose kids to immoral content. When kids have free access to the computer, they may encounter inappropriate sites, such as gun - related sites, which can have a negative impact on their mental and moral development. They may try to imitate the behavior they see on these sites, which could potentially lead to harm to themselves or others. My third reason is that chat sites can be a source of inappropriate attention - seeking behavior. Some individuals may post things they should not, and there is a risk of interaction with strangers, especially for younger users. For example, a @NUM2 - year - old may be exposed to inappropriate content or situations. I hope you will write about these issues and monitor the content as much as possible to prevent such problems.
1036	1038	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I envision a world devoid of computers as a more idyllic realm. Why would one not aspire to enhance the world? Although computers can be advantageous for work and commerce during @MONTH1, young children are forfeiting opportunities to engage in physical activity, appreciate nature, and interact with family and friends. Which do you prefer: the presence of computers or their absence? In my view, individuals would fare better without them. The issue of insufficient exercise is frequently raised in society. Computers are one contributing factor, especially considering that @LOCATION1 is already among the most obese nations globally. Who would wish to exacerbate this catastrophe? If the usage of computers in each household increases, the number of obese individuals in @LOCATION2 will also rise. When computers displace exercise, health problems will occur more frequently and at a younger age. Dr. @PERSON1 asserts, ""If children spend more of their leisure time on the computer instead of engaging in physical activity, their risk of developing diabetes will escalate."" @CAPS3, this also potentially results in less exercise. Elderly citizens will be particularly vulnerable to heart attacks. It is said that five out of six individuals could have prevented a heart attack by simply setting aside some time each day to visit the gym or take a stroll. No one should sacrifice exercise for the sake of playing virtual games and instant messaging online. Fewer people have the opportunity to enjoy nature when they are glued to their computers all day. If more individuals cared about nature, global warming would not be a pressing concern. In my opinion, the residents of @LOCATION2 would desire to maintain a cleaner environment and be more attuned to its well - being. If more people cherished and enjoyed nature, wildlife would not be deprived of its habitat. People would put an end to the detrimental actions of some individuals and companies towards nature. Lastly, when one is engrossed in their computer all day, they fail to recognize the offerings of nature, such as fresh air and wildlife, or the vastness of canyons. People need to appreciate nature more; computers should not impede this. Would not most people concur that their relationships with family members and friends could be significantly strengthened if they interacted and spent time with them rather than with their computers? @CAPS2, contemplate how much dinner conversations and family parties could improve if people were more closely connected with their families. Moreover, people need their families. A computer cannot console you through the emotional pain of losing a loved one. @PERCENT1 of people can overcome difficult and stressful times with the support of their families. Last but not least, one's social life could improve if people were not constantly on their computers. Lack of interaction with others can render one antisocial and unappealing to be around. No one desires to be in such a state. Additionally, while a computer may not always function properly, family and friends will always be there. The world would undoubtedly be better off without computers. I believe that everyone who spends hours in their room on the computer could enhance their exercise routine, appreciation for nature, and relationships with family and friends by disconnecting and engaging in activities that truly benefit them. There is no necessity for a computer in one's life, but this may not apply to everyone. The question then remains: should we cease using computers or abandon them permanently?"
1037	1039	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, certain parents express concerns regarding their children's excessive computer usage. I will now discuss @NUM1 positive aspects of computers, @NUM1 negative aspects, and @NUM1 recommendations. One advantage is the ability to communicate with others. You can converse with your friends online about school - related matters or other topics. This is beneficial because if you forget your homework or need assistance, you can seek help from them online. Another benefit is the opportunity to meet @ORGANIZATION1 individuals. For instance, on platforms like @CAPS1 or Facebook. When you encounter @ORGANIZATION1 people online, they often hail from countries you may have never heard of, allowing you to learn something new and forge friendships with individuals from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. Additionally, you can acquire @ORGANIZATION1 knowledge on the internet about various subjects. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website you've never discovered, offering information that may prove useful in the future. Take @ORGANIZATION2 as an example; it can be highly beneficial. Now, let's examine @NUM1 drawbacks of computers. Firstly, computers can be addictive. For example, I became addicted when I had a computer, but after we got rid of it, I now play with my sisters. Secondly, there are viruses. My grandmother's computer contracted a virus from a website, @CAPS1. When your computer gets a virus, it becomes frustrating as you are unable to perform any tasks or conduct research for school. Dealing with viruses is unpleasant, and you may have to wait approximately a week for it to be fixed. Lastly, excessive computer use can lead to neglecting family time. I know some individuals who exhibit this behavior, and it is not appropriate, especially when guests visit. Since my time is limited, I will share one recommendation. You should allocate a specific amount of time for computer use and then engage in enjoyable activities other than using the computer. This is what I believe you should do for now.
1038	1040	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, my name is @PERSON2, and I am here to share my opinions about computers. Computers are both entertaining and educational. They offer numerous websites featuring games, such as Portaportal and @NUM1.com, which provide safe and engaging games for children under @NUM2. Additionally, there are educational websites that can assist with academic work, like Google and AskYourQuestion.com. These platforms contain all the information you need for your studies. Moreover, there are also @CAPS2 and Facebook. I am aware of the rumors about people being threatened during chats, but aside from that, you can communicate with your friends without having to wait for your mother to finish using the phone. @CAPS2 allows you to meet new people without disclosing your identity. In my opinion, computers are safe in certain situations and also offer a great deal of fun and educational value.
1039	1041	1	1	I opine that individuals should curtail their computer usage as it can foster an excessive dependence. While it is understandable that one can play games and communicate with others on the computer, those who spend excessive time on it neglect the opportunity to interact with their family and friends in person. Instead of merely observing others through chat or webcam on the computer, one could visit them in another state. People who are constantly glued to their computers should venture outside; otherwise, they will miss out on numerous experiences. For example, when @CAPS1 uses the computer, @CAPS1 may spend an hour or so on it and then engage in activities with family and friends, but this should not be the norm. I understand that some individuals may need to use the computer for work, both at the workplace and at home to complete tasks. However, one should also allocate time to spend with family and friends rather than being on the computer incessantly. Some people return home and immediately turn to the computer, which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and weight gain. They may only pause to eat and then resume using the computer. When they finally disengage, they are often too tired to do anything else. This is why people should increase their physical activity and spend quality time with their family and friends to enjoy life to the fullest.
1040	1042	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I conducted a poll of @NUM1 individuals, and @PERCENT1 of them concur that computers have a positive impact on people. Computers facilitate communication with individuals in distant locations, cultivate hand - eye coordination, and enable the acquisition of knowledge about people or places. Utilizing computers is an excellent means of maintaining contact with others. For instance, my grandparents reside in @LOCATION2, and I keep in touch with them through email, video chat, and instant messaging. Another advantage of online communication is the ability to converse with multiple people simultaneously or when your parents are using the phone. Additionally, computers are effective in teaching hand - eye coordination. This is achieved through activities such as typing and clicking on objects. Initially, some individuals may look at the keyboard while typing, but with practice, they can learn to focus on the computer screen. To click on something, one must move the mouse while keeping their eyes on the screen, which is an example of hand - eye coordination. Lastly, computers are invaluable for students. If a student needs to research a place or person for a school report, they can easily access Google.com and enter the relevant information. Similarly, if someone is planning a vacation to @LOCATION1 and has limited knowledge about it, they can quickly gather information with just a few clicks of the mouse. Moreover, if someone wishes to learn about @ORGANIZATION2 for personal interest, they can simply type @ORGANIZATION2 into a search engine, browse through the websites, select the most suitable one, and commence reading. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people for the reasons outlined above. People can communicate online, learn hand - eye coordination, and conduct research on individuals or places using the internet. This is my perspective on computers, and I hope you share the same view.
1041	1043	1	1	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, and I am writing to discuss with you how computers contribute to society. Are you aware that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 households possess at least @NUM3 computer? Well, it's quite obvious! Computers facilitate greater learning as they allow for more extensive research. It is far more expeditious than the traditional method of searching for information in the library. Moreover, with platforms like @CAPS3 and Facebook, one can communicate with individuals one doesn't usually encounter. The internet on computers enables access to websites such as Google, @LOCATION1, and @LOCATION2. When searching for information on these and numerous other websites, one can obtain valuable data that can provide an edge in life. For instance, if I were researching a chocolate chip recipe, experimented with unique variations, and then sold the product, just envision how a single click on the computer could transform one's life. Additionally, if I needed to research a topic for @CAPS1 history project, I would turn to the computer, access Google, type in @CAPS1 topic, and be inundated with the necessary information, enabling me to achieve an excellent grade on the project. This exemplifies how computers enhance learning. Computers are highly efficient. I can create @NUM4 PowerPoint slides @CAPS6 filled with useful information in the time it would take me to visit the library, locate a suitable book, and jot down sufficient information for a single PowerPoint slide. On average, @PERCENT1 of individuals rely on computers to find useful information. When I was working on @CAPS1 social studies project @TIME1, I needed to determine what the @CAPS4 flag looked like. Instead of attempting to search for a book in the library, I simply accessed Google, clicked on the images tab, and typed in @CAPS4 flag. Within seconds, my screen was @CAPS6 with real and edited pictures of the @CAPS4 flag. It is astonishing how rapidly information can travel from the World Wide Web to one's computer. So, would you prefer to be confined to a library, searching for information indefinitely, or enjoy your life by saving time through computer usage? Have you ever heard of Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS3, or Twitter? These are all excellent means of communicating with others using a computer. When I am on @CAPS3 or Facebook, I can converse with people I don't often see. One of my friends from camp resides in @CAPS10, so I don't get to meet her frequently. Thanks to the remarkable invention of Facebook, I can communicate with her regularly. Just imagine, without the computer, Facebook would never have been invented, and I would likely have lost touch with a dear friend. Additionally, when I use the computer, I have the option of signing onto @CAPS3 or accessing my email. Through these, I can interact with others and receive interesting emails. None of this would be possible without the invention of the computer. So, don't you desire easier information research, quicker access to details, and more convenient communication with friends? Let's strive to ensure that @NUM2 out of @NUM2 households own a computer, thereby contributing to society by leveraging the computer for our needs and then savoring life. Just contemplate the amount of time you can save by using a computer.
1042	1044	1	1	"Do you genuinely believe that @CAPS1 require computers to survive? I concur with the notion of reducing computer usage and allocating more time to physical activity, appreciating nature, and interacting with friends. I hold this view because of @CAPS1 and my family. @CAPS1 do not necessitate computers. @CAPS1 often become disoriented and lose their sense of direction when engrossed in computer use. When @CAPS1 need to search for something, they often resort to using iPods. If individuals wish to engage in conversation, they typically utilize cell phones. Suppose you have a school project; libraries are readily available. @PERCENT1 of children enjoy reading, which is an excellent way to enhance one's reading skills. If you encounter difficulties in generating ideas while reading, you can consult your teachers at appropriate times, such as afternoons or during lunch breaks. One day, when I attended class, there was a project due, and a student admitted, ""I copied all the text from the computer."" This act is known as plagiarism. Some parents may not be aware that their children engage in such unethical behavior. Sometimes, the internet can be detrimental to children. It is essential to take a break and slow down occasionally. You can embark on a trip to visit your family or simply observe the beauty of nature. Engage in activities such as exercise, hiking, swimming, and cycling. Computers are not a substitute for family; they do not encourage physical activity but rather promote laziness. Now that you are aware of the reasons to reduce computer usage, considering the availability of electronics, libraries, and family, you should take immediate action to make a change. There is nothing to lose by doing so."
1043	1045	1	1	"What are your thoughts regarding computers? I firmly believe that computers exert a highly positive influence on individuals. All children should have access to @NUM1. Kindly consider the following advice. Computers are an invaluable asset for children as they impart essential life skills, including hand - eye coordination, and offer extensive knowledge about technology. Renowned expert @PERSON1 asserts, ""@PERCENT1 of successful careers involve some form of interaction with computers. If children acquire these skills at an early age, they can become proficient experts."" Technology has become an integral part of modern life and will continue to expand in the coming years. It is a grave error to attempt to isolate our children from technology. As a child, my sister grew up with computers. By the age of @NUM2, she had mastered their full functionality. She entered college with exceptional computer skills and now works as a presidential secretary in a law firm, earning a substantial income. Currently, she encourages me to explore various technological aspects. If you have children, you undoubtedly aspire for their well - being in both the present and the future. People often say that children are the future, but this can only be true if they are successful. Computers serve as an excellent medium for children of all ages to learn and communicate with one another and the wider world. We all desire the happiness of our children. @NUM4 out of @NUM5 children utilize the internet to conduct research for @CAPS2 and school projects. Child therapist @PERSON2 states, ""Children who interact with their peers through internet platforms such as Facebook, @CAPS3, and MySpace tend to be more socially engaged."" I understand your concern about the presence of ""@CAPS4"" content on the internet. However, you can implement parental controls and set usage limits. Additionally, to prevent your children from developing obesity due to a lack of exercise, you can impose time restrictions. My cousins each spend @NUM6 hours on the computer daily. They complete their @CAPS2 and use the remaining time to chat with friends. The internet is not entirely negative. As evident, computers can be regarded in a highly positive light. I urge you to heed my advice and grant your children the freedom to access the internet. They will undoubtedly be happier. Trust me."
1044	1046	1	1	Do you appreciate your computer? Does it offer benefits to you and those around you? Some individuals claim that computers do not benefit people. I am writing to refute this claim and elucidate the ways in which computers are advantageous to us. Computers assist us in various aspects, including learning, communication, and even economic matters. Firstly, learning is of utmost importance throughout one's life, and computers can enhance this process. Hand - eye coordination, for example, is highly beneficial in sports such as tennis, golf, and hacky - sack. When using a computer, one can develop this skill. For instance, last @DATE1, I went to play tennis with my mother, who rarely uses a computer. She failed to hit any of the balls thrown at her. Through computers, one can access a wealth of information from around the world. One can explore places like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION3. Overall, @LOCATION3 has the lowest number of computers globally. Finally, computers enable us to learn typing. In America, there are numerous jobs that require typing skills. If one is proficient in typing, they are more likely to secure a good job, which can lead to a successful life. Undoubtedly, computers significantly contribute to our learning. Secondly, computers facilitate the formation of new friendships. Firstly, at school, computers allow students to interact more effectively with their peers. According to Facebook Magazine, @PERCENT1 of students in a school engage in online conversations with others. Secondly, computers also assist in family communication. For example, if your grandmother gets injured, you can quickly send an email to inform your family. Computers play a crucial role in maintaining family connections. Finally, computers are beneficial in social situations. For example, children with cancer or other health issues can use computers to communicate with others in similar circumstances. Computers are highly useful in enhancing one's social life. Lastly, computers can help in economic terms. In today's challenging job market, computers can be a valuable tool. Online websites offer job opportunities and provide a platform for individuals to find employment.
1045	1047	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are having a detrimental impact on modern youth. The rapid progress of technology is not necessarily a positive development. Popular social networks like Facebook and Twitter expose youth to the risks of @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 and child predators. Moreover, children are becoming addicted to computers, and this is taking a toll on their physical health. Although humanity is becoming more intellectually advanced, we are potentially undermining the future leaders of the world. This excessive reliance on computing must cease! While computers do enable children to socialize, they also expose them to significant physical and emotional risks. ""@PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1, once said, ""I made every effort to ignore the cruel comments people posted about me on Facebook. But every time I logged in and read those hurtful words, I felt my spirit shatter. I almost lost the will to live."" This is a prime example of the @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 that many students endure. Thousands of students, just like @PERSON1, are being severely harassed, and in some cases, the situation is even worse. The social networks promoted by modern technology are breeding grounds for such incidents. If the rapid advancement of technology continues unchecked, we can expect to see a significant increase in such cases. In the past year, @NUM1 victims of @CAPS1 - bullying have tragically committed suicide. These are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved and @NUM1 families that could still be intact. This computer - related crisis is claiming lives, and we cannot afford to let it persist. Computers not only pose emotional hazards but also physical ones. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer, making the recommended one - hour of daily exercise seem insignificant. A large proportion of obese children can attribute their condition to excessive computer use. The numerous features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playback, and games, are highly attractive to kids, luring them away from physical activity. Statistics indicate that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 of their free time in front of a computer, while only five percent of their day is dedicated to exercise and play. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day using a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years, these numbers have deteriorated due to technological advancements. These figures clearly demonstrate that computers have dominated the daily routines of obese children, exacerbating their physical health problems. Computers are largely responsible for the global obesity epidemic. As I conclude this letter, I sincerely hope that I have convinced you to take a stand and halt this unrestrained technological progress. In summary, computers are fostering @CAPS1 - @CAPS2, causing emotional distress, and contributing to physical health issues. We must take action to change this situation and improve the well - being of our youth."
1046	1048	1	1	Dear readers, @CAPS1 what if I informed you that each time you settle in front of a computer, you edge that much closer to demise? @CAPS1 what if I asserted that computers are undermining your lives? This @MONTH1 might not be overly severe, yet it is startling. You cannot dissent. I opine that humans ought not to utilize computers, or at the very least, employ them extremely sparingly. Computers cause people to engage in less physical activity, they deplete brain cells, and they can disrupt your lifestyle. You @MONTH1 believe that computers have impaired your life, yet the consequences persist. Many @CAPS2 today are corpulent and indolent. They do not partake in any exercise. There are numerous reasons for this, but one significant factor is that they remain seated in front of computers throughout the day! Computers @MONTH1 enhance reflexes and the like, but you can achieve the same through physical exertion as well! When you sit in front of a computer, it ensnares you. Ten minutes elapse in a flash, transforming into one hour! That is one hour less of physical activity. Virtual sports @MONTH1 be enjoyable, but they deter you from participating in real - world sports. Without exercise, one @MONTH1 become obese, develop diabetes or heart ailments, or even experience muscle issues. These can be perilous, and even fatal. Computers do not invigorate your body or your mind! Now, this fact leads me to my subsequent point. Computers @MONTH1 possess information to instruct you, but that form of learning has its drawbacks. When you sit in front of a computer, your eyes are fixed on the screen. Now, scientists from the @ORGANIZATION1 foundation have discovered that staring at the screen causes brain cells to perish. Essentially, these cells do not regenerate as readily as other cells, and sometimes they do not regenerate at all. You are merely one step closer to death. I am certain you do not desire an untimely end. Try perusing a book! They are more economical, more accurate, and do not harm your cells! Refrain from gazing at the computer screen, for you are gradually destroying your body, and knowledge can be acquired elsewhere. For a final point, I would like to state that computers simply disrupt your lifestyle. Virtual acquaintances are not your genuine friends and family. Computers prompt you to turn away from them. Online interaction is not comparable to conversing with someone in person or over the phone. You can lose your real - life friends. Additionally, computers govern your lifestyle because half of the things you believe you are learning are not real. You cannot trust certain websites or certain individuals. Being in the company of those you know and cherish is far more advantageous, as computers draw you in and you are detached from the real world. I feel that we should all take a stand against computers. They deprive you of exercise, cause brain cells to die, and other problems arise, and they can ruin your lifestyle. No one wishes to be a solitary object of ridicule! Read a book, venture outdoors; but steer clear of the screen. There are superior alternatives. Take a stand, and do @CAPS1 is optimal. Be the healthy, happy individual, and abstain from using computers, so that you can relish the best of life!
1047	1049	1	1	Dear editor of my local newspaper, in my perspective, computers exert a positive influence on individuals. I endorse the advancements in technology. I believe @CAPS1 is a favorable phenomenon because @CAPS1 cultivates hand - eye coordination, endows people with the capacity to learn about distant locales and individuals, and even enables us to engage in online conversations with others. In the subsequent paragraphs, I will share with you my viewpoints and elucidate why they are the appropriate perspectives for all to embrace. Firstly, hand - eye coordination plays a pivotal role in our lives. Many of us partake in sports. Now, sports are not merely about being the best; @CAPS1 is about self - improvement and giving one's best effort. Sports demand a substantial amount of practice, and one avenue is through computer games. I wager you were unaware that @CAPS1, these games assist you in developing hand - eye coordination. Defeating monsters and the like truly aids you in sports. Catching and throwing are integral aspects of numerous sports, and that is entirely about hand - eye coordination. And where do you think you acquire @CAPS1? Through practice and computer games. So, the next time you are on the computer, engage in some games, and that will be tantamount to practicing for sports and will facilitate the development of the hand - eye coordination requisite for success in a sport. Secondly, another reason in favor of computer usage is that @CAPS1 offers us the opportunity to learn about places and people from across the globe. Consider @CAPS1 before the advent of computers. If you wished to know something, you might have had to search far and wide for a book that provided the information. @CAPS1 could be time - consuming. Now, you simply type what you want to know into Google or Bing, and there is your answer. This ability to rapidly locate what you are seeking affords you greater freedom to learn and allocate your precious time to other pursuits you desire. As you can discern, this is a valuable ability and can be of great assistance when you need to obtain information promptly. So, do yourself a favor and utilize computers to simplify life. Thirdly, computers serve as a means of communication. They enable you to converse with people worldwide, when you might otherwise be unable to do so. This is an excellent way to maintain contact when people relocate, embark on a business trip, go on vacation, or even to meet new individuals. Suppose you are unable to reach someone because their phone is off and it is crucial that you communicate with them. You could send them an email, or if they are online and have @CAPS3.M., you could @CAPS2 (instant message) them. This would spare you the hassle of incessantly calling them. Moreover, if you wish to see what they are doing or where they are, you could utilize a webcam to view them instead of merely conversing with them. As this paragraph demonstrates, the internet and computers open up more possibilities than ever before. As I mentioned earlier, I have only presented a fraction of what computers are beneficial for. My reasons for computers being more of a positive force than a negative one are as follows: they assist us in learning things that were previously inaccessible, facilitate communication with others, and aid us in developing hand - eye coordination. I can only hope that as I pen my conclusion, my opinions are heard and that this letter helps everyone recognize why computers are a remarkable asset, not a liability.
1048	1050	1	1	"Dear @PERSON2 ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1"", I am certain you have all heard the sound of a mouse clicking or people typing if you have entered an office, our local library, a doctor's office, or even our district's schools. The reality is that computers and the world - wide - web are ubiquitous and widely utilized. Without a computer, how would @CAPS3 be able to access our emails, interact with family members across the ocean, and complete that research paper assigned by our teacher? In my opinion, computers have a remarkable impact on people and their lives. The computer facilitates the development of hand - eye coordination, enables learning about specific subjects, and allows interaction with others on the computer. Therefore, given such positive effects, @CAPS3 should continue to utilize this remarkable technology to accomplish our tasks. Have you ever entered your school's lab or an office building and all you could hear was the clicking of mice or the keys being pressed on the keyboard? Well, not only is a task being completed, but you are also engaging in a form of exercise. I recall last month when my class was assigned a five - page essay. After the second page, my hands ached severely. @CAPS4, not only was I completing my essay, but I was also exercising my hands. Not only do computers allow you to exercise, but they also contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. Have you ever played a game where you had to catch fish or engaged in a fast - paced game of pinball? Well, those games necessitate one crucial element—hand - eye coordination. Computers are highly beneficial in today's world. The computer and the world - wide - web are useful in several other respects as well. The internet also allows you to learn about certain subjects or events for which you might not have a book. My best friend, @PERSON1, called me one day from the train. On the phone, she was frantic because she was delivering a speech and she did not know the statistics for type @CAPS5 diabetes. What do you do when you have no book for a specific subject? @PERSON3 accessed her laptop and found all the information she did not know. This is yet another way the rapid access to a computer benefits people. ""You've got mail"" I am certain you have all heard this before. Besides communicating via letters or on the telephone, the internet has provided us with additional means of rapid communication. When you need to confirm a meeting place or inquire with your classmate about the assigned homework problems, what could be a swift mode of communication? Sending an instant message or an email are, of course, two options. Not only do computers allow you to communicate rapidly but also privately. Both your email account and your instant message account are password - protected so that only you can access them. Four out of five households have a computer available for completing assignments, checking emails, and learning about the events that transpired in @LOCATION1 last week. The computer has had a positive impact on numerous individuals and their daily requirements. In my opinion, the computer has been one of the most outstanding technologies in history. This remarkable technology has assisted students, teachers, doctors, police officers, and even your bank agents in serving our community and making it a better place. Thank you."
1049	1051	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 society ought to have computers as they impart knowledge that a school or job will never offer, and they enable you to stay in touch with friends and family whom you do not encounter frequently. I would like you to appreciate my concern regarding why @CAPS1 society should possess computers. First, we should have computers because they teach us things we might not have learned previously. I assert this because if you wish to learn more about @LOCATION1 and the school or job does not provide as much information as you desire, all you need to do is search on the internet, and there is a likelihood that you will find it. @NUM1 individuals would rather use computers to look up information than remain in a state of ignorance about something. Next, we should have computers for @CAPS1 society because we can communicate with people online whom we have not conversed with. My view is that if you have not spoken to a friend or family member in a while, you can interact with them online. Additionally, if they do not have a phone or if it is a long - distance call and you cannot make long - distance calls on your phone, you can communicate with them via email or instant messaging. For instance, if your phone is malfunctioning and the only functioning device is your computer, you can use it to stay in touch with someone. All you have to do is engage in an online conversation. Would you prefer to communicate on the phone or via computer? In conclusion, @CAPS1 society should have computers because we can learn more about various things and chat with people. I would like you to appreciate my concern about having computers in @CAPS1 society.
1050	1052	1	1	"Did you know that @PERCENT2 out of @PERCENT1 children today prefer to engage in computer games rather than partake in other activities? My stance on this topic is that it is of greater significance for children to engage in activities other than sitting in front of the computer all day. The reasons I hold this view are that it is essential to exercise, children tend to become addicted to playing on the computer, and if a child's life revolves around the computer, they are likely to be ill - prepared for the ""real world"". When a child spends the entire day seated at the computer, they do not engage in physical exercise. Today, obesity is a major concern. If people reduce their computer usage and increase their physical activity, this issue could be mitigated. Additionally, it is important for children to breathe in fresh air. When someone plays on the computer, they do not receive as much fresh air as they would when outdoors. Lastly, those who recognize the importance of exercise often participate in sports to stay active and have fun. Once a child begins playing computer games, it can be difficult to stop. In today's society, children of all ages become addicted to the computer. Addicted children pay little attention to their surroundings. Moreover, some of these games may be inappropriate for younger players. Lastly, if children become addicted, they may perform poorly in school as they refuse to complete their homework. If a child is constantly on the computer, they may not be prepared for the ""real world"". In the ""real world"", one cannot rely on computer games. Additionally, games do not teach the knowledge that can only be acquired in school. Later in life, when seeking employment, one may not be accepted as they will not appear knowledgeable. Lastly, when applying to college, the admissions committee will review your records of sports and activities during middle school. If they find no such records, they may reject you due to your lack of participation. So, when sitting in front of the computer screen, remember the numerous opportunities available beyond the computer. For example, it is crucial to exercise, playing computer games can lead to addiction, and it can leave you ill - prepared for the ""real world"". What is your opinion?"
1051	1053	1	1	I opine that computers are highly beneficial. There exists a plethora of functionalities! Ranging from learning, to gaming, to streaming videos, and serving as an extremely useful tool. Without computers, we would resemble the @CAPS1 (apologies to any @CAPS1 individuals). We would have to await a newspaper or the news broadcast on @CAPS4.V. to access breaking news. Allow me to elucidate my rationale in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, there are numerous activities available. One can engage in online games, offline games, browse the web, chat, watch videos, and so on. Without the internet, I likely would have lost my interest in @ORGANIZATION1. I am now a member of the online community named www.MOCpages.com. I upload my creations, view others' works, comment, and chat. I utilize the internet to conduct research for school projects. Presently, I am researching @CAPS5 @CAPS6 during the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Ordinarily, I would have to labor over books to find information. Now, it is far easier as keywords are matched. Finally, it is an excellent instrument. Are you aware that the military requires computers to store information, launch attacks, maintain records, and pilot certain aircraft? I need to use a computer to type my homework, as, as you can observe, my handwriting is not the neatest. Additionally, I keep in touch with my father, who works in @ORGANIZATION2. I hope I have convinced you of my stance. Remember, computers perform numerous tasks, aid in our learning, and are a remarkable tool. Thank you for reading, goodbye!
1052	1054	1	1	To the relevant party, for numerous individuals, it is initially a great deal of fun, yet they may become so engrossed that they risk losing much of what they cherish. My stance is that computers can have detrimental effects on people's finances, weight, and sleep. While this is my personal view, I firmly uphold it. My father is particularly concerned about the financial aspect. With five children and one laptop, it is challenging to maintain contentment. When individuals sit and stare at computer games all day, the bills accumulate until they potentially lose everything, such as their home, family, and money. However, when one is obsessed with their computer, these concerns often take a backseat. My primary concern is the issue of weight gain. Indeed, it is pleasant to sit in a comfortable chair with a computer, accompanied by bowls of chips and boxes of pizza. Nevertheless, sooner or later, all that high - fat food will catch up with you, often when you least expect it. But will you get up and go for a jog, use a treadmill, or take a @NUM1 - length walk? Probably not while the computer game is running. The weight will continue to increase until you may even struggle to move. Sitting at a @NUM2 for extended periods can have adverse effects on your eyes, brain, muscles, and other vital body parts due to lack of sleep and excessive computer use. I can relate this to my brother's situation. He gets home and immediately immerses himself in the computer until perhaps @NUM3 or @NUM4 o'clock in the @TIME1. Eventually, he is likely to fall ill, and I am not to blame. When you sit at a computer for long hours, you may eventually make yourself sick, and in some extreme cases, it could even be life - threatening. As a typical teenager, I enjoy using the computer, yet I refrain from spending every hour of every day watching movies or playing games. I go outside and exercise to avoid falling victim to weight, financial, and health problems, as many others do. Therefore, do not squander your life on games or chat rooms. Go outside and engage in activities like sports or simply enjoy the fresh air.
1053	1055	1	1	Many individuals assert that computers assist them in their daily lives. For instance, one can learn about unfamiliar places by searching on Google. You can obtain facts and reviews about the location. Moreover, it provides a form of finger exercise. It facilitates communication with others. It can help you locate long - lost family members, reuniting numerous families and friends you may have been seeking. Additionally, it enhances hand - eye coordination. Another advantage of using a computer is going online. You can browse the items available in a store without having to drive all the way there, thus saving gas and reducing air pollution. Instant messaging is a means to stay informed about global events and breaking news. You can still interact with family and friends and even meet new people. There are options such as email and instant messaging, among others. If someone does not have an account, signing up is straightforward. If you venture into nature without prior knowledge, you may be unaware of what awaits. You can look it up and discover what a park has to offer. In conclusion, this is my view on how computers are helpful in a multitude of diverse ways.
1054	1056	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, on @DATE1, I am writing to you to express my opinion on whether computers are a good idea. Yes, I firmly believe that computers are an @CAPS12 excellent concept. I hold this view because, firstly, computers are indispensable for school projects. Secondly, they offer an @CAPS12 effortless way to make friends from other towns. Lastly, they enable you to @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Admittedly, the electric bill may be higher, but it is for a worthy cause. One should not simply assume that computers are detrimental to us; you may be pleasantly surprised. Firstly, let me explain why we need computers for projects. From personal experience, my social studies teacher always prefers that we type our final drafts. Additionally, using a computer simplifies projects as @CAPS3 @CAPS4 corrects your errors, and @ORGANIZATION1 provides all the necessary information. I find it far more convenient to use a computer for projects, and I believe all of my friends share the same sentiment. If you remain unconvinced, continue reading as I am certain you will be eventually. Secondly, I will discuss how you can make friends using only a computer. I understand that parents these days are delighted when their children come home having made new friends. By using a computer, you can easily go online, search for friends you wish to @CAPS11 to @CAPS5 better, and chat with them (ensuring their authenticity). The other day, my friend @PERSON1 approached me and said, ""Meet my friend @CAPS6 whom I met online!"" I was genuinely happy for her and realized the helpfulness of computers. Everyone needs friends who are there for them, and computers are an ideal solution. Lastly, I will elaborate on why and how you can @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Do you know what @ORGANIZATION1 is? You can search @CAPS7 on @ORGANIZATION1! If you are truly curious about something, you can conduct a search on @ORGANIZATION1. This is an excellent way to become educated. Moreover, computers assist you with @CAPS12 @CAPS13 as every time you type a random story on @CAPS3 @CAPS4, it corrects your mistakes, and you learn from them. In summary, a computer is an @CAPS12 easy way to @CAPS11 @CAPS12 easy @CAPS13, and you should keep using computers to experience the benefits yourself. In conclusion, I was asked to write a paper expressing my opinion on whether to keep using computers. By now, you should understand that I am in favor of it. In case you have doubts about my reasons, I will briefly restate them. Firstly, you need a computer for projects. Secondly, you can make friends. Lastly, you can @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. All these aspects offer significant benefits in the long run. Don't forget that you can @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13! That is what everyone desires. I hope you will come to agree with me. Thank you for your attention."
1055	1057	1	1	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1, and I firmly believe that computers exert a negative influence on individuals. When people spend the entire day on computers, they have less time for physical exercise. They are exposed to a greater degree of risk, and they spend less time with their families. These are merely some of the reasons why computers do not contribute positively to society. Moreover, the more time spent on computers, the less time is available for exercise. With the obesity rate on the rise, no one wishes to be incapacitated from performing regular activities. By spending all your time on the computer, you are merely setting yourself up to become overweight and unhealthy. It also makes many individuals self - conscious. If they do not allocate sufficient time for exercise and continue to consume excessive food, they will become even more self - conscious. Additionally, it poses a greater threat to you and your family. There are numerous platforms on the internet where you can meet new people. However, how can you ascertain if people are who they claim to be? If you spend more time on the computer, you increase your chances by @PERCENT3 of experiencing a personal assault or even divulging your personal information. So, why take the risk? Simply step away from the computer! Even if you do not encounter an internet assailant, you will still be glued to your computer, making it more likely for you to be harassed. I definitely do not want this for my family. The final reason is of utmost importance to @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 families. If you spend all your time on the computer, you will miss out on valuable family time. This time is extremely crucial as you never know when your family may no longer be around! It is a very distressing thought. I know that most people in @LOCATION1 desire to spend all their time with their families. On a related note, a survey indicates that @PERCENT2 of children who spend time with their families and less than @NUM1 minutes on the computer have grades higher than @NUM2 in all classes. Wouldn't you like to make the honor roll at your school? In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people! Spending most of your time on the computer can result in less time for exercise, greater danger and harm to individuals, and less time spent with your family. Wouldn't you prefer to spend less time on the computer? Thank you for your time.
1056	1058	1	1	I opine that computers indeed exert a positive influence on individuals as they cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow people with learning capabilities, and facilitate online communication. Firstly, they foster hand - eye coordination, which I deem beneficial because when individuals enter the workforce, they are likely to be more focused and work with greater speed. Thus, if their jobs involve computer use, tasks become more manageable and enjoyable. Secondly, computers empower people to acquire more knowledge. With numerous information - rich websites available, individuals can expand their intellectual horizons. Enhanced knowledge may enable them to secure well - paying jobs. They can conduct research on any topic of interest. Through extensive research and education, they can attain their dream jobs as knowledgeable individuals are often more competitive. Lastly, computers enable online communication. The ability to contact others is advantageous, especially when phone access is unavailable. One can use email or webcams to interact visually. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial due to their ability to develop hand - eye coordination, promote learning, and facilitate online interaction.
1057	1059	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 is a place where individuals are constantly engrossed in computers every day. I contend that computers do not confer benefits upon society as they curtail exercise time, limit nature appreciation, and reduce quality time spent with family and friends. To commence, computers detract from exercise opportunities. Would one not prefer to engage in physical activity and shed excess weight rather than passively sitting in front of a computer, which may potentially harm cognitive function? @PERSON1 stated that @PERCENT1 of individuals who acquire a new computer spend @NUM1 more minutes on it compared to their usual usage. Secondly, computers prevent people from enjoying the outdoors. The New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper expressed concerns that if too many individuals own high - quality computers, no one will venture outside to appreciate nature. Eventually, deforestation may lead to human extinction. Lastly, computer use reduces time spent with family and friends. For instance, I became addicted to Xbox Live and my sister was similarly hooked on our new computer. If parents restrict children's computer access, they will have more time for exercise, nature appreciation, and socializing with loved ones. In conclusion, computers are not beneficial to society.
1058	1060	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, do you believe that computers have an adverse impact on people? I concur. Individuals allocate excessive time to the @CAPS5. When they should be working, they become distracted and pursue their own agendas. Some people sit at their @CAPS5 and become irate at @CAPS6. When they are unsure what to do, they resort to using the @CAPS5. Working on the @CAPS5 often leads to distraction. People are distracted by the internet icon in the corner of their eye, click it, and then abandon their work. The internet is not the sole distraction; games such as @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and hearts, which come pre - installed on the @CAPS5, also divert attention. People become frustrated with their @CAPS5 when @CAPS6 fails to perform as expected, such as slow loading, deleting important files, or refusing to turn on. They may exclaim, ""@CAPS7, why are you so slow? I need to finish my work paper!"" or ""@CAPS9, where is the paper I saved? Are you joking with me?"" or ""Why won't you turn on, stupid computer?"" Moreover, people squander excessive time on the @CAPS5. When they have nothing to do, they rely on it. In the @ORGANIZATION1, individuals have access to a @CAPS5 at home and even on their phones. The prevalence of the @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1 is a growing concern. Spending too much time on the @CAPS5 can lead to weight gain as people choose to use it instead of socializing with friends. In conclusion, I firmly believe that @CAPS5 have a negative impact on people. They cause work distractions, are unjustly blamed for mistakes, and contribute to a sedentary lifestyle and weight gain."
1059	1061	1	1	"Do you possess a home computer that you frequently use? Most individuals utilize computers for various purposes, such as socializing with friends or completing projects. Computers offer both advantages and disadvantages. They are designed to assist in learning. Personally, I advocate that computers are highly beneficial. They enable us to access information from distant locations. For example, when working on a project in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 about @LOCATION2, if we lack knowledge, the computer can provide diverse perspectives and visual aids. It can also uncover the history of a place. I recall my sister discussing a question that required computer - assisted research; the answer was World War @CAPS3, and she achieved a @PERCENT1 score. We can also monitor events in @LOCATION1 and other places by simply searching on the computer. My teacher once said, ""Okay class, today we will go to the computer lab for research."" When asked what we would research, the response was ""@CAPS5 happening in @LOCATION1."" These @CAPS5 can support research projects and many other endeavors. Computers offer a plethora of functions. For example, certain programs allow us to search for information, play games, and complete homework. One can essentially accomplish anything on a computer. @CAPS2 indicates that @PERCENT2 of people in @LOCATION1 use computers for assistance. My friend always types her essays on the computer as it facilitates teacher review and typing. These programs are highly useful. People often use computers to save information and keep track of events. I do the same to determine the optimal time to make purchases. In conclusion, those who underestimate the value of computers in @LOCATION1 should reconsider their stance as computers offer numerous benefits for learning and daily life."
1060	1062	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. They enable online communication, expedite research, and are highly efficient and user - friendly. I shall elaborate on these reasons. Firstly, computers facilitate online interaction. Engaging in online conversations can enhance communication skills and expose one to diverse individuals. I regularly communicate with my friends via webcams, instant messaging, or social platforms like Facebook. Computers and webcams allow us to stay connected with friends who have relocated or relatives. Secondly, computers accelerate the research process. Studies reveal that @PERCENT1 of individuals prefer using computers over encyclopedias or other books to gather information for academic papers. Computers are more efficient and easier to use than traditional books. I concur that computers are highly efficient and I enjoy using them. When conducting research on a computer, one can complete the task promptly. Finally, computers are efficient and user - friendly. Given a choice between a computer and a set of encyclopedias, most people would opt for the computer. Using a computer is far simpler; one merely types a query into the search bar, and results appear instantaneously. In contrast, searching for information in a book or encyclopedia can be time - consuming, and the information provided is often limited, unlike the vast amount of data available on a computer. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on people as they enable online communication, expedite research, and are highly efficient and user - friendly. I hope you will share my perspective on the benefits of computers.
1061	1063	1	1	"Computers can prove to be highly beneficial to individuals. They facilitate the connection with friends and family across the globe. One may require a computer for typing an academic or work paper and can access the internet. In the event that a friend or family member relocates, computers offer a convenient means of contacting them. Telephones do not always provide the option to make calls from around the world. Suppose your best friend moves abroad; you can email or instant - message them via computers. Even if there is a blizzard with four - foot snow and you wish to chat with a neighbor, computers present a straightforward way to communicate. When my friend traveled to @LOCATION1 on @DATE1, I utilized instant messaging to converse with her. Imagine being at work or school and being tasked with writing a five - page essay. Do you truly want to write it all by hand? Envision writing hundreds of such essays daily. Typing is an effortless solution that demands less effort and consumes less time. Typing also renders work neater and more legible. Not even a library possesses all the necessary information. What if you need to write a newspaper article about a newly discovered animal? A library will not immediately acquire new books on it. The internet is an ideal source to obtain information as it occurs. What if a celebrity is hit by a bus or a space rocket lands successfully? You cannot expect to travel across the country to observe and take notes. The internet provides information on virtually everything. The internet also enables students to enroll in online schools or courses. When my eldest brother was unable to take @CAPS1 in high school, which was necessary for college, he took an online @CAPS1 course at home. The internet also assists in finding vacation destinations when traveling. What if you need a plane, train, or boat ticket? What if you need to rent a car but cannot visit the store or airport? You can go online to purchase tickets. Have you ever heard someone say ""@CAPS3 it on Google"" when they do not know the answer to something? I recall my friend telling me about her new dog, a breed I had never heard of. When I got home, I went online to research it. The internet is an extremely useful tool for everyone. Using a computer allows one to communicate with anyone, anywhere, type any required content, or access the internet. The computer simplifies life and is also enjoyable, making it a useful tool for writing a newspaper."
1062	1064	1	1	Did you know that the positive effects of computers on people outweigh the negative ones? I contend that the utilization of computers enhances one's knowledge of distant places, can be employed for communication safely, and simplifies everyday tasks. Computers have become indispensable tools in society. Firstly, using a computer enables a Floridian to learn about Connecticut or a Canadian to learn about the world around them safely. In a study conducted by the @ORGANIZATION1, it has been demonstrated that without computers, @PERCENT1 of all people would have remained ignorant of the one - child dilemma in @LOCATION3. Additionally, since the crime rate in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 is @PERCENT2, an American might be reluctant to visit @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1, yet they must learn about it for a business project. What should they do? They access the computer and acquire all the information they need about @LOCATION1 from the safety of their homes. While people can learn about far - off places from the comfort of their houses, they can also utilize the computer for communication purposes. The computer is an excellent tool for interacting with others. In a survey conducted in @DATE1, @PERCENT3 of computer users had some form of social networking or instant messaging program. Examples of these are @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, respectively. Contacting people has never been easier. Did you know that out of every @NUM1 Americans, they spend an average of a few hours online every day? Is it true that the average IQ has increased in the last @NUM2 years? When online, students can receive assistance from fellow students, teachers, and even experts! Computer users can obtain feedback on essays, support for learning something new, and even boost their self - confidence. Communication is a valuable application of computers, as is the ease of performing everyday tasks online. In today's society, the computer can significantly simplify everyday tasks! When I was a child, my mother spent hours at the local grocery store shopping for food. That all changed when my mother discovered @LOCATION2. It is a secure and convenient way to purchase food online and have it delivered. Moreover, @PERCENT4 of Americans with computers have paid their taxes online. A once - arduous task has become simple with just a click of a button. It is remarkable that the majority of our day need not be filled with mundane errands but with what we desire! Whether that involves exercising or simply enjoying nature. In summary, computers are valuable assets to society. They have a multitude of purposes and functions. They can increase a person's knowledge of distant places safely, be used for communication, and simplify everyday tasks. It is difficult to even fathom how we managed before this device emerged.
1063	1065	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my name is @CAPS3, and I am unsure where to commence this letter. I am writing to convey my belief that not everyone should use a computer. My first rationale is that individuals become so distracted by the computer that they neglect their schoolwork. My second reason is that they fail to spend time with their parents. My third reason is that excessive computer use can lead to health issues. My first argument against frequent computer use is that it causes people to forget about school. They become so engrossed in writing, chatting, or playing @CAPS4 that they lose focus on their studies. Another consequence is that their grades decline, and they often do not complete their homework. My second point is that they neglect their parents. Instead of spending time with their family, they are preoccupied with the computer. My third reason is that excessive computer use can lead to health problems, and they may miss out on education as they are constantly on the computer. In conclusion, excessive computer use is detrimental. I hope you understand my perspective.
1064	1066	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, there is a significant amount of discourse and debate regarding computers. Some assert that they are beneficial to society, while others hold the opposite view. For my part, I am among those who advocate for computers. I believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Firstly, the hand - eye coordination of the user is generally enhanced over time, which is beneficial for learning musical instruments. Additionally, computers offer a remarkable learning capacity, particularly for students. Without computers, a student tasked with writing a report would have to peruse an encyclopedia, which consumes significantly more time than simply searching for information on the internet. Finally, computers are excellent for communicating with distant friends or family. The first topic on my agenda is the development of hand - eye coordination skills. These skills refer to the ability to coordinate the hands and eyes simultaneously. There are numerous impacts these skills can have. The most obvious is in the realm of musical instruments. When learning to play a new song on the guitar, one must move their fingers in accordance with the notes on the screen. Another area where hand - eye coordination is useful is in sports. In football, for example, hand - eye coordination plays a crucial role. When the ball is thrown, the wide receiver must track the ball with their eyes and position their hands optimally to catch it. I also wish to discuss the vast world of learning facilitated by computers. Suppose someone asks you who was the @NUM1 president of the @ORGANIZATION2. Where would you look for the answer? I, for one, would definitely search for it on Google (an internet search engine). Moreover, schools @CAPS1 can demand more from their students as they have access to a wealth of information. Lastly, I would like to address the communication capabilities of computers. For instance, if a close friend moves out of state, how will you stay in touch? You could use the phone, but long - distance charges have soared in the past @NUM2 years. Did you know that if you talk long - distance for @NUM3 minutes a day, it would cost over @NUM4 per month? In today's economy, one needs to save money rather than spend it on long - distance calls. The internet incurs no additional charges for chatting, regardless of the distance between users. I hope that my letter will be more successful than ""@CAPS2'bama's failed health - care bill"" and will at least be published in the paper. People should be aware of the facts about computers before engaging in arguments about them."
1065	1067	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, many people own computers, and many use them. It has come to my attention that the government is concerned about people using computers excessively. However, I believe that one cannot use a computer too much. They offer numerous advantages such as providing information, enabling communication, and fostering life skills. That does not seem bad at all. Information is something that humans strive for. In modern schools and workplaces, one needs to know a variety of unusual facts. Where can one acquire this knowledge? Of course, from computers! When @PERSON1 (my teacher) assigns us a research paper on Walt Disney, we use computers to gather information. Without computers, I would not have known that Walt Disney passed away before the opening of Disney World. This clearly demonstrates one of the many reasons we need computers. Communication is another vital aspect of our lives. With a computer, there are @MONEY1 ways to communicate. Although some of these methods can be risky, many are safe. When I was in @NUM1 grade, my teacher, Ms. Casserelle, set up a class - wide email for us. This allowed us to exchange emails with another school. This form of online communication was entirely secure. As long as the user is semi - responsible, nothing can go wrong. How can one go wrong with that? Did you know that @PERCENT1 of life skills can be and are learned on computers? In fact, most jobs involve the use of a computer. One life skill that can be learned is typing. As mentioned earlier, research papers require computers not only for information but also for typing. Most jobs in our world rely on computers in some way. Can you think of a job that does not require a computer at all? I thought not. Information, communication, and life skills are all essential to human nature. I believe that computers are crucial for humans. Whether one admits it or not, everything we do involves a computer to some extent. Can one spend countless hours on a computer? Yes, and one needs to.
1066	1068	1	1	Computers exert a substantial influence on society; however, do they truly enhance every aspect of life? Individuals allocate an excessive amount of time to computers. Computers do not contribute to cognitive development; instead, they can lead to weight gain, and for numerous individuals, they instigate drama. People ought to curtail their computer usage. Under no circumstances do computers aid cognitive function. Consider this: while it is true that a significant portion of work is accomplished on computers, what about children? They squander the majority of their time online, engaging in trivial activities. Instead, they could be outdoors or engaged in study. The internet is a public domain, accessible to anyone, and if a child uses a computer, they are exposed to a plethora of pernicious elements that will not be beneficial in the future. It is an established fact that students who spend less time watching television or using computers achieve better academic grades. I recall my mother frequently scolding me for excessive computer use and poor grades, so she restricted my access for a period, and subsequently, my grades improved significantly. Evidently, computer use does not enhance intelligence. Prolonged computer use can result in substantial weight gain. Those who spend extended periods on the computer are sedentary, and many consume food while using it. This combination of inactivity and eating can lead to weight gain. From personal experience, I know that an active lifestyle, including outdoor activities and exercise, promotes well - being. Once weight is gained, it is extremely difficult to shed. Remaining sedentary like a couch potato is detrimental to health and can lead to obesity. One may claim contentment with their weight, but that does not equate to good health. A significant number of individuals have died due to obesity, which exacts a heavy toll on life. If one wishes to avoid the risk of death from excessive weight, it is advisable to step away from the computer and embrace an active life. The final drawback of computers is the drama they generate. Most people use platforms such as Facebook, AIM, or @CAPS1, and those with accounts on these platforms will likely attest to having been involved in disputes through them. Additionally, there is a new platform called Formspring, which allows users to remain anonymous and post malicious comments. A friend of mine was a victim of such abuse, and it had a devastating impact. Moreover, there are numerous individuals on Facebook who fabricate their identities, and in today's digital age, it is easy for someone to discover personal information and pose a threat. Clearly, computers are not only detrimental to health but can also be life - threatening. Why invite such risks when it is so simple to reduce computer usage? Remember, computers do not enhance cognitive abilities, they can cause weight gain, and they create a great deal of drama. Therefore, it is best to limit computer use.
1067	1069	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, a substantial number of individuals utilize computers @CAPS2 for a diverse array of purposes. Computers confer significant benefits upon society. Although some individuals @MONTH1 overuse their computers, the tasks they accomplish facilitate the smooth operation of our world. Moreover, computers enable us to maintain contact with friends and family whom we no longer see regularly, and they rapidly impart valuable knowledge. Without computers, society would not function as efficiently as it does currently. One way in which computers benefit society is by expediting the completion of tasks such as writing papers and conducting research. For instance, if @ORGANIZATION1 needed to promptly publish an article in the newspaper about the catastrophic earthquake in @LOCATION1, computers would be invaluable, as they allow for much faster typing compared to handwriting. Computers are highly beneficial to society because they enable us to complete tasks rapidly and efficiently. Another reason for the significance of computers is their ability to foster long - distance relationships. Since around @DATE1, computers have played a crucial role, especially for those like me who live far from home. A recent survey indicated that @PERCENT1 of college graduates use computers to stay connected with friends in their hometowns. Video - conferencing features even allow us to see each other. Computers also benefit society by providing access to a vast amount of information. Search engines such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, and others empower us to research any topic of interest with a single click. This rapid access to information has a profound impact on individuals. With this knowledge, people become more erudite and intelligent, and this intellectual growth enables them to achieve remarkable feats. According to @PERSON1, a computer scientist at @ORGANIZATION2, ""The knowledge people acquire from computer search engines enables them to perform @CAPS2 tasks more effectively and achieve greater success in their lives."" Computers are most beneficial to society when their use is balanced with other essential activities such as exercise and social interaction. They quickly teach us new information, perform tasks efficiently, and allow us to communicate with people worldwide. Without computers, tasks would take longer to complete, and society would be less productive. We rely on computers to perform @CAPS2 tasks and carry out the activities necessary for daily life."
1068	1070	1	1	I contend that excessive computer use is ill - advised because @CAPS1 harbors numerous perils online. @CAPS1 can diminish cognitive abilities and induce lethargy. These are the @NUM1 primary reasons why one should refrain from spending excessive time on the computer. Firstly, the internet exposes users to dangerous elements such as kidnapping scenarios. I have witnessed numerous videos and movies depicting instances where adults befriend young children online, arrange meetings, and the children subsequently disappear. Secondly, excessive computer use can impair cognitive function. For example, when I used to spend entire days on the computer, I would sometimes enter the bathroom in search of food, a clear indication of mental disorientation. @CAPS1 often leaves one feeling as if emerging from a daze. Lastly, computers can promote laziness. Prolonged computer use involves extended periods of sitting without sunlight or exercise. @CAPS1 creates a sense of inertia, making one reluctant to leave the computer, which is detrimental to both mental and physical health. These three factors underscore the importance of limiting computer use. The more time one spends on the computer, the more difficult it becomes to disengage. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid excessive computer use due to the associated risks and the negative impact on health and well - being.
1069	1071	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computer usage can have both positive and negative impacts on individuals. The benefits may include knowledge acquisition and the opportunity to meet new people, while the adverse effects can encompass weight gain and a deficiency in social skills for face - to - face or phone conversations. Firstly, knowledge acquisition is of utmost importance. When a computer malfunctions, having prior knowledge can enable one to troubleshoot independently, obviating the need to purchase potentially ineffective anti - software at a cost. Moreover, if one aspires to become a computer engineer, the time spent on the computer can be highly beneficial in the long run. Secondly, computers facilitate interaction with individuals from foreign countries and other states. One need not meet these people in person; a friendly online conversation suffices. However, the third and final drawback of computer use is weight gain. Many individuals spend excessive time on the computer, neglecting physical activity. They sit for extended periods, consuming unhealthy snacks while playing games or watching videos, which is extremely detrimental to health. In conclusion, moderate computer use is far more advantageous than excessive use. It can contribute to knowledge acquisition and social interaction, but excessive use can lead to weight gain and a lack of social skills.
1070	1072	1	1	Dear editor, while @CAPS1 may advocate for the benefits of extensive computer use, I hold a contrary view. Individuals who spend excessive time on computers fail to engage in sufficient exercise, do not receive an adequate amount of fresh air, and neglect to spend quality time with family and friends. It is now necessary to determine whether excessive computer use is advisable. Those who are glued to their computers could be engaging in outdoor activities daily. Some parents encourage their children to play on the computer all day instead of going outside to exercise. Children could engage in activities such as cycling, scooter - riding, basketball, wiffle ball, swimming, and visiting playgrounds. They could also take long walks on the beach. Fresh air is essential, and individuals should step away from the computer and enjoy outdoor settings. They can sit on the beach, watch their children's games, or simply relax on the porch while waiting for their children to return from school. Moreover, computer enthusiasts often fail to allocate sufficient time to their family and friends. They could visit their relatives more frequently, have lunch with friends, and engage in activities with their children. Although online chat is available, there is no substitute for face - to - face interaction. The time has come to decide whether excessive computer use is detrimental. Lack of exercise, fresh air, and social interaction are the consequences of excessive computer use. Therefore, it is essential to write to the local newspaper expressing one's stance on this issue.
1071	1073	1	1	In my view, computers exert a detrimental influence on individuals. I hold this opinion because they lead people to engage in less physical activity, reduce the time spent with family and friends, and distract individuals from completing tasks. Firstly, computers have a negative impact on people as they cause a decrease in exercise. For instance, there are numerous football, soccer, and baseball games. Instead of practicing these sports, individuals will sit in front of the computer on the webcam all night. Another aspect is that one can accomplish work without even leaving home. One can shop online, work from home, and even attend college. These activities previously involved going out, but now one can simply stay indoors and be lazy. Secondly, the computer reduces interpersonal interaction. Recently, when a family member or friend visited, I sat right beside them, yet they didn't even glance at me as they were engrossed in computer games. I know that many more children are in the same situation because I read in a magazine that @PERCENT1 of parents interact with their children less since getting a computer. Lastly, I believe the computer has a negative effect as it distracts them. It distracts children from conversations. Firstly, when people attempt to talk with someone while using the computer, it is extremely difficult because they are absorbed in what they are doing. Secondly, the computer distracts children from their homework. I know this firsthand because whenever I have typing assignments, I get distracted and end up visiting different websites, failing to complete my work. Lastly, it distracts children from household chores. Some children simply set them aside and forget to do them because they are busy playing games or surfing the web. I know that if I did so, I'd be in serious trouble. These are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people. It causes them to exercise less, reduces their interaction with others, and distracts them. Therefore, unless you desire these things to happen to you, I recommend spending less time on the computer!
1072	1074	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have been voicing complaints about computers in our society. They claim that computers keep children indoors idle, but in reality, they are extremely beneficial to us! The internet is a vast resource where one can conduct research on anything, and a plethora of helpful ideas emerge. Moreover, @CAPS5 enhances hand - eye coordination. Lastly, computers enable us to maintain contact with individuals who are far away. For example, last year my friend went to Poland, and we were able to communicate via our computers! So, I invite you to join me in helping the world recognize that computers are advantageous. Firstly, I would like to assert that the computer is an excellent source of information. How would you feel if you still had to peruse scrolls from antiquity when you could access information online? Not to mention, when you need to know something urgently, such as when you're in a bind before a significant meeting. All you have to do is simply type in what you want to know, and just like that, you have the information and can proceed to your meeting. Secondly, using the mouse and keys on a computer can improve hand - eye coordination. As my parents always say when I'm typing an essay, @NUM1 words per minute is a remarkable rate. Moreover, out of @NUM2 kids, many improve their hand - eye coordination after becoming proficient on the computer. Often, kids have a lack of coordination, but I believe that if kids engage with the computer, this will change. Most importantly, computers facilitate communication with those at a distance. As I mentioned before, I stayed in touch with my Polish friend. Moreover, many people don't own cell phones, so they utilize an @CAPS4, Gmail, Facebook, MySpace, or Twitter. All of these allow us to stay connected and keep abreast of our friends' lives. This is crucial because if we are social, we will spend time with our friends and engage in activities, which is vital for our well - being. In conclusion, it is beneficial for our society to have computers in our lives. Computers will assist us in the future; we will achieve good grades on projects due to our access to resources. We will maintain good health through improved hand - eye coordination from using the mouse and keyboard. Lastly, we will have numerous friends. All of these aspects are highly significant. So, let's embrace computers!
1073	1075	1	1	Dear readers, I am writing to you today regarding the effects of computer usage. I believe that there are both positive and negative effects associated with using the computer. One can communicate with others and complete work, but excessive use may lead to deteriorating health and cause one to miss out on other aspects of life. Through the computer, there are numerous ways to interact with others, which is truly remarkable. Whether it is through a game, typing, or real - time chatting, it is of great importance to communicate with people, and this makes things far more convenient than face - to - face communication. For instance, in the past, people used to write letters to their pen - pals, but now one can send messages via email at no cost. Simply type up your letter, click a button, and it's done. Another positive aspect of computers is that they allow one to complete work. Whether it is work for a business or schoolwork, it doesn't matter. One often hears of people using computers to accomplish tasks. Why do you think there are computer labs at school or desks with computers in offices? Computers have become highly advanced and are the most convenient tools for getting things done. Presentations, essays, graphs – you name it. However, I am concerned that people are becoming overly addicted to computers. Many younger individuals are overusing computers, which leads to poor health. When people sit in front of a computer screen all day, only getting up to eat, they are likely to become obese. To stay healthy, people need to be outdoors and engage in exercise. We need to establish rules to encourage people to go outside and lead a healthy life for the next generation. So, I have mixed feelings about computers. They can be wonderful for a certain period, but only temporarily. If you can't recognize this, open your eyes.
1074	1076	1	1	"To the editor of the @ORGANIZATION2, I am penning this letter to express my stance on whether computers benefit or harm society. I am of the opinion that computers are an outstanding tool for several reasons. Firstly, computers serve as a valuable learning resource and a means for people to stay informed about the world around them. Additionally, computers enable us to maintain connections with friends and family more effortlessly. Evidently, computers are more beneficial to people than they are harmful. Life as we know it today would be significantly different without the advancements in computer technology made over the past few decades. Nowadays, if I need to know something, whether it is for @ORGANIZATION1 or for personal reasons, I can almost instantaneously search for information and obtain answers from a variety of sources. This helps people become more educated and well - informed about the world. Dr. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 recently conducted a study on high - school teenagers and concluded that ""@CAPS1 students with access to computers scored significantly better on standardized tests due to the background information they acquired online"". Alongside the internet, there are programs such as @ORGANIZATION4 and @ORGANIZATION3, which aid people in learning a new language or writing on the computer. Moreover, computers keep us updated on global events. For example, when the earthquake devastated @LOCATION1, I first learned about it from the news but received very limited details. I then searched for information online and immediately obtained the death toll, the aid being provided, and ways I could contribute to the donation. Without computers, I would have been unaware of all this. Another reason why computers are so beneficial to society is that they are tools that facilitate communication with others. With platforms like Facebook and @CAPS2, I can chat with people, invite friends over, and even plan parties. Without computers, I would have to call each person individually, but with computers, I can write one message and send it to everyone simultaneously. This gives me more time to engage in activities such as playing outdoors and exercising. Furthermore, platforms like @CAPS3 and Facebook help people stay in touch with old and distant friends. Studies conducted by @ORGANIZATION5 indicate that @PERCENT1 of people with some form of social networking account have a more active social life than those who do not. According to Dr. @PERSON1, this means that these people will find it easier to adapt to different social situations than those without such accounts. Clearly, this is a significant advantage. In conclusion, the computer benefits society far more than it hinders it. It allows people to stay educated, informed, and connected with ease. It helps people stay aware of the world and educated on various matters. It simplifies tasks that would otherwise be time - consuming, giving people more time for other activities such as outdoor play. It also promotes social interaction and enables people to connect with others. Undoubtedly, computers are a great asset."
1075	1077	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, computers have an impact on people and their lives. Many children spend their time after school playing games, using MySpace, Facebook, and checking their email. Instead of constantly using computers, I believe that both children and adults should go outside and have a good time. There is no issue with using the computer occasionally, but spending the entire day on it is quite detrimental. Adults should not allow their children to spend all day on the computer, nor should they do so themselves because it does not enhance one's life. Computers can disrupt one's life through the choices one makes, the pictures one posts, and the things one writes. For example, if you have a MySpace or Facebook account and post inappropriate pictures, in the future, when you are seeking a good job, employers may look back at them and decide not to hire you, thus ruining your future. Instead of being on the computer all the time, one could go outside, engage in sports to maintain physical health, explore the world, learn new things, or even plan family trips and go for walks. This is far better than using computers and putting oneself at risk of losing a job or ruining one's future. One should not let computers ruin their life because if they do, life will never be the same. Children can also ruin their lives due to the things they write or the pictures they post. Other kids may see them, be mean, and talk about them throughout the school year. Sometimes, it may even lead to a fight over a single word or a picture that one thought was cute. Sex offenders are active on computers, and many people are unaware of their presence until it's too late, until someone is taken away or killed. Parents do not always know when there is a sex offender online trying to communicate with them or their children and arrange a meeting. Sex offenders may post fake pictures to lure people into speaking with them or meeting them in person. Therefore, one should not let computers have such a hold on them.
1076	1078	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1: You recently presented a query in your newspaper, the @CAPS2 Yourk @CAPS3, inquiring whether readers were in favor of or opposed to technology. I advocate for computers as they afford individuals the opportunity to gain knowledge about diverse people worldwide and their cultures. They also conserve substantial amounts of time in today's bustling society, and one can engage in online conversations with others via specific computer programs. With a computer, one can acquire a plethora of information about foreign countries and their cultures.  I perused an article in the @CAPS4 @CAPS3 about a man participating in a church program where a foreign citizen would visit @LOCATION2 for a period to make friends and learn about the @LOCATION1. This man, @PERSON1, was assigned a woman from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never left the fields. @PERSON1 deemed it appropriate to welcome her into his home in a familiar setting. Unfortunately, he knew nothing about @CAPS6. However, he had a computer to which he promptly turned to learn everything about her homeland. When the woman entered his door, @CAPS8 was overjoyed to feel as if @CAPS8 were home again. @CAPS8 ultimately stayed with @PERSON1 and got married. Had he not impressed her with his computer - acquired knowledge, @CAPS8 might not have stayed and enjoyed a wonderful life with him.  Moreover, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 asserts that language students, such as those studying Spanish and French, have a @PERCENT1 higher success rate if they possess a computer to learn more about the countries. He states that the average grade for students with a computer is an A, whereas the average grade for students without a computer is a @CAPS9+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about distant places and people can guarantee future happiness and success.  Computers also save a significant amount of time. In the school newspaper, @PERSON6 recounted her homework dilemma. ""One night, I had an overwhelming amount of homework. I had a multitude of vocabulary words to deal with. I had to look up each word in the massive dictionary, and I was failing @CAPS11 because I simply lacked the time for my homework! Then my family purchased a computer for me. Using the online dictionary was a delight. I could complete my homework in @NUM1 minutes compared to @NUM2 hours! I finally started performing well in @CAPS11."" Without her computer, @PERSON6 would have spent @NUM2 hours on @CAPS11. She would have continued to fail without her time - saving computer.  Additionally, @PERSON3 claims that @PERCENT2 of people reach work more quickly when they check traffic reports on the computer rather than listening to the radio. He says that @PERCENT3 of people receive praise because their boss is highly impressed with their consistent punctuality. As evident, time is a precious commodity that computers can assist in conserving.  Finally, computers enable individuals to communicate online. A student once unfortunately fractured one of his vertebrae. The doctor informed him that he would be unable to attend school for a while. The student, @PERSON5, devised a plan to communicate with his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Every day, the teachers would provide @PERSON5 with an update through his computer. When he finally returned to school, @PERSON5 had hardly any work to catch up on because his teachers had interacted with him via the computer. Without his computer, @PERSON5 would have had a month's worth of work and learning to make up, which would have been overwhelming.  Furthermore, @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 states that students who communicate with their families during college develop better relationships after college. Evidently, the ability to converse with others via the computer is a valuable asset.  In conclusion, owning a family computer is highly advantageous. Not only does it allow people to learn about places beyond their own, but it also grants us more time and enables us to communicate with others without leaving the comfort of home. I recommend that everyone desiring an easier life invest in a computer."
1077	1079	1	1	Dear newspapers, I opine that computers exert a positive influence on people as they facilitate online communication. There are electronic devices available for children that can be connected to their computers to learn a variety of things. Additionally, one can settle bills using a computer. Individuals who either lack a phone or prefer not to leave home at a particular moment and own a computer can access chat rooms or local websites to interact with friends and family. Moreover, many individuals with websites like Facebook, MySpace, etc., can discover new acquaintances and find numerous commonalities. Some people even manage to find that special @CAPS1 person they have been seeking.  I believe they have recently introduced a new electronic device for young children, such as the Leaf Frog, which can be connected to a computer or laptop. Through this device, children can learn the alphabet, counting, and even spelling. This is an excellent product for young children as they can utilize it during the @DATE1 or after school to maintain their intellectual sharpness and learn both within and outside the school environment.  One day, I inquired of my mother what she was doing regarding the light bill. She informed me that she was using a website, though I forget its name, to pay the bill. Instead of going to a local establishment to pay bills, one can conveniently accomplish this task at home with a computer.  Therefore, I hope that you, the newspaper publishers, concur that this is a compelling argument highlighting the benefits of computers. I sincerely hope that computers remain an integral part of our lives for a long time.
1078	1080	1	1	"People have been posing the question to me, ""@CAPS1, do you believe we should allocate more or less time to computers?"" I firmly contend that we should reduce our computer usage. Firstly, children spend an excessive amount of time engrossed in online games. Secondly, both children and adults devote an inordinate amount of time to platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, MSN, and even AIM. Thirdly, children ought to be outdoors engaging in physical activities and exercise. These are the three primary reasons why I advocate for less computer time.  The first rationale for reducing computer usage is that children are overly preoccupied with online games, such as @CAPS2 of Warcraft, @CAPS3, and Soldier Front, among others. A significant issue with children playing these games is that they often become addicted and can play for hours on end. Children should be outside building stronger muscles and bones. By continuously playing these games, they are detrimentally affecting their lives. This is the first compelling reason to curtail computer time.  The second reason is that children and adults spend an excessive amount of time on social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, AIM, and MSN. These online platforms encourage people to connect with friends, but they also generate excessive drama and can lead to conflicts or the spread of rumors. Approximately @PERCENT1 of children and adults visit these online pages daily. It is high time they spent more time outdoors or socializing with friends in person rather than being glued to their computers.  The final but equally important reason is that children should be outside playing instead of being confined to the computer. They should go out with their friends and participate in sports or games that do not involve a computer. This is the third reason why children should not spend an excessive amount of time on computers.  As previously stated, people should reduce their computer usage. Children spend too much time on online games, adults and children alike spend too much time on online platforms, and children should be playing outside. It is time we set time limits on our computer usage and allocate more time to outdoor activities."
1079	1081	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers have adverse effects on people globally. While they do have their advantages and disadvantages, computers are, to some extent, perilous. Some individuals utilize computers for improper purposes. Some search for pornographic sites and attempt to hack into servers. I firmly believe that computers are intended for positive endeavors, not negative ones.  Another reason for my opposition to computers is the potential danger posed by online interactions. Many people assume they are communicating with one individual, but in reality, it could be anyone. Nowadays, people readily disclose personal information to strangers. This is how kidnappings and murders occur in our society.  @CAPS3 - @CAPS2 is also a significant problem associated with computers. (@CAPS3 - @CAPS2) refers to @CAPS2 someone via the computer. The consequence of this is that someone may get hurt, and the crime may remain unsolved.  Furthermore, people spend an excessive amount of time using computers. Instead of going outside and appreciating nature, they squander their time on computers. This is also a major contributing factor to obesity. People become obese due to a lack of physical activity and exercise.  In conclusion, the current usage of computers in our world is often misguided. This situation necessitates a change.
1080	1082	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, You are an avid computer user, correct? It is beneficial if you are because have you ever considered why experts are questioning the extensive use of computers by @CAPS5? I believe that @CAPS5 require computers as they are the means by which @CAPS5 stay informed about global events, learn about the weather conditions to prevent accidents, and although one can turn on the @CAPS2.V., one often has to wait for the desired information to be broadcast.  So, @ORGANIZATION1, you must decide whether @CAPS5 should spend more time outdoors. Don't you also need to be aware of what is happening in the world? Of course, you do, as everyone does. I believe it is crucial for @CAPS5 to know if a meteor is about to hit the world, don't you? President @PERSON2 even states that @PERCENT2 of the world obtains information about current affairs from computers. Are you going to disregard the President of the @LOCATION1? I think not.  I am @PERCENT1 certain that @ORGANIZATION1 does not wish to be labeled as the accident - prone state. This is precisely why @CAPS5 need computers. To know if it will snow, sleet, or if there is heavy traffic, @CAPS5 need to access the internet to find out when, where, and what is happening. The CEO of @CAPS3, @PERSON1, remarks, ""When someone says, '@CAPS5 might experience some snow or rain,' they typically turn to the internet immediately.""  One can turn on the @CAPS2.V. to gather information, but not all of it will be relevant or necessary. Hence, one has to wait. The internet, on the other hand, provides instant access to information (unless there is a poor internet connection).  Do you think these reasons present a compelling argument? I do. Do you use your computer to stay informed about current events, weather conditions, instead of relying on the @LOCATION2? If so, I believe you will concur with me."
1081	1083	1	1	I opine that utilizing a computer is entirely acceptable. The rationale behind this view is that one might have family members residing at a considerable distance. Instead of merely conversing and hearing voices over the phone, they can engage in dialogue and, most importantly, visually perceive one another. They can showcase novel and interesting items they possess. When one has a beloved one, they can see them even when a physical visit is not feasible. Computers prove beneficial when one's vehicle breaks down or when one does not own a car. One can purchase goods from stores with the convenience of remaining at home. Virtually everything available in a store can be procured as many establishments have online platforms that offer mail - delivery services. Additionally, one can now purchase food via the internet and much more. Computers assist in saving money by indicating where to obtain goods at favorable prices. There are numerous dating websites where one can meet diverse individuals, go out with them, and share one's opinions. Texting on Facebook enables cost - savings as it is free. One can play free online games with friends. Moreover, one can create websites and watch movies and shows online. There are simply a multitude of activities one can undertake on a computer. I am aware that many individuals refrain from going outside to exercise, yet I concur with certain experts. A large number of people need to shed weight or spend more time in the real world outdoors. Due to this technology, some people become sedentary and consume excessive amounts of food. Nevertheless, computers are highly useful in numerous aspects and are extremely enjoyable. These are the reasons why I believe computers are excellent and should be utilized more extensively.
1082	1084	1	1	"Computers confer significant advantages upon individuals. Firstly, computers are versatile and beneficial machines. For instance, I personally utilize a computer to check my homework. They are also valuable because whenever one encounters knowledge gaps, one can access the internet to conduct searches. Provided that computers are not used for extended periods, they do not adversely affect our health. In fact, they can aid students in completing projects by using software such as Word, Excel, and other Microsoft applications. Hence, I contend that computers are remarkable machines for people to possess. Secondly, using computers facilitates social interaction. Many students, including myself, use Facebook. Thus, even when we are not in close proximity, we can still communicate. Computers can also be employed to make new friends. However, as our health teacher, @PERSON1, stated, ""There are individuals we do not know, and we should not disclose our personal information."" Computers are useful for staying in touch with friends who live far away. If a friend moves to another state, one can use a computer to chat with them. There are numerous ways to socialize using computers. Lastly, exercise is crucial for everyone. Using computers does not imply that we can no longer go outside and exercise. Although computers can be addictive, if one monitors their usage time and limits it to, for example, half an hour at a time, one can still engage in the necessary exercise. Exercise is not difficult, and children generally enjoy it, so there should not be an issue. For example, my neighbor often comes to my house and invites me to play football while I am chatting with someone on the computer, and I still go outside to play. Therefore, computers are not overly addictive, and parents need not worry about their children's exercise habits. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people, whether it is for online research or communicating with friends. Adults also require them for work. This demonstrates that computers are indeed remarkable machines."
1083	1085	1	1	Over the past few years, computers have significantly assisted humanity. Thanks to computers, scientists have discovered cures for diseases, jobs have become more manageable, and communication with friends and family has become more affordable. I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people as they educate individuals about various places around the world, assist with professional tasks, and enable cost - free communication. If someone plans to visit a particular country, they can use a computer to learn more about its culture. They can also visit websites to find affordable flights or suitable accommodation. When a child is tasked with writing a report about a country in @LOCATION1, they can access a computer to gather relevant facts. Computers educate people about global locations. One can visit websites featuring videos and short clips to learn about current events without incurring any costs. If one wishes to celebrate a friend's birthday but lacks the funds to travel halfway across the world, one can engage in a video chat. Computers help people save money by enabling communication with friends, family, and colleagues. Since their invention, computers have been extremely helpful. They allow people to learn about different parts of the world and acquire knowledge on any subject. They also simplify work and help people save a substantial amount of money by replacing phone calls with online communication. Computers have undergone remarkable improvements over the years. Previously, their screens were small, and one had to press multiple buttons to start them. Now, computers can be as large as flat - screen @CAPS1 and can be turned on with a single button press. Who can predict what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now?
1084	1086	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 post, I have been contemplating the impact of computers on our lives. On this very topic, I concur with experts who assert that people are spending excessive time on computers and less time on other activities. I firmly believe that everyone, including myself, spends a significant amount of time online. Even when it comes to research, wouldn't it be more beneficial to consult a book for information? The same principle applies to computer games. Instead of playing virtual kickball, wouldn't it be better to play outside? The primary points I am trying to convey are that computers impede our progress, they are unable to provide physical assistance, and disengaging from the computer, or even going outside, would be more advantageous. I have mentioned how computers hold us back. The more time we spend on them, the less time we have for other daylight activities. I say this because instead of going outside, we prefer to stare at a screen, play games, or chat with friends. Online chat, in particular, has a profound impact on most people as we sacrifice a fun day outdoors for online conversations. I also believe that imposing a time limit on computer usage would encourage social interaction and outdoor activities. Unfortunately, computers prevent us from doing so, and we often end up achieving nothing. Another reason is that computers cannot physically assist us or make us active. I can relate to this as a cheerleader. I often watch YouTube videos to learn new stretching techniques and skills. However, despite spending time learning how to perform them, I often get injured and fail to execute them properly. This is why I prefer to seek guidance from a gymnastics teacher who can provide hands - on assistance and feedback. Lastly, I am convinced that reducing our computer usage would be beneficial for our well - being. After spending an hour or more online, I feel lethargic and unmotivated to do anything. Conversely, when I go outside, I feel energetic and active. Being away from the computer feels better and is better for us. In summary, while computers are useful tools, excessive use is detrimental. They truly hinder our progress and are harmful to our health. Additionally, excessive computer use reduces our physical activity levels. Thank you for reading.
1085	1087	1	1	"You claim that computers have a negative impact on today's society? @CAPS1, I am here to refute that claim and assert that they actually confer numerous benefits. For instance, some children may not own phones, yet they can log onto Facebook to access a wide range of features similar to those of a phone and more. In the realm of education, a vast number of homework assignments and projects are assigned, and computer programs can offer substantial assistance, lending a professional touch to the work. One cannot overlook Google, the most renowned online platform that everyone adores. It can be utilized for a multitude of purposes. Facebook, a website visited by people of all ages, undoubtedly offers benefits. By logging in, one can view the latest updates on friends' profiles, including pictures, videos, and life events, obtaining every minute detail. Moreover, if one does not have a phone, there is no need to worry as Facebook has a chat system. One can communicate with friends and relatives, and in the case of an upcoming family party, one can receive all the relevant information via inbox and visit relatives' homepages to catch up on their well - being. @CAPS3, if you have not logged into Facebook yet, you surely will now! How often do we hear a teacher say, ""This project will be done on the computer""? Almost every time an assignment is given! Windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs are extremely beneficial for students. For example, if one is assigned to create a product commercial in computer class, one can use Windows Movie Maker to obtain all the necessary help and create a professional - looking and sounding project. One program that is useful throughout life for presentations is PowerPoint. In my history class, when we were assigned to present on a famous person from the @DATE1's, I used PowerPoint and received an excellent grade! Another well - known program is @ORGANIZATION1 Word, which is used for various projects, homework, and especially for writing papers and short stories. With its spell - check feature, a good grade is almost guaranteed. Google is a household name that everyone loves and uses for almost everything. It can be used to search for pictures and information for school projects, watch videos of songs, friends, or favorite TV shows, and browse websites. Some argue that technology discourages people from exercising, but Google can provide videos of special workouts, websites on healthy eating, or information about exercise groups and fitness clubs. Thus, it is evident that the internet offers tremendous benefits. ""Have you changed your mind? Have you listened attentively?"" @CAPS3, by using Facebook for social interaction, @ORGANIZATION1 and Windows programs for schoolwork, and Google for various aspects of life and health, your life has become significantly easier. You have benefited from my insights and from the use of modern technology, the computer."
1086	1088	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever desired to behold the entire world with merely a click of a button? It is as straightforward as venturing out and procuring a computer. Computers are becoming increasingly prevalent. Some individuals opine that people utilize computers excessively. I am here to assert that such an accusation is egregious. First, computers assist you with academic tasks. Suppose you have an essay that requires @NUM1 words or more; you can simply employ a word - counting tool, and then you will have the precise word count. Additionally, you might need to conduct research on a particular topic. You can simply type in the keyword and search, and then you will have millions of options to select from. If you have a homework assignment that you do not comprehend, you can search for how to complete it on the internet. However, this is merely the commencement. Another reason computers are so remarkable is that you can encounter and interact with individuals from across the globe and learn about their cultures. You can enter a complimentary chatroom and meet someone from @LOCATION1. You would also be acquiring knowledge about their culture. This could also serve as a means to learn another language. If the person is fluent in @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, then he or she could instruct you. You might be able to observe how an @CAPS2 household operates. You could then draw comparisons between the ways you both live your lives. Finally, you can gain an understanding of the world around you. There are numerous websites where you can obtain a live satellite feed of places in every corner of the globe. You could also conduct research on the planet itself. You can learn about the conservation of the earth and what transpires within it. You might also learn about nature. You can develop a deeper understanding of plants and animals. You can also explore space. You can learn about planets, whether there is life, water, or anything else on them; these are the things you can research. So, to summarize, you can complete your schoolwork, interact with people worldwide, and learn about the world around you, and this encompasses less than a fraction of all that you can do on computers. Nevertheless, do not remain online all day. Ensure that you go outside and have a wonderful time as well!
1087	1089	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I have several inquiries for you and was hoping you could provide answers. I was pondering. Do you possess any computers in your residence? If so, how many? Additionally, do you enjoy using the computer? I am attempting to determine the number of people who do not use computers because I wish to ask them how they manage to survive without one! Computers are indispensable to our contemporary lives. All the information in the world is accessible through a single computer. You can converse, send emails, and even see people via a computer since nowadays, everyone has a webcam attached to their device. I want to enumerate all the remarkable things that computers do, which make our lives significantly more convenient. People are constantly seeking a means to contact someone. For instance, if your phone is depleted of charge, how will you inform your friend about the time you are supposed to meet at a particular place? You can effortlessly send her a text from the computer. You can either use your screen - name to text someone or visit websites such as verizon, at&t, sprint... etc. and send texts from there. This would prevent you from disappointing your friend and feeling remorseful about it. Has there ever been an occasion when you needed a phone number but could not locate your telephone directory? It has certainly happened to me, but do you know what I do? I access the computer and visit yellowpages.com and simply search for the restaurant/place on the website. It is that uncomplicated. You can search for almost anything on the computer: prices, locations, facts, anything! Most of the time, accurate information will always be available. Computers are extremely helpful if you require assistance with historical, scientific, and @CAPS2 facts. Computers aid us on a daily basis. People need them for communication, retrieving phone numbers, or obtaining facts about anything. A significant portion of someone's life can be stored on the computer. If you have poor penmanship, you can simply type your paper and submit it neatly. As I mentioned earlier, computers are essential to our present - day lives. @CAPS3, upon reading this, I wager you will concur.
1088	1090	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1's perspective on computers is that they are beneficial to people. They offer assistance when people need it and provide entertainment. Hence, this is the reason why computers are advantageous to people. @CAPS1's first rationale is that a computer can assist people in times of need. For example, if you have to write a paper and need to conduct research, you can utilize the computer. Or if there is a complex equation, you can look up the formula. As you can observe, this is why computers benefit people. @CAPS1's second reason is that it offers entertainment, such as through social networks like MySpace and Twitter. If you enjoy watching TV or listening to music, there are also websites dedicated to these activities. Thus, this is why I stated that computers also provide entertainment. @CAPS1's third reason is that it facilitates communication. For instance, if you are in different countries and cannot visit someone, you can communicate with them via instant messaging or webcam. Or if you are homeschooled and do not interact with other children your age, you can communicate with them on the computer. As you can see, this is why I say that the computer is a valuable tool. In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial because they offer entertainment, enable communication, and assist people.
1089	1091	1	1	Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, It is often said that technology is having a far - reaching impact on everyone. Computers actively contribute to our daily lives. They assist us in completing school projects, enable us to understand cultures around the world, and provide us with the ability to communicate and connect with friends and family regardless of their location. Our school assigns numerous projects, and the computer serves as our primary resource. If you plan to travel to a distant location, you are likely to conduct research on it and then make arrangements for the trip. It is also commonly used to interact with friends on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and @CAPS3. Computers facilitate learning and communication. As an eighth - grader, we are preparing for high school. Fortunately, this means that we engage in projects, reports, and research using the computer. The computer allows us to gather information for a project or create a diagram or data table for a survey. Many people employ this approach in their jobs. People write reports on celebrities and historical figures. Books do not always contain the information you are seeking, so they search for the person's name, and they will discover hundreds of websites that offer information and photographs of that individual. Moreover, computers enable you to book flights, compare prices, and check tax rates. Sometimes, people do not want to drive to a local car dealership, so they visit an online website that sells cars and can examine all the features, price, and mileage of the vehicle. The only way to obtain tickets is by accessing the internet. There are websites that allow you to book any type of flight, whether it is to Florida or to @LOCATION1. If you want to know about the state of the economy, you can look up tax rates and find out the national debt. You can even determine the average annual tax payment of a family. Computers can be extremely useful at @CAPS2. They provide the capacity to accomplish more than you can envision. Most importantly, computers have created a means for you to communicate with friends and family across the globe. Facebook and Twitter are the latest phenomena of the century. They allow you to interact with friends, share photos, and discuss your personal life. There are also new lifestyle games available. @CAPS3 is no longer as popular and does not offer as many appealing features. It only allows you to chat with friends, which is why few people use it nowadays. People desire to do more than just talk. I have noticed that computers have evolved over time. Nowadays, computers enable you to communicate with friends, conduct research and complete projects, book flights, and purchase cars. Our school curriculum includes many projects and reports, which can only be completed with the assistance of a computer. You can research people and places, obtain pictures, book flights for long - distance trips, and purchase cars and other items online. We also have the ability to communicate with friends on Facebook and Twitter. Computers have a positive influence on people.
1090	1092	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Are you constantly admonishing your children to complete their homework and disengage from the computer? Well, I might be able to offer some insights. Computers do not contribute positively to our society at present. People are spending an excessive amount of time on them, failing to enjoy the outdoors, and sacrificing time to spend with friends and family. I believe imposing a daily limit on computer usage might help resolve these issues. Computers can be highly distracting, and people tend to use them too frequently. Staring at the computer screen can damage your eyes and deplete brain cells. This is something that both children and adults often overlook. You need your brain cells for school, social activities, and other pursuits. Computers can also divert your attention from completing tasks, and then you have to stay up late to finish your homework. Homework should take precedence over computer use. Time passes quickly as you click and type. Before you know it, it is ten o'clock, and your work remains unfinished. Given my busy schedule after school, I strive to complete my work and then use the computer before dance practice. This way, I can socialize with my friends and unwind. Allocating less time to the computer is a prudent decision. As @DATE1 approaches, the weather is going to be delightful, and you do not want to squander a beautiful day on the computer. The human body requires oxygen, and clearly, computers do not provide it. A great way to obtain oxygen is by going outside for exercise and rejuvenation. Playing outdoors offers far more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or engage in sports. My doctor once advised, ""Everyone should engage in at least an hour of exercise per day."" You cannot achieve this by sitting at your computer. The next time the sun is shining, regardless of the season, go outside and take a break from electronic devices. Spending time with family and friends is an enjoyable way to stay away from the computer. Friends and family are not to be taken for granted. They are the ones who support you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives visit town after a long absence, you do not want to spend that time on the computer. Conversing and catching up with one another is an excellent way to reconnect. During family holidays, we refrain from using our computers. We turn them off to spend quality time together. Friends and family are precious gifts. So, do not neglect your friendships or family relationships. Step away from the computer and build bonds."
1091	1093	1	1	Dear Newspaper, it has come to my notice that certain individuals have expressed concerns regarding excessive computer usage. However, I dissent from this view. I opine that the computer fosters hand - eye coordination. Moreover, it enables one to engage with a greater number of foreign individuals and explore diverse locations. Finally, computers facilitate communication with others. As previously mentioned, I believe computers are valuable as they contribute to hand - eye coordination. For instance, when crafting academic papers or work - related documents, one employs this coordination. One may not even realize that once proficient in typing, the speed of work tends to increase. This technological marvel is an exquisite invention; please do not eliminate it! The computer is integral to daily life and is highly useful for acquiring knowledge about distant places and people. Another aspect often overlooked when using a computer is that one can communicate not only with those nearby but also with individuals from far - off locations. How could one obtain such information without incurring substantial expenses on airfare or fuel? The computer is the most expedient means of accessing information! Ultimately, the computer is a crucial resource as it allows for online chats with friends. A [CAPS2] researcher demonstrated that computers... They have a positive impact on all! They teach hand - eye coordination, offer insights into distant places, and enable online interactions with friends! I hope you perceive the computer as I do.
1092	1094	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, it is evident that the majority of individuals currently own computers. Computers have significantly propelled societal and technological progress. While some assert that computers have adverse effects, this is inaccurate. Computers have influenced individuals in numerous beneficial ways. Although certain experts advocate for reduced computer usage, this technology is indispensable in educational institutions. Students are instructed to type their papers, which enables them to complete assignments more rapidly. This accelerated completion can prevent students from staying up late to finish homework, which is conducive to their well - being. Computers also cultivate hand - eye coordination, a vital skill for future endeavors. In my view, computers have made substantial contributions to technology. They enable exploration of places that humans have never or could never physically reach. We can manufacture and distribute products at a much faster pace. Additionally, computers allow individuals to learn about remote locations, diverse cultures, and different people. They can broaden everyone's perspectives and expose them to places and phenomena they were previously unaware of. Facebook, a platform with a vast user base, is a prime example of a website used for communication. More than [PERCENT1] of students in an average school have a Facebook account. They communicate more effectively on this platform than they could without computers. Computers are not making people ""anti - social"" or reducing their interaction with friends; instead, they are facilitating more communication. Computers enable daily communication with individuals worldwide without concerns about exhausting cellphone minutes. Overall, computers are expanding people's horizons and introducing them to a wealth of new knowledge. They are more of an asset than a liability. Computers are truly a remarkable innovation."
1093	1095	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I believe it is necessary to voice my apprehensions. [CAPS4] are becoming overly reliant on computers. [CAPS4] should spend more time outdoors and engage in physical activities. While some individuals in [MONTH1] may think they are not squandering time on the computer, I disagree. One should only use the computer when it is essential. Developers are constantly devising [CAPS2] gaming concepts to attract users, but people often fail to recognize that this not only wastes time but also squanders money. Electricity bills are soaring. Instead of going out to meet [CAPS1], people are staying at home and communicating on social networking sites, which can lead to a decrease in social skills. Children are not participating in sports, resulting in a loss of physical strength. Moreover, excessive sedentary behavior can lead to weight gain. [CAPS2] applications like Microsoft Word are useful, but daily gaming on the computer is not. Teachers, parents, and all concerned parties should educate individuals that the computer is not the sole focus of life. While computers can provide valuable knowledge at our fingertips, they can also detract from family and friend time. I am not suggesting that computers are entirely bad, but their impact extends beyond the user. [CAPS4] need to come together and take action. [CAPS4] should spend more time outdoors and exercise. [CAPS4] should limit computer usage with the help of adults. Therefore, let us strive to create a better environment and allocate less time to the computer.
1094	1096	1	1	I firmly believe that we should possess computers. They assist us in locating individuals, facilitate communication, and enable us to conduct searches. For example, one could discover a long - lost sibling. Additionally, we can interact with friends online through platforms such as MySpace or [CAPS1]. In [MONTH1], it is possible to have a large circle of friends on MySpace. Through searching, we can uncover new information, such as the weather in a different country or state. We can determine the temperature in Texas or research the age of a particular entity. Computers offer a plethora of opportunities for connection and knowledge acquisition.
1095	1097	1	1	Dear fellow citizens, consider the scenario where you had to obtain a book for every query. It would be a time - consuming process, not to mention the time required to read it. Computers have been instrumental in addressing questions, maintaining long - distance friendships, and providing entertainment in the modern world. Their contributions extend far beyond these aspects; the [CAPS2] is such a versatile tool that it is challenging to enumerate all its benefits. Firstly, the [CAPS2] allows us to stay in touch with distant friends without relying solely on phone calls. Platforms like [CAPS3] and [CAPS4] enable us to communicate and engage in activities with them. If one believes that the only way to communicate with a friend from a different location is by making a phone call, the friendship is likely to fade quickly. This is because people rarely have the time to dedicate solely to a phone conversation. However, when communicating via the [CAPS2], one can multitask. For example, I can converse with someone on the [CAPS2] while tidying my room. Furthermore, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options, such as playing games, watching humorous videos, or engaging in other enjoyable activities. In the past, I used to eagerly await my brother's permission to play games again. Now, I can play games, watch movies, TV shows, and videos on the computer. If you miss a show, you can access it online and watch it at your convenience, saving time and effort. Finally, computers are far more efficient in information retrieval. They are much faster than searching through a library, and you can do so from the comfort of your home. Although some claim that the [CAPS2] is reducing reading time, this is not the case. You can read anything online, and if you prefer, the [CAPS2] can even read to you. Reading is not a problem. [NUM1] of Americans recognize the significant benefits of computers and appreciate the additional time they provide. The [CAPS2] is constantly evolving and improving. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers are a boon, especially for busy individuals. So, go ahead and acquire a [CAPS2].
1096	1098	1	1	Dear local newspaper, there exist several reasons regarding how computers impact people. My stance is to persuade the local newspaper as to why certain individuals should not and should use computers. Some people become engrossed in the internet, or others lack sufficient funds to explore the world, so they simply remain online. As a result, people should not squander their time on the internet because they will become entrapped. For example, my friend, @PERSON1, stays on the computer for more than @NUM1 hours. He tells me that he is on a chat line, connecting with other people. He forgets about everyone. He is so immersed in the internet. He stopped going to school and is gaining weight. Now he is just a nobody. He merely sits in front of his computer and does nothing. I feel as though he has thrown his life away just for some foolish chat line. It is not difficult to find someone else in our city. There are a lot of beautiful young ladies here to discover. Similarly, people should not waste their time on the internet because they start losing time. For instance, they spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People lose their focus on important matters and start paying attention to other things like the internet. There was a great person. She was extremely successful. She made tons of money. Until she started losing her job. She stopped because she was so fixated on Facebook. Facebook is like a place for friends where you can meet other people from different countries. You can just find people to date on that website. Facebook turned her life around. I remember her telling my mom how her life is so messed up now. How she got fired, how she doesn't pay her bills, and how she is moving into a smaller place. Sometimes websites cause people to lose focus on important things in life. Consequently, certain people should use computers because the internet can assist you with certain things. In summation, it can help you find a hotel or a trip to take with your friends or family. I love being on the internet. One time I signed up for this website called MySpace. For a moment, I did get caught up in it.
1097	1099	1	1	Dear local newspaper, my perspective on the effects that computers have on people is that an increasing number of individuals are becoming obese. People tend to become moody, and it appears that computers are addictive. I believe that computers have a substantial impact on people. The primary issue is that more people each year are becoming obese because they do not leave the chair in which they sit for the majority of the day. Additionally, they become so lethargic that they do not want to get up, so they will simply order food and have it delivered directly to their home. Another concern is that they do not get enough exercise because they sit there all day and do not move. But when they do move, it is only to get something to eat or retrieve their phone. This is why they should restrict kids and adults to only @NUM1 hours or less of computer time each day. My next reason is that people who are on computers tend to become moody. For example, one moment they are happy, and once they get off the computer, they are sad. They are confined indoors for the entire day. They do not see enough of the outside world because they are constantly on the computer. If they limited their computer time to one hour each day, the moodiness would improve. People need a significant amount of exercise to maintain their weight and muscle. My final reason that computers have an impact on people is that people will tend to act addicted to the computer. For instance, if they are playing a game all day and do not realize it, they will become addicted and not stop playing all day. People need to leave the computer and engage in other activities such as riding a bike or playing a sport. In conclusion, what I am attempting to convey to you is that it is not beneficial for people to stay inside all day and play on the computer because it is detrimental to your health and puts you at a high risk of obesity. So, can you please consider my ideas?
1098	1100	1	1	"Dear newspaper, I have been following the debate regarding computers. Some people claim that computers are imparting important skills. Others assert that ""people are spending excessive time on their computers and less time exercising."" In my opinion, I believe that people should be able to utilize computers (after all, they were intended to assist us). Consider how much computers have aided the human race, from communicating with friends and family in other countries to checking the departure time of a plane to @LOCATION1. It is reported that over one million people use their computers more than once a day. Without the computer, there would be no worldwide web, which is connected to everything in this world. Without computers, you would not be able to control any robotic devices, which would create more jobs, but the cost of food would increase significantly. Without computers, the equipment in hospitals would not function, as computers can save lives by storing important information. We would have to revert to the era of typewriters. Another significant issue is that people are overusing the computer. Once you learn to moderate your computer usage, this will not be a problem. Some people say that computers are too expensive. There are ways to make so - called ""down payments"" on computers, similar to a loan, where you pay each month, and setting up the internet is as easy as @NUM1. So, yes, there are both positive and negative aspects discussed about computers, but without them, we would not have a modern era. We can control the robot that manufactures products and the device that saves lives. With all this in mind, I would like to express my gratitude for listening and advocate for the use of computers!"
1099	1101	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing this article about computers to inform you of my opinion on the positive and negative effects of computers. The reason why computers are so successful is due to some of the excellent information they provide. Such as directions to a place you are going to or detailed information on a subject or a person. Although all of these seem beneficial, anyone can post information on the internet, so some of the information may not be accurate. Some reasons why the computer can be problematic are the presence of unsafe links, which can disclose your personal information to someone and cause trouble for you in the future. Also, some websites or pop - up icons are not suitable for younger kids and expose them to content that is too mature for them. Lastly, communicating on the computer is a part of our daily lives, such as email. Almost every American with a computer uses email. It is a great way to relay information. Also, the new form of the web, which allows you to see people and interact via computers, is rapidly growing in @LOCATION1. In conclusion, this article presents my point of view on computers.
1100	1102	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I believe that the computer is not a negative thing for three reasons. One reason is that we can learn about a distant place. Another reason is that it teaches hand - eye coordination. The last reason is that we can communicate with friends and meet new people. From the computer, we can learn about a faraway place if we are doing a report on it or simply out of curiosity. We can learn what kind of plants grow there for food. For example, in tropical places, bananas and coconuts are grown. We can learn what they eat, like in @LOCATION1, where they consume many beans. A lot of their food contains beans, even their salads. We can also find out their language; perhaps they speak Spanish, like in @LOCATION2. You can also develop hand - eye coordination because it involves using your fingers and eyes to see what you are typing. You use your hands for everything while typing, whether you are typing on the keyboard or using the mouse. However, the computer is not just for learning; it is also for socializing because of all these platforms like MySpace, Facebook, AIM, and webchat. The possibilities are endless, and you can even play games. If you don't know someone on Facebook or MySpace, that's okay; it is an excellent way to meet new people and make new friends. Additionally, if you are having trouble finding a friend, you can just check if they are online. It is useful for getting together somewhere. And for those people who think it is taking away family time, you can always say, ""Okay, that's enough,"" and talk to them. So, in conclusion, computers are good because you can learn about places, develop hand - eye coordination, and communicate with new and old friends."
1101	1103	1	1	Computers present both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, they serve as a means to communicate with individuals in different states. Additionally, they can keep one out of trouble and provide entertainment. However, computers can also lead to negative outcomes. One may become overly obsessed with computers, transforming into a computer enthusiast to an extreme degree and exhibiting hyper - behavior when dealing with them. Nevertheless, computers possess capabilities that many other objects lack, which is a significant positive aspect.
1102	1104	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, are you aware that eight out of ten households in @LOCATION1 possess at least one computer, if not more? Computers facilitate our daily activities and simplify numerous tasks, such as essay writing. They confer benefits upon our society in multiple ways. Without computers, some families would lose touch with their distant loved ones. Moreover, computers can effortlessly maintain organization and tidiness. Perhaps the most significant advantage is the ease with which one can learn about distant countries and cultures at the click of a button. The potential of computers to benefit society is boundless. Many individuals fail to recognize that some families cannot be together as easily as others. When a family member is in the military, communicating via computer may be the sole opportunity to interact with loved ones back home. Denying this as a benefit is fallacious. For those without such an urgent need for communication, it remains a convenient method to converse with someone afar without incurring high long - distance phone bills. Additionally, it can be an alternative to parents purchasing expensive cell phones for their children. Thus, having a computer is undoubtedly advantageous for communication. Computers can also streamline many tasks. For instance, if assigned a @NUM1 - page essay at school, typing it on the computer would be neater and faster than writing it by hand. Many businesses rely on computers to organize and manage data. Programs like Excel, developed by @ORGANIZATION2, offer a straightforward way to organize data, which is far more efficient than having information scattered across various locations. Another benefit of computers is their ability to maintain organization and provide accessible means to complete daily tasks. Perhaps the greatest advantage of computers is the vast amount of knowledge one can acquire effortlessly. Suppose one is curious about the recent earthquake in @LOCATION2; one can promptly turn to the computer. Simply visit @ORGANIZATION3 or another preferred search engine, enter the subject, click, and access numerous websites and articles for in - depth reading. Computers are a treasure trove of information, readily available at our fingertips, which is a substantial benefit to our society. Computers are remarkable tools that can assist in multiple aspects, including communication, organization, and satisfying curiosity. This technological advancement enhances our daily lives. Computers benefit not only our small town of @LOCATION1 but also our entire society through their diverse capabilities.
1103	1105	1	1	"Dear Editor, during @TIME1 week, I came across an article in the newspaper titled ""@CAPS1 off the computer and go exercise."" This took me by surprise as computers offer numerous benefits, such as enhancing education, enabling learning about foreign countries, and facilitating communication with others. Every school is equipped with computers, which are easily accessible and highly useful. I recall that @TIME1 year, when a question arose and the teacher was uncertain, we would immediately consult the computer. It also aids us in excelling at projects. I once had to complete a project @TIME1, and the computer was indispensable for its completion. We also utilize the programs available on computers. In art class, we created a cartoon and used Photoshop to make it realistic. Conducting research on a computer is both easy and rapid. One can also explore distant places using a computer. For example, one can discover details about other countries, such as whether they are landlocked, their population, and other relevant facts. One can also learn about a country's history, including its leaders and government. Additionally, websites like @CAPS2.com provide up - to - the - minute information. Finally, computers allow us to communicate with others via email, instant messaging, and platforms like Facebook, which help us connect with friends. Through email, we can communicate for business purposes, receive links to @CAPS1 - related websites, and exchange information. Instant messaging is similar to texting but much faster, enabling us to instantly catch up with people. Thousands of individuals use Facebook to reconnect with old friends and stay in touch with current ones. My mother, for instance, uses Facebook to communicate with her old friends after moving. In my opinion, computers are highly beneficial. They not only enhance education but also teach us about foreign countries' histories and enable us to reconnect with old friends. Remember your ""best - friend - for - life"" from school? With Facebook, you can catch up with them instead of letting those memories fade."
1104	1106	1	1	Dear Readers, one of the most significant inventions of the past few decades is the computer, which has both advantages and disadvantages. I contend that people, especially teenagers, spend an excessive amount of time on computers. They devote too much time to @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, neglecting outdoor activities such as enjoying nature, playing sports, or exercising. Although they can communicate with friends via @CAPS4, it is not equivalent to going to the park and playing baseball with friends. Families also become distant when they sit around using @CAPS5. Teenagers spend an inordinate amount of time on the @CAPS6 instead of engaging in more beneficial activities like reading. I am certain we all know at least one obese person or teenager. My neighbor is extremely overweight and consumes a large amount of food. He will sit in front of the computer screen, glazed - eyed, for hours on end. I often wonder how many brain cells he squanders per second. I am confident that everyone reading this knows someone similar to my neighbor. The statistic that @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2 is obese is not an exaggeration. In my view, it is the fault of the @CAPS6 and computers. Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends, they choose to sit at the computer, chat, and consume junk food. They waste their time watching pointless @CAPS5 videos instead of playing baseball or football. Some may argue that computers help develop hand - eye coordination, but sports offer better opportunities for this. Computers are a major contributor to obesity as they encourage people to be sedentary instead of engaging in the recommended @NUM1 minutes of exercise per day. Another pressing issue is the limited amount of reading done by the average teenager and @CAPS9. I estimate that the average individual spends only @NUM2 minutes reading per day because they are too occupied chatting with friends on the @CAPS6. I have a cousin who reads only one book every @NUM3 years, fails every test, and has been held back @NUM4 times. Instead of reading and learning, he spends his time chatting and texting. He squanders excellent educational opportunities while people in underdeveloped countries like @LOCATION3 are fortunate to own a single book. I know that more than @PERCENT2 of the students in my class read only the required materials because they waste time on computers. The literacy rate is approximately @NUM5 and is declining due to the lack of reading and excessive computer use. I have seen surveys indicating that @NUM6 out of @NUM7 people spend more than @NUM6 hours a day on computers. These statistics make me wonder how much time we truly need to spend on computers instead of reading. Otherwise, we may become like oversized monkeys who struggle to read. Computers and the @CAPS6 not only erode our brain cells and health but also deprive us of outdoor experiences. Nature offers wonders such as the @ORGANIZATION1, the @CAPS11 @CAPS12, and the @CAPS13 @CAPS14. Nothing can compare to skiing down a large slope or climbing @LOCATION1, yet most @CAPS15 choose to sit in front of the computer. They tap on the keyboard instead of exploring nature trails and beaches. They sit on old, moldy chairs, staring at computer screens, while others enjoy butterfly gardens and wildlife preserves. Instead of taking steps to protect the environment, we are sitting in front of computers, mesmerized by the screen. We should be preserving and learning about the planet, but the influence of computers and the @CAPS6 prevents us from doing so. I have presented a compelling argument against excessive computer use, and I strongly urge you to take action to reduce time spent on computers. Establish programs at home or in the community to limit computer usage. We need to act now!
1105	1107	1	1	I am of the opinion that the household computer can assist with daily activities such as research and development, homework, artwork, and serve as an ever - updated travel dictionary. It is like a 24 - hour superstore stocked with an endless array of items, a platform for video games, and a highly sophisticated calculator. New programs are constantly emerging. However, addiction is regarded as a detrimental behavior. Once one becomes addicted, they may start to isolate themselves socially, losing friends and potentially neglecting family. Prolonged computer use can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome from typing and fatigue from staring at a bright screen all day. Sitting in a chair all day, whether kneeling, leaning back in a chaise lounge, may seem comfortable initially but is harmful to health. In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial and enjoyable. Yet, they can be addictive. Therefore, while having fun, one should avoid excessive use. Computers can be a source of entertainment, but moderation is essential for a healthy lifestyle.
1106	1108	1	1	Dear local newspaper, as you can observe, approximately @PERCENT1 of our population excessively utilizes the computer. They ought to be outdoors, inhaling fresh air and spending quality time with their families and friends. Conversely, the computer can prove highly useful. For numerous individuals, their families reside at a considerable distance, as do some friends, and the risk of losing touch is a distinct possibility. One can also acquire knowledge about distant locations, such as @LOCATION1. The computer is frequently employed for projects and essays, which is of great significance. A substantial amount of learning can be achieved through a computer. The computer can serve multiple purposes. One such purpose is maintaining communication. Certainly, one can visit the park and spend time there, yet not everyone lives in close proximity. For those with relatives or even good friends living far away, a computer is what you require. It is an excellent means of staying in touch. One can remain updated on a daily basis at all times. For instance, my cousin recently went abroad for college and will be there for a few months, so she has her own blog on the computer to keep everyone informed and maintain contact. The phone is not always a viable option. Learning about distant places is truly remarkable. Online, one can explore the history of specific locations. One can view the towns and much more. One can even see pictures. Perhaps one day, one will even have the opportunity to visit those specific places in person. How fascinating would that be? Education is of utmost importance these days. Students are inundated with project after project and essay after essay, and it entails a great deal of effort. As you grow older, the workload increases, and with a computer, the burden on your shoulders will be alleviated. When writing essays, one can type them and correct mistakes without the work appearing messy. Projects are also easy to rectify, so making errors is not a major concern. On the other hand, more Americans than ever before are overweight. The computer is significantly implicated in this issue. Most people return home and spend the remainder of the evening sitting in front of the computer. They fail to recognize the profound impact a computer can have on an individual. More people should engage in outdoor exercise and spend time with their families. Computers can have both negative and positive effects. They can be far more beneficial than one can imagine. However, they can also exert a substantial negative influence on people. They can assist in maintaining contact with others, learning about distant places, or even with schoolwork. Let it be advantageous; use it when you need it.
1107	1109	1	1	Dear Newspaper, computers confer benefits upon society as they educate individuals. They are also advantageous because they resolve problems that humans might encounter difficulties with. They can also amuse us when we have nothing to occupy ourselves. They can instruct people in numerous aspects. They can aid tourists in learning about a destination they intend to visit. In fact, @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 tourists conducts research on the area they are going to using a computer. They assist students in catching up or fully comprehending a concept. Once, I was struggling with fractions in math. So, I decided to search for the method to find the answer, and it enabled me to catch up with the class once again. The computer can elucidate cultures from anywhere in the world. According to culture digest.com, @PERCENT1 of people visiting a new country first familiarize themselves with the culture. Computers solve problems that some individuals might be unaware of. It can effortlessly solve a math problem with a built - in calculator. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 computer users have employed a calculator to help them solve a problem. They also address geographic problems. There may be an outdated map, but this can be easily resolved with live satellite maps. Map tools claims that there has never been a flaw in their system. Computers offer a wide variety of entertainment options. They can play music. @PERCENT2 of teens obtain their music from the computer rather than a CD. Computers can entertain you with games. One day, it was pouring heavily, and I had nothing to do, so I turned on my computer and played Minesweeper. This kept me thoroughly entertained. Please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for your time.
1108	1110	1	1	An increasing number of individuals utilize computers, yet not everyone concurs that this is beneficial to society. In my view, it does confer benefits on society in numerous ways, such as online learning. One can acquire a wealth of knowledge online, practice math, reading, and even writing. One can also have a great deal of fun online when one is bored at home and has nothing to do. Additionally, one can interact with friends and family members via email and other means. When online, one can learn a great deal. If one is at home and needs to study for a test, one can go online and study. One can also expand one's knowledge, as one can learn how to solve a math problem if one is unsure, or simply catch up on reading. People sometimes require a computer because they may be bored, so they can go online and play games and have a good time. People, especially children, often get bored, so they can simply use the computer to play games and quizzes and still learn. Computers enable one to interact with one's family and friends. One can send emails or use a webcam. If one hasn't communicated with someone for a long time, one can simply use the computer to talk to them. If one wishes to find a @CAPS1 school classmate one hasn't spoken to in years, one can now do so. Computers do benefit society. In my opinion, we do need computers. If parents do not want their children to access websites they do not approve of, they can always block those websites. Computers are truly essential as they can be of great assistance.
1109	1111	1	1	As a teenager myself, I believe my computer is something I could scarcely live without. However, is it impeding me from engaging in more significant activities? I believe so. I contend that the absence of computers would, in a sense, educate people more effectively than the current situation. For example, when working on school research papers, we immediately turn to computers to gather information, whereas we could be utilizing books and magazines. Owing to the widespread use of computers, many people lack the proper skills to utilize and locate information in books. Moreover, spending excessive time around and using computers is driving families further apart and preventing humans from interacting more closely with nature and the environment. For many individuals, using a computer has become a lifestyle, something we rely on more than religiously, and that may not be the most favorable thing. Children, teenagers, and even adults become extremely addicted to computers. Teenagers and children use laptops and @CAPS1's daily to complete their schoolwork and communicate with friends. Similarly, parents and adults use them to finish their work and as a convenient means of communicating with colleagues. To this day, people have become highly addicted to computers. I am certain that in my family, neither my mother, nor my father, nor my brother, nor I could go through a day without using a computer. As previously mentioned, computers are also causing families to grow more distant. There is less family time and communication among family members nowadays due to computers. Instead of spending time with their families, teenagers prefer to spend time on the computer chatting with their friends. I suspect that if a poll were conducted on the amount of family time lost in households due to computers, I almost guarantee it would be a substantial amount. I know that for some families, the only true family time without computers is during dinner, and that is not much. Lastly, many humans are no longer as connected to nature and involved as they once were. Using computers keeps people indoors and shields them from nature. Although there are numerous advertisements and pop - ups on the computer informing us about how to properly care for the earth, we easily ignore them and continue playing on the computer rather than going outside and taking action to make the world a better, cleaner place. Not only is it about taking care of our planet, but also the fact that many people these days do not get the fresh air they need as often as they should. While not all of this can be attributed to the use of computers, I believe a significant portion can. As I previously stated, it is incredibly difficult to envision a day without a computer. I mean, how would we communicate or complete our work? However, there are genuinely other ways to achieve these things; we are simply not accustomed to them because we are so attached to computers. It is only now that I have truly realized that it is possible to live without a computer, and that so many people are missing out on incredible experiences, such as family time and connection with nature, because we are so addicted to computers.
1110	1112	1	1	Dear local Newspaper, in my perspective, I believe that computers have significantly contributed to our society over the past decade or so. This is because when using a computer, one can enhance hand - eye coordination. Additionally, one can learn how to type and perform other computer - related tasks, which are essential if one desires to secure a well - paying, decent job. Moreover, nowadays, one can access platforms like Facebook and other websites where one can make friends and engage in conversations with others. Thus, it not only improves social skills and hand - eye coordination but also increases the likelihood of obtaining a good job if one knows how to type and operate a computer. Firstly, owning a computer helps develop better hand - eye coordination. This is because when using a computer, improved hand - eye coordination enables one to type more proficiently and rapidly. Secondly, a computer can enhance social skills. This is because a large number of people now use Facebook, where one can make new friends and chat with them. Additionally, on a cold and rainy day, one can occupy oneself by playing various games and also check the news and the weather forecast for the next day. Lastly, when one learns how to type, one stands a good chance of getting a good job because most well - paying jobs require typing and computer operation skills. In conclusion, in my opinion, I believe computers have benefited our society over the years, yet others may hold a different view. So, now let's hear your thoughts.
1111	1113	1	1	"Click, click, click resounds the computer mouse as one scours the expanse of the internet. Computers serve as an excellent means to instruct children in social skills, augment people's intelligence, and assist with homework. I firmly believe that computers exert a highly positive influence on individuals. Computers can guide children towards social interaction as, primarily, they function akin to an online telephone. One can communicate with others through numerous avenues such as Facebook chat, AIM (chat), MySpace, Twitter, Skype, and a multitude of other unmentioned methods. Moreover, I opine that a teen, child, or even an adult who is overly nervous to converse on the phone or in person, and is socially inept or extremely shy, can commence by merely chatting with others online. Once they feel more at ease, they can then initiate phone conversations or in - person interactions. For instance, I once met this girl who was extremely amiable but painfully shy, and everyone was aware of it. So, one day, she decided to create an AIM account and converse with people on it to prove that she was not the annoying, nerdy girl that everyone made her out to be. She turned out to be one of the most amicably humorous individuals I've spent time with in a while. This exemplifies how the internet can be beneficial. Have you ever contemplated that computers sometimes render you more intelligent? In my view, I believe that computers offer far more assistance than a book. If you seek information, it merely entails typing a few keys and clicking a button. Owning a computer is like possessing your own personal compendium of everything in the world. A significant number of people nowadays study via the internet; I certainly do. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT1 more people assert that computers are more helpful than books and can make you considerably more intelligent because the internet contains far more detail and a greater number of facts. @PERCENT2 of children with computers utilize them for homework. Computers are an outstanding tool to employ while doing your homework. I spend the majority of my day on my computer doing homework rather than off it. For example, suppose you have a report and need facts about @CAPS1 @PERSON1 and his birthplace. You would simply type, ""When was @ORGANIZATION1 born?"" and lo and behold! There it is, with the exact date. Additionally, if you are working on a piece of writing, such as a rough draft, why waste time attempting to write neatly and flawlessly? When you can simply open a word document and type it up. To summarize, computers undoubtedly have a positive impact on people for these three reasons: they are an excellent way to teach children social skills, enhance people's intelligence, and assist with homework. However, I understand your concern that people are spending an excessive amount of time on their computers and less time exercising. But you can search for great exercise methods on the internet, watch videos of people with @CAPS2.V shows about exercising, and do it with them on the computer. Remember, computers are not merely a waste of time and a means to dull your brain cells; they have a very positive effect on you."
1112	1114	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am here to persuade you to concur with me that the utilization of computers indeed benefits society. Some of the reasons I hold this view are related to schoolwork, business operations, and overall research on significant matters. My first reason for believing that computer use is advantageous to society is that @CAPS6 is frequently employed for schoolwork. For example, it is used for projects and certain types of research that students might be interested in. One of the most crucial reasons for the high usage of computers is the large number of people taking online classes, whether for college or personal learning purposes. This is why I consider schoolwork to be a valid reason for the positive impact on society. My second reason for believing that @CAPS6 benefits our society pertains to the business or job aspect of computers. Many people these days work from home, establishing their own offices and almost creating their own companies. Another factor is that many individuals also use ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" or publisher. @PERCENT1 of those working in public businesses engage in this, along with advertising, which could also be a contributing reason. Moreover, you can even pay your bills online! I recall when I assisted my mother in paying one of the bills online, and let me tell you, ""@CAPS6 was effortless!"" My mother said she would do @CAPS6 more often now that she knows how to use @CAPS6! The business side alone should be more than sufficient to convince you. My final reason is the overall research on all important matters. Some of these significant aspects include online catalogs, the news, and most importantly, job openings. I, myself, love to shop! So, instead of leaving the house, I simply access the online catalog of my favorite store, ""@CAPS8"". The main reasons I prefer online shopping are the greater variety and range of sizes available. As for the news, that is more for my parents as I do not watch it. Lastly, regarding job openings, as I am @NUM1, I would like to find a job, even if it pays minimum wage. @CAPS6 is still something, right? This should be a compelling reason for agreement. In conclusion, I believe my @NUM2 reasons are very clear: schoolwork, business, and overall research. If these reasons do not convince you, I am unsure what will!"
1113	1115	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 represents a family. It is an ordinary family whose lives have been transformed due to computers. They are overweight, constantly plagued by fatigue, lonely, deprived of nature, and lethargic. However, they could have turned out differently if they had simply shut down their computers. They might have become healthy, fit, energetic, vibrant, and hard - working individuals if they had ceased spending hours on the computer daily. Although there are some positive aspects, the negative impacts of computers can be dramatic. They isolate you from friends and family, deprive you of the natural world around you, and most importantly, they @MONTH1 cause you to become overweight or even obese. Friends and family are two extremely important elements in everyone's life, even if you do not realize it. By using computers instead of interacting with them, you are severing the connections you have. Computers @MONTH1 lead you to isolate yourself. They might cause you to have limited communication with your loved ones. Unfortunately, friendships can be damaged. ""Spending long hours on my computer has caused me to become withdrawn, making me feel lonely,"" @PERSON1, @NUM1, says @CAPS2. By relying on computers, you are not doing yourself a favor. Computers can deprive you of the nature that surrounds you. You are most likely to be on your computer rather than going outside. Instead of spending countless hours on the computer, you could be participating in a sport or an activity. By playing sports, you are enhancing your hand - eye coordination far more than if you were on a computer. Wouldn't you prefer to have fun with your friends playing volleyball, basketball, swimming, or even going on an outing rather than sitting in front of your computer? I know I would! The obesity rates in this country will increase if people continue to use computers. You will rise by approximately @PERCENT1 due to lack of exercise. Computers can ruin lives by increasing your likelihood of becoming unhealthy and overweight. So, now think, would you want to be lonely, overweight, and deprived of nature? I know I definitely would not. This is why computers should be used less frequently! So, it's time; let's unite and raise awareness of the negative effects of computers!"
1114	1116	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am here today to present my reasons for opposing the usage of computers. My first reason for being against computer usage is the negativity associated with it. For example, numerous pop - ups appear on the websites you visit, along with those tiny advertisements like ""@CAPS1 on me"" and ""free trial"". This is not suitable for children to encounter when using the computer. My second reason for opposing computer use is the issue of who is online when you are. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people use the computer every single day, and @NUM3 out of @NUM5 people are chatting with young children. And these individuals may not be what they seem. What I am trying to say is that these people are known as ""@CAPS2"". These individuals prowl the internet day and night in search of young boys and girls. As I mentioned earlier, this is not proper computer usage. The purpose of using the computer is to seek information or play games, not engage in such other activities. My final reason for being against computer use is the lack of monitoring. A large number of parents do not supervise their children when they are on the computer. As a result, most children access inappropriate sites or content that they should not be viewing. And this is their fault because there should be parental locks in place. In conclusion, essentially what I am trying to convey is that computers can be dangerous at times because you do not always know what you are clicking on, and you may end up on a site that you do not wish to visit. So, these are my opinions, and perhaps you can understand what I am trying to say. Thank you."
1115	1117	1	1	"Statistics reveal that an increasing number of people each year are not getting sufficient exercise and are instead on the computer, conversing with their friends on Facebook, MySpace, or similar platforms. Will people venture outside more, or will they remain seated and type? Here lies the @CAPS1: more and more people are using computers, yet not everyone concurs that this benefits society. Those who support advancements in technology believe that computers have a positive impact on people's lives. However, I @CAPS2 believe that it does not have a positive effect on individuals. My reasons are as follows: people who use computers more frequently do not get enough exercise and tend to gain weight. Additionally, if you disclose your name and address on the computer, there is a slight @CAPS3 that you may be kidnapped or murdered. My final reason is that you do not spend as much time with your family as you should. Obesity in the @LOCATION1 has increased by at least @PERCENT1 because people are not getting enough exercise and are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer @CAPS4. Nothinka states that: ""There are too many people who do not get the exercise they need."" The @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""@CAPS5 people like the internet, but what people do not realize is that there are @CAPS5 bad people out there who would like to obtain your information."" @CAPS6 As you can see, I @CAPS2 believe that it would be a wise decision if you wrote an article on technology. Given @ORGANIZATION1's concerns about obesity in America and @CAPS8 safety, it is now or never that you write this article. It will probably earn you hundreds of @ORGANIZATION1 dollars. @CAPS6 So, get out your @CAPS9, pick up your pencil, and write. @CAPS5 people think that computers are fun, but you are not realizing the consequences of your actions. You could be @NUM1 lbs one day and @NUM2 lbs the next. @CAPS6 Remember, it would not be a bad thing if you wrote an article on this."
1116	1118	1	1	"@CAPS1, @CAPS1, the resounding ""boom"" and ""bom""! Those are the sounds of pinball emanating from my computer. @CAPS2! Indeed, we emerged victorious. Those are noises one would rather not endure throughout the day. Persistently being engrossed in one's computer is detrimental to one's health. @CAPS5, you are an inveterate computer enthusiast; you will likely become overweight. It is harmful to your eyes, and you miss out on the splendor of nature. ""@CAPS3, do you aspire to be so corpulent that you cannot even rouse yourself from bed? I presume not. @CAPS5, if you are constantly seated at the computer desk, you might well end up in such a state. @PERCENT1 of medical professionals assert that if @CAPS5 you do not rise from the computer desk, you will become obese! Obesity is extremely deleterious to your health. It can curtail your lifespan. @CAPS5, if you desire a long and healthy life, you must rise from the computer and engage in physical activity. ""@CAPS4, I believe I require stronger corrective lenses; my eyesight is deteriorating! @CAPS5, if something of this nature has ever befallen you, it is because you subject your eyes to the computer screen all day. @PERSON1 opines, ""@CAPS5, if you are perpetually at the computer, you will need glasses or stronger prescription ones."" @CAPS6, adults and children alike need to disengage from their computers. Studies indicate that more adults are on computers, indulging in games, than children. Preserve fresh, healthy eyes and distance yourself from the computer. Envision the sun casting a magnificent glow across your skin. @CAPS3, does this prospect appeal to you? Step away from your computer and venture outdoors. This is the remarkable experience that awaits you outside. @CAPS5, if you remain seated at the computer screen, you may only watch others relishing the wonderful, relaxing experience that should be yours. Rise, become active, and go outside. Now is the time to extricate yourself from your computer. @CAPS5, if you have not yet grasped this, the computer is an unwholesome device for humans. Emulate me and rid yourself of your computer. You need to be healthy and, above all, active. Possess good eyesight and savor nature. Abstain from using the computer."
1117	1119	1	1	Currently, a discourse has emerged regarding whether computers confer benefits upon society. Some individuals contend that computers facilitate online conversations among friends and disseminate information about distant locales and people. Nevertheless, I am inclined to believe that the computer is not indispensable. People squander a significant portion of their time on computers, thereby diminishing their exercise time. Few pay heed to nature. Instead of conversing with friends online, why not meet them at the park? Many computer users experience a decline in their metabolism. This is one of the reasons why @LOCATION1.A has the highest obesity rates globally. Additionally, the less one exercises, the less healthy one becomes, and the more pain one will endure. You will feel more stressed if your muscles are not exercised. If we, as @CAPS1, continue to be deficient in exercise, our future prospects will be limited. Is it not disheartening to witness people overly fixated on the computer when there are endangered species in nature? Pandas, polar bears, various types of whales, and other creatures all necessitate our assistance to combat the issue of extinction. Regrettably, we allocate a substantial amount of our attention to the computer. As humans, we have the capacity to effect change, so we should aid creatures in need to ensure their survival for future generations. Perhaps we @MONTH1 could acquire more knowledge about these creatures if we allocate time away from the computer to do so. Perhaps we will discover that nature is more captivating. Why do we rely on text - messaging on our computers when we have the ability to converse with our friends in a park? We enjoy the freedom of speech in @LOCATION1. Our families occasionally require assistance, yet sometimes we are unavailable. While our social lives are being eroded, our computer usage is becoming increasingly significant, and it is diverting our attention from what truly matters. In conclusion, when considering our computer usage, we must contemplate what can be done for nature, our health, and our family and friends.
1118	1120	1	1	Dear editor, I have become aware of the ongoing debate regarding technological advancements. I wish to express my conviction that it indeed benefits our society. I hold this view for the following reasons: Computers enable communication with friends, assist with academic pursuits, and serve as a reliable resource when information is needed. Kindly continue reading as I elucidate my rationale. Computers and technology offer numerous advantages. Firstly, they afford an avenue to interact with friends. Computers provide a convenient and expeditious means of communicating with others. Instead of sending a mundane letter that takes an interminable time to reach its destination, one can connect with friends whom one has not seen for a while. I recall when my friend relocated to @LOCATION1. It would have been arduous for me to reach out, so I opted to communicate with him online. Moreover, it spares one the effort of writing. Now, allow me to present my second reason. Secondly, computers are an invaluable tool for information retrieval. What would have taken days to find in the past can now be accessed online within minutes. In fifth grade, I was tasked with a challenging project. I spent @NUM1 days scouring books to no avail. However, I was able to locate all the necessary information within half an hour online. Additionally, the internet offers a wealth of resources. If one visits @ORGANIZATION2, hundreds of sources on a single topic can be found. It is remarkably straightforward. Now, let me share my final reason. My most compelling reason is that technology can assist in finding anything in daily life. Computers can provide directions. They can even help with grocery shopping. They are versatile in their utility. One year, I went on vacation to @LOCATION2. My mother got lost, and without the computer's assistance, we would have been in a predicament. Would you not feel more confident if you had such a tool? Computers can also discover novel places for you, your friends, or family to enjoy, such as @ORGANIZATION1. Now, let me conclude. As you can discern, technology significantly benefits our society, primarily for three reasons: it enables communication with friends, aids in academic endeavors, and serves as a reliable resource for everyone's life. I trust you have found this read engaging. Please take this information into account for your next consideration. Thank you for your time and for perusing my letter.
1119	1121	1	1	In my estimation, computers are beneficial to people. They furnish individuals with the information they @MONTH1 may require. Moreover, they facilitate the acquisition of a vast amount of knowledge.
1120	1122	1	1	I am of the opinion that computers exert a substantial negative influence on society, yet their positive impact is even more pronounced. Contemporary computers are highly sophisticated and enable individuals to communicate with friends, access information more efficiently, and amplify our human capacity in scientific research. Nearly every adolescent possesses an online alias that allows for virtual conversations with friends. This feature helps keep young people connected and socially active. Although instant messaging can divert children from their daily routines, it can also be incredibly useful. Just last week, a friend of mine forgot to jot down their homework and effortlessly made contact online. I was able to inform them within @NUM1 seconds. Similarly, through online communication, one can engage in voice and video chats as if physically present with friends. Since it is not feasible to meet friends in person every day, this serves as a convenient alternative. Not only is it rapid and effortless, but it is also cost - free. Computers prevent children from excessive phone usage, thus avoiding inflated phone bills and those irksome discussions about limiting texting. The most crucial contribution of computers to society is information gathering. The internet enables people to access millions of websites at lightning speed. Every moment of the day, someone is on the internet searching for data that would otherwise require a trip to the library. Computers are an integral part of society, and we rely on them; without them, we would be adrift. They offer an easier way of life that we indolent @CAPS1 need to thrive. The internet keeps us abreast of global events without our having to travel. We rely on the internet, and computers are the gateway to it. One of the most significant areas of life where computers have been instrumental is research. Computers have exponentially increased our human resources, providing a more organized method of data storage. Recently, I watched a program where a computer was testing items for @CAPS2, a process that would take a human weeks. They also foster creativity and innovation. With the evolution of computers, they have become more compact, fitting into the palm of our hand. They inspire us to pursue greater achievements in life, safeguard our planet, and reduce environmental damage. They have encouraged us to explore the uncharted regions of the world that a scientist with a notepad would not have dared to contemplate @NUM2 years ago. Computers have connected the world through communication and information, propelling us to new heights of understanding our existence. Overall, society is reliant on computers, and their positive impact on society is overwhelming.
1121	1123	1	1	A multitude of individuals possess computers that they utilize on a daily basis, do they not? The majority of them remain engrossed in it from the moment they finish work or school until bedtime. In my opinion, they ought to engage in alternative activities rather than spending six hours seated in front of the computer, leading an unfulfilled life. Moreover, prolonged computer use can impair one's eyesight. Why remain glued to the computer all day when one can venture outdoors and breathe in fresh air? Why would one prefer to be on the computer when there are family members and friends with whom quality time could be spent and cared for? One should not be indolent and accomplish nothing for oneself. Instead, one should be capable of going for a walk rather than being confined indoors using the computer. Why would one even desire to be on the computer when one could relish going out for a meal or visiting a place one has always longed to go throughout one's life? One cannot always rely on a computer; when one wishes to explore something novel, one must experience it firsthand to truly understand its essence. One surely does not want to lead a mundane life, does one? This indeed seems to be the case when one spends every day sitting around on the computer looking at a plethora of @NUM1 - since one desires to do what one pleases and have fun by engaging in activities one enjoys. It is not effortless to find a job or plan a long - distance trip by merely looking on the computer because one has to click through numerous numbers or pictures to reach what one wants, whereas one can go out and seek better and other things to do oneself.
1122	1124	1	1	"Dear @PERSON2 - @CAPS1, I earnestly propose that individuals curtail the amount of time they currently spend on computers. By doing so, people will be able to partake in more beneficial activities, such as physical exercise or spending quality time with family and friends. Both of these pursuits are advantageous for one's physical and mental well - being and prove to be more valuable in the long run. Please contemplate the following reasons why it would be more advantageous if people reduced their computer usage. Firstly, physical exercise serves as an excellent substitute for sitting in front of a computer screen. A recent study jointly conducted by @ORGANIZATION3 and @ORGANIZATION1 revealed that the average person spends five hours a day on the computer. By eliminating at least a portion of these hours, individuals will be able to incorporate more exercise into their daily routine. Additionally, @PERSON3 at @ORGANIZATION4 stated that ""@PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION1 alone do not engage in sufficient exercise."" When some of the time spent on the computer is reallocated, people will reward themselves by taking care of their bodies. For instance, I abstained from using my computer for a week, and it was a rewarding experience as I learned to perform a backflip in gymnastics during that free time. There are numerous possibilities in the realm of exercise if people reduce their computer usage. Secondly, if people spend less time on the computer, they will enhance their social skills. For example, @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION5 remarked that ""when people spend time with family and friends, they acquire essential social skills for their future."" A study at @ORGANIZATION2 indicated that individuals who spend three hours or less on their computers exhibit up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick - thinking skills. Spending time with family and friends instead of being on the computer is extremely beneficial. I make an effort to spend at least three hours a day with my family and friends, and I have developed strong relationships with them. Evidently, it is preferable to spend less time on the computer and more time exercising or socializing with loved ones. Some may argue that online communication can also develop social skills, but in fact, face - to - face interactions are more effective as they require quick thinking and emotional intelligence. In conclusion, I firmly believe that reducing computer usage is the optimal way to maintain good physical and mental health. Thank you for considering my perspective."
1123	1125	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it has recently come to my attention that computers are significantly impacting people's daily lives. I concur with this view, especially considering the rising obesity rates in our country. More individuals need to engage in physical activity, interact with friends, and enjoy activities that do not involve technology. Some people are overly reliant on computers; let's see if this trend does not change after reading this essay. A large number of people are spending excessive time on their computers and insufficient time working out or exercising. Due to the continuously increasing obesity rates in many states, people should allocate more time to exercise and less to computer use. One might say, ""I'll just go on a diet!"" However, diets do not always yield results, and many people have tried them. Even a simple one - hour walk with one's dog is preferable to idly browsing the internet. If one wishes, one could even join the local gym for @MONEY1 per month. However, this can only happen if one is willing to take action. Now that you know how to address this issue, it's time to get moving! More people should interact with friends rather than spending time on their computers. Interacting with friends or family will enhance their social skills overall. For example, if you and your friends are out and hungry, you are likely to have more fun engaging in physical activity than sitting in front of a computer. By interacting with loved ones, one will be better prepared for social situations later in life, such as job interviews, and will feel less nervous. Finally, it is essential to learn to enjoy activities that do not involve technology because many people do not find as much enjoyment in the real world. One has to actively seek out fun. This can be achieved by inviting a friend on a camping trip or spending a little money to treat oneself. The outdoors and nature offer numerous beautiful and amazing things; however, one can only appreciate them by having fun outside and exploring the wonders of tourism. In conclusion, many people's lives are being negatively influenced by computers, disrupting their daily routines. However, by following these simple tips - exercising more, socializing more - one can regain control of one's life."
1124	1126	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, I firmly believe that computers are indispensable. Computers are highly beneficial and play a crucial role in our world. They enable us to acquire knowledge about fascinating facts and facilitate online communication. After reading this letter, I hope you will share my view. Firstly, computers are essential as our world becomes increasingly technologically oriented. They are necessary for almost every occupation, and it is imperative for individuals to be proficient in using them. Police officers utilize computers to track down wanted criminals and maintain criminal records. Schools rely on computers daily for students to conduct research, write reports, and complete homework. As a student, I am well - aware that students frequently use computers. For instance, @TIME1, I used a computer to complete my math homework assigned by my teacher. I hope you will concur with me after reading this. Secondly, computers provide us with the ability to research locations worldwide. Additionally, they allow us to stay informed about current events by accessing the news. If one is not fond of writing by hand, a computer can be a valuable tool, and if one is a fast typist, tasks can be completed more efficiently. I use my computer to write all my essays and book reports for @LOCATION1, and I also use it to keep abreast of global news. Lastly, computers are excellent for online communication. One can either send emails or engage in video chats via webcam. Online chatting is an effective way to stay in touch with distant friends or to inquire about homework. On my birthday, my sister was unable to return home from college, so we set up webcams so that she could be present when we opened presents and sang ""Happy Birthday."" I hope you will agree with me after reading this. I trust that I have convinced you that computers are of great importance, which is why we use them so extensively. They are extremely helpful, enable us to learn interesting facts, and facilitate communication with others online."
1125	1127	1	1	"The utilization of computers has been on the rise since the invention of personal computers. Although computers offer certain advantages, such as conducting research and interacting with others, there are significantly more drawbacks than benefits. Computers have a detrimental impact on people's lives outside the ""virtual world."" Many individuals become overweight or obese due to spending excessive time sitting in front of a computer and insufficient time engaging in outdoor exercise. Moreover, people often interact with individuals online whom they do not communicate with in the real world or do not know at all. They also disclose personal information to strangers, which leads me to my second point. Theft occurs daily across the globe, whether it involves robbing a bank, a store, or stealing someone's identity. Computer use can contribute to such thefts. There are individuals who hack into people's bank accounts, which contain all their personal information, and withdraw any amount of money they desire. Millions of people have their information accessible online, which poses a significant risk. This is yet another disadvantage of computers. My final point pertains to the costs associated with computers. Many people have to spend a substantial amount of money on glasses due to prolonged computer use. Some individuals even require rehabilitation. There are individuals who are genuinely addicted to the internet and must pay thousands of dollars to regain their health. As is evident, the cons of computer use far outweigh the pros. Any of these issues could potentially affect you, so I advise you to limit your computer usage."
1126	1128	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, This era is entirely centered around computers. Computers are a distinct advantage to possess. They enhance hand - eye coordination, communication skills, and facilitate access to knowledge.  My first point pertains to hand - eye coordination. This is a crucial skill as it aids in physical movements, such as the use of hands. Studies have indicated that [NUM1] out of [NUM2] individuals have improved their hand - eye coordination. Moreover, it benefits children as it stimulates the nerves in the hands and brain, especially for those who have undergone hand surgery. A study from last year revealed that [PERCENT1] of children showed faster improvement in hand movement compared to regular therapy.  Secondly, the significance of computers lies in communication, such as through email or instant messaging. This is highly beneficial for pen - pals as it saves time on waiting for mail responses and money on postage, as there is no need to send physical mail. When you send an email, you can expect a prompt reply. Additionally, it helps shy individuals. A study has shown that [PERCENT2] of shy children have enhanced their communication skills at school. Improved communication skills also boost children's confidence.  Finally, the computer is a valuable knowledge - acquisition tool. Most books can be more challenging to navigate as they often contain extraneous information that is not required, and it takes longer to find the relevant details. With a computer, all you need to do is type in the information you are seeking. ""It's an effortless experience,"" Time magazine stated. That was a great endorsement from Time. In school, there are useful features like bookmarks that make information retrieval quicker. All you have to do is go to the bookmarks, find the website, and click.  In conclusion, the era of computers is becoming increasingly popular. The benefits of computers, including hand - eye coordination, communication skills, and easy access to knowledge, are undeniable.  ### Item 2 Dear Newspaper, I oppose the entire concept of computers, as I believe they are a waste of both money and the time of children. Children may become overweight and lose the inclination to go outdoors, preferring instead to play video games and consume junk food. Prolonged use of computers can weaken eyesight and, in some cases, may even lead to cancer, which can be fatal, or cause severe illness. Children often spend hours on the computer playing unproductive games and stay indoors for days, neglecting to play with their friends. When they eventually wish to socialize, they may find themselves too overweight and sluggish.  My aunt passed away due to excessive computer use. She developed brain cancer and lived with it for [NUM2] years. I felt deeply sorry for my cousin, who had to witness his mother's suffering because her job required daily computer use.  Therefore, I assert that computers should not be used for more than [NUM2] hours a day.  ### Item 3 Dear Newspaper, I contend that computers are of great importance to people, primarily due to their utility in research, online education, and online shopping. These are my top [NUM1] reasons, and I will elaborate further.  Firstly, computers assist students in obtaining vital information for projects. For instance, Wikipedia can be used to gather details about historical events such as the Battle of [LOCATION1]. I once visited AmericanHistory.com to find comprehensive information about [CAPS1] Alley [CAPS2]. People also conduct extensive research related to schoolwork, including topics about the Earth.  Secondly, computers offer educational opportunities. After high school, individuals can pursue higher education through online colleges. My cousin, for example, studies online because she needs to take care of her two children. Online college advertisements are frequently seen on television, encouraging people to enroll in virtual courses.  Lastly, computers facilitate online shopping. Many stores have online platforms where customers can browse products. Children who love shopping but cannot go to the mall can view items online and make purchases. The products can be delivered to their doorstep. My mother often orders from [CAPS3].[CAPS4] to avoid the hassle of going to the store, and the items arrive within a week.  In conclusion, these [NUM1] reasons clearly demonstrate the importance of computers. They enable people to conduct research, access online education, and engage in online shopping, which enhances people's understanding and utilization of computers.  ### Item 4 Dear [CAPS1] news editors, [CAPS2], my name is [PERSON1], and I request that you write an article on the impact of computers on people. Over the past [NUM1] years or so, computers have become a ubiquitous technological device. They enable individuals to acquire new skills, complete important tasks, and socialize. However, some experts argue that excessive computer use may lead to a decrease in physical activity and health, which is a concern as everyone desires good health. While computers are both enjoyable and useful, could they have a detrimental effect on society?  As of [DATE1], [PERCENT1] of [CAPS3] are employed, and with this figure declining, people need to be more productive to retain their jobs or keep their businesses afloat. With computers available at work or school, a greater volume of work can be accomplished. Programs like [ORGANIZATION1] [CAPS4] allow users to type reports, and software such as [CAPS5], [ORGANIZATION2], and iCalculator enable workers to calculate taxes more efficiently, leaving them with more time for other tasks. Some individuals are involved in stock trading, and in today's volatile market, it is essential to stay informed. Stock websites allow users to manage their investments without incurring high phone bills from calling brokers. Laptops also make it possible to work on the move.  Computers teach a variety of skills necessary for employment and other aspects of life. Typing, proficiency in work - related programs, and programming are all skills that are in demand in certain industries. They also enhance mathematical abilities and hand - eye coordination. Moreover, users can access their favorite books through online scans, which are sometimes free.  In addition to their educational and work - related benefits, computers are also a source of entertainment. Platforms such as [CAPS6], Twitter, email, Google Buzz, MySpace, ooVoo, Skype, and GamesRadar offer numerous ways to communicate with friends and meet new people. On [CAPS6], I can interact with up to [NUM2] people at any time. While face - to - face interaction is important, online communication provides a convenient alternative, especially on lazy days or when friends are unavailable in person.  Online gaming has become extremely popular, and people of all ages, including [NUM3], [NUM4], [CAPS8], [CAPS9], and [CAPS10], can participate. Some may view gaming as a waste of time, but it is no different from other indoor leisure activities. Everyone needs a form of entertainment that can be enjoyed at any time.  Contrary to the belief that technology is making [LOCATION1] into unfit and unproductive individuals, computers can be used to socialize and meet new people. People, like myself, can strike a balance between computer use, gaming, exercise, and sports. When used appropriately, computers can help individuals complete work efficiently and acquire new skills.  I hope you find this article informative. Thank you for reading.  ### Item 5 Do computers impede your fitness when you engage in exercise? I question whether a computer can significantly contribute to various career paths. If you believe it does, that is your prerogative. However, it may not be a necessity. Let us delve into this argument.  Owning a computer can distract you from exercise, which is beneficial for your well - being. The more time you spend on it, the more likely you are to become addicted. While a computer can offer some assistance, in most cases, its drawbacks outweigh its benefits. Of course, if you are in business, you may require one. Nevertheless, you can easily get engrossed in all the activities available on the computer, and before you know it, your day has passed. You may find yourself with nothing accomplished, which is rather frustrating.  Once you start using the computer again, you may wonder why you should go out when you can chat with friends online. Spending excessive time on the computer often leads to a sedentary lifestyle, where you consume more snacks and gain weight. You may become self - conscious about your appearance when you go swimming with your friends.  Your friends may notice your weight gain and inquire about it. You may have to admit, ""I spent too much time on my computer, became inactive due to lack of exercise, and ate unhealthily."" Subsequently, they may invite you to participate in activities. Eventually, you can regain your fitness and your six - pack abs. You will feel great about yourself, and life will seem more fulfilling.  You should use technology only when necessary to maintain a healthy and fit body, which is not just what you desire but what you need."

1128	1130	1	1	Dear Newspaper I disagree with the hole computer thing I think it's just a wast of money and it's a wast of time for kids. That will be the kids will get fat and kids will never want to go out side they will want to play video games, eat junk food. If you stay on the computer for to long, it can make your eyes week and it sometimes can give you canser and you can die from canser or you can get really sick and not die and you will hike @NUM1 sick year of pain. Mostly kids stay on the computer for mores playing stupid games and they will never go out side and they will stay in side for days and never go out side and play with there friends. When they get sick of there games they will want to try and hang out with there friends but they wont be able to they will be to fat and slow. My aunt died from useing a computer to much she had brain cancer and she died she lived for @NUM2 year with the cacer. I felt so bad for my cousin he had to watch his mother die all because she used a computer everyday cause that has her job. Therefor I state that computers should not be used for more than @NUM2 houre a day
1129	1132	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I disagree that computers are important to people because they have research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top @NUM1 reasons and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project. You can do on the wikepedia to help find information about the battle of @LOCATION1 and other important history. one example is I went to american history.com to find good information about @CAPS1 alley @CAPS2 and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it. My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school, you can go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. My third and final reason why computers are good for you people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping alot but they can't go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from @CAPS3.C @CAPS4 so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week. There was my @NUM1 main reasons why people should have a computer. They can find research, online schools, and online shopping stores. This can help people understand computers.
1130	1133	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 news editors, @CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1, and I would like you to write an article on the effects computers have on people. Computers have been the technological item to have over the past @NUM1 or so years. They allow people to learn many new skills, get important work done, and even socialize! However some experts believe that people spend to much time on computers, and that people are not as active or healthy because of it, and. Everyone wants to be healthy. While computers are fun and useful, could they have a negative effect on society? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are employed as of @DATE1, and with that number dropping people need to get more work done to keep their jobs, or even keep their businesses open. With computers available at work (or school) much more work can be done, with programs like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 people can type reports, and with programs like @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2, and iCalculator, workers can calculate taxes faster, so they have more time to work. Some people are working with stocks, and these days, the stocks could be good or bad, so you need to keep up! You can go to the stock websites and control what you buy and sell, without raising you phone bill from calling the brokers. Laptops make work possible on the go to! Computers teach many skills you need to know for jobs, and other skills you @MONTH1 need times in life. You can learn typing, work programs, and programing which are all needed in some lines of work. Computers increase math skills and hand eye coordination to! And you can read your favorite books via online scans!, now you @MONTH1 be wondering why not pick up a real book? Well, you canít online scans, and some are free! Not only do computers teach skills and work, they are very fun too! Between @CAPS6, twitter, email, googleBUZZ, mySpace, ooVoo, skype and gamesradar, there are lots of ways to talk to friends and meet new people. On @CAPS6 I can have up to @NUM2 people talk to whenever I want! Why not talk to real people? you ask, well the answer is simple, maybe it is a lazy @DATE2 and nobody wants to go out anywhere, or maybe your friends want to talk right before bed time. Talking to real people is important, but canít be done all the time! Online gaming has become an sensation!, and not only an @NUM3, @NUM4 and @CAPS8, @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 can ìgameî too! So many people are gaming now, that if your not, you are missing out on an amazing experience. Some people think gaming is a waste of time, but the same can be said for any indoor leisure activity, everybody needs a fun activity they can do anytime! Besides everybody likes having fun! Some people believe the ludicrous notion that technology is making @LOCATION1 into fat, lifeless losers, but, it is opposite, you can socialize online and meet new people. People (like myself) can balance computers and games, with exercize and sports. With computers you can efficently complete work and learn new skills! Computers are posotive if used correctly. I hope you like this artice, thanks for reading.
1131	1134	1	1	Dear Sir, I am of the opinion that computers are highly advantageous to society. There are numerous benefits associated with having access to a computer. One can engage in online communication via instant messaging, which is far more reliable than using a telephone or a mobile phone. Frequently, individuals do not answer calls when needed. With a computer, one can send a message directly to a person's mobile device. Moreover, a wealth of knowledge can be acquired from a computer, including information about the world and people across the globe. One can learn things that even teachers may not cover in class. Subsequently, one can study and expand one's knowledge base. It is indeed a concern if one spends more time on the computer than exercising. However, with today's technology, it is possible to exercise while using a computer. For instance, one can play music during a workout or watch a movie while running on a treadmill. Although some people spend excessive time on the computer, there are ways to exercise and use the computer simultaneously. In conclusion, despite the pros and cons, it ultimately does not matter how much one uses the computer, as one can exercise at the same time. This is why I believe that having computers today is beneficial.
1132	1135	1	1	"Recently, there has been a discourse regarding whether computers are advantageous to society. While each perspective has its merits, computers undeniably exert a positive influence on both individuals and society at large. Computers offer several benefits. By utilizing computers, one gains the capacity to conduct research and acquire knowledge about both local and foreign destinations, communicate with others, and assist in completing daily tasks. At some point in everyone's life, there is a need to learn about local or even distant places. It is entirely impractical for an individual to visit every location they need to know about. This is where computers prove invaluable. Through the internet, one can research a wide range of topics, from the primary dietary staples in @LOCATION3 to the date of the New Year in @LOCATION1. One can learn about various things from the comfort of one's home or hometown. I recall in @NUM1 grade, I had to undertake a research project on @LOCATION2. By accessing the computer, I learned all the necessary information and more. The project was effortless, and I achieved a perfect score. Additionally, one can stay informed about local upcoming events and the world around them. During childhood, children often have numerous questions that parents may not be able to answer. Using the computer is a swift and straightforward way to obtain these answers. Computers play a crucial role in educating people's minds, and without them, our knowledge might be severely limited. Communicating with individuals on the other side of the world can be challenging. Sending a letter may take weeks to reach the recipient. Computers provide us with an immediate means of communication, whether the person is nearby or far away. Last year, my uncle relocated to @LOCATION3 for work. I rarely got to see him. We maintained communication through computers, and when he returned home for Christmas, our relationship remained as close as before. Computers helped preserve our relationship, and I doubt it would have been the same without them. Scientists state that approximately @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 have communicated with someone at least once via computers. They also note that @PERCENT2 of these individuals regularly use this mode of communication. Although we still rely on phones and traditional mail, I believe that our society would struggle to function socially without the widespread availability of computers. Every day, computers assist people in navigating their lives with minimal difficulties. People can accomplish tasks more efficiently, allowing them more time to focus on what truly matters, such as spending time with their families. Without computers, daily business operations would take approximately twice as long, leaving less time for leisure activities. @PERSON1, my neighbor, remarked, ""@CAPS2 and banking are extremely time-consuming. I'm not sure how I would manage without the ability to conduct online banking."" In addition to facilitating tasks, computers also simplify shopping and help us find the ideal phone company for our new business. The ability to shop and browse online eliminates the need for travel, walking, and waiting in checkout lines, enabling us to relax and make the most of our day. Typing also enhances hand - eye coordination. Without computers, we would struggle to perform everyday tasks, such as opening doors or playing sports with our children. Using computers allows people to lead more efficient and fulfilling lives. I cannot envision a world without them. Computers benefit society in every aspect. By facilitating knowledge acquisition, strengthening relationships through seamless communication, and streamlining daily life, they have an overwhelmingly positive impact on people everywhere. Computers have a profound influence on individuals and should continue to be an integral part of daily society."
1133	1136	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, It has come to my attention that more than half of the students worldwide utilize computers for study purposes. I contend that people do not spend an excessive amount of time on computers, and when they do, it is primarily for educational pursuits, learning, or reconnecting with old friends. Here are several reasons why I believe computers have a positive impact on people. Firstly, most children use computers to enhance their understanding of classroom subjects. They also employ computers to research countries or individuals for reports. Moreover, there are educational games on computers that can aid in improving mathematical skills. Secondly, computers provide a means of communication with friends who live at a distance. One can send emails or use social media platforms like Facebook to locate old friends. Additionally, video chat functionality allows for face - to - face communication, whether it is for personal conversations or business meetings with clients across the country. Thirdly, computers are equipped with applications such as Microsoft Word, which enables users to type essays or term papers instead of writing them by hand. There are also applications for creating PowerPoint presentations for projects and for digital painting or drawing. These are the reasons why I believe computers have a beneficial effect on people. Without computers, the world would be vastly different. Children would struggle to conduct research for projects or type essays, and it would be difficult to maintain contact with those who have moved away. Moreover, creating PowerPoint presentations for projects would become a cumbersome task. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people.
1134	1137	1	1	Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers are among the most remarkable inventions of all time. They contribute significantly to education, simplify various aspects of life, and streamline travel. In the realm of education, educators frequently employ computers to facilitate students' acquisition of essential knowledge. For example, when preparing for a study session, there are specialized websites available for learning. There are also platforms designed to teach young children how to read and write. Nowadays, nearly all educational institutions are equipped with computers. Some schools even provide computers to students for study purposes. In the @CAPS7.S, approximately @PERCENT1 of educational institutions rely more on computers than textbooks, resulting in higher test scores. This clearly demonstrates the positive impact of computers on education. Secondly, computers generally simplify life. Instead of spending hours writing an essay by hand, only to discover numerous spelling errors, one can type it quickly and utilize spell - check. I have yet to encounter anyone who claims that computers have not made life easier. For instance, if one needs information about a new pet, rather than spending time at the library, one can simply access the internet and find the required information within seconds. This exemplifies how computers simplify daily tasks. Finally, computers have revolutionized travel. Without computers, purchasing tickets would involve a time - consuming visit to a ticket counter. In fact, I can hardly recall the days when online ticket - buying was not an option. With a computer, all one needs to do is visit the relevant websites and make a purchase. It is incredibly convenient. Additionally, computers have transformed communication. I have not sent a @CAPS8 card in years. Instead, I prefer to send emails, which are faster, more convenient, and more reliable. Overall, computers are one of the most useful tools ever invented. With the continuous advancement of technology, it will become even easier to accomplish tasks. While excessive computer use can be detrimental, and people should not be overly reliant on the internet, computers prove to be invaluable in most situations. This is why I believe that computers are truly remarkable.
1135	1138	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, There has been extensive debate regarding whether computers are beneficial to society. I firmly believe that they are indeed advantageous. Firstly, computers facilitate communication. One can engage in conversations or web chats with friends. I once reconnected with an old friend from @LOCATION1 whom I had not seen in five years through an online platform. Every day after school, I log on to the computer to catch up with my friends. The computer serves as an excellent medium for making plans and staying in touch with companions. Secondly, there is a plethora of activities available on computers and the World Wide Web. It is like having an amusement park at home. The internet is a wonderful resource, whether for completing homework or playing games. Sometimes, I spend a couple of hours just playing games on the computer. However, I still make sure to exercise regularly. Although computers can be addictive, it is essential to engage in outdoor activities. It is reported that over @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS1 population owns a computer, and @PERCENT2 of them check their emails or use the computer every ten minutes. While excessive computer use may not be healthy, it is an individual's choice. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers are beneficial. As I have mentioned, they are excellent for communication and socializing with friends, and there are countless things to do on them. Therefore, if you do not have a computer, I highly recommend getting one. It will surely be worth your while.
1136	1139	1	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, the average American utilizes the computer at least once daily. Undoubtedly, these machines confer significant benefits upon society. With them, individuals can effortlessly acquire knowledge about distant locales, engage in learning without the burden of carrying voluminous books and papers, and converse with individuals across the nation and, at times, even globally.  First and foremost, computers can educate you about the world without necessitating a visit to a library. Free resources such as Wikipedia offer rapid access to knowledge on virtually any subject. You can employ these platforms for essay writing, trip planning, and to satiate your curiosity. Some individuals contend that computers deter people from exercising and appreciating nature. However, computers actually promote physical activity and outdoor exploration. They provide swift and convenient access to travel agencies and information on popular tourist destinations. Additionally, they feature advertising platforms for gyms and offer ideas for home workouts. Computers do not impede exercise or nature walks; rather, they facilitate their pursuit.  Moreover, computers simplify other aspects of life. Learning can be significantly enhanced through their use. Instead of lugging around heavy books, one can carry a compact laptop. Furthermore, one need not worry about keeping track of papers, as everything can be saved on a laptop. Computers organize files efficiently, enabling even disorganized students to maintain order. Another advantage is that text typed on a computer is neat and easily comprehensible, unlike some handwritten documents. The implementation of laptops in @ORGANIZATION2 within @ORGANIZATION1 exemplifies how schools can be streamlined. Each student is provided with a laptop for use instead of traditional books, as one student remarked, ""@CAPS6 is so much easier.""  My final point is that individuals can communicate with anyone via chat platforms. If someone has a cousin in a distant country, they can still maintain contact. The same applies to friends who have moved. E-mail is considerably faster than conventional mail. The transmission of an e-mail from one person to another is nearly instantaneous. Additionally, e-mail offers greater privacy. While regular mail is merely sealed, e-mails are password-protected. There are also other social networking sites where people can exchange messages. These platforms can assist individuals in learning about the cultures of other cities, regions, and even different countries. Such platforms can help bridge cultural gaps, combat racism, and contribute to a more ideal world.  Computers enhance our community. They enable us to learn about remote places, simplify education, and facilitate communication with others from almost anywhere. Therefore, upon reflection, you will recognize that computers are indeed beneficial to our society."
1137	1140	1	1	Computers represent the vanguard of the future and stand as the most remarkable technological innovation humanity has achieved. They empower us to refine our hand - eye coordination, gain insights into distant peoples and places, and interact with our friends.  Computers enhance hand - eye coordination in multiple ways. Typing is an excellent method to develop this crucial skill. By typing without looking and instinctively knowing the location of each key, one can improve this ability. Similarly, using a mouse enhances hand - eye coordination as one maneuvers the digital cursor with the physical mouse in hand. This improvement in hand - eye coordination can have a positive impact on writing. Just as one moves a mouse or types, the same dexterity can be applied to writing. It can also be beneficial for driving. When driving, one cannot constantly look at the steering wheel; instead, one must keep their eyes on the road. To do this effectively, one needs to have a good sense of how they are moving the wheel, which is where the enhanced hand - eye coordination from using a computer comes in handy.  Computers also expand our knowledge of far - flung places and diverse cultures. Cultures are incredibly diverse, and with a computer, we can explore all of them from the comfort of our homes. We can also study nature without leaving our living spaces. Learning about different cultures offers a wealth of knowledge, such as the traditional clothing they wear, the cuisine they enjoy, and the habitats they inhabit. This exposure can inspire us to make positive changes in our own culture. Moreover, learning about new places can broaden our horizons and potentially lead to exciting vacations.  Finally, computers enable us to interact with friends from the comfort of our seats. Chatting, emailing, and video - chatting are all excellent means of staying connected. With a webcam, it's almost as if you're having a face - to - face conversation with the other person. We can also send important files like pictures, documents, and videos via email, which can be extremely useful for work.  In conclusion, computers are invaluable as they teach us hand - eye coordination, educate us about distant places and people, and allow us to interact and share with friends. They have become an indispensable part of our lives.
1138	1141	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, an increasing number of individuals are utilizing computers; however, not all concur that this trend is advantageous to society. Proponents of technological advancement assert that computers exert a positive influence on individuals like myself. They enhance hand - eye coordination, endow people with the capacity to learn about remote locations and individuals, and even facilitate online communication.  I shall elucidate the reasons why we should leverage the benefits of these devices. Firstly, computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. One can acquire the skill of rapid typing. Without proficient hand - eye coordination, how would one be able to strike a ball with a bat or catch a ball with their hands?  Secondly, computers afford us the opportunity to learn about distant places and people. For instance, if we are in @LOCATION1 and wish to learn about @LOCATION3, or if we are in France and are curious about the German people, we need not travel there in person. Instead, we can simply conduct an online search. Consider the impracticality of flying to a distant location and returning on the same day.  Lastly, computers enable us to communicate online with anyone, from individuals in Africa to those in the United States and all the way to @LOCATION2. As such, it is evident that computers are truly remarkable. We do not wish to burden others with excessive written correspondence; hence, the need for computers becomes apparent.
1139	1142	1	1	"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1, it has come to my attention that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 devote an excessive amount of time to their computers. I firmly believe that individuals should allocate more time outdoors in the company of their families. Prolonged computer use can undoubtedly lead to neurological issues, visual impairment, and, most alarmingly, mortality.  To begin with, there are numerous cases of individuals suffering from neurological problems due to excessive computer usage. When these individuals are with their families, their thoughts are preoccupied with their computers. They remain glued to their screens for an unbroken stretch of time. A recent survey has indicated that teenagers are the most frequent computer users. Many people have effectively confined their lives within the four walls of their computer rooms.  Moreover, optometrists have been inundated with calls from concerned parents. These parents are alarmed by their children's deteriorating vision. I had the opportunity to interview an optometrist, who recounted, ""A child visited my office and was experiencing severe visual difficulties."" When inquiring about the cause, the child's mother revealed that her son spent an average of three and a half hours on the computer each day. As a result, the child had to obtain a pair of specialized glasses, which are prohibitively expensive.  I have also encountered reports of both children and adults succumbing to the perils of excessive computer use. Prolonged exposure to screens can cause irreparable damage to the brain, leading to erratic and often illegal behavior. For example, some individuals have engaged in activities such as home invasions, homicides, and car thefts. I recall a disturbing incident where a teenager, after excessive computer use, began committing violent acts and was ultimately shot by a police officer. As the number of such fatalities increases, so does the death toll.  It is high time, @CAPS3 friends, that we unite in our efforts to curtail our computer usage. I am confident that none of us wishes to become a statistic in the death toll unless absolutely necessary. It is time to step outside, enjoy the company of our families, and create lasting memories. Our families yearn for our presence. So, rise from your seats and venture outdoors. Before you do, ensure that you turn off your computer to avoid the temptation of returning to it."
1140	1143	1	1	To the @CAPS1, I have recently become aware that some individuals hold the view that computers do not contribute to the betterment of society. However, I firmly oppose this stance.  Computers offer three significant advantages. Firstly, they enable both children and adults to explore distant places and gain knowledge about a wide range of subjects. People, including professors, historians, and other highly educated individuals, share their discoveries and information daily. This means that every day, there is an opportunity for individuals to learn something new. When I conduct research on an important historical figure, I often uncover facts that were not taught in school. The computer serves as an ideal platform for people to share their knowledge, allowing others to learn from one another. The possibilities for learning are endless for those who own a computer.  Secondly, computers facilitate communication between family and friends, even when they are geographically separated. In the absence of computers, maintaining contact with family members who have moved to a different location would be extremely challenging. With computers, one can send emails to family members' computers or mobile phones. This technology allows us to stay close to our loved ones, regardless of the distance. For instance, my brother is in @LOCATION1, and I video - chat with him every day when I get home. Without the computer, this regular communication would be impossible.  Lastly, computers offer a form of entertainment on days when going outside is not feasible. Certain software enables users to create games and share them with the public. On rainy days, I often turn to my computer to play video games. These games not only keep me entertained but also, in some cases, are educational. They can teach me various aspects of history.  In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset to society. They expand our knowledge, help us stay connected with our loved ones, and provide entertainment. Their benefits far outweigh any negative perceptions, and they have become an integral part of our lives.
1141	1144	1	1	"Dear @LOCATION4 @ORGANIZATION2, Computers, a remarkable invention, are increasingly facing public disfavor. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that they exert positive influences on individuals. Firstly, they serve as an excellent avenue for children to enjoy themselves; @CAPS1, people can acquire highly interesting facts. Lastly, they offer an outstanding means of communicating with friends and family. These are several reasons why I consider computers to have a positive impact on people.  Initially, one can derive substantial enjoyment from playing games on a computer. Moreover, computers save a significant amount of money for many of us. For example, purchasing a gaming system would cost well over @MONEY1, whereas on a computer, one can find and play games for free. Not all games need to be like ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS5""; they can also be sports - themed games. Suppose a student breaks his leg but loves playing soccer. He can simply use the computer to play a soccer game, despite his injury.  People can @CAPS1 learn a wide variety of facts directly from their computers. The primary purpose of computers is to facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge. No one in the @CAPS2 is omniscient, but if everyone shares their knowledge on the computer, people can learn anything from it. I recall @CAPS6 when my friend once told me about a person named @PERSON2. I had no idea who he was, and my friend started laughing at me. @CAPS6 when I got home, I searched for him, and by the time I finished reading about him, I knew more about @PERSON2 than my friend did. If a student has a question in class that the teacher cannot answer, the teacher always tells us to either ""@CAPS7"" it or ""@CAPS8"" it. Both are search engines.  Not only can one learn a great deal from computers, but @CAPS1 one can also communicate with individuals from different countries. Imagine if @PERSON1 had not invented the telephone; how different our lives would be at present. Nowadays, most people use computers for communication. Whether it is @CAPS9 or @CAPS10, or whether it is @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS11, all are excellent ways to communicate with others. Making phone calls to people in different countries incurs costs, but using a computer for communication is completely free. One could be living in @LOCATION1 and chatting with someone in @LOCATION5, or living in @LOCATION2 and emailing someone in @LOCATION3. Communication becomes rapid and effortless everywhere with the use of computers.  My entire family resides in @LOCATION6, and making a call there costs us twice as much. @CAPS6 when we use the computer, it is even better because they can even see our faces through the webcam. As is evident, computers are by no means negative. As far as I know, they assist people around the @CAPS2. They enable children to have fun through the games we can play. @CAPS1, they educate both children and adults on various new things. Lastly, they represent an excellent communication strategy. I hope that you publish these reasons in our local paper so that everyone can recognize how computers have a positive impact on people."
1142	1145	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are you aware that over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 possess computers? Computers, among the greatest technological advancements, are permeating the nation and the world. As can likely be discerned, I am of the opinion that computers have positive effects on individuals.  Computers cultivate hand - eye coordination and foster the ability to learn and conduct research rapidly and efficiently. Additionally, they provide numerous avenues for online chatting. Have you ever participated in a baseball game where you struggled to hit the ball? It seems you need to enhance your hand - eye coordination. Studies have indicated that @PERCENT2 of computer users exhibit improved hand - eye coordination during activities such as sports or games. Thus, if you use a computer, you will be hitting home runs rather than striking out.  After winning your baseball game, it is time for homework. Guess what? Your teacher has assigned a project due tomorrow! Do not panic; go online! Computers facilitate learning and research, which is more expeditious than visiting the library and retrieving a book. Suppose you need to know the birth date of Olympic gold medalist @PERSON1; simply search for it on Google! Finally, once you have gathered your information, all you need to @CAPS2 is cite your source.  Now that your homework is completed and you wish to discuss your plans for @DATE1 with your friend, computers offer numerous online chatting options. There are @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, woVoo, @CAPS7, and many others. So, you log in to @CAPS7 and converse with your best friend. Now you are no longer bored. Computers are an excellent means of alleviating boredom by engaging in online conversations with friends. However, you should go to bed soon as you have @ORGANIZATION1's in the morning!  As is apparent, computers are integrated into our daily lives. They are ubiquitous! I believe that they are transforming society, predominantly for the better. They enhance hand - eye coordination, aid in research and learning, and enable communication with friends. Additionally, if you do not already own a computer, you should acquire one.
1143	1146	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, In my perspective, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial and can provide us humans with a wealth of information. Although some individuals contend that computers are overused, they enable the world to connect with relatives and family across the globe, assist in job - hunting in different countries and states, and facilitate learning about the entire world. I will elucidate the reasons why I consider computers to be positive for humans.  To commence, not all families and friends live in close proximity to one another. They @MONTH1 reside on the opposite side of the world. This is where webcams and online chatting on computers prove invaluable. How could one expect to see their family and friends without webcams? While we do have cell phones, not everyone can afford them. People can visit their nearest library and utilize the computers there for free!  Another reason why computers are crucial is that when one loses their job, they cannot simply stay at home and expect to live rent - free. One must @CAPS1 seek another job. One can apply for jobs directly on the computer. How much more convenient could it be? Now, you no longer need to borrow your mother's car to attend an interview.  Furthermore, the last point I wish to emphasize is that learning about the world is of utmost importance for both the young and the old. Do you think that every teacher has visited every place and thus knows about the world? Of course not! Teachers also rely on computers to search for information on specific subjects. For instance, I am interested in learning about crocodiles in @LOCATION1. I live in the @ORGANIZATION2. Do you really think I would travel all the way to @LOCATION1 to learn about crocodiles when I can simply turn on the computer and immerse myself in the world of crocodiles? Of course not. It would be enjoyable to travel to @LOCATION1 to witness it firsthand, but I do not have the financial means.  In summary, I believe you can understand my stance. I sincerely advocate allowing computers to do what they do best: assist humans. It is one of the greatest inventions of all time. Don't you agree?
1144	1147	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff, Do computers prove beneficial to us on a regular basis? Computers are highly useful machines that enhance productivity on a daily basis. Not only do they enable people to explore @ORGANIZATION1 locations and gain a deeper understanding of other parts of the world, but they also facilitate communication with individuals globally. Additionally, computers are equipped with word processors and other applications that assist workers in performing their daily tasks.  So, do computers aid people in learning more about our planet? Many teachers and students utilize computers daily for educational purposes. There are numerous online websites that help students discover and analyze different regions around the world. For example, there is a @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org) where students are required to match places/areas on a map. There are also websites such as MapQuest and Yellow Pages that assist people in navigating across the country and within the town. As is evident, computers contribute to students' education and our daily lives.  A significant number of teenagers of all ages are fond of using a program on computers called @CAPS1. @CAPS1 stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program enables people of all ages to communicate instantaneously with their friends or colleagues. One simply types a message in a chat box, and it is immediately sent to the recipient.  Emailing serves multiple purposes. It can be used to catch up with friends or discuss matters with others. One can also attach documents that @MONTH1 contain relevant information. Emailing expedites the process, just like computers enhance efficiency. If your newspaper were hand - written, it would consume a substantial amount of time, labor, paper, and money. As you can clearly see, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are indispensable!  Computers have a profound impact on us in numerous ways that are not readily apparent. As previously mentioned, they educate and help people learn about diverse locations around the world, facilitate communication with those around us or in @LOCATION2, and allow us to carry our work, family, friends, and cases wherever we go. Moreover, they enable us to word - process papers, making our daily lives more convenient.  Therefore, do not spend excessive time on the computer, but utilize it to meet our needs. Please incorporate computers into our daily routines. Stop writing on that notepad and start typing on your computer!
1145	1148	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you may have noticed that there is considerable controversy regarding whether computers are beneficial or harmful. I firmly believe that computers are advantageous as they enable us to learn about new things, communicate with people worldwide, and explore novel experiences.  For instance, have you ever wondered about the capital of @LOCATION6? With a computer, you can obtain the answer in an instant. This is because the internet offers unparalleled information that no book can provide. The internet allows us to stay informed about global events through various news sources and blogs. @PERSON1, do you recall the earthquake in @LOCATION4? I certainly do, as I learned about it through the internet. You can also find directions to places, sports statistics, and information about different locations. Is there a better way to learn about these than interacting with local residents? I think not. Is it more beneficial to read about @LOCATION5 or converse with someone from @LOCATION5? This is the beauty of the internet; it strengthens the global bond. I remember chatting with people from @LOCATION3 during the gold medal game @PERSON3.  Some may argue that one can meet people from different countries in person. However, how would one meet someone from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1? I have never had such an opportunity. With the internet, it becomes entirely possible.  Have you @PERSON1 ever desired to visit @PERSON4? With the internet, all you need is a credit card, and you could be there the next day. The internet allows you to embark on new adventures. Have you ever wanted to try ping - pong? You can order a set online and have it delivered to you within a few days. I always wanted to visit a zoo but was unaware of any nearby. Using the internet, I searched for zoos near @LOCATION1, and within moments, the results for @PERSON2 zoo appeared before me.  In conclusion, the internet is extremely helpful for those who use it appropriately. However, I acknowledge that the internet can sometimes be inappropriate. By blocking unnecessary websites, the internet can accomplish almost anything.
1146	1149	1	1	Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers represent an exceptional technological innovation. They are highly advantageous for numerous reasons, three of which are entertainment, convenience, and education. I firmly contend that these three factors are the primary motivations for our contemporary utilization of computers. One rationale for our computer usage is entertainment. On specific websites, one can engage in conversations with friends, ascertain their activities, and even partake in video chats. Additionally, one can watch movies, @CAPS4 episodes, and videos. Moreover, one can listen to music, play games, and check sports scores. I am firmly convinced that entertainment is one of the principal reasons we employ computers today. Another reason for our computer usage is convenience. The majority of individuals in @LOCATION1 possess a computer in their residence. Computers are convenient as one can pay bills online, email colleagues regarding work, and create websites to enhance business visibility. Evidently, computers are an extremely convenient technological device. The final reason for our computer usage is education. With a computer, one can acquire knowledge on virtually any subject. One can learn about @CAPS5 history, sports, and current global events. Computers can assist in studying, note - taking, and completing homework. Whenever I have a project, I invariably utilize the computer to gather crucial information on the topic. As is evident, education is the most significant reason for our computer usage. Now, I trust you comprehend how computers are vital in @LOCATION1's education, entertainment, and convenience. I hope you have considered my perspective on computers and that you continue to inform others about their excellence and importance.
1147	1150	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, It is my conviction that individuals are expending an excessive amount of time on computers. Presently, one can accomplish virtually anything on a computer, such as conversing with friends, playing games, or even controlling home lighting. However, what are computers depriving us of? They are eroding communication skills and giving rise to cyber - bullying. They also impede our ability to appreciate the beauty of nature and engage in physical exercise. One out of every @NUM1 teenagers spends more time communicating with others via computer than in face - to - face interactions. This mode of communication inhibits children from acquiring valuable social skills that are developed through in - person conversations. Consequently, it becomes more challenging for children to make friends or perform well in work - related situations. Studies indicate that with each successive generation, communication skills are declining by @PERCENT2. Eventually, if this trend persists, we will inhabit a world with severely impaired communication. This form of communication has also spawned a new type of bullying. What have we inflicted upon ourselves? One squanders over @NUM2 days a year sitting in front of a computer. During this wasted time, one could be jogging or taking a walk. In fact, the percentage of individuals who own a computer is significantly higher than those who do not. Moreover, exercise is a personal endeavor; a computer cannot substitute for physical activity. Sitting in front of a computer offers no physical benefits. One must physically rise and move. It is beneficial for health and allows one to breathe fresh air. Regarding fresh air, @PERCENT1 of individuals who use computers at home are more prone to illness than those who occasionally venture outdoors. While one can view images of a green - spotted tree on the internet, it is no substitute for experiencing nature in person. Discoveries of new species cannot be made on a computer; it cannot replace real - world exploration. People are becoming increasingly detached from the environment due to computer use. They are merely viewing pictures rather than experiencing the real thing. After penning this, I have become acutely aware of my own over - reliance on computers, which deeply concerns me. I have noticed that I see friends less frequently, venture outdoors less often, and engage in less physical activity. This is true for most people, whether they realize it or not. I am committed to reducing my computer time starting today. Let us break free from the computer's hold and lead more fulfilling lives. This will enhance our well - being. In conclusion, computers exert a negative influence on humanity, and we should curtail our usage and focus on self - improvement. Thank you for your time.
1148	1151	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I am writing to convey my view that the increasing prevalence of computer usage is a positive development. This is because computers facilitate the development of hand - eye coordination, enable individuals to gain knowledge about distant locations and people, and provide opportunities for online communication. The first reason for the growing popularity of computers is their role in enhancing hand - eye coordination. For instance, there are computer programs designed to teach touch - typing, allowing users to type proficiently without constantly looking at the keyboard. The second reason is the ability of computers to offer insights into far - off places and diverse individuals. Suppose you have a school project requiring research on a foreign country. In that case, a computer can provide comprehensive information about its religions and overall characteristics. Additionally, one can use the computer to study different types of people, from @PERSON1 of @DATE1 to @PERSON2, the current president. The final reason is the convenience of online communication. One can create accounts on platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 to interact with others. Through these platforms, one can befriend neighborhood kids previously unknown. In conclusion, the increasing use of computers is highly beneficial. They help users develop hand - eye coordination, learn about the world, and communicate online. I surveyed individuals new to computer use, and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 respondents expressed satisfaction with their experiences. I encourage you to acquire a computer and experience its advantages firsthand. Thank you.
1149	1152	1	1	Envision this scenario: You enter a raffle at your child's school and win an all - expenses - paid trip to @LOCATION1. Initially, you are elated, but then you realize your profound ignorance about @LOCATION1. You are unaware of its climate, cuisine, and how to prepare for the journey. Consequently, you turn to the internet and amass comprehensive knowledge about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriately and enjoy a remarkable trip, all thanks to your computer. Computers are instrumental in facilitating education, regardless of age. They also enable individuals to maintain contact with friends and family and are indispensable for numerous occupations. Computers empower people to explore different countries and cultures. Our understanding of other places has expanded exponentially since the advent of computers. However, computers offer far more than just cultural knowledge. They can teach new languages and enhance comprehension of scientific concepts. There are numerous online colleges where one can study at one's own pace, which is particularly advantageous for busy individuals. The internet serves as an excellent medium for staying connected with loved ones. One can utilize email, instant messaging, video chatting, or create accounts on social media platforms like Facebook or MySpace. For example, my cousin has served in the navy for @NUM1 years. Before I joined Facebook, we lost touch, but now we communicate regularly. When most people think of computers, the internet immediately comes to mind. However, computers have far - reaching applications beyond the internet. Nowadays, a wide range of occupations, including banking, @CAPS1, teaching, @CAPS2, and cashiering, rely on computers. Computers have transitioned from being a luxury to a necessity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs mandate computer proficiency. Computers enable the creation of professional - looking book reports and important letters. Computers have transformed the world, and this transformation is irreversible. Clearly, access to a computer simplified the trip to @LOCATION1. Undoubtedly, computers have become an integral part of daily life, facilitating communication, work, and most importantly, learning.
1150	1153	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, Technological advancements, though remarkable, do not invariably exert a positive influence on society. Hence, I sincerely believe that computers do not confer benefits upon my community. For example, computers can pose significant risks, and contemporary individuals seem to squander excessive time using them. Moreover, computers are exorbitantly priced. Firstly, my parents often caution me, ""Avoid interacting with strangers,"" when I venture outside. I opine that they should issue the same warning when I use my computer. Computers can be genuinely perilous for the unwary. Online predators frequently assume false identities, making it impossible to trust individuals met solely in chat rooms. Additionally, cyberbullying is another hazard associated with computer use. Furthermore, any content posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone, including pictures, blogs, and comments. I contend that society would be better off without the perpetual anxiety engendered by computers. Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, devote an inordinate amount of time to computers. Some individuals spend hours daily on computers when they could engage in activities that yield tangible benefits. If people dedicated as much time to community service as they do to computer use, the world would become a far more pleasant place to live. Moreover, it would foster closer interpersonal relationships. Computers appear to dominate people's lives, which is detrimental to their well - being. I advocate that individuals should allocate more time to living and less time fixated on computer screens. Lastly, computers are akin to vampires, draining one's financial resources. In @DATE1's economic climate, individuals need to save money for college or even mundane necessities such as a new pair of shoes. Additionally, given the rapid pace of technological progress, even the most advanced computers become obsolete within a year or two, necessitating the purchase of a new device. Moreover, computer prices are constantly on the rise, making it arduous to keep up. I firmly believe that computers are a waste of money and have a detrimental impact on society. In conclusion, computers are a negative element in communities across @LOCATION1. They are hazardous, time - consuming, and expensive. In @DATE1's world, computers are simply a nuisance."
1151	1154	1	1	In my view, computers serve as an excellent source of information, communication, and business facilitation, streamlining various tasks. For instance, rather than visiting the library to gather information on a particular subject, one can utilize a computer. As one of the most advanced technological tools, computers enable users to search for any information globally. They are also highly beneficial for school projects or work - in some professions, computer usage is mandatory. Moreover, computers are ideal for learning about unfamiliar topics; some individuals even enroll in online courses. Additionally, they can assist in planning vacations. Computers are frequently employed to communicate with family and friends. If one owns a computer, they likely have an email account, a homepage, or a [specific platform] to maintain contact. There are even platforms to meet new people. In my opinion, computers exert a positive influence on people as they can be employed for numerous purposes and are a valuable technological resource. They can save a significant amount of time. For example, if you have a [number] - page essay due the next day, it is undoubtedly easier and faster to type it out rather than write it by hand and risk making errors. When typing a letter or a paper, computers have [spell - check/grammar - check] features, which can indicate mistakes and save time.
1152	1155	1	1	Dear Readers, I recognize that some [Month] believe computers can impact people's lives. This is due to the fact that it leads them to refrain from going outdoors to engage in exercise and enjoy nature. In my perspective, individuals have the option to venture outside, exercise, and appreciate nature. Computers offer an abundance of information that can inspire people with ideas for various outdoor activities. They also possess the capability to download videos and other software that people can use to perform exercises and learn techniques. In my life, my parents and many other family members browse different websites online to discover activities we can undertake on weekends and seasonal events. Computers are extremely significant and life - altering. Without computers, some individuals would be unable to access an education. Doctors, police officers, and banks rely on computers for their work, which simplifies our daily lives. Based on my observations and understanding, computers have a positive impact on our lives. Although computers can have negative aspects, it ultimately depends on self - control and how they are utilized.
1153	1156	1	1	Computers are advancing at an unprecedented rate, and nearly everyone either owns or has owned a computer. I firmly believe that they confer substantial benefits upon society. One of the numerous advantages is that they enhance hand - eye coordination. Even when you are playing games, your hand - eye coordination is gradually improving. Hand - eye coordination is essential for sports such as baseball. When is hand - eye coordination most crucial? I find it most useful when playing hockey or baseball. Therefore, the next time you are using a computer, bear in mind that your hand - eye coordination is being enhanced. Another reason we benefit from computers is that they enable us to learn about distant places. Whether you are aware of far - off locations that you may or may not be able to visit, a computer can provide background knowledge. If you travel for business to a place about which you know nothing, what should you do? Simple! Use a computer to conduct research. For example, if you have to fly to [Location] and know nothing about it, use a laptop during the journey. By doing so, you will acquire some knowledge about the place. As is evident, laptops and computers are excellent tools for learning about foreign countries. Finally, computers are highly effective for learning new languages. Suppose you need to learn Spanish within a few weeks. What would you do? Download a free language - learning app. If you have limited knowledge of French and need a few words but don't have a dictionary, use a translator. When communicating with someone from [Location] and you don't understand their language, use an English - to - [African language] dictionary translation app on your computer. Computers offer numerous free translation applications, so if you don't know a language, simply use a computer to learn it. In conclusion, computers are used daily and greatly assist us, whether it's learning a new language or simply chatting with friends. They confer significant benefits on society.
1154	1157	1	1	"To the editor of the daily newspaper, I firmly contend that computers have a detrimental effect on people of all ages. In contemporary society, computers are being overused for privileges that we already possess. While people engage in random computer activities, they neglect physical exercise. Moreover, although email and social media platforms like Facebook are excellent for communication, people are constantly checking their emails instead of paying attention when their parents return home after a long day at work. As a result, people become so engrossed in the computer that children get distracted and forget to do their homework. Although computers are a remarkable invention, in today's society, there are numerous issues that are often overlooked. Firstly, people are not getting the necessary exercise because they are either playing on the computer or video - chatting with friends. Approximately [Number] of Americans are obese, so exercise should undoubtedly be a priority. However, the new websites and activities on the computer are hindering people from exercising. In addition, both children and adults are engaging in high - tech communication methods that waste excessive time. Computers offer numerous unnecessary activities that prevent us from exercising, as many people perceive these options and web pages as important. Indeed, computers are a necessary technology, but people are abusing it by immersing their entire lives in the virtual world instead of focusing on other aspects such as exercise and maintaining good health. Furthermore, computers not only detract from exercise but also consume time that could be spent with family. For example, [Time] when my dad returned home from a long day at work, he did not receive the warm hug he yearned for because everyone was preoccupied with their emails or what my sister's friend had posted on Facebook. Family is the most important part of one's life, and if computers are interfering, computer usage must be regulated. Which is more important to you, family or computers? I understand that you still interact with your family and give them hugs, but when you are chatting with your sister on Facebook even though she is in the next room, it is obvious that a change is needed. Computers affect you and those around you in more ways than you realize. Finally, computers not only disrupt family life but also interfere with schoolwork and work. Most children spend excessive time on the computer and neglect their homework. This is unacceptable. Children and teenagers are constantly playing games, socializing on Facebook, and video - chatting, only to realize later that they need to start their homework. A girl from [Person] said, ""[Time] I spent the entire afternoon on Facebook and then realized I hadn't started my [Subject] essay!"" This has happened to many people because computers are highly distracting and drain our mental energy. Moreover, I recall that yesterday I video - chatted with my friend for [Number] hours and didn't start my homework until [Time]! The influence of the computer on everyone is unacceptable. Without a doubt, computers have a negative impact on people. They prevent people from exercising and consume excessive time, which is both unbelievable and terrible. They also reduce communication with family, making it difficult to truly bond. As a result, people become overly attached to the computer and forget to complete their tasks. Overall, computers make life more stressful. Thank you for your attention."
1155	1158	1	1	"Dear newspaper, I am of the opinion that there are numerous reasons why computers are beneficial to people. Firstly, computers facilitate the maintenance of connections between friends. Secondly, they serve as excellent sources of knowledge. Thirdly, there are numerous team - based programs on computers that enhance teamwork and team - building skills. These are three of the many reasons why I believe computers have a positive impact on people. To begin with, computers are advantageous as they help keep friends connected. If you relocate to another town, attend a college far from home, or move due to work, especially if the distance is significant, you are likely to lose touch with your friends. However, computers can solve this problem. On social networking platforms such as [Platform], Twitter, and MySpace, you can easily search for and reconnect with friends from your previous location. You can catch up, reminisce about good times, and perhaps plan future meetings. [Percentage] of [People] have reconnected through social networking sites on computers. Experts assert that maintaining connections with your past is crucial for well - being and happiness. I have had a personal experience where a social networking site reconnected me with a [Friend]. When I was young, I had a [Friend] whose grandmother lived near my dad. After over a year of friendship, he moved to [Location]. I thought I would never hear from him again. Later that year, I also moved to a different town. Then, [Friend] searched for me on [Platform], and we reconnected. I discovered that he had moved back to my former hometown. This is the first reason I believe computers are highly beneficial to people. The second reason is that computers are outstanding sources of knowledge. If you need to obtain information without having to sift through books, a computer is the ideal solution. As long as you can find an accurate and reliable source, a computer is an incredible tool. You can search for almost anything and access a vast amount of information. Statistics indicate that you can find [Percentage] more information on a computer than in a book. Experts predict that books will soon become obsolete, and computers will reign as the primary sources of knowledge. This is the second reason why I think computers are beneficial to people. Lastly, computers are valuable because they offer many programs that enhance teamwork and team - building skills. By ""programs,"" I primarily refer to video games. Most computer games feature multiplayer modes that require a high level of teamwork. In these games, you must communicate and collaborate with your team to win. This is the third reason why I believe computers are beneficial to people. In conclusion, computers are beneficial as they help reconnect friends, serve as excellent knowledge sources, and enhance teamwork skills through various programs."
1156	1159	1	1	"Dear Local Media Newspaper, Although I comprehend why some individuals perceive computers and technology as detrimental to society, I firmly oppose this view. In my perspective, technology, particularly computers, can foster social connections and offer substantial benefits to students. Moreover, computers can yield time and cost savings.  Firstly, computers facilitate social bonding. One of my dearest friends relocated across the nation to @LOCATION1! As a result, face - to - face meetings became impossible, but I now engage in video chats with her via my laptop. Without this option, our friendship would likely have faded. A similar situation occurred with my grandmother. During Passover, our family traditionally gathers to celebrate, but due to her advancing age, we use video chat so she can share the occasion with us. It is truly a remarkable experience.  As previously mentioned, computers are advantageous to students. You may be thinking, ""I can understand that, but how does it apply to me?"" As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I sometimes forget to jot down assignments. In such cases, I use my laptop to access @ORGANIZATION1 notes.com. Without this resource, I would have received a zero on my homework. Evidently, computers are highly beneficial!  Have you ever been in a situation where you need something but lack the time to obtain it? Nowadays, numerous items can be ordered online, ranging from food to clothing and toys. Surveys indicate that over @PERCENT1 of average consumers make online purchases, saving on gas as they avoid driving.  In conclusion, I believe computers are useful and beneficial for people of all ages. They assist students with homework, help maintain family and friendship bonds, and offer convenience to busy adults. I am confident that as time progresses, more people will recognize these advantages."
1157	1160	1	1	"I firmly believe that computers exert positive influences on individuals. They enable connections with distant friends or family members, aid in discovering remarkable natural parks, and assist in locating local gyms or exercise equipment. The following discussion will elaborate on how these three aspects underscore the significance of computers in our society.  To begin with, computers play a crucial role in connecting people with their far - flung friends and family. A recent study reveals that @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have communicated with friends or relatives residing across the country via the internet. Another survey by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine indicates that the computer is the optimal means of staying in touch with loved ones. @CAPS9's best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 once told me, ""If the computer had never been invented, they would be like phantoms to me."" @CAPS6 depends on the computer to converse with his dear family. Clearly, computers are indispensable for reconnecting with distant friends and family.  How would you feel if you were passionate about nature but unable to find any extraordinary parks? I suspect it would be dreadful. Fortunately, all you need to do is enter ""amazing nature parks"" into a search engine, and within seconds, you'll obtain excellent results. Many people think that computers detract from the time spent enjoying nature, but I believe they actually enhance it. @CAPS9's sister adores nature and photography. However, she lost interest over time, saying, ""I grew weary of photographing the same local scenes daily."" I searched for nature parks on a search engine, and now she is traveling all over @LOCATION2 again. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert, claims that @PERCENT2 of people lose interest in nature because they are unaware of new places to visit. A nature magazine also concludes that the internet is the best way to discover nature. Evidently, without the internet, few people would possess the same love and enthusiasm for nature as they do today.  Everyone needs exercise. Currently, @LOCATION3 has a significant obesity problem. We need to attract more gym members and develop more exercise equipment, but how will people find out about these resources? Through the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 of gyms have websites accessible via the computer. ""@CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine states, ""The most effective way to recruit members is to create an online website."" @CAPS9's friend's dad recently joined a newly opened gym. He said, ""It was easy. I simply searched for local gyms on the computer.""  Connecting with old friends and distant family, finding great natural spots, and locating local gyms and exercise equipment are challenging tasks. However, computers excel at these functions. If reconnecting with loved ones, appreciating nature, and exercising are considered negative impacts on society, then what can be regarded as positive? In conclusion, computers have a multitude of positive effects on people, and their importance in our lives cannot be overstated."
1158	1161	1	1	To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 concern, today people of all ages are useing computers. Computers are a great way to do reports, talk to friends & family, & also to research things you @MONTH1 have needed to know. Kids in @ORGANIZATION1 have many projects to do & most of these projects involve writing a paper. Teacher have troble reading other hand writing so it would be helpful for the students to use the computer to print out a very neat paper. The computer has many ways that you can write that paper & now it will be very helpful. The near by libarry will always have extra computers students can use to write a papper. If you walk by a teenager on the internet, now a days you @MONTH1 find them on '@CAPS2'. '@CAPS2' is a website to talk to friends & relatives. Some of these relatives @MONTH1 live very far away or not have a phone to talk on, so you can talk to them here. Some people think '@CAPS2' is 'stupid' & can't be any good, because it takes away time for homework, but what if a @CAPS3 forgot to write down the homework? The @CAPS3 could go on '@CAPS2' & chat with a friend from @ORGANIZATION1 to get that home work. There are many search engines on the computer such as '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', or even the ever most popular '@ORGANIZATION2'. Most people use these web pages to research for papers, trips, or even just to find out random information. Many people want to go to @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 for @CAPS6, but don't know what to do when they get there. By going on one of the search engines they would find that in @LOCATION1 they could go to the @LOCATION1 zoo. In @LOCATION2 they could go to @CAPS7 world or the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 to learn all about @CAPS11 & how it is in a @CAPS9. Thank you for taking the time to read this & I hope you will look into what I said.
1159	1162	1	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 I see why some people think that computers and technology are bad for society, I on the other hand strongly disagree with them. In my eyes technology, especially computers can bring people together and computers are very benificial to @CAPS5. Also computers can save you time and money now. First off computers can bring people together. I had one of my best friends move across the country, all the way to @LOCATION1! and I don't get to see her so I now video chat with her on my laptop. and if I didn't have that opportunity then we probably wouldn't have stayed in touch with each other. That experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as well, my grandmother. Every year for passover the whole family comes to house to celebrate but because she is getting older we video chat so she can see the whole family together. It is wonderful experience. As I said before computers can be benifical to @CAPS5. You might be thinking ""@CAPS3 it can only understand that but I am a student at @ORGANIZATION1 and sometimes I forget to write an assignment down so I get my laptop and go to @ORGANIZATION1 notes. com, if that was have gotten a zero on the homework. See! Computers are very benifical! Have you ever been in a situation where you need something but you just don't have time? Well now many things can be ordered offline. You can get things from food to cloths and toys. Surveys have proven that over @PERCENT1 of average @CAPS4 order off of the computer and save money from gas because they don't have to drive. Overall, I think computers can be handy and helpful to all ages, @CAPS5 with homeworks, family and friends and adults who don't have a lot of time. And I think as years go by more and more people will start to realize that."
1160	1163	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive. Computers can help you connect with far away friends or family members, find great naturistic parks, and help you find local @CAPS8 or exercise equipment. These three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage. To start off, computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members. According to a recent study, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet. Another survey done by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one. @CAPS9 best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all of his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 told me, ""@CAPS5 the computer was never invented, they would be like ghosts to me."" @CAPS6 relies on the computer to talk to his loved family. Clearly, the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members. @CAPS10 would you feel @CAPS5 you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks? @CAPS9 guess is terrible. Luckily, all you have to do is type in ""amazing nature parks"" in a search engine. In about two seconds you should have fantastic results. Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature, but I believe that @CAPS11 enhances @CAPS11. @CAPS9 sister loves nature, she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery. However, she lost interest over time. She said, ""I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday."" I typed in nature parks on a search engine, and @CAPS9 sister is back to traveling all over @LOCATION2. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert says that @PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they don't know any new places to go. Also, nature in a @CAPS7 magazine concluded the best way to find nature, is the internet. As you can see, @CAPS5 @CAPS11 wasn't for the internet, barely any one would have the love and passion as most people do today for nature. Who needs excersize? Everyone. Currently, @LOCATION3 is extremely overweight. We need to enroll more @CAPS8 and create more exercise equipment, but @CAPS10 will people find out? Over the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 or @CAPS8 have a website which can be accessed over the computer. ""The best way to get members,"" @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine stated,"" is to create a website online."" @CAPS9 friends dad recently just joined a brand new gym that opened up three days ago. ""@CAPS10 did you find out about @CAPS11?"" I asked. ""@CAPS11 was simple, I just searched local @CAPS8, and @CAPS11 came up!"" Experts say that the computer restricts time to workout, but in all, truth, the computer is the key to the gym. Connecting old friends and faraway family, finding great nature spots, and finding local @CAPS8 and excersize equipment are three very hard things to do. However, these are three things the computer does very well. @CAPS5 reconnecting with loved ones, loving nature, and exercising are bad effects on society, then what is good?"
1161	1164	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am cognizant of the ongoing debate regarding technology, more specifically, computers. Computers are an invaluable, engaging, and even delightful piece of technology. They open the world to new individuals and locations, and limiting this access is unjustified. Computers are the keys to innovation and creation. When @ORGANIZATION1 conducted a study on computer usage, @PERCENT1 of participants stated that they obtained news, files, and even planned through the computer. Currently, @PERCENT2 of creations are being accomplished via the computer. This demonstrates the power of computers, enabling people to achieve feats once deemed impossible. Now, humans can disseminate information across the globe in mere seconds. Computers also foster business growth through advertising or work software. They are the key to unlocking new possibilities and options that were unattainable @NUM1 years ago. I understand that my opposition not only opposes computers but also wishes to restrict their use. This is unfair and potentially unconstitutional. They argue that people exercise less due to computers; however, @PERCENT3 of individuals, when asked if computers had negatively impacted their exercise, replied ""no."" One man stated, ""Because of computers, I learned new workouts and even found a great local trainer."" @CAPS2, you can appreciate that computers are not merely about games and toys; they allow people to grow, learn more, discover travel destinations, and assist in their exercise. Computers are an excellent tool for communication. Emails, @CAPS3, and other software enable people to communicate across the world. @CAPS2, as the world begins to innovate, communication is crucial. People can spread news in seconds; in fact, @PERCENT4 of news is now disseminated through the computer. New @CAPS4 Times and the Wall Street @CAPS5 have predominantly shifted their news to the internet, allowing people worldwide to access it. Work is also primarily conducted through the computer. People can send files, ship, and even place orders online. Even important business meetings are held via the computer, enabling all participants to join from their homes. Computers are essential for communication, work, and news. I hope you understand and consider my opinion. Computers are necessary for the growth of @CAPS2, a world that solves problems, communicates, and expands. That is why I believe there are no issues with computers."
1162	1165	1	1	Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1, I am penning this letter to convey that I believe computers are a prudent investment for several reasons. The following are some of the ways in which computers benefit society: they assist children with their homework, enable them to interact with friends, and provide entertainment when they are bored. At times, I find myself sitting at the kitchen table, attempting to complete my history homework, but I am unsure of the year of the Revolutionary War. @CAPS2, I retire to my room, power on the computer, and @CAPS6, I navigate to Google to search for the information I need. This also benefits parents, as when they are handling bills or other tasks, they are not disturbed, and the child can independently look up the required information. Finally, after completing all my homework, with the computer still on, I check who is online to chat with and ensure I haven't missed any assignments. Communicating with friends online helps maintain connections with those in other states or individuals one doesn't see frequently. This can facilitate the formation of new friendships or strengthen existing ones, reducing potential conflicts. Alright, no one is at home or online. @CAPS2, I think I'll relax, play some music, and perhaps take a nap. Alternatively, I can play the new Counter-Strike game I acquired! Yes, playing Counter-Strike. I had the least number of deaths on my team in that game! Alright, that's enough Counter-Strike for today. I think I'll play some music and lie in bed. Now that I have outlined all the benefits of computers, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, keep in mind that they can aid with homework, social interaction, and entertainment.
1163	1166	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, computers can be useful on occasion; however, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals believe that they are a waste of electricity. Overall, computers are not beneficial for daily life. When people use the computer, they often spend multiple hours on it. This means that they do not engage in sufficient physical activity, which can be detrimental to their health. Moreover, people tend to use this device obsessively, allocating more attention to the computer than to their families. It is well-known that exercise is vital. But what happens when we do not get enough? Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the @LOCATION1. Heart disease is often caused by obesity, which can result from a sedentary lifestyle. When using the computer, one is typically seated rather than moving, which slows down metabolism and reduces calorie burn. This is unhealthy for everyone, even those in excellent physical condition. Gaining weight is not the only potential harm to the body. When using the computer, one must stare at a screen illuminated by very bright @CAPS3 lights. After prolonged exposure, the eyes can experience the adverse effects of these lights. Many people compare it to staring into a flashlight for an extended period. Approximately @PERCENT1 of the students at our school wear glasses due to excessive computer use. This @PERCENT1 represents an increase of @PERCENT2 compared to before. Previously, the figure was around @NUM3. As mentioned earlier, people often use the computer for extended periods. What about family? They deserve more attention than a machine. Spending more time on the computer than with one's own family is unjust. In a survey, an average of @NUM4 out of @NUM5 individuals reported spending approximately eight hours on the computer for work and personal use combined, while spending only about an hour with their families. The results are truly shocking. Considering all these factors, ask yourself how useful the computer really is. While it is effective for quick research, it can also contribute to weight gain, lead to the need for corrective eyewear, and distance people from their family members. Ultimately, the computer is not very helpful.
1164	1167	1	1	Contemplate how the world would fare without computers. I contend that it would regress us by several eras. We rely on computers for communication and to acquire knowledge. Without them, our country would be severely handicapped. Some argue that computer use leads to insufficient exercise, limited appreciation of nature, and less time spent with family. However, computers can address these concerns as well. Communication is one of the most significant advantages of computers. Teenagers relish the opportunity to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 with each other while at home, as it is as instantaneous as face-to-face conversation. @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 is another popular communication tool. Company executives utilize @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 to disseminate @CAPS10, ensuring that everyone is well - informed. Additionally, there is a new video - chat feature that enables face - to - face communication with individuals on the other side of the globe. Computers are also a vast repository of knowledge. They host dictionary sites, history sites, and encyclopedias. One can explore any historical period and find dedicated websites. For instance, Wikipedia allows users to search for a specific topic and obtain a comprehensive web page of information about an object or person. Schools also leverage these sites to enhance students' knowledge. There are math sites, English sites, @CAPS3 studies sites, and (a science teacher's favorite) @CAPS4 @CAPS5, which provides in - depth scientific knowledge. There are numerous websites for language learning as well. A recent program called @CAPS6 @CAPS7, available on the computer, teaches languages as effectively as a human instructor. Some still claim that this is inadequate. They assert that people still need exercise, nature, and family time. Computers can facilitate all these activities. One can search for suitable workouts or find nearby hiking trails. There are websites (such as @CAPS8) where one can @CAPS9 @CAPS10, share pictures, play games, and video - chat with family members who may reside across the world. Despite the many reasons I have presented in favor of computers, there are countless more. They develop hand - eye coordination and offer various other benefits. One can check sports scores from the previous night or from @NUM1 years ago. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people, and everyone should own one.
1165	1168	1	1	"Dear newspaper writer, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They assist individuals worldwide in learning different languages, facilitate communication with friends globally, and simplify the process of writing and sending letters to colleagues or bosses who require reports by the end of the day. These are the three primary reasons for the positive influence of computers. Computers enable people to learn a new language without incurring significant costs. Unlike Rosetta Stone, which requires an expenditure of @NUM1 US dollars, online language - learning resources are free. The slogan of Rosetta Stone claims, ""I have spent less money than months of formal classes."" I believe their new slogan should be, ""We have a better learning company than anyone else."" This exemplifies how computers help people learn different languages. Computers also enhance communication with friends. One can use AIM, web - cast, or text, making it easier to stay in touch with friends online. The purpose of these technologies is to eliminate the need for long - distance travel and associated expenses when sharing important news. In conclusion, one can communicate with friends without substantial financial outlay. The third way computers benefit people is in professional communication. Employees can email their bosses to inform them that they are faxing their final report for a crucial interview for a new position at work. Computers make it easier for bosses to read reports, as they can be sent from anywhere in the world, such as Japan to Florida, in just @NUM2 minutes. This demonstrates the efficiency of computers in sending messages to bosses. In summary, the three main advantages of computers are the ability to learn a new language for free, easier communication with friends, and more efficient message - sending to bosses compared to traditional methods like phone calls. These are the reasons why computers have a positive impact."
1166	1169	1	1	To The Middlebury Paper, regarding the article on whether or not computers benefit society, my perspective is that they possess numerous advantages, rendering them a valuable asset in our towns' schools, homes, and businesses. Their benefits outweigh their drawbacks, and can one genuinely envision life without checking emails and staying abreast of societal developments? In schools, computers augment the learning experience of our children. For instance, students can study math facts online during math classes or learn about the skeletal system in health classes. Moreover, it is advantageous in terms of cost - saving. Instead of paying for your child to travel to Rome to learn about the Colosseum, you can let them explore it on the internet first to determine if the trip is truly worthwhile. Additionally, hand - eye coordination, an essential aspect of life, can be practiced through exercise games on a computer. This helps develop the coordination that the town's children will utilize throughout their lives. Educational benefits will only expand as technology progresses, so isolating children from it currently is a grave error. With computers, communication becomes seamless. Students can receive homework via email, saving time and allowing for more productive use of their schedules. The cost - effectiveness of computers is evident as, instead of paying for phone bills, tutors for your children, and cellphone bills, one can communicate via email and potentially save money. Keeping in touch with family is also simplified, as a single email can update all family members. The acceleration of communication through computers clearly offers benefits that no one would want to forgo. So, why make such a mistake? When addressing the issue, one cannot attribute people's lack of exercise to computers. People decide the extent of their physical activity, not computers. Computers do not dictate whether one maintains family relationships; in fact, they can facilitate connection. Spending time in nature is an individual's choice. All these so - called drawbacks cannot be blamed on computers, as it is people who determine their usage, not the computers themselves. All in all, I believe maintaining our current level of computer use is the optimal approach, because without it, communication and education will decline, and who can guarantee an increase in exercise? Ultimately, the choice lies with the computer user, not the computer. When used judiciously, computers contribute significantly to society.
1167	1170	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION3, it has come to our attention that certain members of society contend that computers are not beneficial. This stance stems from a lack of judgment and a narrow - minded perspective. Computers serve as lifelines for business workers, enabling them to complete all their tasks. These technological tools also ensure the efficient and effective dissemination of news regarding disasters or weather conditions. Moreover, they foster and sustain communication among family members and friends. In today's society, computers are indispensable, and eliminating them would be tantamount to depriving the body of oxygen, accompanied by numerous severe repercussions. First and foremost, approximately @PERCENT1 of all modern companies mandate that their employees work on computers. These technological marvels are not mere toys; rather, they are as essential to the working class as a #2 pencil is to a student taking an exam. @PERSON3, the owner of a small business, concurs. ""Our company designs software and relies heavily on computers. Many of our employees work remotely and must own computers."" The growth of computer technology should not be disparaged; instead, it represents a technological achievement that enhances the lives of many. Removing computers from the workplace would create chaos with numerous unappealing consequences. Adults are not the only ones whose jobs involve computers. Nowadays, most students' homework is online. Computers reduce the time required to write an essay and are a boon to students of all ages. @PERSON4, an eighth - grader at @ORGANIZATION1, exemplifies this situation. Every night, she has at least three hours of homework, and typically one hour of it requires a computer. However, this is not an issue as the computer shortens the time it takes for her to complete her assignments. She can rapidly type an essay or conduct research on a science topic, rather than resorting to a painstakingly slow, old - fashioned method. Furthermore, computers serve as gateways to the real world, especially for residents of @LOCATION1. Whether some people acknowledge it or not, @LOCATION1 is a somewhat insular area where people are unaware of events beyond their town. Computers disseminate news rapidly and open the eyes of @LOCATION1 residents to national and global issues. @PERSON2, another student at @ORGANIZATION5, states, ""When the earthquake occurred in @LOCATION3, my friends and I were at lunch. When we returned to class, our teacher was projecting the news via her computer onto the whiteboard."" If computers were removed, a vital source of knowledge would be cut off from both adults and children. Most importantly, computers facilitate communication between friends and family. Since calling is not always a viable option, computers offer a better alternative. Families can stay connected regardless of whether they have cell - phone reception or their location in the world. @PERSON1, a senior at @LOCATION1 @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION1, agrees. ""When I go to college next year, I'll be far away in @LOCATION2, and I want to stay in touch with my family. Through email and instant messaging, I can contact them even when it's inconvenient, as they don't have to respond immediately."" @PERSON1 makes a valid point. Computers provide the luxury of communication, which is crucial for maintaining @PERCENT2 of healthy relationships, as a study at @ORGANIZATION4 indicates. In conclusion, computers are remarkable devices that should be valued and not discarded. They are essential for workers and students and bring news to people in every corner of the world. Computers also enable friends and family to stay connected. Therefore, I urge you, readers of the @ORGANIZATION2, to advocate for the benefits of computers so that they are not removed from our society."
1168	1171	1	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, are you present? Can you hear me? Such issues never arise with computers. It has come to my awareness that there is a debate about the benefits of computers: should we embrace and advance them, or not? I firmly believe that computers are a necessity for the average person. They assist everyone and simplify life. Certainly, there are cellphones and other useful electronics, but can they always be relied upon? Computers are consistently dependable, whether for homework or other purposes. They facilitate seamless interaction without disruptions, enhance the learning process, and are safe when used judiciously. Without computers, it is difficult to envision the state of our society. To commence, computers enable individuals to converse with others located halfway across the globe. There is a plethora of applications to choose from, all of which are user - friendly. My personal preference is @ORGANIZATION2 email. I have family in @LOCATION1, which is an entire continent away. I could call them, but my phone bill would soar. How else can I maintain contact with my loved ones? Do you know how many others face the same predicament? A recent study reveals that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families in @LOCATION2 have relatives living far away. That accounts for @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population! Imagine if they had no access to computers. Phone companies would profit immensely, while ordinary families would struggle financially or, worse, lose all contact with their relatives. Do you desire such an outcome? Computers are easily accessible, allowing you to interact with loved ones, friends, or new acquaintances. It doesn't get any better than this! So, would you choose to sever family ties or stay connected via email and computer applications? If that is not convincing enough, computers simplify the process of learning new things and accomplishing tasks. As a student of @PERSON1, I know that other students and I need to type our homework at least three times a week. Just yesterday, I had to compose a response, a free - writing piece, and an entry for a history project. Imagine if we had to revert to using typewriters. Either homework would remain unfinished, or everyone would suffer from a severe lack of sleep. Both options are unacceptable. Additionally, computers are excellent for research. If you need to learn about a new country, explore distant colleges, or discover information about the world, simply turn to your computer. You can determine the most suitable college for you without leaving home or ""visit"" a new country without leaving town. You could read a newspaper, but consider this: where does the paper come from? Trees are sacrificed for it. Computers offer an easy, environmentally friendly alternative. If the previous two reasons have not persuaded you, perhaps this one will. Many people believe that computers are unsafe, and this may be partially true. However, if you are well - informed, like me, having learned about computer risks in school, you will know that this is not always the case. In our school, we are educated about the potential hazards of computers and how to prevent them. I'm certain that most schools do the same. In fact, nine out of ten students rate computers as an A+ in terms of safety. Everyone is aware of hackers, and we take precautions to avoid them. My parents claim that in over thirty years of using computers, they have never encountered any safety issues, and neither have I. ""@CAPS3 are only powerful if you allow them to be and cede control,"" says @CAPS4, an expert on the subject. So, if safety is your concern, there is no need to worry. The current and future generations are aware of the risks and know how to mitigate them. Let's recap. Are computers beneficial for communication? Undoubtedly. Are they the best means to learn new things easily? I believe so. Are they safe? Yes, when used properly. It wasn't phones, nor television; it's computers! I understand why some might think people should be outdoors, but cellphones and TV can also keep them indoors. At least computers don't dull the mind. I have presented my case. I support the use and advancement of computers. However, the choice is yours. Please spread the word about their benefits. It is the right thing to do."
1169	1172	1	1	An increasing number of individuals are utilizing computers; however, not all concur that this trend is advantageous to society. I am of the opinion that those who contend computers do not benefit society are correct. This stance is grounded in the fact that people need to engage in more physical activity, interact more with family and friends, and savor the joys of life. Allow me to elaborate on the reasons for my view. Firstly, individuals who are constantly engrossed in computer use need to increase their physical activity to maintain good health and strength. Failure to do so may lead to overeating and the accumulation of unwanted fat. In fact, some individuals do not exercise at all. Secondly, excessive computer use often results in reduced interaction with family and friends. People may find themselves arguing with family members when asked to step away from the computer. After such disputes, they may retreat back to the computer, which is not a healthy pattern. Prolonged periods of computer use are detrimental to one's well - being. Lastly, people should relish life. They should explore the world firsthand, socialize with family and friends, pursue higher education, and make the most of their lives. They should experience the world as it was before the advent of computers, iPods, and even cellphones. In conclusion, my conviction is based on the need for people to exercise more, interact with family and friends, and enjoy life to the fullest. I hope this clarifies my perspective.
1170	1173	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I am firmly of the belief that computers are highly beneficial to society. This is because computers can perform a multitude of tasks, such as facilitating research, enabling communication with others, and offering a variety of engaging games and websites. They serve as exceptional resources for any endeavor. Honestly, in a world without computers, I would be at a loss. Computers are akin to digital encyclopedias, housing virtually all the information one could seek. They possess databases and websites specifically designed to aid in research, just as they do. Suppose you have an essay due tomorrow and require prompt and reliable information. You can simply access @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, a computer database. You will obtain valid facts to assist you in finalizing your essay. Thus, you won't need to go to great lengths for research. Communication is another area where computers excel. For example, email and @ORGANIZATION1 are popular means of communication. With email, you can send a message and await a reply, while @ORGANIZATION1 offers instant responses. The latest innovation in communication is video - chatting, where the person you are chatting with can both hear and see your actions. This is particularly useful for families separated by a considerable distance. Computers assume various roles, and entertainment is one of them. The internet hosts numerous enjoyable gaming websites, such as @CAPS6.com, miniclips.com, and @LOCATION1. These websites can distract you from a bad day. You can also purchase computer games for your device. A highly popular game is The @CAPS7. This game revolves around your character and the life you choose for it. It can transport you to a realm where all your stress dissipates. In conclusion, computers enhance society in numerous ways, including research, communication, and entertainment. They are sophisticated tools that enrich people's lives. Computers handle complex tasks with relative ease and typically achieve success. Therefore, computers are truly an essential part of our lives.
1171	1174	1	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, are you aware that prolonged exposure to technology can potentially lead to cancer? Since their inception, computers have undergone continuous advancements over the years. People, particularly children, tend to overlook the risks associated with physical health, as well as the well - being of family and friends and even mental health. The obesity rate in @LOCATION1 has reached an all - time high. People may not realize that technology is to blame. @CAPS2, did you know that the average @CAPS3 teenager spends at least @NUM1 hours on computers? Consider all the calories that accumulate without physical activity. If people could limit their computer usage, they would reduce their risk of diabetes. Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases associated with technology, alongside obesity. @NUM2 @CAPS4 are diabetic, indicating that we are not at a safe health level. If you restrict computer use to @NUM3 hour a day and exercise for at least @NUM4 minutes a day, imagine how healthy you will become. You will have more energy, better mental focus, sleep will no longer be a problem, and you will be more physically appealing. Computers can also cause friendships to deteriorate. Cyberbullying is another significant issue. @NUM4 of students engage in cyberbullying. This means that friendships may suffer if individuals spend all day on the computer, and it can also have a negative impact on mental health. @CAPS2, are you aware that certain forms of cancer are caused by the radiation emitted by technological devices? Radiation can damage the brain, leading to Alzheimer's and other mental diseases that typically manifest in old age. Young adults in school have also become accustomed to texting. @PERCENT1 of students text, and @PERCENT2 develop poor spelling habits. @PERCENT3 accidentally write ""thru"", ""lazy"", or even ""native @CAPS5"" during school. This is evidence of technology's encroachment on mental faculties. As you can see, computers affect health, social interaction, and mentality. Therefore, please refrain from overusing technology."
1172	1175	1	1	"Dear individuals, computers have been in existence for a relatively short period, yet with each passing day, more people purchase and utilize them. While they serve purposes such as entertainment, education, and long - distance communication, they have also had a detrimental impact on people. Allow me to elaborate. Initially, when people start using computers, they find it enjoyable. They browse the @CAPS1, play games, and use them for work. However, as they continue to use them, they may become addicted. People are addicted to computers due to the allure of games and the ability to access the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all computer owners in this @CAPS3 are addicted to computers. This percentage is projected to increase to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Computer addiction can lead to severe problems. Some individuals have died as a result of excessive computer use, neglecting to eat and sleep. A recent newspaper report stated that a student at @ORGANIZATION1 was expelled for poor academic performance. His parents discovered that he was addicted to the game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4"", which is currently the most popular game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies suggest that @CAPS8 addiction is nearly as harmful as smoking addiction. My second reason for the negative impact of @CAPS8 on people is online bullying. People communicate via @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email, and many are subjected to bullying. A friend of mine recently received an email with hurtful words. Online bullying is more severe than in - person bullying because when you say something on the @CAPS8, your identity can remain anonymous. @PERSON1, a professor who has recently studied online bullying, states, ""Online bullying has become more severe than face - to - face bullying. People are more frequently threatened and exposed to offensive language."" If people do not put an end to it, online bullying and harassment will worsen. Moreover, individuals can be arrested for their online posts. My final reason for the negative impact of computers on people is that excessive computer use leads to a sedentary lifestyle. @CAPS8 usage contributes approximately @PERCENT3 to the prevalence of overweight individuals. On the @CAPS8, everything is more convenient. Instead of mailing letters, you can send emails. You can listen to music without having to physically operate a radio. You can purchase tickets, shop, socialize with friends, and have fun without leaving your seat. However, this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of computer users are either obese or overweight. People spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying the natural world. In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people, and parents should regulate their children's computer usage. A single @CAPS8 can give rise to numerous problems. So, if you suspect that you are addicted, try to create a daily schedule. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour at a time and take breaks between sessions. Addiction, online bullying, and weight gain are not the only issues associated with @CAPS8; there are many more."
1173	1176	1	1	Dear newspaper, I have noticed that an increasing number of people are using computers, and I find this truly remarkable as it enables people to communicate online. @CAPS5, they also offer computer - usage tutorials. Computers provide individuals with the opportunity to learn about distant places and people. As the most advanced technology, it is no wonder that people are embracing it. I enjoy spending the entire day on the computer, especially when I log in to @CAPS2 to engage in online conversations. For instance, some people use computers to communicate with family members who live far away. I often talk online with my cousin in @LOCATION2, as I haven't seen her for @NUM1 years. Therefore, I believe that online communication and computer usage are of great importance. Even my grandmother has @CAPS3 and uses it to chat with her family members. I do not consider computer usage to be a negative aspect, as it facilitates communication with family and friends. This is why I believe those who oppose computer usage are misguided. Secondly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination. My grandmother, despite her advanced age, has excellent hand - eye coordination. When she types on the keyboard, she presses the right keys accurately. I believe that computers have a positive influence on people. They also improve writing skills. For example, I love writing, and when I use the computer, I don't need to rely on other methods. It helps me improve my hand - eye coordination. Additionally, computers assist in locating distant places and people. On @ORGANIZATION1, you can find any street you desire. They also help you gather information about people. For example, if I have a project, I can find relevant information about people or places on @ORGANIZATION1. The computer is extremely useful as it allows you to access pictures of places and information about people. I firmly believe that it has a positive impact on people. Finally, I believe that computers bring significant benefits to society. Firstly, they enable online communication. @CAPS5, they enhance hand - eye coordination, which is beneficial for the brain and eyesight. They also improve hand movements. Secondly, they provide people with the ability to learn about distant places and people. For example, I had a project in @CAPS7 where I had to research forensic doctors, and I found all the necessary information on the computer. I believe that computers stimulate the brain and are a symbol of advanced technology. Therefore, I am convinced that they are beneficial to our society.
1174	1177	1	1	"I concur that computers have a negative impact on people, primarily because they lead to a reduction in physical activity. Excessive computer use not only impairs cognitive abilities but also diminishes the time spent with family and friends. Please allow me to explain the reasons for my stance. Firstly, excessive computer use results in less time dedicated to exercise, which can lead to lethargy and laziness. If one ceases to exercise, it can also affect their ability to run or even stand. As @PERSON1 states, ""Individuals who engage in regular exercise are better equipped to perform tasks, whereas those who do not may struggle."" Moreover, excessive computer use may cause individuals to miss out on enjoyable experiences due to their lack of motivation. Secondly, computers can erode knowledge. Prolonged computer use may cause individuals to forget what they have learned. Additionally, they may require tutoring because they are unable to concentrate. In extreme cases, excessive computer use can even cause individuals to forget the people they know and their place of residence. Finally, computers consume a significant amount of time that could otherwise be spent with family and friends."
1175	1178	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, as a student, I firmly believe that computers have numerous adverse effects on people. While many perceive computers as merely a new and useful technology, there is more to the story. The cyber world is fraught with various issues. Although computers are valuable for school research, work, and other essential tasks, they also have significant drawbacks. Nowadays, kids tend to be glued to their computers almost immediately after returning home from school. This often results in them neglecting their homework, projects, and important assignments, as they are easily distracted by the computer. Some parents are deceived by their children, believing that they are doing their homework, when in reality, kids are interacting with numerous strangers through social networks such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 @NUM1, @CAPS6, and others. When they decide to meet these strangers in person, many problems can arise, as not everyone is as amiable as they appear online. This highlights the potential danger of excessive computer use for children. Young children, pre - teens, and teenagers are exposed to a plethora of harmful and inappropriate content that is unsuitable for their age group. Another concern is that people spend the entire day on their computers, often consuming junk food and engaging in no physical activity. This leads to weight gain and poor physical fitness, which is a health concern for kids as young as @NUM2 and adults as old as @NUM3 and above. It ultimately results in an unhealthy lifestyle. Due to excessive computer use, people have less time to explore the world, exercise, socialize with friends, or spend quality time with their families. I also strongly advocate that computers or laptops should not be placed in a child's room. When children have unrestricted access to computers in their rooms, they may lock themselves away, stay up late, and have difficulty waking up early for school or work, often resulting in tardiness. This clearly demonstrates that computers are not always beneficial. To strike a balance between computer use and a fulfilling life, people can create a schedule to regulate their computer time, which may significantly improve their situation.
1176	1179	1	1	I am convinced that individuals who allocate excessive time to computers can adversely impact their health and the relationships they maintain with friends and family. Suppose you are engrossed in the computer, and a friend invites you to go outdoors. In that case, you are highly likely to decline because the computer commands your attention more powerfully than the prospect of going outside. This not only undermines your health but also strains your relationship with your friend. Similarly, if your family plans a movie - night for quality time, you might choose to stay home and be on the computer, which negatively affects your family relationship. Most people prefer to remain on the computer rather than engage in physical exercise. Consequently, this harms your health as, when you spend long hours on the computer, you will eventually feel hungry and keep eating. Since you are not exercising, you are prone to weight gain. You become sedentary and continue to consume food. Due to the lack of exercise and your mind being constantly preoccupied with the computer, you are at risk of falling ill. This is why a significant number of people are in poor health because of computers. Computers can disrupt your relationships with family and friends. Sometimes, a friend may ask you to go outside or work out, but you decline because you are on the computer, which damages your friendship. Or, when your family has a movie - night and you stay on the computer as they leave, it undermines your family relationship. Spending time on the computer can lead to sleepless nights. If you are playing an extremely engaging game on the computer and it is time to rest, but the game is so captivating that you forgo sleep. After a while, you become addicted and cannot stop playing. As a result, you will not get enough sleep, and if you have school, you will be unable to concentrate as you will be overly concerned about the game. This is why computers are not entirely beneficial. They can damage your health, disrupt your social life with family and friends, deprive you of sleep, and impair your ability to focus.
1177	1180	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1! Cease using that computer; it is @TIME1. However, Mom, I do not wish to stop; I am in the middle of a game. Does this dialogue seem familiar? Undoubtedly, it does. Every child has an inclination to play on the computer. Nevertheless, observing your child spending @NUM1 on the computer is not a favorable situation. In this regard, experts are definitely @PERCENT1 correct, as both children and adults are expending an excessive amount of time on the computer. These individuals can engage in other activities such as increasing their exercise, appreciating nature, and interacting with friends and family. Prolonged computer use is detrimental to health. Conversely, if someone disconnects you from the computer, you can achieve the well - toned physique you desire. There are three primary methods to get in shape. Firstly, taking a gentle jog every evening on your community track can transform your legs from being fatigued each time you ascend the stairs to being firm and capable of running multiple laps as a warm - up. Every year, my father takes me to the track in @DATE1 and times me for @NUM2 and @NUM3 yard dashes, the @NUM4 meter, and the mile. During the intervening months, I train until @DATE2, after which my father conducts another assessment. I engage in this training because I play baseball. Weightlifting is another effective way to get fit. Some fundamental exercises include bench - pressing, squatting, and dumbbell curls. There are more challenging exercises, but I will not elaborate on them. Once you feel that you are in good shape, apply all your training to a sport. Exercise is not the sole option. Appreciating nature is an alternative. Simply step outside if someone removes you from your computer. Absorb all aspects of nature, from the squirrels to the trees. In winter, relish the snow instead of remaining indoors @NUM1 playing computer games. However, if this does not appeal to you, then spend time with your family. Spending time with family is a worthwhile activity. Gather your family and plan an outing. You can attend a baseball game, visit a park, or go to the movies; anything that will divert you from the computer. This is my perspective on why people should exercise, appreciate nature, and spend time with their families instead of being on the computer @NUM1.
1178	1181	1	1	One young lady sits beside her computer, diligently completing her homework. Another young woman, also with her computer, engages in conversation with her friends. These girls are participating in activities that enhance the productivity of our world. I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. Computers assist people in developing hand - eye coordination, learning about distant locations, and communicating with others online. This is how computers contribute to the improvement of our society. Firstly, the computer can instruct us in hand - eye coordination. Through playing games, we can apply what we learn in real - life scenarios. For instance, a boy can play an online football game and then utilize the skills he has acquired in an actual football match. Hand - eye coordination developed on the computer can aid us in learning novel aspects of our society. We can employ this knowledge to make new discoveries and contribute to the betterment of the community as a whole. These skills also enable us to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Multitasking is a challenging endeavor, but with hand - eye coordination and the assistance of computers, it becomes more manageable. A second productive function of computers is facilitating learning. Some individuals are unaware of global events. The computer can direct us to news sources; it is essentially a vast repository of information. Another positive impact of computers on people is communication. Many individuals have accounts on Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, etc., and all these platforms can be beneficial. Tools such as Skype, video chat, AIM, and email allow people to converse online. Email is a medium through which numerous new ideas can be exchanged. You can not only engage in conversations but also conduct business, send pictures, invitations, and announcements. Schools, offices, and companies worldwide utilize these tools, which not only enhance society but also improve the world. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people globally. They can enhance hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning about far - off places, and assist people in communicating. That one girl doing her homework can achieve an A, and the girl chatting on her computer can log off to spend time with her family.
1179	1182	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am of the view that computers and advancing technology are advantageous to society as they can aid in the development of hand - eye coordination, offer an effortless means of learning about distant places and cultures, and enable individuals to manage and utilize their time more efficiently. Firstly, every individual requires hand - eye coordination; otherwise, one might throw a ball in the completely wrong direction or get struck in the face by it. Computers also contribute to children's education by helping them explore and learn about far - off locations. For example, if a student is studying @PERSON3 @LOCATION1 in their @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class, @PERSON1 in @CAPS4 class, or perhaps @PERSON2 in music class, rather than retrieving an old, dusty biography book, it would be more convenient to search for them on a search engine. Lastly, computers are beneficial to both working and stay - at - home parents. If you need to contact a particular person or business promptly, you do not have to rely on the phone book, which may not contain the information you need. Instead, you can visit @NUM1.com, enter a last name or business name, and you are all set. Additionally, if your child is being a nuisance, screaming and running around the house, you can set them up with an educational game so that you can complete your household chores. These are three of the most crucial reasons why I believe computers are beneficial to society. They are the development of hand - eye coordination, the improvement of learning methods, and the saving of time for ordinary people.
1180	1183	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers have a detrimental impact on people for three reasons. Firstly, they can severely damage your eyesight. Secondly, they pose a safety risk if there are young children in your household. Finally, if you are constantly on the computer, you will rarely have the opportunity to interact with your family and friends. The first reason computers have a negative impact on people is that they can cause significant harm to your eyes. If you are constantly fixated on a computer screen, you are at risk of going blind. Moreover, poor eyesight can lead to serious head injuries simply due to the strain on your eyes. The second reason is that computers are not safe when there are young children in the home. For example, you might be watching an adult - oriented movie that is inappropriate for children, which can have a negative influence. It also has a negative impact on people because you will have less time for other activities. If you have a young child in the house, they may be exposed to inappropriate content or constantly be in the vicinity of the computer and may accidentally hear or see something unsuitable. The third reason computers have a negative effect is that if you are always on the computer, you will miss out on valuable time with your family and friends. You will never get to experience the joys of social interaction. When you are overly focused on the computer, you neglect your relationships. So, it is essential to keep a close eye on young children when they are in the same environment as the computer. And ultimately, you should disconnect from the computer and spend time with your family and friends.
1181	1184	1	1	"In contemporary times, computers have emerged as an indispensable component of business, education, and recreation, conferring substantial benefits upon our society. Firstly, they facilitate a superior educational experience, and concurrently, serve as an excellent medium for interpersonal communication. Moreover, they cultivate hand - eye coordination, a skill applicable in daily life.  My initial contention is that computers enhance educational attainment. For instance, the social studies textbooks in our school still refer to @LOCATION3 as the @LOCATION1. Computers offer a reliable means to access up - to - date global information. As @CAPS2 @PERSON2, an eighth - grade teacher, states, ""With our outdated school textbooks, the @CAPS1 is our primary source of information."" Through computers, one can explore distant locales without leaving the comfort of home.  In addition to their educational value, computers are an outstanding form of communication. I recall when I was in @NUM1 grade and my father was on a business trip overseas. Due to the limitations of long - distance phone calls, we relied on computers to stay connected, which alleviated my sense of his absence. Using a computer for communication also results in cost savings. According to @CAPS2 @PERSON1, an electronics expert, ""One can save over @MONEY1 annually by using the @CAPS1 instead of a cell phone for communication.""  Finally, computer usage improves hand - eye coordination. The act of typing on a keyboard steadily enhances hand dexterity. A recent poll in the @LOCATION2 times by @CAPS3 reveals that ""@PERCENT1 of computer users exhibit greater coordination throughout the day compared to non - computer owners."" In today's world, hand - eye coordination is essential. Wouldn't it be advantageous to be able to use your hands without having to look at them?  In conclusion, computers are beneficial to society and all their users. They are a valuable asset that @CAPS4's require for education and business. Thank you for your attention."
1182	1185	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, it is a well - established fact that people are fond of computers. They are akin to an alluring and irresistible entity. Contrary to popular belief, computers are highly advantageous for our daily lives. One can engage in communication, play @ORGANIZATION1, listen to music, watch movies, and even learn a language using computers. In every aspect, the computer is far from being detrimental.  @ORGANIZATION1 are enjoyable and aid in relaxation. However, in the present era, traditional @ORGANIZATION1 no longer evoke the same level of joy as they did in one's youth. Computer @ORGANIZATION1 have emerged as their substitutes. Imagine playing baseball with a friend residing miles away while still being a child in @LOCATION1 or embarking on an exercise adventure. Computer @ORGANIZATION1 have transcended boundaries, offering a more immersive experience, similar to the iconic ""You got mail"" moment.  Many individuals, in fact, millions, hear this phrase multiple times a day. It is an alert indicating the receipt of an email. @CAPS4 are messages transmitted over the @CAPS7 at a speed surpassing any other service. Instead of waiting @NUM1 days for a letter, one can send a message to friends within minutes. Microsoft @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and other electronic messaging systems represent a superior form of communication, enabling us to interact with the world.  Although it may seem whimsical, if one desires, they can send a message to anyone with a message box. Suppose you wish to watch a particular movie but do not own a copy. With a computer equipped with a disc drive, you can watch any @CAPS6. Even better, you can download movie media available on the @CAPS7 and watch them with a simple mouse click.  Computers are replete with gadgets and accessories that simplify our lives. It is highly unlikely that @ORGANIZATION1, movies, or @CAPS4 cannot be found on a computer. They are the ideal tools in modern society."
1183	1186	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1: There is a divergence of opinion regarding the impact of computers on society. While some believe they are beneficial, others perceive them as overly consuming. Personally, I am convinced that computers contribute positively to society. They foster hand - eye coordination, facilitate social interaction, and enable online chatting.  I suspect that your job necessitates computer usage, and you may even own a personal computer for chatting with friends, as I often do. Another passion of mine is sports, particularly softball. In softball, hand - eye coordination is crucial for accurately swinging at the ball. When a pitcher throws, one must hold the bat at the correct angle and track the ball to determine the optimal time to swing. If children develop good hand - eye coordination through computer use, they may be more inclined to join local sports teams and perhaps even travel teams.  Do you enjoy traveling? I do, and I gather information about destinations by researching them on the internet. Approximately three years ago, I planned a vacation to @LOCATION1. Since I had never been there before, I looked it up and discovered numerous tourist attractions and ""packages"" that allowed swimming with dolphins. I was thrilled to go and had a wonderful time. Had I not conducted the research, I would have been unaware of these enjoyable activities.  One of the primary reasons I appreciate computers is the ability to chat with friends online. @CAPS2 is a popular online platform that most people have. Some use it to view pictures, while I use it to chat with friends. One evening, while chatting with a friend, she reminded me that we had science homework due the next day. I thanked her and promptly completed the assignment. This example illustrates how online chatting can help students stay on top of important tasks, potentially improving grades by @PERCENT1.  In conclusion, society stands to benefit significantly from computers. They enhance hand - eye coordination, provide access to information about distant places and people, and enable online communication. It is difficult to envision a society without computers."
1184	1187	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, have you ever utilized a computer? More than @PERCENT1 of the population believes that computers contribute to societal progress, making people more intelligent and technologically advanced. Computers facilitate learning and enable individuals to maintain contact with family and friends. Although they can be somewhat addictive, most people are capable of self - restraint.  Computers are remarkable tools for exploration. Websites such as search engines, dictionaries, and @CAPS1 offer valuable resources for learning about the wonders of the tropical @LOCATION1. By providing easy access to knowledge - enhancing tools, computers empower individuals to advance in various aspects of life. For example, scientists can develop new theories and make discoveries using computer technology.  Computers also feature websites and programs that facilitate communication with loved ones. As @PERSON1 explains, ""I have reconnected with many high - school friends through email and Facebook on the computer. It is an excellent way to stay in touch."" Social media platforms like Facebook and MySpace help people find and maintain contact with family and friends. It is evident that many people would feel isolated without the ability to connect with friends online. Thanks to computers, people can lead more vibrant and fulfilling social lives.  However, it is important to acknowledge that computers can be addictive. I am aware that some individuals may develop computer addictions. Nevertheless, I believe that people are capable of making responsible decisions. If someone chooses to spend excessive time in front of a computer, it is their prerogative. No one should be restricted from using computers, as it would be a violation of personal freedom.  In fact, the vast majority of people recognize that computers are a beneficial and remarkable technological resource. Only @NUM1 out of @NUM1,000 people worldwide are addicted to computers, indicating that computers are far from being overly addictive.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. They educate, facilitate communication, and are not overly addictive. Therefore, they are highly beneficial to the world, its inhabitants, and technological advancement."
1185	1188	1	1	In my opinion, computers are on the verge of becoming a significant issue in our lifestyles. They are merely a material possession that everyone seems to possess and benefit from, yet the actual benefits are questionable. This technology is surreptitiously eroding people's freedom and willpower, often without their awareness. It is evident that change is necessary.  Firstly, computers serve as a distraction in our daily lives. It is reasonable to admit that we do not require such distractions. They prevent us from engaging in essential activities, such as exercise. Everyone desires to shed excess weight, but instead, they opt to browse websites or chat with friends. In essence, it is a lazy form of distraction. Would you truly sacrifice your health for something as materialistic as a computer? If we continue this trend, more than @PERCENT1 of the currently fit and healthy population will become obese. We need to address this problem promptly, perhaps by reducing the promotion of websites on @CAPS1.V networks or implementing a computer - shutdown week to encourage people to enjoy the outdoors.  Secondly, have you ever found yourself asking your children for assistance with using a computer? This is a concerning sign. Our future leaders are already overly engrossed in online games, email, and instant messaging. It is clear that they are spending an excessive amount of time online. This is a worrying trend as more and more children are submitting less schoolwork each year because they prefer to chat with friends or watch online videos. This is a critical period in their lives, and they need to acquire knowledge to secure a stable future. Instead of making a daily habit of going online, they should develop habits such as completing homework regularly.  In summary, numerous aspects of our lifestyles need to change, whether it pertains to schoolwork or weight management. It would be advisable to reduce our computer usage to minimize distractions and focus on living a more fulfilling life that does not revolve around a computer screen.
1186	1189	1	1	As substantiated by @PERSON2, within the realm of the @CAPS1 domain, over @PERCENT1 of children possess either desktops, laptops, or some form of internet access. What are your thoughts on this phenomenon? In my view, computers are encroaching upon people's time, particularly that of children, and impeding their ability to complete their work. Moreover, computers not only facilitate communication with friends but also give rise to @CAPS5 bullying. Finally, @CAPS1 devices are also exacerbating parental stress as they entail an additional internet bill. Nowadays, children return home, change, and immediately log onto the computer to chat with friends and listen to music. This may seem appealing until their report cards arrive, revealing that they are failing half of their classes. I recall when my friend @CAPS3 would return home, change, eat, and promptly log onto the computer. As the end of the year approached, she realized she had two issues: she was gaining weight and failing all her classes. She recognized that excessive computer use was unnecessary, so for the next month and a half, she reduced her computer time, completed her homework, and this experience convinced me that children should moderate their @CAPS1 usage. As proven by @PERSON3, over @PERCENT2 of children have either been cyberbullied or engaged in @CAPS5 bullying. This occurs when children are unsupervised or become bored and seek to pick on others. When people inquire of @PERSON1 about a solution, she suggests confiscating the @CAPS1 devices. I remember reading on newchannels.com about a young girl who was @CAPS5 bullied. This incident demonstrates that children worldwide can be victims of cyberbullying at any moment.
1187	1190	1	1	Dear local newspaper, computers are a prodigal expenditure of time! Those who claim they are beneficial often use this as a pretext. Some assert that computers are useful for research and communication. However, both of these functions can be accomplished without a computer. Computers are merely a money - squandering distraction that hinders one's quality of life. People squander hours on computers conversing with others. This is unnecessary; one can use a phone instead. A study has shown that phone conversations are more cost - effective than using a computer. In this economic climate, why not save money while achieving the same outcome? Moreover, when using a computer, communication is often limited to typing, which can be perilous. One can never be certain of the true identity of the person on the other end. Why take such a risk when a phone is a safer alternative? Using a computer is akin to smoking; it is highly addictive! People spend hours on computers daily and neglect physical exercise. Merely sitting and moving one's hands does not burn calories effectively. This is a grave issue! Obesity rates are already escalating due to the proliferation of fast - food establishments, and computers are exacerbating the problem. Alarmingly, some parents are indifferent. Some children spend @NUM1 hours a day on the computer, and their parents do not encourage them to go outside. Children require motivation to be active; otherwise, they will become increasingly sedentary and overweight. We must form a group to address this issue; otherwise, @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 population will become obese. Another excuse proffered by computer enthusiasts is that they use computers for country research. While this may be true, there are alternative methods. For instance, one can ride a bike to the library and borrow a book. This way, one can burn calories while acquiring the same knowledge. Additionally, not all information on the internet is reliable, whereas books offer more trustworthy content. Although it may take a month or two for computer addicts to break free, if we act now, we can effect change and curtail computer overuse. Computers are a waste of money. One can easily live without them, and the world would be a better place without their excessive presence. People are being indolent and concoct excuses to justify their computer use. Spending @NUM1 hours a day on a computer precludes the creation of family memories. All one will remember is the time spent in front of the screen, and surely no one desires such an outcome.
1188	1191	1	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, the question of whether @CAPS2 computers have positive or negative effects on people is a topic of much debate. I firmly contend that they have detrimental effects. My stance is based on several reasons. Firstly, individuals allocate more time to computer use than to physical exercise. Secondly, while some argue that computers enhance hand - eye coordination, sports and play can achieve the same result. Finally, although people claim that computers aid in learning about distant places and people, books serve the same purpose. Despite the belief of many that computers have positive effects, the reality is that they are more harmful. To begin with, people spend an inordinate amount of time on computers instead of engaging in physical activity. They prefer to stay indoors and play online games rather than participate in outdoor sports such as tag. During a talk, it was stated that ""in @LOCATION1, a significant number of people are overweight,"" and the global obesity rate was comparable to that of @LOCATION2. Therefore, I advocate that people should abandon their computers and engage in exercise. Secondly, the assertion that computers teach hand - eye coordination is unfounded, as sports can also develop this skill. Instead of sitting at a computer to learn hand - eye coordination, one can be outdoors, having fun while acquiring the same ability. Finally, while some claim that computers are used to learn about far - off places and people, books are a more reliable source. People often look up information on the computer but quickly switch to playing games. Moreover, some online information may be inaccurate, as websites are frequently hacked and altered. In contrast, books cannot be hacked; the only way to change a book is to rip out pages, which is a waste of money. Thus, I believe that books are more dependable. Now is the time to make a decision. Are the effects of computers positive or negative? I am convinced that computers have a negative impact on people. Other activities can teach excellent hand - eye coordination, and there are better sources of information about other places than computers. Most importantly, people should prioritize exercise over computer use. It is now your turn to feature this on the front page of your newspaper and inform the world."
1189	1192	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I am writing this letter to express my perspective on the impact of computers on people. I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence. Firstly, they provide the opportunity to learn about diverse people and places across the globe. Secondly, computers foster unity within the nation and on a global scale. Lastly, they can assist in organization and enhance job prospects. To elaborate on my first point, when working on a school project about a famous individual or a distant location, a computer can offer more comprehensive information than a book. For example, if I want to know the distance between my location and a particular place or the local weather, all I need to do is enter the query into a search engine, and numerous websites will provide the answers. Additionally, if I am unable to draw a picture for a biography project, I can simply search for images of the person on a search engine. Moving on to my second point, computers promote unity. Consider social networks such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, which have millions of users with whom one can interact. Moreover, platforms like the @ORGANIZATION1 webcam enable face - to - face communication. Recently, when earthquakes occurred in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, computers allowed us to quickly spread the news to family and friends, encouraging them to offer support. Finally, computers are ubiquitous in the workplace. There are few jobs that do not require computer skills. Therefore, proficiency in using computers is essential for securing employment. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits, including global learning, unity, and career advancement. Their positive impact on people is undeniable.
1190	1193	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, in recent times, computers have been regarded as a distraction and an unnecessary device. However, I firmly believe that they offer a plethora of advantages to everyone, enabling us to comprehend subjects that were previously inaccessible. Some claim that computers make people lazy and physically unfit, but this depends on individual choices. One can easily engage in social activities with family and friends if they so desire. Moreover, computers are becoming increasingly important for learning, making information more accessible than ever before. The most prevalent use of computers today is communication. Many websites are designed with the primary purpose of facilitating interaction. Computers are an indispensable part of our future, neither harmful nor superfluous. Recently, we have witnessed the remarkable utility of computers in various fields, from learning and researching new knowledge to collecting data for disease treatment and operating machinery. They have become an integral part of modern jobs. Almost all content published or presented to the public has passed through a computer. People rely on computers for both work and learning. For instance, if one has a job that involves printing a paper regularly, computers are used to edit and compile the content before printing. Therefore, basic computer skills are essential for both new and common jobs. There are rumors that computers are time - consuming and unhealthy. However, computer use is a personal choice. One can choose to spend time with loved ones, go to the gym, or take a vacation without a computer. While computers are entertaining and offer a wide range of activities, they are not as essential as air or water. One can live without using a computer for a week, engaging in activities such as walking, reading, or socializing with family. If one is concerned about excessive computer use, taking a break is advisable. Computers are also valuable in education. In @CAPS2, students use computer labs to learn reading and other programs, write essays, conduct research, and create projects. They are a useful tool in the academic environment. The most significant function of computers today is communication through websites like YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, etc. These platforms allow people to share ideas, communicate with distant friends and family without incurring high phone bills, and stay informed about politics, news, and weather. In conclusion, computers are a vital and useful part of our daily technology. They are only unhealthy or time - consuming if we allow them to be.
1191	1194	1	1	"Letter addressed to the @CAPS1: I dissent from the so - called ""experts"" who assert that computers can exert negative influences on individuals. The notion that one socializes less with family and friends is a feeble argument. Social networking platforms such as @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 enable @CAPS22 with all your friends. @CAPS4 and other online games assist you in encountering new individuals who could be hundreds of miles distant from you! Twitter is useful when you wish to convey something briefly, like ""@CAPS5 to @LOCATION1"". @CAPS18 allows you to converse with friends, comment on their videos, and subscribe to them. Moreover, it offers hours of entertainment at no cost. Computers can also present engaging games and amuse users. There are numerous free games, like @PERSON1, which possess endless possibilities. @PERSON1 (developed by @CAPS6) claims to be the most popular @CAPS7 (@CAPS8 @CAPS9 Online @CAPS10 - playing @CAPS11) on the web. You can enhance combat skills: attack, defense, strength, ranged, and magic. Or you can improve skills such as wood - cutting, prayer, farming, fishing, mining, and cooking. @PERSON1, similar to most @CAPS4, features quests of varying difficulties. For instance, in one quest, you must slay a demon, while in another, you simply need to find a missing cat. There are over @NUM1 quests, and there are never fewer than @NUM2 people playing simultaneously. Some other notable @CAPS13 games are @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15, @CAPS16 of @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1. As is evident, the computer has an impressive array of entertaining @CAPS11 for all age groups, not to mention sites like @CAPS18 or addictive games. Computers do not genuinely impede exercise. That is a personal decision, so you must choose between @CAPS2 or the basketball court. It is akin to stating that before the advent of computers or video @CAPS11 consoles, a @CAPS20 board prevented kids from exercising. The computer does not actually prevent us from exercising. It is our mindset and judgment that do. If you have poor judgment, you would remain indoors all day tweeting and @CAPS21. With a strong mind and willpower, you can overcome a bad decision and engage in sports or visit the gym. All that is required is good judgment. To recapitulate what I have stated, @CAPS22 is abundant on computers, and there are numerous options on how to achieve it. Many sites entertain us, and we should make use of that. Not to mention you can purchase games like @CAPS16 of @CAPS17 or @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15 for your @CAPS13! Computers do not actually hinder exercise; all it takes is good judgment to rise from that chair and exercise."
1192	1195	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, envision @CAPS4 having every conceivable piece of knowledge readily accessible and @CAPS4 having an inexhaustible source of information within the confines of your own residence. Would you not desire to have all of this perpetually? The subsequent question then is, do computers have positive impacts on individuals? I firmly believe that computers do confer benefits upon society. Firstly, computers impart hand - eye coordination. The primary means is through typing. When commencing to type, one initially glances at the keys, but eventually, one memorizes the locations of all the keys. Additionally, computer games instruct hand - eye coordination. Is it feasible to win a game if one is not looking at the screen? When computers teach hand - eye coordination, this skill can be applied to other activities as well. For example, it is undoubtedly necessary in sports and more. Specifically, in baseball, without good hand - eye coordination, one would be unable to catch the ball or strike it when swinging. Hand - eye coordination is of great significance. Secondly, computers endow people with the ability to acquire knowledge about places and individuals. When people are deliberating on when to take a vacation, they turn to the internet. They seek to know what there is to do. Why would one travel to a place if they have no prior knowledge? Many individuals utilize the internet to conduct research on other countries. When the eighth - grade students were preparing reports, they sourced their information. Eighty - seven percent of them used the internet. Finally, some individuals claim that computers detract from interaction with family and friends. However, computers actually enable you to communicate with family and friends across the globe. Would it not be wonderful to connect with your loved ones in a different state or country? The primary mode of online communication is @CAPS5 - mail or @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These facilitate sending a message to someone more rapidly and effortlessly. It is far easier to remember someone's @CAPS5 - mail address than a phone number. Why settle for mere conversation when you can actually see the person? It would be as if they were present in the room with you. Computers are an excellent means of communicating with someone. Why delay any longer? Computers are a superb way to refine your hand - eye coordination skills. You can research distant people and places to gain insights into life around the world. Most importantly, you can communicate with family and friends online via @CAPS8, @CAPS5 - mail, or @CAPS10. Undoubtedly, computers benefit society. So, go ahead and share this information with others to convince them of the positive aspects of computers.
1193	1196	1	1	Computers do not exert a negative influence on individuals. They facilitate maintaining contact with family and friends, aid in school - related work, and allow for the enjoyment of video games and the exploration of music. Computers can keep you connected with family and friends. You can discover the locations where they reside, inquire about their well - being, and learn about their recent activities. It enables you to send emails and interact with friends who have relocated to distant places. Computers also assist with schoolwork. They help you find answers to questions that a teacher might pose. They support you in writing reports for any subject. Moreover, there are numerous websites that you can visit to obtain assistance with a book. These sites can also direct you to your school's website. In this way, if you forget where your homework is, you have a place to check. Even if you were absent, most papers and questions are available on the internet, allowing you to complete the homework. Another common use of computers is to watch movies, whether they are old classics or new releases. Computers serve a similar purpose for music. Anything from @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 to country and back can be found. New @CAPS3 shows and music can all be located. Video games are also highly popular. Many people play these because they can connect with friends. They can converse with friends they haven't seen in a long time and avoid boredom. If it is raining outside and there is nothing to do, there are games available. And if you want to talk, there is always someone there to listen and potentially become your friend. Therefore, computers are not a waste. They can keep you in touch, help you make new friends, eliminate boredom, and enable you to search for everything from @CAPS4 shows, music, and movies.
1194	1197	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I posit that it would be more beneficial for people to venture outdoors, engage in exercise, relish nature, and interact with their family and friends. If individuals go out with their family and friends, perhaps more teenagers and adults would be in better physical condition and enjoy better health. Imagine waking up, having breakfast, and then heading to the park to exercise with your loved ones. I believe that a significant number of family members and friends spend an excessive amount of time on computers or laptops. If they are engrossed in the computer for too long, they will be disinclined to go outside and exercise with their friends. An increasing number of people are using computers. However, not everyone concurs with this view. In my opinion, it would be more prudent to resolve this issue by encouraging everyone to go outside and breathe in fresh air with their family and friends. Nevertheless, some individuals do not consider this the appropriate course of action. Those who advocate for technological advancements believe that computers have a positive impact on people. I, however, do not subscribe to this view as I believe one needs to go outside and interact with others. If one wishes to use the computer, it can be done, but I think it should be for a limited duration. Some people have business - related work that requires them to use the computer daily. In such cases, they should be permitted to use the laptop or computer. However, if you are a teenager, you should only use the computer when necessary, such as when you need the internet for research or to write a paper. If you use the computer merely to chat with friends, it is a waste of time. At least, that is my perspective. I believe that as a teenager, one should focus on studying and completing homework rather than being on the computer. This is because it is crucial to ensure that your grades do not cause you to fail in your academic and life pursuits. Hence, it is essential to avoid spending all day on the computer chatting with friends as it could lead to failure in life. One should only use the computer briefly to talk to friends. That is why I believe it is inappropriate to spend all your time on the computer. Step outside and enjoy the outdoor weather with friends and family members. I hope that teenagers and adults will start going outside from now on as it would be beneficial for everyone, and everyone would be healthier. If they try this approach, I promise it will work, and they will be healthy and free from self - deprecation.
1195	1198	1	1	Dear Whom It May Concern, I understand that those who do not use computers wonder how people are affected by them. I believe that computers are superior to newspapers. Newspapers can provide news, weather information, details about houses for sale, TV listings, job opportunities, and other content, much like @CAPS1, but computers offer a virtual experience. Computers confer benefits upon society for certain reasons, yet it depends. Sometimes, computers can have negative impacts on people, but they also teach people to read, write, type, learn, and more. With computers, we can communicate with others, view pictures of people we know, and search for information we need. They are helpful when using MapQuest to find our way around. A negative aspect of having computers with internet access is the presence of certain websites that are not age - appropriate. Children may access websites that their parents are unaware of, looking up boys they met on @CAPS1. There have been cases where people make plans with someone they met online, and the next day, that person goes missing. I think if experts were to remove computers, most kids would be angry and disappointed, and they would have nothing else to do but play video games and go outside. These are my opinions.
1196	1199	1	1	Computers are instrumental in every individual's life. Through them, novel knowledge can be acquired. They offer a means to communicate with others and significantly simplify the writing process. Overall, they exert a beneficial influence on the world. Technology enables everyone to explore new subjects. When a query is entered into @ORGANIZATION1, results appear within seconds. By clicking on these, the required information is presented. The computer is also invaluable for research papers. The internet facilitates a more comprehensive final draft. Learning positively impacts academic grades or work performance. It is always advantageous to be able to contact anyone desired. With the computer, individuals can @CAPS1, engage in conversations on @CAPS2, or even have a face - to - face conversation with a loved one via webcam. On @CAPS2, pictures can be added, allowing those unable to attend an event to visualize it. Webcams connected to the computer enable people to interact directly with someone they may not have seen for months. These are all compelling examples of why computers have a positive impact on humanity. Writing papers can be a laborious and monotonous task. On the computer, one can type without the need for an eraser to correct spelling mistakes, as these are detected by spell - check. In this way, no points are deducted for incorrect spellings. Sometimes people @MONTH1 have illegible handwriting. These challenges can all be resolved by using a typing program on the computer. Therefore, computers must have a positive effect on people. They impart new knowledge, allow people to connect with those far away, and can also simplify the paper - grading process. This concludes that computers benefit the society we live in today.
1197	1200	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 it has come to my attention as to why, on a pleasant sunny day, someone would choose to remain indoors. The unfortunate reality is that an excessive number of individuals are squandering their time indoors on their computers instead of relishing the day. Computers are having a detrimental impact on the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 population. We are approaching a juncture where our entire world may become utterly chaotic if no action is taken. Firstly, the @LOCATION1 has the highest proportion of obese children globally. Generally, children should be actively running around to burn calories, and even some teenagers should do so. Instead, kids are seated in front of computer screens, engrossed in virtual games, emails, and the like. Even performing household chores could significantly reduce the obesity rate compared to sitting idly, staring at a screen all day. This leads me to my next point. Prolonged exposure to the bright, flashy lights of a computer is harmful to the brain; computers cause @NUM1 out of @NUM2 child seizures annually. The radioactivity emitted by a computer can also severely harm one's health by causing cancer. Since there is currently no cure for cancer, every instance of excessive computer use puts one's life at risk. The longer one uses the computer, the more radiation accumulates in the brain. Do you truly wish to shorten your life, knowing that you are the one responsible? It could almost be regarded as a form of self - inflicted harm, as you have been warned if you are reading this. Thus, we have essentially covered the physical effects of computers on the body. Computers can also impact one mentally and socially. When @DATE1 arrives, you will have ample time to use the computer, but did you know that over vacation, you lose @PERCENT1 of what you learned in school? It has been proven that computers cause memory loss. So, what if you return to school and struggle to keep up? Frustrating, isn't it? If you had spent the time reading a book instead of using the computer, you might have gained knowledge rather than losing it. Computers can also have a negative social impact because not everyone wants to stay indoors on the computer. While others are out having fun, you will be alone, with only a computer for company. Would you like a computer to be your sole friend? The debate on this topic could continue indefinitely without a clear winner, but in all honesty, before turning on the computer, ask yourself: Is it truly worth it? Consider all that you would lose, all that you could never regain, or would you rather engage in an activity that will yield future benefits? The choice is yours, but be responsible enough to make the one that is beneficial to you.
1198	1201	1	1	Dear editor, Computers are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the @LOCATION1. People are allocating an excessive amount of time to computers at the expense of other activities, an outcome that is not advantageous to society. Due to computers, individuals have been deprived of exercise, the opportunity to enjoy nature and other aspects of the world, and the chance to interact with family and friends. Computers should be utilized in moderation and not as a substitute for other significant events in our lives. First and foremost, computer users engage in significantly less physical activity than non - computer users. According to a survey conducted by the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, only @PERCENT1 of computer users reported exercising at least once a week. In contrast, @PERCENT2 of non - computer users (infrequent computer users) reported exercising at least once a week. Can one envision a scenario where everyone is a dedicated computer user? Nearly everyone would be overweight, lethargic due to sleep deprivation from long hours on the computer, and ill - informed. Exercise is an indispensable part of everyone's life, and a lack of it can be detrimental to one's health. Stepping away from the computer and engaging in physical activity would contribute to a healthier and fitter nation. Not only do computers prevent people from getting exercise, but they also impede people from appreciating nature and other parts of the world. By traveling to @CAPS1 and unfamiliar destinations around the globe, one can experience and learn about different cultures. While using the internet @MONTH1 can be a reasonable way to learn about other places, actually immersing oneself in the ambiance and environment of a foreign location allows for a much deeper understanding. For instance, when I visited @LOCATION2 on vacation, I learned about the disparities in traditions and culture. I witnessed the stark contrast between the poor and the rich, from the humble shacks along the river to the imposing, elegant buildings reaching towards the sky. It was an experience that could not be replicated on a computer. People should be able to enjoy the wonders and diversity of the world through their own eyes rather than on a small computer screen. Lastly, computers hinder people from interacting with family and friends. Based on my personal experiences, I tend to neglect my friends and family. Communicating, playing, and socializing with others are crucial aspects of everyone's life. Without this fundamental need, people cannot be content. In summary, computers should not be overused. Such excessive use can lead to people getting less exercise, failing to fully experience the world, and losing the opportunity to interact with friends and family. To build a better country and nation, the people of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 should make an effort to reduce their computer usage.
1199	1202	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, a substantial number of students at my school spend their post - school hours on their computers. They do not venture outdoors to appreciate nature, visit with family and friends, or even engage in physical activity. A significant portion of the population is affected by this behavior. Venturing outside can enhance one's knowledge; for example, one can take a stroll in the woods. During such a walk, one @CAPS2 may discover interesting new species. Additionally, when outdoors, one can play with friends or siblings. @CAPS2 often, in neighborhoods with many children, one can initiate an impromptu game of baseball. One can also engage in creative construction. One could find a large tree and build a treehouse or a tire swing with one's family. Going outside offers a plethora of enjoyable activities. When children remain glued to the computer, they fail to interact with their family or friends. During the @DATE1, you can visit the beach with your friends. This provides a refreshing experience without the need to pay for an air - conditioner. You @MONTH1 may also have the opportunity to visit a different state for the day or travel across the country to see a sick grandmother or a newly - born cousin. Going on a picnic allows you to get acquainted with new people. You could invite friends and encourage them to bring a new acquaintance for the group to meet. Moreover, there will be an abundance of delicious food, which is appealing to everyone. Traveling with family and friends can lead to a rewarding experience. @PERCENT1 of children choose to use the computer over exercising, which will cause them to become overweight. When using the computer, @CAPS2 children tend to eat continuously. Consuming food for extended periods each day is not a prudent idea. You can try out for your school's basketball team or participate in cross - country running. Once you are part of a team, you will make new friends and get your daily exercise. When on a team and exercising, you will learn @CAPS2 valuable life skills. You will understand the advantages of working both as a team and independently. Therefore, getting exercise plays a very important role in your life. Why would you opt for the computer? You would miss out on enjoying the outdoors and spending time with family and friends. You would become overweight and unhappy. So, do not choose the computer; instead, select another activity!
1200	1203	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people at my school sit on there computers after school. They don't go outside and enjoy nature. Visit with family and friends or even exercise. @CAPS2 people are affected by this. Going outside can enchance your knowledge, you can go on a walk in the woods. When you are on your walk you @CAPS2 find interesting new species. Also when you are outside you can play with your friends or siblings. @CAPS2 times in neighborhoods there are a lot of kids, you can start a pick of game of baseball. You can also build new things. You could find a big tree and build a treehouse or tireswing with your family. Going outside leaves you with a lot of fun activites. When kids sit on the computer they don't interact with there family or friends. During the @DATE1 you can go to the beach with your friends. It will cool you down without having to pay money for an air conditioner. You @MONTH1 also find the oportunety to go to a different state for the day. Or you could go acros the country to see your sick grandma or your newly named cousin. Going on a picnic will give you time to get to know new people. You could invite friends and have them bring a new friend for the whole group to met. You will also have a lot of tasty food and who wouldn't want that? Going places with your family and friends can pad to a worth wild experinse. @PERCENT1 of kids chose to go on the computer than to exercise. Kids will become overweight. When on the computer @CAPS2 kids will eat. Eating for hours each day to not a good idea. You can go out for your schools basketball team or run distances in cross country. Once you are on the team you will make new friends, and get your exercise for the day. When you are on a team and exercising you will learn @CAPS2 life skills. You will learn the benifits of working as a team and by yourself. So getting your exersise is a very important role in your life. Why would you choose the computer? You wouldn't be able to enjoy the outdoors. Or spend time with family and friends. You would become over weight and unhappy. So, don't choose the computer, choose another activity!
1201	1204	1	1	"To the concerns of @CAPS1, @CAPS6, and @MONTH1: @CAPS2, I have been apprised that you hold the view that an increasing number of individuals are utilizing computers, yet not everyone concurs that this is advantageous to society. I vehemently dissent; I believe that computers exert a positive influence on people. Engaging with computers cultivates hand - eye coordination, endows individuals with the capacity to explore @CAPS3 and distant locales, and even enables people to communicate online with friends or family. Do you not desire for your children to develop exceptional hand - eye coordination? More than @PERCENT1 of parents voted affirmatively. As numerous statistics indicate, adults and children who use the computer for an hour or more daily possess superior hand - eye coordination compared to a typical adult or child who uses @CAPS6 only once a week. By using the computer for over an hour each day, your typing speed accelerates, and your reaction time improves. Not only does faster typing enhance your computer skills, but @CAPS6 also offers benefits beyond the home, such as in sports. For instance, if you play baseball, the velocity of your pitch will increase by over @PERCENT2 if you use the computer for more than an hour a day! If you are a batter, your reaction to the pitch will also improve by over @PERCENT2! All it takes is computer usage. Is time running out for your @CAPS3 project? Without computers, you would not be able to obtain the necessary information promptly enough. Dr. @DR1 from @ORGANIZATION1 stated, ""You can acquire the same information about people, other countries, and @CAPS3 from the computer as you can from a book, and it is effortless. Additionally, unlike books, which require purchase to access their information, computers allow you to look up information inexpensively. Do not settle for less; opt for the best! Over @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 have old friends or family members out of state with whom they still wish to maintain contact. With a computer, you can chat with them via your webcam! Instead of making a phone call or sending an email, you can chat with them and see them in person! Several computer owners claim, '@CAPS5 feels as if you're actually hanging out with them!' It takes at least @NUM1 days to receive a letter or an email from them if they live far away, but with computers, @CAPS5 is instantaneous! Wouldn't you prefer to converse with friends and family daily rather than waiting for a call, email, or letter? I think so. All in all, owning a computer is an excellent investment. I would also like to emphasize that without computers, you would be unable to communicate with friends and family online, improve your hand - eye coordination, or even gain knowledge about @CAPS3 with just a click of a button! Isn't this what you desire?"
1202	1205	1	1	"Dear Newspaper Editor, Have you ever been engrossed in writing a paper or reading a text and encountered a word you've never heard before? And you simply cannot decipher its meaning? This is where a computer can be of assistance. Indeed, some individuals squander all their time online, but they have underlying issues. Computers aid us in all our school projects and facilitate research. You can @CAPS3 reestablish connections with old friends you haven't seen in years, and learn numerous valuable things through the internet and computers. Firstly, we would be unable to accomplish some of the tasks we do without computers. For school projects, I frequently utilize @ORGANIZATION1 Word and PowerPoint. Our teachers prefer that we complete assignments in this manner rather than handwriting everything. Obtaining information on the computer is significantly faster and easier. Consider the time it would take you to look up the word ""elephants"" in an encyclopedia; it is probably @NUM1 times longer than the time it takes to search for it on Google. Moreover, within approximately @NUM2 1/@NUM2 seconds, Google can retrieve millions of websites related to ""elephants"". Another reason why computers are highly beneficial is that you can reconnect with old friends you haven't seen or spoken to in years. You can @CAPS3 meet new @CAPS1 through dating platforms and Facebook, especially considering these three aspects, and there are also websites like Twitter where you can follow celebrities and @CAPS2. The internet accessible via computers provides valuable information to people. Some children take online @CAPS3 @CAPS4 courses, and they really have no alternative. So, in conclusion, computers can be extremely advantageous to many people. I am aware that it is not advisable to sit idle all day playing computer games, but we can achieve a great deal, such as completing school projects or any other project. It is @CAPS3 pleasant to reconnect with someone you haven't communicated with in a while. We have learned a great deal from the internet. I hope you will consider my perspective."
1203	1206	1	1	"Dear Editor of @ORGANIZATION2, the source @CAPS1, I have observed that a significant number of people have been spending an excessive amount of time using their computers. This is a situation that must be rectified as it impacts people's health, safety, and education. To commence my argument, excessive use of the computer can lead to poor health. Take my friend @PERSON1 as an example. He remains at home, seated in front of his computer all @DATE1, playing games, browsing @CAPS2, and engaging in @CAPS3 activities. He rarely engages in physical exercise and scarcely sees daylight. @PERSON1 in @LOCATION1 has gained @NUM1 pounds, which has resulted in obesity and heart problems. He even wears dentures because his overall hygiene has deteriorated. Another prevalent health issue that arises from excessive computer use is arthritis. Dr. @PERSON3 of the @ORGANIZATION1 informed @ORGANIZATION3, ""The extensive amount of typing on the keyboard can lead to joint problems, arthritis, and other joint - related ailments."" In fact, a study conducted from @DATE2 to @DATE3 to assess the long - term effects of computer overuse yielded some startling results. @PERCENT1 of the test subjects sought medical attention for joint pain problems. These health risks are a cause for concern, but people's safety is an even more significant issue. When people use the computer excessively, they put their safety and well - being at stake. People have suffered serious injuries and have been victims of scams due to the internet. In @DATE4, a girl named @PERSON5 was kidnapped and taken to @LOCATION2. She met a man on @CAPS4.com named @PERSON6, who persuaded her to meet him at an airport. From there, she was taken to @CAPS5 and held for ransom. Every time people use their computers, they expose themselves to risk. Dr. @PERSON4 of the @ORGANIZATION2 asserts, ""I have witnessed @NUM2 internet - related kidnappings and other crimes. The victims were individuals who overused the computer and frequently accessed the internet."" Safety is one of the most crucial aspects of life. However, people's education is also affected. When people overuse the computer, they can have a negative impact on their education. The internet contains false information and can be a waste of people's time. When students are working on a report, they often use the internet to gather information. Websites like @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION4 are the most commonly used. This can be a major problem. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of the information on the internet is inaccurate? That's more than half of it! The internet can also be a time - consuming distraction. My brother, @PERSON2, had an assignment due on @DATE1. He spent @NUM3 hours on @CAPS2 and didn't even start writing his essay. He received a zero for that grade. In conclusion, overusing your computer can cause health problems, endanger your safety, and impede your education."
1204	1207	1	1	Dear Editor, Have you ever utilized a computer? Chances are you have, which implies that you are aware of how convenient and beneficial computers are. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 regularly use computers? These technological wonders offer numerous means of communication and learning, demonstrating that computers have an extremely positive impact on people. Who hasn't played a game on a computer? Computers provide various forms of entertainment, such as games, music, and videos. Once, I had to drive @NUM1 hours to visit my grandma in @LOCATION1. The only thing that saved me from boredom during the journey was my portable computer, on which I played games and watched movies. Critics of computers contend that people who use computers do not engage in physical activities. However, try exercising when you are confined in a car traveling at @NUM2 @CAPS2, which exemplifies how computers have a positive influence on me. It was @NUM3 on a @DATE1 @TIME1, and my mother was about to give birth. Unfortunately, none of my relatives were present to witness the arrival of the baby because they all reside on the other side of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS3. Nevertheless, this minor obstacle did not prevent them from seeing the @LOCATION1 baby. Thanks to computers, they didn't even have to leave their homes. This is because computers offer numerous ways to socialize, such as through social networking sites. Within @NUM4 hours after the baby was born, there were numerous pictures and videos posted on these social networking sites, allowing everyone to enjoy my @LOCATION1 baby sister. Computers make life convenient for everyone. Last but not least, computers are not only an excellent tool for school but are essential for educational success. On a snow day in @DATE2, I was assigned a research paper on @PERSON1. Unfortunately, I knew nothing about @PERSON1, so I asked my mother to drive me to the library to borrow some books for my report. However, due to the snow, the library's power went out, and it was closed. This was not a problem, though, because I only needed to spend @NUM5 minutes on a computer searching for information, rather than spending hours leafing through countless pages in a book. Thanks to computers, I received an A on my report. Overall, computers serve many useful purposes for people. These remarkable machines can provide entertainment, enable social interaction with people worldwide, and even offer information on any topic of interest. Readers of @ORGANIZATION1, you now understand why computers are beneficial for your lives and those of others. I encourage you all to spread this message so that everyone is aware of the advantages of using computers.
1205	1208	1	1	I disagree that computers are beneficial because, firstly, excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. When one spends all day doing nothing but sitting in front of a computer, it can have detrimental effects on one's body. People need to be active, and if they remain idle constantly, their bodies will become accustomed to inactivity, making it difficult for them to move or walk. Secondly, one can encounter malicious individuals on the computer. People may not disclose all the information you need to know and may engage in inappropriate behavior. They could be hiding something or have ulterior motives. Thirdly, one can get involved in something dangerous. When using the computer, you might share personal information with others, and they could use it against you without your knowledge. You may unknowingly be used for purposes you are not aware of. So, spending a long time on the computer can lead to significant problems. You become inactive, may encounter bad people, and can get caught up in something harmful. Now you understand why spending an extended period on the computer can be detrimental. Now, what will you decide? P.S. I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to read this.
1206	1209	1	1	Computers exert numerous influences on individuals in contemporary times. The majority of these impacts are highly beneficial, capable of fostering greater self - assurance. They serve as educational tools, enabling people to explore ancient figures and complete school projects. Moreover, computers offer entertainment. Additionally, they can enhance one's prospects of securing a job or facilitating work - related tasks. For most individuals, education holds significant importance. Since children do not remain in school for @NUM1, computers are employed to educate them. Children can learn about diverse locations, which enriches our knowledge. They can also undertake projects, such as writing essays or preparing science fair projects. Furthermore, they can study historical figures, including renowned musicians, celebrities, legends, and hall - of - famers. People constantly seek entertainment, and the computer is often their first choice. Everyone appreciates entertainment, and the computer is an excellent option. They can engage in a wide range of games, from classic to futuristic ones. There are also various types, like multiplayer, figure, castle defense, shooter sports, racing, and arcade games. Another enjoyable activity is interacting with friends online or communicating with distant family members. Finally, one can watch humorous, sad, or music videos. Another way computers affect people is in job - seeking and work - related assistance. The computer can instruct individuals on job - related tasks and what to anticipate. It also allows for job searches. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. They can enhance education, provide entertainment, and assist with job - related matters or job - hunting.
1207	1210	1	1	There have been substantial advancements in computer technology, and opinions are divided regarding its merits. I am opposed to excessive computer use, and I will elucidate my reasons. Prolonged computer use leads to reduced physical activity, which may result in weight gain. It also reduces the time spent appreciating nature, causing a disconnection from the natural world. Additionally, it diminishes the time spent with friends and family. This is not to say that computers are entirely negative, but overindulgence is certainly detrimental. Firstly, decreased physical activity is a consequence of excessive computer use. Lack of exercise not only leads to weight gain but also restricts one's ability to perform daily tasks and poses health risks. This is concerning as it can lead to a decline in physical well - being, and in extreme cases, mobility issues. To avoid this, it is advisable to manage computer time. Instead of spending excessive time on the computer, one could go for a jog outdoors. Secondly, less time is spent enjoying nature. Nature is incredibly beautiful, yet it is being destroyed while most of us remain passive. Only a small fraction of the @NUM1 billion people on Earth actively contribute to environmental conservation. It is a pity to witness the degradation of such beauty. Finally, spending less time with friends and family is the most crucial concern. Family is of utmost importance as they are our closest companions. Friends are equally significant. Excessive computer use may cause family members to distance themselves. Friends are also important as they bring joy and support. We should cherish these relationships as they may not last forever. In summary, these are my three reasons for opposing excessive computer use: reduced physical activity, limited appreciation of nature, and less time with loved ones. It is essential to remember that moderation is key.
1208	1211	1	1	Dear editor: Are you aware that @PERCENT1 of the population in the @LOCATION2 own computers? These devices are undoubtedly beneficial to society. People rely on computers to stay informed about important issues, communicate with others, and acquire new knowledge. Computers have become indispensable in daily life. The dissemination of news is crucial, and computers offer an effective means to achieve this. Ordinary individuals need to be aware of weather conditions, global events, and other significant topics. By using a computer, one can access information instantaneously. For example, there is no need to wait for the weather report on television when local weather information can be obtained within seconds. Recently, an earthquake in @LOCATION1 resulted in the loss of millions of lives. In the event of a natural disaster in @CAPS2, computers can ensure that everyone is promptly informed. Moreover, computers facilitate communication. My relatives live far away, and we cannot afford long - distance phone calls, so we use email. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people communicate with distant friends and family via email. Social networking sites like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 also enable friends to stay in touch. Interaction with others is essential, and the internet provides an ideal platform for this. Finally, computers are excellent tools for learning. Children can easily search the internet for project or essay - related information. Adults can also use computers to learn new things, which is more convenient than visiting a library. Many adults use online dictionaries to look up word definitions. In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial to society. They keep us updated on important issues, help us communicate, and allow us to acquire new knowledge. These technological advancements are advantageous for humanity.
1209	1212	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Owning a home computer offers numerous advantages. Firstly, computers enable individuals to explore other countries and cultures. They also promote efficiency by allowing users to type documents, thereby conserving paper. Additionally, they revolutionize communication, facilitating interaction with both nearby and distant individuals. Finally, computers can replace textbooks, reducing paper consumption. One of the most significant benefits of computers is their role in education and research. Students can readily access information about countries, people, and cultures, which is far more efficient than using traditional textbooks. When typing papers, computers save time and money. They eliminate concerns about handwriting, spelling, and grammar errors, and there is no need to purchase writing supplies. Moreover, computers contribute to environmental conservation by reducing the need for paper - based textbooks. Computers have also transformed communication. Before their invention, international communication was costly and time - consuming. Now, instant messaging and video calls save time and resources. These features are particularly useful for staying in touch with family and friends. In conclusion, a home computer offers significant advantages. It saves time in research, reduces costs associated with communication and writing supplies, and helps preserve the environment by minimizing paper usage.
1210	1213	1	1	In my view, I concur that computers bring benefits to society. The rationale behind my stance is that numerous businesses, fast - food restaurants, and schools rely on computers. Businesses utilize computers in their operations. Workers use them for design work, data filing, and document typing. In the design industry, professionals have shifted from using paper and pencils to design software. Instead of traditional filing cabinets, businesses store client, patient, and employee information on computers, which can hold more data. News reporters, for example, type reports for publication. In short, computers are essential for businesses in filing, typing, and design. Fast - food and regular restaurants have also embraced computer technology. Chains like @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1 use computers to take orders and process payments. In the past, cash registers were used, but now computers offer more security and efficiency. All modern restaurants are equipped with at least one touch - screen computer, making computers indispensable for their survival. Schools also depend on computers. Students write reports and teachers manage student information such as names, grades, and personal details. Teachers can also create homework assignments and print materials using computers. In conclusion, computers benefit society significantly. They are crucial for business operations, restaurant management, and educational institutions, which is why their impact on society is highly positive.
1211	1214	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, Computers are indispensable and confer significant advantages upon our community. They contribute substantially to simplifying our lives. There is scarcely a day when we do not utilize a computer in some manner. The benefits of our computers are that they establish connections among us, disseminate news, and enable everyday objects to function. Computers connect us in a multitude of ways. Where would businesses stand without computers? Most contemporary businesses are operated by computers. Owners can now possess businesses across the globe. With computers, a business in @LOCATION2 or elsewhere in @LOCATION4 can be linked with a building in @LOCATION1. They can engage in live video chats. With the assistance of computers, they are capable of contacting any branch of their business worldwide. Even smaller businesses employ the computer to connect with customers. Nowadays, we engage in a great deal of online shopping. This serves as an example of how stores connect with their customers. Stores can showcase to buyers everything they have to offer, including store locations. This can aid stores in attracting more business by connecting the buyer with the shop. The computer not only connects stores and businesses but also individuals with one another. @PERCENT1 of kids in my school own a computer. With the prevalence of these computers, numerous social networking sites have emerged. The most popular one currently is @CAPS1. Students can connect with old friends from other places and even other countries. We can have a live chat on @CAPS1 or even @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is instant messaging, which, as the name implies, is instantaneous. With a simple click, people are connected regardless of the distance between them. Therefore, computers connect people. Computers also broadcast news. Without computers, most of us would be unaware of world news. This includes the @LOCATION3 earthquake. If we did not have computers to inform us about the earthquake in @LOCATION3, they would be in far greater trouble. They would not receive all these donations. Additionally, computers even broadcast national news. Almost all newspapers are now available online as well as in print. Before long, they will be entirely online. This will significantly transform how we access news. It will be just a click away. What previously took days to reach us now takes minutes or perhaps even seconds. Science also benefits from computers. Phones can now serve as personal TVs, internet devices, and messaging tools. Phones are merely a miniature version of a computer. Cars also have computers installed in them. The @CAPS3 in our cars are computers; we would be lost without them. Moreover, in cars, there are computers that control almost everything else. So, there is not a day when we do not encounter computers. In conclusion, computers benefit us in numerous ways. They connect us, deliver news, and are present in almost all of our technology. Could you envision life without computers?
1212	1215	1	1	"Are you acquainted with that square box featuring a screen on @CAPS11? Or that rectangular - shaped object adorned with letters on @CAPS11? Or that other rectangular box where you insert a disk or a USB and power @CAPS11 on? All of these are computers. Indeed! @CAPS11 is enjoyable; you can play games, access the internet, watch videos, and check your mail. If you owned a computer, everything would be effortless, but that's not always the case. There are @NUM1 reasons for this. If you have children and they use the computer you have at home, @CAPS11 can lead to addiction, @CAPS11 can be inappropriate, and @CAPS11 can be costly. Please consider my reasons and give me a fair chance to present my argument. The first reason why computers can be detrimental is that @CAPS11 can cause your child to develop an addiction. This is a problem because your child will pester you, saying, ""@CAPS1 or @CAPS7, can I use the computer, please?"" And when you consent, they will be elated. However, when you say, ""@CAPS2, it's time to turn off the computer,"" they will protest, saying, ""@CAPS3, can I stay on just a little longer? I'm in the middle of a game."" Even after they finally turn it off, the next day they will ask again, ""@CAPS6 or @CAPS7, can I use the computer?"" And if you say ""@CAPS8,"" they will cry and throw a tantrum. The more you allow them to use it, the more they will want to stay on. If you say ""@CAPS8,"" you'll face a difficult situation. The second reason why having a computer can be a bad idea is that @CAPS11 can be inappropriate. As your child grows up, they will explore the internet and may encounter things like nude pictures or videos, which could potentially lead your child to engage in sexual intercourse. You'll find that at the age of @NUM2 to @NUM3 years old, you'll realize the inappropriate content a computer can expose them to. Last but not least, the final reason why a computer can be a drawback is that computers are quite expensive these days. You purchase a computer, and it will cost you a substantial amount to get it repaired or to buy a new one. And they will use it even more, or they might damage it. Trust me, I know. This is why a computer isn't always a good thing. Now that you've heard my reasons, I hope you take this information into consideration and ponder whether you truly want a computer. They are useful and convenient, but they also have some negative side - effects. All the facts I've stated are true. I'd say about @NUM4 people in the world deal with computer - related issues every year. So, think carefully. Do you?"
1213	1216	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an extremely valuable tool in this contemporary era. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow people with the capacity to effortlessly learn about distant places and individuals, and facilitate online communication among people. Therefore, I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on people. Hand - eye coordination is a highly crucial skill for young children to acquire. Without it, they will have messy handwriting, little to no chance in sports, and face numerous other challenges. Computers assist in teaching this skill as children need to use their fingers to press the same keys that their eyes see. Moreover, since they tend to strive for faster typing, it further enhances the coordination between the finger and the eye. Computers also empower people to easily learn about far - off places, people, and so on. In the past, people had to spend hours searching for a moderately good book on a topic and then sift through hundreds of pages to find the specific information they needed. Now, that information is merely a few clicks away. Suppose you are having problems with your faucet; it keeps dripping, but you don't want to hire a plumber. You can readily obtain step - by - step instructions on what to do using the computer. The possibilities are limitless. Finally, computers enable people to maintain contact with friends who reside far away. It is more convenient than traveling by plane as you don't have to hold a device in your hand constantly. You can step away and return when you receive a message. It is also highly beneficial for individuals such as businessmen because they can communicate with multiple people simultaneously while still being able to complete other tasks. @PERSON1, the author of a business magazine, informed us in an interview that it is nearly impossible to run a successful business without a computer. I am at a loss as to how some people can claim that computers have a negative impact on society. However, I hope that you will publish this in the paper and demonstrate to them that computers are essential.
1214	1217	1	1	I opine that possessing computers is advantageous as they can be employed to locate places. Another reason for their desirability is that they enable communication with friends. One can engage in a diverse range of games, acquire pictures, and they are also conducive to completing homework. This is why computers are beneficial and why we require them. The primary reason we need computers is that they can serve as a map for us. Additionally, we can explore places we have never seen before, and if we wish to reach a particular destination, we can rely on the computer to facilitate this.
1215	1218	1	1	There are over @NUM1 students at @ORGANIZATION2, and out of @NUM2 students, they own computers. Computers have a positive impact on individuals. Students who utilize computers are more proficient than those who do not, as they learn various software and how to ensure safety while online. Computers impart hand - eye coordination to children, which can prove useful when participating in sports. Moreover, they endow people with the ability to learn about distant places and individuals. Finally, they enable people to communicate online with others. Computers aid people in developing hand - eye coordination. When one participates in a sport such as baseball or basketball, hand - eye coordination is undoubtedly essential. For instance, if you are a catcher, you need to catch the ball. Almost every sport necessitates hand - eye coordination, and computers help in attaining this skill. Hand - eye coordination can also be beneficial for people in their jobs. If one works with computers professionally, being well - versed with the keyboard is advantageous for achieving rapid results. Most jobs, along with sports, require hand - eye coordination. Some individuals are born with the gift of hand - eye coordination, but for those who are not, practice is the most effective means. Learning about faraway places and people is always captivating. On computers, towns can post webpages featuring pictures, information, or even guidance on planning a vacation. There is also @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 can assist you in finding any location or provide you with information about that place. Computers even grant you the ability to plan or visit a location by purchasing tickets online or simply reading about what the place is like. Finally, computers can be carried anywhere. Suppose you travel to @LOCATION1 and do not speak the local language. You can visit a translating site to understand the meaning of things. Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, all these platforms make it possible to communicate with others. Personally, I have a Facebook account, an AIM account, and even an email. Often, I log on to Facebook to chat with my school friends and even my cousins whom I don't see frequently. Online communication helps you interact with people you may not encounter at school or in your neighborhood, as well as friends who may not have a cell phone. It helps you develop social skills that are essential for everyone. Computers offer all these benefits. It is an easy and cost - free way to communicate with anyone you know at any time. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. Almost everyone uses computers, and they are not difficult to operate. Computers teach hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about faraway places and individuals, and facilitate online communication. Computers are one of the most remarkable inventions ever.
1216	1219	1	1	Dear Editor, I recently perused your previous article positing that computers can consume an inordinate amount of an individual's time, time that could be dedicated to exercise or @CAPS1 @CAPS2. This assertion is entirely fallacious, and in numerous respects, computers actually confer benefits upon society. The internet offers a rapid and straightforward means of reducing the time expended on activities we would otherwise engage in. Instead of dispatching a letter to invite someone to the @CAPS3, one can simply send an email. Letters may take weeks to arrive and can even go astray, whereas an email reaches the recipient instantaneously. Moreover, what if the movie sells out or is cancelled? Fear not, as with the internet, one can reschedule and purchase tickets online to prevent such an occurrence. Suddenly, your phone rings; it's your best friend urging you to turn on the news, but you must leave to pick up your children in three minutes. Instead of waiting for the reports to conclude, you can promptly check one of the numerous news websites and still arrive early. Have you been yearning to converse with someone you haven't seen in a long time? Well, with one of the many free platforms like @CAPS4 and Facebook, you can do so in an instant. You can communicate with that person and discover a plethora of things. Additionally, if you've been feeling lonely and unable to find the right person, dating sites can help you find your perfect match and perhaps accompany you to the @CAPS3. Not only does it save time and facilitate connections with others, but it can also have physical benefits. According to Drishnig at @ORGANIZATION1, individuals who use computers for at least @NUM1 minutes a day experience a @PERCENT1 increase in hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and accuracy. Although some claim it is detrimental to the eyes, this is a falsehood, as proven by @PERSON1, the @CAPS5, in charge of health, who holds @NUM2 degrees in science and health.
1217	1220	1	1	To Whom It May Concern: I concur that computers have led many individuals to spend less time outdoors. However, they have kept children indoors instead of roaming the streets and causing mischief. Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. Some utilize them to maintain connections with family members or reconnect with old friends. Experts contend that it is unfavorable, yet @ORGANIZATION2 offers a computer class at @ORGANIZATION1. In this class, we acquire keyboarding skills, @ORGANIZATION3 techniques, and how to conduct research on any subject. @ORGANIZATION1 itself has influenced the use of computers. If we were to travel back in time, we would likely witness children loitering on the streets. Nowadays, children spend a significant amount of time indoors, using computers. This is not necessarily a negative phenomenon. I wager that you, your parents, or perhaps even your grandparents used to hear about gangs or fights occurring on the streets. Now that computers have become a crucial element in many people's lives, such incidents are not as frequently reported. I am not suggesting that they do not happen, but you no longer hear your child return home and discuss gangs and fights. Therefore, spending time on the computer is not as bad as it seems. In history, you may have learned about immigrants journeying to @LOCATION1 to escape their rulers. However, not everyone was able to make the journey. Some individuals have family members residing in other countries. Due to time differences, it is challenging to stay in touch. My mother immigrated here when she was @NUM1. The rest of her family still resides in @LOCATION2. To maintain contact, they communicate via email or @CAPS1 chat. The five-hour time difference makes it difficult to determine the appropriate time to call. The invention of computers has made it easier to catch up with family members. Most importantly, the use of computers is promoted in schools. My institution, @ORGANIZATION1, offers a computer class where we learn to type proficiently. We are also taught how to properly cite and conduct research for our work. This is beneficial because if we lack this knowledge, we may inadvertently plagiarize, which is illegal. Frequently, teachers assign projects that require the use of computers. We either need to search for specific, accurate information or type a @ORGANIZATION3 document. Additionally, we can use the online @CAPS2 book instead of carrying it home. After considering all these facts, I am confident that you will agree that computers can bring benefits to society. Students stay off the streets and only cause minor disputes with their siblings at home. People no longer feel as though they have left or lost their family members. Schools encourage the use of computers to aid in our learning. Surely, you cannot disagree with me.
1218	1221	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1, some individuals believe that computers are detrimental to our society because people allocate more time to using such technology. I contend that this is not the root cause of our society's decline, although I acknowledge that people spend an excessive amount of time on computers. In fact, computers are beneficial to our society as they represent an advancement in communication. People have discovered ways to interact with others by connecting a webcam and microphone. Not only do computers facilitate communication, but they also enable us to access information about contemporary society, such as news, to stay informed. This sophisticated device can also store files and documents by typing them in, so that if they are lost, one can simply reprint them. One common activity among users of modern technology is to communicate with distant friends and family during their leisure time. Legal websites allow people to be informed about events that have occurred to a friend or family member, such as an incident or an upcoming event. Some experts, like @PERSON1, who specializes in human behavior, claim that this is the primary cause of obesity and prevents people from socializing with others outdoors or even engaging in simple exercise. I would argue that this is not entirely accurate because before interacting with anyone online, people often go for a jog around the neighborhood. Information is essential in our society and keeps us updated on modern life. A computer can provide us with specific information, such as news and weather reports. Nowadays, any intelligent person would search for information on a computer, not only for missed news but also for future weather forecasts to plan a picnic. This would be a valuable tool for our society to keep pace with the world and not miss the latest events. I believe this represents an advancement in our modern society because one can obtain the necessary information. When you are in a hurry to go to work, don't you often misplace papers and files and forget about them? A computer can transmit data to another computer to conveniently copy a file or document, so you don't have to rush to work and worry about lost files. It is well-known that thirty out of fifty people have saved their jobs thanks to a computer. A computer can also store and retain data for later use, such as a song or picture. You can send that file and listen to it on another computer. Now is the time to decide whether you should support computers. With a single click of a button, a computer can help you communicate with long-lost friends. If you need specific information, you can find it on a computer without leaving the comfort of your home. Last but not least, a computer can store important files and documents, saving you the hassle of rushing to work. So, write a letter to a representative to help people recognize that computers are beneficial to our society.
1219	1222	1	1	Computers. Firstly, I firmly believe that people should not be overly reliant on computers. Staying up late, especially on a school day, can leave one feeling fatigued. Staring at black-and-white words on a screen can exacerbate this tiredness, leading some to consume energy drinks like Red Bull or Monster when they shouldn't. Secondly, nearly the entire school uses laptops and computers, with @PERCENT1 of the population relying on them. The remaining <@PERCENT2@NUM1> of students and adults still prefer to write on paper, which offers the advantage of developing good hand-eye coordination. The @PERCENT1 of users who go online often engage in activities such as using Facebook, watching YouTube, playing games, and using Google. In contrast, the @PERCENT2 of individuals who write on paper may also doodle on the margins. Thirdly, in some states, people do not have access to internet services or are unable to use computers. As a result, they must write their work on paper. Some children, young adults, and students may have poor handwriting. In my view, not everyone should have access to a computer.
1220	1223	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, In my estimation, computers are advantageous for individuals. I hold this view because many people are able to access information that they would not encounter in their daily lives. I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. In today's fast-paced world, many individuals are occupied with work and may not have the time to purchase a newspaper or watch the news on television. However, thanks to computers, they can access the same information in a more efficient manner. Some individuals whose jobs involve the use of computers can even read the newspaper on their devices while working. This contributes to society in its own unique way. I am convinced that computers are highly useful to everyone. Computers facilitate communication and enable people to stay connected with others. They can use webcams and other tools to see and interact with individuals from different parts of the world. This provides an opportunity to connect with people who are geographically distant. In my opinion, people can also learn from computers. Computers offer numerous positive benefits that are of great significance. They provide individuals with the opportunity to acquire knowledge, which can have a positive impact on society. The more informed people are, the better equipped they are to contribute to the community. Computers allow individuals who may not have had the chance to learn certain things to do so. For instance, @PERSON1 states that @PERCENT1 of children believe that computers have been helpful to them in some way. Many people experience boredom at times, but computers offer a variety of entertainment options such as games and videos. As @PERSON1 mentioned, children believe that computers are beneficial because playing games can improve hand-eye coordination and provide other advantages. Computers also contribute to society by providing access to technology. Technology is an essential part of modern life and has helped many people. Computers are one such technological advancement that continues to benefit individuals. Technology can teach people new skills and expand their knowledge. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have numerous positive effects on people. They not only benefit those who use them but also have a broader impact on society. They provide everyone with the opportunity to learn and grow, making them a valuable asset.
1221	1224	1	1	"In contemporary society, a multitude of novel technologies have emerged. Among them are the @NUM1 player, mobile phones, and video - game consoles like the Xbox @NUM2. However, perhaps the most prevalent and widely utilized is the computer, which offers the remarkable ability to access and search for information with just a few clicks. Some individuals are so enthralled by technology that they verge on addiction, seizing every opportunity to use it. This prompts the question: Is this beneficial for people? Is their current behavior impacting their health and physical activity? Indeed, people today are significantly influenced by the internet. Certain websites, such as Facebook, MySpace, and YouTube, are highly addictive. These platforms have witnessed a dramatic increase in usage since their inception. Dr. @DR1 asserts, ""This online behavior must cease; people are becoming addicted and gaining weight due to a lack of physical activity."" As is evident, the internet can be extremely useful, yet it should not be used incessantly, as it can affect one's health and pose other risks."
1222	1225	1	1	Hello! I am writing to discuss whether computers have a negative or positive impact on society. In my view, computers are a valuable addition. They assist us in numerous ways, enabling us to make new friends and stay updated. This is my first point. I believe that computers positively influence society as people can obtain @CAPS1 of the latest updates regarding the weather, social affairs, and countries. It benefits society as individuals no longer need to sift through old newspapers. All they need to do is click, and they can read the information, likely accompanied by pictures and other details. My second reason for considering computers a positive influence on society is that they facilitate various means of interaction, such as meeting new people, maintaining close relationships, communicating with them, and sharing pictures of oneself and other things. My final opinion on why computers have a positive impact on society is that @CAPS2 if you own a business or engage in any commercial activity, you can sell your merchandise, manage business plans, and create a website for your enterprise. Over time, @CAPS1 of people will become aware of it, which will have a substantial impact on your business. These are my three perspectives on why computers have a positive impact on society, and I firmly believe that they are truly beneficial to society.
1223	1226	1	1	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 envision a world bereft of computers. From where would we source all our information? Would we have to rely on television or magazines, where information is susceptible to alteration? Or how would we ever complete any work - related reports or school assignments? I know numerous individuals with untidy handwriting; how would anyone decipher their work? Essentially, computers exert such a profound and positive influence on our lives that chaos would ensue without them. Computers empower people to learn typing, which can enhance comprehensive skills such as hand - eye coordination. They enable us to connect with unfamiliar places and interact with family members, and they offer the opportunity for online education, which can contribute to the economy. Computers impact us in an extremely favorable manner and transform our daily lives. @CAPS2 astonishingly, some children today struggle to type. A recent study conducted at @ORGANIZATION2 revealed that @PERCENT1 of children older than @NUM1 are already proficient in keyboard typing. Computers have a significant impact on us in numerous skills that people often fail to fully recognize. Since those children know how to type, they can also improve their spelling. I recall once when I was writing an online report. I encountered @NUM2 a word I had always struggled to spell. So, I took my time and typed it out letter by letter, and it was correct! This example demonstrates that computers can impact everyone's lives, even those of younger children. The way we acquire information from computers is analogous to how our hands receive instructions from our brains to move. For instance, when babies learn to walk, they rely on their brains to guide them. Similarly, during a natural disaster, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1, we rely on our computers to inform us of what is happening and how such an event could occur. Computers can influence us in this way because there are numerous aspects of our world that we might never discover without them. Computers affect families' daily lives by providing online education. My @NUM3 - year - old cousin told me that she was delighted her mother could pursue a college education from home, as it allowed them to spend more time together. I understand that you might think computers can drive families apart, but in fact, they bring them closer. There is only one conclusion: computers affect all of us positively. They help us learn to type, connect us with the world, and strengthen family bonds. Without computers, we would not be the same as we are today.
1224	1227	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I advocate for the continuous advancement of computer technology. Some individuals contend that people spend an excessive amount of time on computers and insufficient time outdoors. Personally, I believe that the computer is invaluable, provided it is used in moderation. There are numerous reasons why the computer is essential. Firstly, there are many places in the world that not everyone can visit. The internet offers an excellent means to learn about these places. Additionally, if you are planning a vacation and wish to gain some knowledge about your destination, you can simply search for information on the computer. Moreover, the computer can assist you in studying a particular place. If you are writing a research paper for school, you will likely prefer to gather your information from the computer. When you are in a disagreement with someone, you can quickly and easily find relevant information. All you need to do is conduct a search, and you will obtain the desired results. You can also learn new things that you previously had no knowledge of. In most cases, the internet is extremely helpful. Another crucial reason is communication. There are multiple ways to communicate with others on the computer. If you have friends or family living far away, you can maintain contact with them without leaving your home. If you are unsure about your homework or something similar, you can simply consult a friend. You can also share pictures or videos to stay connected. Although some people misuse these features for inappropriate purposes, you can take measures to avoid such content. The internet can significantly enhance your daily life. You can explore new places, conduct research, and communicate with friends and family. If we continue to improve technology, you will be able to accomplish far more than you can currently. The internet will play an even more significant role in your daily life. As you can see, the internet benefits people; it is not merely a tool that keeps people indoors. This is why I believe we should continue to enhance computer technology.
1225	1228	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that new technology is a remarkable asset. That is why I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on our society. Some of these benefits include the development of skills that can be useful in the present or future, the facilitation of a better education, and the promotion of social interaction. Computers can assist people in countless ways; one merely needs to recognize their potential. So, come and discover why computers are an excellent choice to possess and utilize. My first reason for believing that computers have a positive influence on people is that they can help individuals develop latent skills. For example, a teenager might realize while typing a paper that she has a passion for writing. Subsequently, she could explore different writing styles on the internet and potentially become a renowned journalist. It all stems from the skills she acquires through online exploration of her interests. Another scenario could be that a man applying for a job is required to have proficiency in specific software. He can then use the computer to find tutorials on that software. A computer can aid people in building skills for both the present and the future. My second reason for the positive impact of computers is that they can contribute to a better education. Any adult who has not attended college but wishes to do so can enroll in online courses and earn a degree. This form of education is not limited to adults; children can also go online to research the history of different places they live in or aspire to visit. The remarkable aspect is that information can be retrieved quickly and easily. Computers enable people to learn more and attain a better education for themselves. My final reason for the positive effects of computers is that they foster social interaction. There are numerous ways to connect with family and friends. You can send an email and await a reply. Alternatively, you can now use instant messaging to communicate with someone as if they were in the same room. There are also websites, such as @CAPS1 Facebook, where you can reunite and converse with old friends. As you can observe, computers have numerous positive impacts on people. They can help you develop social skills for the present and the future. They can also assist people in obtaining a better education. Moreover, they provide an excellent means to connect with past and present friends. Hopefully, you can now appreciate how a computer can have a positive impact on so many people.
1226	1229	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you contemplate whether computers exert a positive or negative influence on people's lives? Well, if you deem it negative, I shall elucidate why it is, in fact, highly positive. Firstly, it cultivates proficient hand - eye coordination. Secondly, it enables individuals to communicate with others. Thirdly, it can assist with academic and professional endeavors. As is evident, this is why I opine that it is positive. Firstly, computers foster good hand - eye coordination. While utilizing computers, one enhances their hand - eye coordination. For instance, when browsing online and encountering something appealing or desiring a closer look, one maneuvers the mouse and clicks. This is beneficial as one can click without consciously observing the mouse's movement. Moreover, when typing a paper, one can type without glancing at the keys, looking at the screen and moving fingers freely. As can be seen, this is my initial rationale for believing that computers are positive. Secondly, computers facilitate people's communication with others. This is particularly significant when one needs to converse with someone residing at a great distance. If someone lives far away and there is an important matter, the @CAPS7 is invaluable. One can send @CAPS3 or engage in @CAPS4 chat. It enhances communication to such an extent that one has options regarding the mode of interaction. Thirdly, it aids people in their academic pursuits and sometimes in their work. It helps because they can @CAPS2 projects. This can be useful for learning about places previously unknown. Once, I was curious about how people from @LOCATION1 lived and survived. Being @CAPS5, I was determined to find out. I accessed the computer, and within approximately half an hour, I precisely knew what and how @CAPS5 people lived and survived. This can also be advantageous at work when one's boss expects work to be completed; one can utilize the @CAPS7. As is clear, this is my third and final reason for believing that computers are positive. In conclusion, I believe that computers are positive for three primary reasons. Firstly, they can contribute to the improvement of hand - eye coordination. Secondly, they assist people in communicating with those from other regions. Thirdly, they aid with school and work. Now that you have read this, I hope I have demonstrated that computers are not detrimental to us at all. In fact, they are the optimal choice for a better future.
1227	1230	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, have you ever mused about who truly invented the ice - cream cone while savoring one? Well, why not retrieve your BlackBerry and discover the answer? That is the remarkable aspect of technology. You can communicate with friends or family, seek assistance, and it is readily available whenever you require it. Have you ever relocated so far from your best friend that you wept copiously, causing someone to mistake it for rain? Well, this is no longer necessary as you can now have a webcam in your computer and converse as frequently as possible. Of course, it is not identical to being physically present with the person, but it is quite similar. Thanks to the remarkable invention of computers, you can communicate anytime, anywhere. Another way in which a computer benefits communication is that you and your friends can engage in chat. If your parents are out and prohibit you from going out, you can still interact with your friends. Lastly, if you are older, you can use Facebook to reconnect with friends you haven't seen in a long time. Another reason why computers and technology are excellent is that you can obtain the information you need. Schools essentially rely on computers. Not only students but also teachers. Teachers assign projects that involve using computers to gather information about your topic. Also, if you encounter something you've never heard of, you can research it. It's remarkable as all you have to @CAPS2 is click a button, and all the information is at your disposal. This can be useful when you're in an argument with your friend about who is a better @PERSON1. You can simply look up who has hit more home runs, and there you have a winner! Have you ever been at dinner when someone asks about the hockey game score, and your friend, husband, or brother takes out his phone and announces a score of @NUM1 to @NUM2 approximately @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well, that indicates they have internet on their phone. Phones such as BlackBerries, @CAPS3, and iPhones all have built - in internet. This means that when they are at the airport waiting for their flight, they can play a game or watch television. To me, that is a rather ingenious invention. Additionally, business and industry professionals have phones with built - in internet because they can look up information at any time. So, this is why I believe having technology is beneficial in our society. Especially because you can communicate with distant friends, and whatever information you need is accessible with a simple touch of a button. Also, you can have it on devices such as your phone.
1228	1231	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers have beneficial effects on people, such as enabling them to communicate with family or friends living afar. Computers also allow you to acquire knowledge about different places and people across the globe. My first reason is that computers facilitate learning about diverse places and individuals worldwide. This is advantageous if you are planning a vacation to a foreign country; you can learn about the most notable historical sites and the best hotels. If you have a project on a foreign country, you can search for all the relevant data. My second reason is that computers enable people to communicate with family or friends who live far away. This helps maintain connections so that it doesn't seem as if you've lost touch. Computers also allow you to discuss with your distant friends about suitable times to hang out.
1229	1232	1	1	Advancements in technology are highly practical and exert a positive influence on those fortunate enough to possess a computer. Firstly, computers assist individuals in enhancing their hand - eye coordination. Secondly, computers simplify the process of learning new information about various aspects such as people and places across the globe. Finally, computers enable people in different locations to communicate instantaneously. For the aforementioned reasons, computers are extremely beneficial to people worldwide. One of the ways computers aid people is by improving their hand - eye coordination. When a person learns to type while looking at the screen simultaneously, they will be better equipped to perform mundane daily tasks. If a person lacks good hand - eye coordination, they may struggle to write neatly on a piece of paper! This also enhances focus, and individuals with better focus tend to excel in school, work, and their social lives. Hand - eye coordination is crucial to learn, and computers help teach it to people. The second reason I believe computers are beneficial is that they facilitate learning about new things. I, myself, have experienced numerous processes. I am now fortunate to realize how valuable research is, and it is all thanks to computers. Computers are educational. Finally, computers are useful as they serve as a means of communication similar to a telephone. One form of communication on computers is instant messaging. This involves typing, which is comparable to a telephone conversation but free of charge. The most popular and final method is video chat. Video chat allows people to use cameras connected to their computers and converse while seeing each other's faces! All these means of communicating with people globally are highly advantageous, especially for those with family or friends in other towns. Undoubtedly, computers benefit people in society in multiple ways. They teach hand - eye coordination, which is essential for simple daily tasks. They also help people worldwide learn about things that would be difficult to discover through books. Last but not least, computers enable people around the world to communicate with one another. In all these respects, computers assist people everywhere.
1230	1233	1	1	Dear local Newspaper, I understand that you are deliberating whether computers have a positive impact on people. In my view, I firmly believe that they do. I hold this opinion for the following reasons: @NUM1. Computers enable you to gain knowledge about foreign places and cultures. @NUM2. Computers are often beneficial to those with special needs. @NUM3. Computers allow you to connect with people who live far away without the need to travel to them. I genuinely enjoy learning about foreign places and cultures. From my personal experience, I know that the more knowledgeable you are about foreign places and cultures, the more well - rounded you become. Without computers, many people would be unable to explore these places and learn about them. The computer is essentially a vast encyclopedia that provides important information to those who cannot travel the world to visit these places. Without computers, people would be less informed about the people, cultures, and the world we inhabit. Places such as the pyramids in @LOCATION1, etc. Don't you concur? In my school, there are several students with special needs. I personally cannot fathom how challenging it must be for them to learn. However, I do know that the computer is an extremely useful resource for them. The computer offers pictures, sounds, and interactive activities that truly assist the kids. Since some of the kids with special needs in my school have difficulty reading, the computer helps by reading the content aloud to them. Where would these children be without computers? I cherish staying in touch with my distant family and friends. Don't you? In the past, it would take days to send and receive a letter from a relative. Now, thanks to the computer, this arduous task can be accomplished with a simple click of the mouse. But that's not all. Besides sending virtual emails, because of the computer, you can see people face - to - face! Some computers are equipped with webcams that allow you to see someone through the computer screen. Isn't that remarkable? So, why squander money on a flight to deliver a simple message when you can convey it personally in less than @NUM4 seconds? Thanks to the computer, people communicate more frequently and are often brought closer together. As you can see, there are numerous significant positive effects that computers have on people. The reasons are as follows: @NUM1. Computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures. @NUM2. Computers are often helpful to those with special needs. @NUM3. Computers allow you to connect with people who live far away. Thank you for your attention.
1231	1234	1	1	In my view, computers represent a remarkable addition to our world. They can assist individuals with academic tasks, facilitate communication, and offer entertainment in a secure manner. These are the factors contributing to the influence of computers on people globally.  Firstly, computers are beneficial for a child's schoolwork. For example, when a student is conducting a research paper, the internet serves as a valuable resource for obtaining information that may not be found in books. Moreover, if a student forgets, loses, or misplaces their homework, they can log onto the school website and print the assignment. Additionally, most teachers expect essays to be as neat as possible. This can be challenging for some students, but typing ensures neatness and is accessible to all. As you can observe, computers are indispensable for schoolwork.  Secondly, computers provide an excellent means of communication and maintaining contact with others. For instance, if an employee wishes to communicate with a boss or send something to them, they can easily do so via email. Similarly, friends can engage in instant messaging to converse with one another. If a teacher and a student's parent need to schedule a conference, the teacher can email the parent with a suitable time and date. This is why computers are ideal for effortless communication.  Lastly, computers offer a safe and enjoyable form of entertainment. Numerous companies create child - friendly websites that children can access. For example, my six - year - old sister visits a website that imparts knowledge in an engaging way. Studies indicate that [PERCENT1] of kindergartners who visit these websites perform better in first grade compared to those who do not. Clearly, computers are a great way to spend one's time.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a profound impact on people across the globe. They aid in schoolwork, enable easy communication, and provide safe educational activities. As you can see, computers are a wonderful addition to our world.
1232	1236	1	1	Dear [CAPS1], some individuals contend that computers are overused and contribute to weight gain, even obesity. While this may hold some truth, computers also enhance hand - eye coordination, offer opportunities to learn about distant places, and facilitate collaboration. Overall, I believe that computers exert a positive influence on people, and the following are the reasons.  Computers play a role in teaching hand - eye coordination. You may be thinking, “How can computers achieve this? One is merely staring at a screen.” However, to your surprise, computers do enhance hand - eye coordination. When playing games, individuals watch the screen and use their hands to click. They do not simply fixate on the mouse. Through this process, hand - eye coordination is developed. Scientists have proven that individuals who own a computer and use it for at least [NUM1] hours a week have [PERCENT1] better coordination than those who do not own a computer. This statistic alone is highly telling. Hand - eye coordination is crucial; it improves performance in sports such as baseball and is beneficial for future careers. As you can see, [CAPS1], computers are essential for our hand - eye coordination.  Some people assume that computers are only for gaming, but in fact, they educate us about various aspects of the world. Without computers, people would have limited knowledge of what is happening in other countries. For example, the other day, my mother was checking her email and came across the story of a young, starving child. This story changed her perspective on daily life as she often took food for granted. Without computers, my mother would be less informed about the situations in other countries. Living in the [CAPS4].S, we are often unaware of what is happening in other, less fortunate nations. However, computers help us stay informed about the world daily.  One of the significant advantages of computers is that they enable people to communicate. Even my grandmother stated, “Without computers, I wouldn't be as close to you as I am today.” [CAPS5] and I use the website skype.com. This website allows us not only to talk but also to see each other. Thanks to such platforms, I can maintain contact with and see my grandmother who lives far away. Without computers, this would be impossible. Computers also facilitate communication with people nearby. I frequently ask my friends on the computer about homework or upcoming tests. They make it easier to connect with people regardless of distance.  In conclusion, computers offer assistance in multiple ways. The world would be significantly different without them. They enable us to learn about distant places and people, improve hand - eye coordination, and facilitate communication. Although computers have some drawbacks, their positive impacts far outweigh them. Thank you.
1233	1237	1	1	Dear editor of [LOCATION2] [CAPS1], [LOCATION3]'s society is being detrimentally affected, undoubtedly by computers. They are extremely time - consuming, and I fear they are contributing to an increase in obesity in [LOCATION3]. People are concerned that computers are restricting their ability to interact socially and enjoy nature. I share these concerns and believe that action should be taken.  The average American spends approximately [NUM1] hours a day on a computer. Considering work, school, and sleep, this leaves very little time, only about [NUM2] hours, for outdoor exploration. The number of visitors to our national parks has been declining rapidly. I visited Yellowstone last week and learned from the entrance attendant that “since the start of [DATE1], about [PERCENT1] fewer people have visited [LOCATION1].” I attribute this decline to computers, which consume the public's time with the latest trends or games on websites like miniclip.com.  I also believe that excessive computer use is preventing people from exercising. With the popularity of games like “The Sims,” it is difficult for people to stay fit and healthy. I conducted a study on the amount of time children spend on computers. Of those who reported spending more than [NUM4] minutes on the computer, [PERCENT2] could be legally classified as obese. Is this the future we envision for our next generation of leaders, lawyers, and doctors? Certainly not. We want them to live life to the fullest by taking care of themselves through exercise. The influence of computers on children is excessive and unacceptable.  Finally, computers are causing a breakdown in communication between family members and friends. Sure, parents come home to find their children on the computer and give them a kiss on the head, but is this sufficient? I asked a friend's child about his interaction with family and friends. He said that since getting his new “[CAPS5] [CAPS6] with a [NUM5] - gig hard drive,” he had hardly spoken to them. Instead, he spends [NUM6] hours a day chatting with friends online and only occasionally receives an [CAPS7] - mail from his family. This is not conducive to building strong friendships and family bonds.  In [LOCATION3], computers are limiting social interaction, reducing exercise time, and preventing people from exploring nature. Who knows, in [NUM7] years, [LOCATION3] may be completely dominated by computers. Do we want this? We should take action now. Thank you very much.
1234	1238	1	1	Dear editor of the local newspaper, computers are having a substantial negative impact on people, potentially altering their lifestyles significantly. For example, individuals who spend extended periods on computers allocate less time to exercise, enjoy nature, and socialize with friends and family. Evidently, computers have a profound influence on us.  One reason why computers can be detrimental is that people spend excessive time on them and neglect exercise. Maintaining physical fitness and health is always crucial. This may explain why [PERCENT1] of people in the [CAPS1].S are obese; computer use could be a contributing factor to this obesity epidemic. I can relate to this as I have a relative who admitted to gaining at least five pounds due to excessive computer use and lack of exercise. Is it truly worthwhile to sit in front of a computer all day, consuming food? There are more engaging and health - promoting forms of entertainment.  Another issue is that an over - reliance on technology can impede the development of social skills. Excessive computer use may lead to a decrease in self - confidence and a more introverted personality. No one desires to be a loner, and the feeling of isolation can be extremely distressing. Moreover, this makes it challenging to interact and make new friends. It is always heartening to have a supportive network of loved ones, but excessive computer use can cause us to lose them quickly.  In conclusion, individuals who spend too much time on computers have less time for exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Prioritizing computers over other aspects of life can have a negative impact on our well - being and change the course of our lives.
1235	1239	1	1	An increasing number of individuals utilize computers on a daily basis. Computers are highly beneficial for various tasks such as projects, email communication, researching vacation destinations, and more. Nevertheless, some scientists opine that people are allocating an excessive amount of time to computer usage instead of engaging in physical activities like exercise or taking a stroll.  In my view, computers are an integral part of an individual's life because the information accessible on a computer is extremely valuable. It can prove useful when one has a report to complete. Suppose your teacher informs you that a report is due the next day. What would you do if you don't have the time to visit the library? I would turn to the computer to gather all the necessary information.  I would also employ a computer to gain knowledge about distant locations or renowned historical figures. Additionally, I could use it to research my vacation destination and acquire more information about it. For example, I could find out the best restaurant locations, the most suitable accommodations, and the top tourist attractions.  Computers are also advantageous for communication. My grandparents have moved away, so I don't have as many conversations with them as before. However, thanks to my computer, I can send them a quick email to say hello or inquire about their well - being.  Imagine going to work without a computer! There would be a significant amount of paperwork to handle. In some workplaces, the job involves emailing colleagues about work - related problems and meetings. By using a computer, one can stay updated on all the happenings.  Moreover, computers are helpful when it comes to studying. If you have a test and forget your notes at school, you can search for the relevant information online and study from the computer. This way, you are less likely to fail the science test the next day.  Computers can also serve as a pleasant diversion after completing all your homework. If you wish to use the computer to chat with your friends, it can act as an incentive to finish your homework first. Sometimes, people need some relaxation time after a long day of studying. Playing games on the computer can be a great way to unwind.  In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial for tasks such as writing reports, planning vacations, communicating, gathering study - related information, and playing games. Many people also use computers for their work. I firmly believe that computers are an essential part of an individual's daily life.
1236	1240	1	1	Do you have an affinity for computers? Do you utilize the internet to assist you? Do you engage with it daily? Well, regardless, this article furnishes you with information regarding all of these aspects. Firstly, a significant number of individuals dislike computers as they claim they are overly perplexing. In actuality, computers are not that arduous to operate; one merely has to be patient and allocate some time to become accustomed to them. Moreover, computers can simplify tasks such as typing. Why would you write manually when you have the option to employ a computer, which enables you to write more expeditiously than on regular paper? Secondly, the internet is far more convenient than books. All one needs to do is visit @ORGANIZATION1 or any other search engine, input what one is seeking, and in an instant, all the world's information on that topic is at one's disposal. Additionally, if you are planning a vacation, the internet can be of great aid. You can purchase plane tickets online, and occasionally, there are special discounts available on the web. Furthermore, you can book hotels and view live pictures with more details. Hence, when you book a vacation online, you can be certain that it will be a favorable one. Finally, you can procure anything with a mere click of a button. Nearly every website offers discounts. I recall the time when I purchased @MONEY1 shoes for @MONEY2 online. Moreover, it typically gets shipped to your residence within a few days. Lastly, frequent internet usage is not detrimental. I access the computer almost daily, yet I also venture outside. I can do so because at night, when no one can go outside, I use the computer for schoolwork or entertainment. Additionally, you can communicate with your friends or family via the internet. What if your mom or dad embarked on a @NUM1 - week business trip? You could utilize your webcam to converse with them and see them as if you were in the same room. So, is using the computer truly that bad? I think not, as it is extremely useful and easy to handle.
1237	1241	1	1	Dear newspaper company, the number of individuals using computers is increasing each day. However, not everyone concurs that it benefits society. Some individuals assert that those who are on computers do not engage in physical exercise or play outdoors. Subsequently, when they disengage from the computer, their eyes ache, and their vision deteriorates. Nevertheless, despite all that has been said, I am of the opinion that the benefits of computers are highly valuable. The reasons I believe computers have benefits are as follows. They enhance hand - eye coordination and provide people with information about distant places. They also allow one to rent hotels, movies, and games. One can even communicate with people online from across the globe! However, what if we did not have computers? In the event that a serious crime occurred, we would be unable to obtain the criminal's name or his records! Some negative aspects of having computers are significant issues, notably cyberbullying! Children may be targeted. People are constantly subjected to name - calling. Another major problem is that online, some individuals may seem friendly but then attempt to deceive. There are two significant problems associated with computers, namely plagiarism. Plagiarism occurs when one takes someone else's work and claims it as their own. It can also involve stealing and presenting it as one's own creation. The second problem is the unauthorized downloading of music for free from the internet, such as through Lime Wire. As a result, the artists do not receive the revenue from the albums. That is why I believe computers offer benefits, yet they also have drawbacks. One must be cautious when using a computer.
1238	1242	1	1	Dear all computer enthusiasts, I firmly believe that you are all spending an excessive amount of time on the computer. Undoubtedly, it is beneficial to access the computer to acquire new knowledge, watch amusing videos, and considering that nowadays, almost everything is available on the computer. Nevertheless, most individuals spend an inordinate amount of time on it. You ought to engage in three activities: appreciating nature, spending time with family and friends, and most importantly, exercising. In this letter, I will elucidate why you need these aspects, which cannot be obtained from the computer. Firstly, I will explain the significance of appreciating nature. At times, appreciating nature can be challenging, but if we all observe more closely, it can be truly enjoyable. Examples of nature include trees, grass, and the fresh air. However, I am certain that all my fellow teenagers would concur that this seems rather dull, and we would all prefer to sit and watch television. Some ways to make nature enjoyable include climbing a tree instead of merely gazing at it, or going outside to play with your dog and lying in the grass. One of my favorite activities in nature is when I stay up all night and then venture outside very early to lie in the grass, inhale the fresh air, and watch the sun rise. Secondly, it is extremely important that you disengage from the computer and spend time with family and friends. Family can engage in @MONTH1 activities with you, and I know that I am extremely happy when I am with my family because they always make me laugh, and most importantly, my family loves to have parties. Parties are always enjoyable, especially when you are with your family. Friends are also wonderful to be with as they make you laugh, embark on adventures, and are always there for you.
1239	1243	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I opine that the impact that computers are having on people is a @CAPS1 phenomenon because most individuals simply remain seated at their computers throughout the day. In this letter, I will discuss the effects of computers on people, the alternative activities we could pursue, and the actions people engage in on the computer. Firstly, computers are having a @CAPS1 impact on people and their lives. Computers are causing people to remain indoors, glued to their computers all day, doing nothing productive. They just sit there playing games, and approximately @PERCENT1 of the individuals who spend an excessive amount of time on the computer are probably gaining weight while they are on it, which is why some people @MONTH1 become overweight. Most of the people who spend all their time on the computer are in their @NUM1's and @NUM2's, while some are in their @NUM3's or @NUM4's. Merely sitting at the computer will lead you nowhere in life. It will not secure you a job or provide you with a school education. By sitting at the computer for an extended period, you will be unable to engage in outdoor activities. If so many people were not constantly on the computer, they could be outdoors. When outside, they can play sports, ride bicycles, swim, run, and engage in other activities. They could also obtain a job and earn some money or attend college. Children who spend too much time on the computer could go to the mall, hang out with friends, get some exercise, or simply enjoy nature. There is no purpose in spending more than @NUM5 or @NUM6 hours on the computer. The maximum time one should spend on the computer is an hour to an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only use the computer for homework, and the rest of the time, they should engage in other activities. All kids from grades through @NUM7 should go outside and play with their toys, and those in @NUM8 grade and above should socialize, such as going to the mall, watching a movie, or having a sleepover. Additionally, everyone in these grades should interact more with their families by seeing them more than @NUM7/@NUM8 times a month and could have parties or simply gather and socialize. Therefore, people should engage in some of the other activities I have mentioned instead of spending all their time on the computer. The final aspect is the activities people engage in on the computer. For instance, I sometimes use Facebook. Other people use Facebook, Google, play games, search for information, and more. They also have email accounts to chat with others. Another popular platform is YouTube, where people listen to music and watch videos. So, I do not believe that the impact of computers on people is a positive one. I think that people should be out and about doing things rather than just sitting at home on the computer. Those who sit at home on computers could, and probably will, become overweight. Thus, the impact of computers on people is @CAPS1.
1240	1244	1	1	Dear editor, I am of the view that computers are an excellent and engaging tool. However, I also believe that people can spend an excessive amount of time on them. The computer is highly proficient. People can utilize it to type papers or reports, create graphs, and perform other important tasks for us. Schools are increasingly incorporating computers into their systems. Schools maintain websites for students to access their homework, classwork, projects, reports, and extra - credit assignments. The school has even initiated a novel practice, allowing parents and children to check the students' grades online. Not only do schools benefit students, but ordinary people also gain from computer usage. If a student has a project but is unsure how to commence it, he or she can search for the project and ways to start it on Google. As you can observe, computers can be truly remarkable and user - friendly for schoolwork. Computers are not only valuable for academic purposes but also for leisure activities. Prior to the advent of computers and the internet, there were only a limited number of ways to have fun during dull moments of the day. One option was watching television, reading a book, or going outside, if feasible. What do I mean by that last statement? If you resided in a city, it would be more challenging to go outside, perhaps because you lived in an apartment or in an area lacking a sense of community. Then, you would be unable to venture out; moreover, reading books can become tiresome after a while, and there might be nothing on television that interests you. However, with the emergence of computers and the internet, people can play games, watch videos, and communicate with cousins or family members who live far away. Computers are also beneficial for social networking. Not all families live in close proximity, yet they maintain strong family bonds. However, in this economy, we cannot always afford to visit them whenever we desire. Therefore, by using computers, we can connect with them on Facebook, MySpace, and even engage in video chats, which, as I mentioned, is ideal for staying in touch with distant family members. Nevertheless, at times, people can become overly obsessed with them. Some individuals spend the entire day on one website, particularly Facebook or YouTube. Do not misunderstand me; these websites are enjoyable and interesting. However, they are not so captivating that one should forgo going outside and experiencing free, natural fun. I recall logging into Facebook and seeing a girl online. I logged off approximately an hour later, and she was still online. Then, I logged in again around @TIME1, and the same girl was still there! Spending that much time on one website is excessive. Computers are a remarkable tool for humans to utilize for business, education, and leisure. However, excessive use is not advisable.
1241	1245	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently learned via @CAPS2 @NUM1 @CAPS3 that individuals believe computers exert diverse effects on people. Historically, computers have precipitated issues concerning the human body. Numerous @CAPS5 are becoming overly reliant on computers. Thus, in my view, computers have a negative impact. Firstly, computers have led @CAPS5 to neglect exercise and deteriorate in health. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS5 have reported that their @CAPS5 are spending excessive time on the computer. @CAPS5 need to recognize that prolonged computer use poses a threat to their health. Do you want your @CAPS5 to develop eye problems? People often spend excessive time on the computer, not only for work but also for gaming. I am aware that I must cease and engage in outdoor exercise to maintain a well - balanced health. @PERSON1 states, ""@CAPS4 technology advances, and the number of people requiring glasses increases."" @CAPS5 need to modify their daily activities. So, @CAPS4, I oppose computers because @CAPS5 are becoming unhealthy. Moreover, people do not spend sufficient time with family and friends. In the past, my mom used to scold me. @PERCENT1 of people believe social interaction is crucial; did you know that? Excessive computer use can lead to marital discord. People need to enhance family interaction as it diminishes when computers are overused. My final point is that people are not connecting with nature. @NUM4 out of @NUM3 people enjoy nature; it offers an opportunity to express thoughts. Many individuals need time to reflect on their lives, which they cannot do with the internet. In the past, I was stressed as I never had time to relax and think while constantly using the computer for tasks or homework. @PERCENT2 of people with busy lives believe they are affected. Can you now see that nature can be beneficial? Therefore, @CAPS4, it is evident that computers have a negative effect as people do not have enough time to enjoy nature. In conclusion, I firmly believe computers have a substantial negative impact on people. The reasons are that people become less active, interact less effectively, and fail to enjoy nature. Hence, I strongly urge you to vote against the positive effects of computers."
1242	1246	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1. I am enrolled at @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1, currently in @NUM1 grade. I am writing this letter to convey my opinion on whether technology has a positive effect on people. My stance is that computers are advantageous. They have the potential to transform people's lives in <@NUM2 @LOCATION1</@CAPS2>. My first reason is that computers cultivate hand - eye coordination. For instance, when I was in @NUM3 grade, I would visit the library at my @ORGANIZATION1. It had a website named @CAPS3 for learning, which assisted in learning to type without looking at the keyboard. My second reason is that computers endow people with the ability to explore distant places and cultures. For example, when I was in @NUM4 grade in @CAPS4 @CAPS5, I had to write about @CAPS6. I accessed @ORGANIZATION2 and discovered remarkable pictures of @CAPS7, observing their way of life. I watched a @CAPS8 special approximately @NUM5 weeks ago, which reported that @PERCENT1 of people use @ORGANIZATION2 to search for personal information. My third reason is that computers enable communication with distant individuals. For example, when I wish to converse with my cousin residing in @LOCATION3, I use the internet and webcam to communicate. I read an article about a month ago stating that @PERCENT1 of people use the computer for online chats. In conclusion, some may argue that experts are concerned about people spending excessive time on computers and less time exercising, socializing with friends and family. However, using the computer is a safer alternative than going outdoors, ensuring greater safety for more kids and people. I hope you will publish this in your newspaper.
1243	1247	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1's opinion on computers is that they are the most beneficial asset in our society, offering significant advantages. Suppose one desires to visualize the world's distant corners or the surfaces of the moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, etc. One can simply access a computer, open or download a program, and obtain the information. Computers also facilitate the expression of creativity through various programs that allow drawing or building. I believe they even contribute to the intellectual development of young children by enabling them to create on the computer. Additionally, computers create numerous job opportunities, which are invaluable in a challenging economy. With computers, one can support medical diagnoses, identify broken bones or tumors, and design blueprints for bridges and homes. The most significant benefit of computers is their role in education. Through simulations of the Titanic, spaceships, or floods, they help users acquire knowledge. They also provide access to information about people and can even save lives by locating plane crash sites. Therefore, computers are the most helpful tools as of @DATE1, and we should continue to learn and innovate to advance further.
1244	1248	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers exert a positive influence on people. Computers offer a multitude of functions, such as facilitating learning about almost every aspect of the world. Moreover, there are programs on computers that enable communication with others. For adults, computers provide the convenience of managing finances, paying bills, and handling taxes online. Undoubtedly, computers have a positive impact on people. A large number of individuals utilize computers to acquire new knowledge about various subjects and people. Nine out of ten people access the computer at least once a month to learn something new. In schools, children frequently use computers for academic tasks and to explore new concepts. They engage in projects and experiments using computers, thereby gaining insights into people and the world. Clearly, computers have a positive effect when it comes to learning. Another remarkable aspect of computers is the availability of communication programs. Eight out of ten people communicate with others on the computer almost daily. This is highly beneficial as it allows people to connect with friends and family over long distances and enjoy meaningful interactions. It is also useful when family members relocate; one can still maintain contact via the computer. Additionally, computers offer a positive advantage for adults by enabling them to handle financial matters online. Seven out of ten adults pay their bills using their computers. This is a significant improvement as it eliminates the need for manual processing, which is undoubtedly a positive development for individuals. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people in numerous ways. They aid in knowledge acquisition, facilitate communication with loved ones, and simplify financial management. There are many other ways in which computers benefit people; I have only highlighted a few. I sincerely hope you will share my view that computers have a positive influence on people.
1245	1249	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, do you maintain contact using computers, and how do computers impact your work? Some individuals overuse computers and fail to appreciate the outdoors. Others use computers for non - essential purposes, sometimes wasting time. I firmly believe computers have a profound positive impact on people. They enable communication, facilitate learning, and provide entertainment. Computers play a crucial role in our society, and I trust you will make the right judgment regarding their appropriate use. Regarding communication, computers allow not only contact with relatives but also with people from different countries, states, or even neighbors. Email is an excellent and efficient means of communication. There are also platforms like Facebook and Skype where one can share pictures of family and personal experiences securely. Even if you are miles apart, you can easily show friends your recent activities or introduce your new - born. @CAPS4 also provides personal information sharing. You can make friends and plan social gatherings. Yesterday, my @CAPS2 emailed me a picture of a cub bear in a tree near his cabin. He is over @NUM1 hours away, yet I could instantly reply, ""@CAPS2, did you make a friend?"" He responded promptly, ""I even got a bear hug =)!"" Through email, we feel connected despite the distance. It is a fast and convenient way to communicate. In terms of learning, computers are integral to the educational process. Teachers, students, parents, and grandparents all learn from computers daily. There are numerous educational websites. For example, in our school, we use ""quiz.com,"" a platform for schools where quizzes can be taken online instead of on paper. Busy parents can work and earn online. They can also pursue online education. People with busy schedules who cannot attend college classes can take online courses and interact with others. Computers are educational tools, not harmful devices. They assist in various aspects, including security, job - hunting, bill - paying, schooling, and socializing. Most schools and businesses rely on computers. They protect and support personal growth. For entertainment, many people play games on multiple websites. These games can be a source of enjoyment and time - passing. Even if one is not physically active, the computer offers a wealth of entertainment options, such as playing games, downloading music, video - chatting, browsing, and shopping. Meeting new people online is also popular. My cousin, @NUM2, met his wife through online dating and is now happily married. Computers can be a source of love and fun. After considering these points, it is clear that computers are essential. Most people, schools, and businesses cannot function without them. They safeguard and contribute to personal development. In conclusion, I am confident that you are now convinced of the positive impact of computers on people."
1246	1250	1	1	"Dear The @CAPS1 newspaper, @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 @CAPS1 after @CAPS1. Oh, how one yearns to simply unwind in the unconfined natural air; however, with all the technological advancements, one feels compelled to remain perpetually updated. I am of the opinion that technological advancements have exerted a detrimental influence on individuals. People are neither engaging in physical exercise, interacting in person with family and friends, nor capable of appreciating nature. Exercising entails elevating one's heart rate, inducing perspiration, and for me, the release of endorphins that ultimately enhance one's well - being. @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 all @CAPS1 does not stimulate the innate urge to exercise. Proponents of technological advancements assert, ""@CAPS3 are capable of imparting hand - eye coordination."" Nevertheless, while coordination is significant, one must also consider the well - being of the entire body. @PERSON1, voted # @NUM1 cardiologist in the world, remarks, ""Annually, an increasing number of people are afflicted with heart disease and heart attacks!"" He further states, ""Numerous links to this ongoing problem have been hypothesized, yet none seem as plausible as my theory. I believe that people's lives have been overtaken by technology. An escalating number of cases indicate that people are addicted to their computers. Incredibly, @CAPS5 individuals have a @PERCENT2 higher probability of developing heart disease!! There are numerous healthier pursuits one can immerse oneself in. Take tennis, for example. In tennis, one must develop hand - eye coordination to strike the ball accurately. Tennis also elevates the heart rate and burns fat cells, aiding in weight loss. Statistics reveal that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 individuals claim that tennis has enhanced their self - confidence. This is because when people possess the determination to lose weight and lead a healthier lifestyle, they feel capable of conquering the world. Is this not the attitude everyone should adopt? Nature is ubiquitous and benefits us even if @CAPS4 fails to notice. Trees, for instance, absorb @NUM4 and release oxygen. Oxygen is essential for life. Trees also serve as habitats for numerous living organisms, such as the sapsucker woodpecker or even owls. They all depend on trees for survival. However, if one is on the @CAPS3 @NUM5 hours a @CAPS1 @DATE1, one may not appreciate nature. Nature is a magnificent phenomenon, and over @PERCENT3 of people assert that they relish relaxing outdoors, listening to birds chirping in the morning or observing a deer tending to its young. Regrettably, technological advancements also disrupt the ecological balance of nature. Technology necessitates a power source. Google, for example, informed the press, ""Our business indeed appreciates nature but also needs to operate its corporation."" They further stated, ""We obtain our energy from oil and coal."" @CAPS5, according to scientists like Boy, indicates that oil is the primary energy source for large corporations. While this may be the case, they overlook the fact that over a million [unclear what is meant here] each year due to... And this depletes the protection provided by our ozone layer, accelerating the onset of climate change. ""Without technological advancements, we would have a safer and more sustainable earth for future generations."" Oh, Sue remarks sarcastically. But since you're texting her, you're unaware of what to ask. If not for technological advancements, people could make more prudent decisions. @PERCENT4 of texters claim to have misinterpreted others' texts, leading to poor decision - making globally. @PERCENT1 also admit to participating in sexting, such as sending inappropriate pictures. Underage children are engaging in illegal activities due to technological advancements. The chief of the police department in @ORGANIZATION1 states that since the invention of cell phones with picture - and text - sending capabilities, he has witnessed @NUM6 more cases of child pornography. @PERCENT5 of @CAPS5 people are underage. Without the advancements in cell phone technology, this would not be possible for minors. Technological advancements in cellular devices have also distanced families. @PERCENT6 of parents claim that their children have less appreciation and respect than before they received cell phones. And @PERCENT1 of children with cell phones assert that they no longer require family interaction. Do you believe this is the message we should convey to future generations? I appreciate your reading this article and hope you now recognize the other side of the debate. Children need more family interaction, to appreciate nature, and to engage in physical exercise. This is unattainable with excessive technological advancements."
1247	1251	1	1	There exists a diverse array of computers; however, they all serve a common purpose. Computers assist individuals in fulfilling a wide range of needs. For example, one can access the internet to engage in conversations with others, conduct buying and selling activities, pursue online college education, acquire knowledge on virtually any subject, and neatly type up homework. Personally, I contend that computers are highly beneficial, and we are fortunate to have them. Surfing the internet presents numerous opportunities in various domains. It enables individuals to enroll in online college courses when they lack the time to attend in person, or simply to communicate with friends. One can acquire a vast amount of knowledge on the computer, and it is an extremely enjoyable experience. For most people I know, the computer is one of the greatest inventions, second only to the most obvious ones. Enrolling in online college courses is remarkably straightforward. A significant number of individuals in the country opt for online college education. For instance, parents who wish to resume their studies but are unable to attend in person, or individuals with a heavy workload who cannot allocate sufficient time for traditional college attendance, can take advantage of online courses during their free time. Additionally, communicating with friends online is also a pleasant experience. When one is not physically present at a friend's residence, online communication platforms such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or email can be utilized. The computer offers numerous avenues for online interaction. The computer is also replete with a wealth of information that is beneficial to people worldwide. One can learn about different countries, cultures, and even discover the recipe for apple pie. The possibilities for learning on the computer are endless. The computer caters to the diverse interests of individuals across the globe. Given our differences, some people prefer to engage in buying and selling activities on the computer, while others use it for homework or simply enjoy playing computer games. Although people have distinct preferences, one thing is common: the world recognizes the necessity of computers, and computers are regarded as one of the most intelligent inventions since the calculator. Conducting buying and selling transactions on the computer is more straightforward than it appears. All one needs to do is list the items they wish to sell online or search for the items they desire to purchase. Subsequently, the transaction can be completed. While there are additional aspects to the process, such as the involvement of @ORGANIZATION1 personnel for delivery or pickup, these are the fundamental steps. Moreover, if one has messy handwriting, the computer can be used to neatly type up homework. In conclusion, the computer offers a multitude of benefits that can enhance the lives of individuals and contribute to the development of the world.
1248	1252	1	1	To Whom It May Concern, @CAPS1. My name is @PERSON1. I am writing in response to the letter regarding electronics, specifically computers. In my view, computers, while useful, are also extremely pernicious. These metallic apparatuses are not only exorbitantly priced but also detrimental to health and impede human learning capabilities. The numerous negative aspects of computers are difficult to overlook. Renowned computer companies such as Dell and @ORGANIZATION1 sell computers at outrageously high prices. One may purchase a computer on sale, only to encounter malfunctions and problems when it is most needed. @CAPS2! In such cases, one is compelled to call a repair technician, incurring additional expenses. Is it truly worthwhile to spend hard - earned money on a defective piece of equipment? This is utterly preposterous. I experienced this firsthand when my six - hundred - dollar computer crashed yesterday. I have decided that once I dispose of my current computer, I will not replace it. Have you ever sat in front of your computer for an extended period, causing your eyes to water? This is an unpleasant experience, and it is not the only problem associated with computer use. Your health is at risk! When you choose to sit at your computer, either working or playing, instead of engaging in physical activities such as jogging or exercise, your health deteriorates. Weight gain, pink eye from prolonged screen time, and other health issues are just a few examples. The very computer that you may cherish can have a detrimental impact on your well - being. I urge you to discard your computer, visit friends, family, and acquaintances, and lead an active and healthy lifestyle. This is not for my benefit but for yours. The next point I am about to make may shock, surprise, or alarm you. Your computer is making you intellectually lazy. I cannot sugarcoat it. Please do not consider me rude, as this is a harsh reality. Let me provide an example. A student is assigned a typical homework task: define three or four words. Seemingly easy, right? Unfortunately, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 surveyed students resort to using computers to obtain the answers. What if your child is cheating? What consequences will this have for their future? They may drop out of school prematurely and struggle to develop independent learning skills. Is this the kind of world we want for our children? Certainly not! We should eliminate the over - reliance on computers. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. It has been a pleasure corresponding with you. I wish you a pleasant day.
1249	1253	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers are detrimental. People become so engrossed in computer games that they neglect their homework. Moreover, they develop an addiction to computers, which is highly perilous. When using the computer, one may interact with strangers, and this is as dangerous as having a MySpace account. There are malicious individuals on the computer who post inappropriate content.
1250	1254	1	1	I firmly oppose the notion that computers are beneficial to society. There are three primary reasons why computers can be detrimental. Firstly, people become overly attached to computers and neglect spending quality time with their families. For instance, when a young girl wishes to play with her elder sister, the sister may ignore her and continue emailing friends on the computer. Family unity is crucial, yet computers often disrupt family activities such as picnics. The addictive nature of computer games causes individuals to ignore their family members, which can lead to depression in some cases. Secondly, computers pose significant health risks. People who are overly addicted to computers tend to lead sedentary lifestyles. They sit in front of the computer for extended periods, consuming unhealthy food and beverages. This can result in weight gain, diabetes, heart problems, and other serious health conditions. If one's weight reaches an extreme level, it may become difficult to lose weight as the body becomes accustomed to the excess weight, and the heart may not be able to tolerate the strain. Lastly, excessive computer use causes people to abandon outdoor activities. People should at least venture outside daily to experience nature, breathe fresh air, and socialize with friends. Going to the beach to relax can alleviate stress from computer games. Prolonged computer use can lead to high stress levels, which may cause depression. Sitting in the dark and lacking sunlight while using the computer can also harm one's eyesight. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers are numerous, and most of these issues are related to health. Therefore, I firmly believe that excessive computer use is detrimental to society. I sincerely hope that you will take these concerns into consideration. Thank you.
1251	1255	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I perused an article in the publication on @DATE1 deliberating whether computers exert a positive or negative influence on individuals. Despite my fondness for my computer, I am cognizant that computers can have an adverse impact on people. Computers can lead to a dearth of physical activity, a paucity of time spent with family and friends, and a lack of appreciation for nature. Although computers can assist people in numerous ways, they can also exacerbate matters for individuals. In @LOCATION1, the obesity rate has reached an all - time high of @PERCENT1. Using a computer is a sedentary activity; thus, if one uses it, they get no exercise. Once, I spent two consecutive hours on the computer and gained two pounds. One's health is also of utmost importance. When one becomes overweight, they are at risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was recently diagnosed with diabetes, and now he regrets the excessive time he devoted to his computer. Lastly, some people in @MONTH1 claim that computers foster excellent hand - eye coordination. While computers might do so, is this hand - eye coordination ever utilized? No, because that person is too engrossed in playing on the computer. Can you perceive how computers can affect your health? Eighty - eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most significant aspect of their lives was their family and friends. The remaining twelve percent stated that their computer or cell phone was the most important thing in their life as they could not live without it. Failing to spend time with family and friends is a lamentable act. When my mother lost contact with one of her new friends, @CAPS2 regretted not spending more time with them. Additionally, if one does not interact with people, it can lead to socialization problems. If the only form of communication is via the computer, one may develop speech problems. My neighbor, whom I have never conversed with, rarely left his house; he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one ever visited. One day, someone came over and they started talking outside. When I overheard a snippet of their conversation, I could discern that he had difficulty articulating words and did not possess a good vocabulary. Lastly, one can also encounter relationship problems. Inability to experience a genuine relationship is a consequence. That is why computers can have a negative impact not only on you but also on your family and friends. In our daily lives, we observe the beauty of nature. Squandering time on the computer instead of relishing nature is deplorable. For instance, if I were to stay indoors all day and spend my time on the computer, I would be wretched. Nature is a gift that should be bestowed upon everyone. Moreover, the @CAPS3 air is beneficial for your body. Without @CAPS3 air, one would be inhaling chemically - altered air, which is detrimental to the body. Lastly, everyone reads about @CAPS4 warming on the internet, yet why do we not take action? If you spend your time on the computer, you will not be able to aid nature. I recall when I read about @CAPS4 warming on the computer. Subsequently, I took action and cleaned our lakes. That is why computers have a negative impact on people. Computers can be advantageous in many respects, but it is the excessive time one devotes to the computer that is problematic. That is why computers have a negative impact on our society.
1252	1256	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, As of @DATE1, the world has undergone a remarkable transformation for the better. Technology has advanced to such an extent that there are novel cures for various diseases. Computers are among these remarkable boons. They enable expedited communication. One can stay in touch with family members and old friends. One can also converse with individuals residing in another state, country, or continent. There is a quote that states, ""Communication is key."" I shall elaborate on this in the subsequent paragraph. I recall a time long ago when the sole means of communication were letters or physical travel. Now, with computers, with just an email or an instant message, someone can receive your message promptly. Sending a letter can be time - consuming. Even if you call someone, they @MONTH1 may not be at home or answer. However, emails and instant messages can be received at any time. Moreover, it does not incur long - distance charges. This leads me to my next topic. A professor at @ORGANIZATION2 once remarked, ""Computers are consuming time."" However, upon reflection, what computers are actually doing is reestablishing connections with family members and old friends. For example, you @MONTH1 may relocate and be unable to see them again. Then, you obtain a new phone number and forget others' numbers. If you have a computer, you can access a remarkable social networking site where you can search for the names of old friends and distant relatives, and discover that it is truly them. Then, they introduce you to other family members, and before you know it, you are all connected again. Now, I shall present my @DATE1 topic. The World Wide Web is a vast expanse where people from all corners of the globe converge. On the World Wide Web, you can encounter new individuals who do not reside in your state or country. You may find that you hit it off with this person, even if they @MONTH1 belong to a different race. That is perfectly fine; you can learn new things about a different culture. While you two @MONTH1 may have something in common, you can share other interests and try new activities, thereby learning something new while having fun. Now, you can see that it is time for you to acquire a computer rather than forgo the experience. With a computer, you can communicate more rapidly. You can reconnect with distant relatives and old friends. You can also engage in conversations with like - minded individuals."
1253	1257	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, you are aware that computers are an integral part of our society. Since the advent of the first computer, they have been significantly enhanced to the point where a keyboard is no longer necessary. The presence of computers benefits our society as it allows us to gain knowledge about technology and develop memorization skills when we engage in extensive typing. One has the opportunity to learn about subjects of interest. Moreover, as an added advantage, one can communicate with people from across the globe. Every day presents an opportunity to learn something new! Learning extensively now will prove beneficial in the long run! This is what teachers consistently emphasize. Well, computers fulfill precisely this function. Computers can serve as educators! The more one uses a computer, the more knowledgeable one becomes about it. One can learn about its construction and the viruses it may harbor. Computers can also impart knowledge in ways one may never have contemplated. When one sits at a computer and types, they begin to memorize the locations of specific letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. Now, you @MONTH1 may inquire about young children. How do they learn from computers? There are millions of educational games available for children, which can assist them in learning even before preschool. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all children who commence playing educational games prior to entering preschool are ahead. How remarkable is that? Both children and adults utilize computers. When children use computers, they engage in activities they enjoy. For example, my brother is extremely interested in parkour. Parkour involves individuals performing flips off buildings, walls, or any available structures. When he uses the computer, he searches for different parkour tricks he can perform or learn. For adults, computers are used for work. They may need to research information for a meeting or a business they are associated with. Using computers can be enjoyable for some and a means of work for others. Regardless, they are using computers in a manner that can be advantageous in the future. Communication is one of the primary reasons people use computers. There are email, @CAPS3, Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, and numerous other platforms. If you were to randomly select ten people on the street and ask them if they have a Facebook account, @PERCENT2 of them will respond affirmatively. Communication is crucial in both business and relationships. In the case of relationships such as those with family and friends, having a computer to communicate with them when they are far away is invaluable. For businesses, communication is also essential. Computers have been and will continue to be a significant part of our society. The computers help us in areas such as learning, communication, and work. Recognizing that this technology can contribute to our success is truly remarkable.
1254	1258	1	1	Dear readers, In the ongoing debate regarding the effects of computers, I firmly believe that they offer substantial benefits to all individuals. For instance, modern computers can incorporate business software, enabling meetings to be conducted via the computer. This is not only convenient but also cost - effective. Additionally, computers are equipped with built - in programs that can assist in tracking expenses. These programs are user - friendly and time - saving. Moreover, computers facilitate staying in touch with friends. Even if they are @NUM1 miles away, you can simply click a button and engage in a live video chat! Firstly, the business software on new computers is truly remarkable. You can create brochures detailing sales and expenses with a simple mouse click. This is a more economical and environmentally friendly way of presenting ideas. Furthermore, on the computer, you and your clients can hold a conference call. This allows you to relax and multitask while your computer provides crystal - clear audio of the call. Unlike traditional phone calls where you have to hold the phone to your ear, this method is hands - free. Another situation where computers prove useful is during tax season. Tired of rummaging through your house to find a car bill from three months ago? Well, with a spreadsheet software like @ORGANIZATION1, taxes can be calculated along with their corresponding details, so when you visit a tax consultant, everything is well - organized. Utilizing these tools reduces stress and leaves you less frustrated. Even better, you can purchase a tax program for your computer, enabling you to handle your taxes from the comfort of your couch! Consider the cost of paying someone to calculate your taxes year after year when you can save a substantial amount and do it yourself. Above all, computers help you reconnect with old friends who have moved away or drifted apart. The internet now hosts numerous social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, where you can reunite with lost friends. These networks also provide access to photo - sharing and chat features, allowing everyone to keep abreast of each other's family situations. In addition, video chatting enables face - to - face conversations with someone on the other side of the world. This is completely private, so it is safe to mention the names of family members or their locations. The internet truly is an extraordinary tool! In conclusion, the internet plays a vital role in our daily lives. Not only can we follow the outcome of the @ORGANIZATION2 game, but it also offers interactive business software. Work will never be as arduous again. Moreover, the computer has programs to help you manage expenses, keeping you in control. Finally, it provides numerous tools for interacting with friends thousands of miles away. I firmly believe that the computer is essential for success and happiness in life. It is a new era, and we should embrace it.
1255	1259	1	1	To whom it may concern, @CAPS1, envision your life without a laptop or a desktop computer. It would be chaotic, wouldn't it? How would you keep up with your emails or write articles for this newspaper? Although some individuals @MONTH1 may believe that computers are detracting from exercise, the enjoyment of nature, and time spent with family and friends, computers actually have a positive impact on us. The reasons for this are numerous, but three prominent ones are that you can communicate with people in other states or countries, learning from a website is more engaging than from a textbook, and eventually, @CAPS2 will be computerized anyway. Am I correct? Have your former teachers ever assigned you a pen pal in another state or country? If so, didn't you have to write letters? Then, you had to wait at least @NUM1 weeks before receiving a response from your pen pal. If you had used computers, you would have received a reply within days. I am aware that many parents and other adults @MONTH1 may think that emails are a waste of effort, but in reality, they are far faster than letters. Has your daughter or son ever told you that reading from a textbook is boring? Whether the answer is yes or no, this is where computers come in. Using the internet is much more interesting than reading a book. I understand that some students can read a book and retain all the information, but many students learn differently. If a student learns from the internet, they are more likely to remember the information because they won't be bored to sleep by a textbook. Many people have noted, and some statistics indicate that by at least @DATE1, @CAPS2 will be computerized. Do you really want to be left behind? I wouldn't. I understand that you are someone who likes to stay informed about current events, so why not make more use of your computer? When they refer to @CAPS2, they truly mean @CAPS2. There are even @CAPS3 tools available on computers. I encourage you to conduct a survey to determine how many people find computers effective, and you will be astonished. Many people will share the same view as mine. The choice is yours. Which side are you on? Thank you.
1256	1260	1	1	Dear local newspaper, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, a student in the @NUM1 grade at @CAPS5 @CAPS6 in @LOCATION1. I am writing to you because I have noticed that an increasing number of individuals are utilizing computers; however, not everyone concurs that this trend benefits society. In my view, computers do bring about positive impacts on society. As you continue reading, I will elucidate the reasons. Firstly, computers exert a positive influence on people. For instance, when I observe my elder brother using a computer, he appears more knowledgeable. Approximately @NUM2 out of @NUM3 family members acquire knowledge from the computer. Secondly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination. When I play computer games, my hands are actively engaged. (As an illustration, when I watch a game, my hands are in constant motion.) Around @NUM4 out of @NUM3 individuals play computer games, relying on their hands to perform various actions. Thirdly, computers endow people with the ability to learn. For example, when I use the computer, it imparts a vast amount of knowledge, and I often spend a significant amount of time on it. About @NUM6 out of @NUM3 students study using computers and learn about things they were previously unaware of. They also have the capacity to learn more on the computer. Some might argue that people are spending excessive time on computers. Nevertheless, I contend that computers assist people in learning about global events. For example, they can learn about ongoing wars and how people are risking their lives for a cause. In conclusion, in my opinion, computers benefit society. They have a positive impact, improve hand - eye coordination, and endow people with learning capabilities. I believe you should offer full support to address this matter.
1257	1261	1	1	Have you ever experienced the situation where someone close to you moved away, and you desired to maintain communication? Owning a computer facilitates such connections. Moreover, it enables students to explore diverse places, people, and much more. However, why do some individuals refrain from using computers? Firstly, computers allow individuals to communicate online with friends and family. For example, through email, instant messaging, and video chat. I have a friend who relocated, and we now exchange emails to stay in touch. Instant messaging enables people to chat in real - time and share pictures and videos. For example, my @CAPS2 @CAPS3 shares pictures of my baby cousins so that everyone can witness their growth. Additionally, some businesses utilize webcams for communication. Suppose a boss is away but wishes to monitor the progress of employees. He can connect a webcam and have a conversation with them. This is how computers enable people to stay connected. Secondly, computers empower people to acquire knowledge. For instance, if a student needs to research a topic, they can type it into a search engine like Bing or Google and obtain all the necessary information for their project. If a family plans a trip, they can search for destinations, find hotels, and discover attractions. This is how computers assist people. Furthermore, computers help with tasks such as typing papers, enabling the reader to clearly read the text. They also simplify tax - paying processes. For example, TurboTax is an online program that allows people to pay taxes online and keeps a record of all paid taxes. So, if a company sends a notice claiming unpaid bills, one can check on TurboTax. Reader, these are some reasons why people should embrace computers. They allow communication with friends and family via email, instant messaging, and webcam. They also provide the ability to learn about distant places and people. Lastly, what drawbacks are there to having a computer? They facilitate online tax payments and paper - typing. Computers are essential in modern times; otherwise, some people would struggle to cope. So, these are the reasons why people should readily adopt computers.
1258	1262	1	1	Dear local newspaper, have you ever observed that many individuals are constantly engrossed in their laptops or computers? When they are online, they completely neglect physical exercise. I have three reasons why people should reduce their computer usage. People may become ill, are likely to experience memory loss, and may fail to achieve the future they have always envisioned. My first reason is that excessive computer use can lead to health problems. For example, there are numerous individuals who consume large amounts of food while solely using their computers. Some people become obese as a result. Subsequently, they search the internet for weight - loss solutions but rarely take action. Some even consider online - sourced surgical options due to their obesity. They believe there is a quick fix for obesity on the internet, but in reality, the only effective solution is through physical activity. When people are surfing the web, they tend to forget many things. Some individuals spend almost their entire day or even their lives on the computer, lacking the initiative to engage in other activities. I have witnessed people forgetting their location, their identity, and even their family members. They also lose contact with their relatives. This is clearly not a favorable situation. My third and final reason is the lack of a promising future. Although some people apply for jobs from home using computers, the problem is that they do not get sufficient exercise and may not earn as much as those who work outside. Some people aspire to make changes in their lives but are unable to do so because they are addicted to computers. Some even require therapy to overcome their internet addiction. Do you want such an outcome? The risks of getting sick, experiencing memory loss, and having a bleak future are three compelling reasons for people to reduce computer use and start exercising. If I were addicted to my computer, I would not be able to receive an education or write this letter. Let's get some exercise. Together, we can bring about change and find a solution.
1259	1263	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that a greater number of people should commence using computers. Computers offer advantages that traditional writing on paper cannot provide, such as the ability to learn about topics not covered in school, communicate with friends online, and centralize information. The first reason I advocate for increased computer use is that they enable people to learn about subjects not typically taught in educational institutions. This includes current events, national history, and the functioning of the government. Some may argue that current events can be learned from @CAPS1 or newspapers. However, computers can present news in both written articles and video formats. In my opinion, online news is presented in a more comprehensive and visually appealing manner compared to @CAPS1. Another reason is that computers facilitate online communication with friends. This is particularly useful when friends move away. I had a friend who moved to Pittsburgh when I was @NUM1. After I created a @CAPS3 account, I was able to reconnect with him and communicate with him before his visit. It also helps in maintaining contact with friends who attend different schools. The final reason is that computers allow users to store pictures, videos, documents, and contacts on their hard drives. This is crucial for me as I am not well - organized when it comes to schoolwork. When I started using my computer to store and manage my work, it became less cluttered, and I could keep all my materials in one place. It also enables me to email my work to teachers or share notes with friends who missed school. In conclusion, these are the reasons why I believe more people should use computers. They aid in learning, facilitate communication with friends, and provide a centralized storage solution. That is why I think a larger number of people should embrace computer use.
1260	1264	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, computers do not exert a positive influence on individuals. Owing to computers, people are becoming less physically active, spending less time enjoying nature, and interacting less with family and friends. One reason for this is that people are neglecting exercise as they are overly occupied with computer games. This sedentary lifestyle is causing weight gain, which is already a prevalent issue in @LOCATION1 due to unnecessary technological advancements. There are numerous sports available, such as soccer, baseball, and football. People managed to stay active without computers in the past and were significantly more physically engaged. Another reason is that computers prevent people from enjoying nature. Instead of exploring the outdoors, people spend excessive time browsing pictures of beautiful places and animals online. They could easily take a stroll in the forest, a local park, or along the beach and encounter a wide variety of animals, not to mention the numerous plants and flowers they may have never noticed near their homes. Without computers, people would be more inclined to enjoy nature. Thirdly, computers impede face - to - face interaction. Some people are preoccupied with social media platforms like Facebook or MySpace, as well as emailing and @CAPS3 - ing each other. Sometimes, they may not even be communicating with the intended person, which is not only dangerous but also unhealthy. Why not make a phone call to someone far away? You can actually hear their voice and confirm their identity. It is absurd that people would email a friend who lives nearby. It would be much healthier and more convenient to visit them in person. The two can have a chat, take a walk, or play a game instead of sitting in front of a screen all day. In conclusion, computers lead to insufficient physical activity, less appreciation of nature, and reduced social interaction. They clearly do not have a positive impact on people. You should concur and restrict computer use to professionals.
1261	1265	1	1	In my estimation, computers exert a positive influence on individuals. Computers enable you to communicate seamlessly with people from any corner of the world. You can acquire knowledge about diverse places at a much swifter pace than if you were to peruse a book. Additionally, numerous jobs now seek individuals with computer proficiency. It is both entertaining and educational. Can you envision how arduous it would be to communicate with someone residing in, say, @LOCATION1? It would undoubtedly be far more challenging, wouldn't you concur? Thanks to computers, it is as effortless as powering on your device. Many educators relish conducting activities with pen - pals. This would be significantly more difficult if one had to write letters, and it would also incur a greater cost to make a call. Moreover, if you were in search of specific information about Florida, it is considerably easier on a computer. You simply input what you are looking for, rather than sifting through numerous books, where you might not even find the desired information. The computer also boasts millions of pieces of information and various pictures, which is advantageous. Another compelling reason is that in contemporary times, a multitude of jobs aim to hire individuals who know how to operate computers. You can perform a plethora of tasks on a computer that are unfeasible on a sheet of paper, such as creating animated movies and video games. These aspects have advanced over the years due to computers. Finally, not only is it educational, but it is also enjoyable. Certainly, you can conduct research and complete your homework on the computer, and you can also play games. Computers can execute a wide array of functions. They can be programmed to simulate jobs like those of policemen, ambulance drivers, and doctors, all of which save lives. This is why I believe computers have a positive impact on people. Without computers, our country likely would not have reached the level of advancement it has today.
1262	1266	1	1	Individuals utilize computers on a daily basis. There are numerous reasons why they are constantly engaged with them. They might be conversing with a family member. Moreover, they are probably in search of employment. There are a multitude of activities, and people should not be dictated on how to live their lives. Many residents in @LOCATION1 employ the computer to reconnect with old friends and catch up on events. They may also be in touch with family members. There is a technology called a webcam, which people in @LOCATION1 use to visually interact with one another. Business professionals are frequently on the computer as they need to print documents and may have to send materials to another country. They also conduct a substantial amount of work on the computer. They can still engage in exercise, such as a quick jog at @TIME1, but it is their prerogative whether to maintain good health, especially considering they are busy individuals. On the other hand, those who use the computer and are neither businesspeople nor communicating with family or old friends are students and parents. A large number of students in @LOCATION1 have daily projects and must use the computer to gather information. Parents, in turn, assist their children and may also communicate with relatives or search for a new home or job. If these people are occupied, they should be allowed to carry out their necessary tasks. Once they are finished, they can exercise, but if they choose not to and others urge them to engage in healthy activities like taking a walk, it is their loss. We cannot force them. They are simply becoming more reliant on computers each day, and this impacts them, not us. However, excessive computer use can lead to poor eyesight due to the excessive light exposure.
1263	1267	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my notice that several individuals are concerned about the technological boom and excessive computer usage. I can affirm that technological upgrades only bring harm to our population. Email and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have merely contributed to a decline in our already sub - par communication skills. Moreover, we spend increasingly less time engaging in outdoor exercise as we are ensnared in a technological revolution rife with inaccurate information. Why are we causing self - harm instead of providing assistance? It is evident that our teenagers are growing up lacking communication skills. I recall reading a persuasive essay and realizing that it employed @CAPS3 @CAPS4 - based language. It is preposterous that we are forgetting how to utilize the proper grammar of the @CAPS7 language. Additionally, I have noticed that when my friends converse, they use slang terms such as ""@CAPS8"" and ""@CAPS9"". I understand that computers offer a faster and more convenient means of communication, but we definitely cannot neglect the work of @CAPS10. Some people hope they won't become contestants on a weight - loss show, but if they continue to be engrossed in their computers, they will join the millions of obese Americans. I believe that when people are seated at their computers, they tend to consume junk food. In contrast, spending time with @ORGANIZATION2 instead of sitting in front of a computer, exercising, and unleashing one's creativity is a far better option. Would a citizen rather invest in a computer or enjoy the vast, free, and magnificent outdoors? Furthermore, people are squandering their valuable attention. A fact is that over a certain proportion of the information on the internet is unreliable. Statistics also indicate that nearly @PERCENT1 of students use certain websites. These statistics further show that when students use these sites, they will clearly score lower than a student who undertakes the so - called ""daunting"" task of conducting research in a textbook. What is so intimidating about this? Clearly, nothing is overwhelming. It is only rewarding when the student achieves an excellent grade while their classmates do not. Moreover, I question why people are filling their minds with unreliable information. In conclusion, the impact of computers on people is highly negative. As a result, many people lack communication skills, are more prone to obesity, and are harming themselves by being fixated on inaccurate information. I urge people to abandon @PERSON1 and @CAPS11 PC and embrace @ORGANIZATION2 Nature! She is magnificent."
1264	1268	1	1	Guess what! Are you fond of using computers? Well, I am, and I believe it confers benefits upon society for several reasons. It is advantageous for obtaining information about various matters, for meeting people, and for exploring the internet. If you continue reading @CAPS1, I will elucidate why I hold this view. One reason I think it benefits society is that in this era, one needs to be aware of global events. Instead of constantly watching the news or reading newspapers, you can access the internet to stay informed. This is why I believe it is beneficial to society today. A second reason is that having a computer enables people to communicate online and meet new individuals. You can converse with family and friends whom you haven't seen or heard from in a long time. Even if you don't have their phone numbers, you can talk to them while they are online. A third reason is that with a computer, you can explore the internet and acquire facts about people, things, and places that you were previously unaware of. By using the internet, you can learn more things than you ever knew before. A fourth reason is that having a computer allows you to attend school online. You don't have to leave your home as you can study from there. By doing so, most people can avoid getting into trouble as they are not leaving their residence. Unfortunately, I must conclude this letter. Given the numerous reasons and details I have provided regarding why I think having a computer is a good idea, I hope you will concur with me.
1265	1269	1	1	Dear editors, I had planned to embark on a journey to @LOCATION1. I swiftly obtained directions using a computer. Computers are remarkable, user - friendly devices. However, as technology progresses, people are increasingly relying on computers for entertainment. Some individuals in @MONTH1 may disagree, yet there are numerous outdoor activities that are more healthful than spending the entire day sitting in front of a computer, such as socializing, engaging in outdoor pursuits, and participating in sports. @CAPS1 is a well - known platform for social interaction, but it also presents significant risks. Did you know that anyone can view your profile, which contains personal information? You don't always have to chat online. You can call a friend and meet up at a local movie theater. Many people, and I concur, believe that watching a movie with friends is far more enjoyable than playing online chess or any other virtual game with a friend. Are you a movie enthusiast? No problem! You can go for a walk, a bike ride, or even take your dog out while cycling! There are countless options. @ORGANIZATION1 park is an incredible destination for a vacation. Camping at @TIME1, cycling during the day - it is a beautiful part of nature and one of the best parks in the world! Camping on the weekend is an excellent way to strengthen bonds with your family and friends. Hiking is a popular activity in parks and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. So, venture out and spend a weekend in the great outdoors instead of staring at a computer screen. Soccer, baseball, basketball, and lacrosse are just a few of the many enjoyable sports. They are not only fun but also beneficial for health. Every town I am acquainted with has sports fields that are utilized by children and adults of all ages. It is also a great way to make new friends! Get to know people in person rather than through the internet. Engaging in daily exercise while having fun is far superior to simply having fun on a computer. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this article and go out to meet new friends. Visit a local park or play a sport for enjoyment. If I were to enumerate all the activities one can do instead of using a computer, it would not fit in this entire newspaper. So, go and explore!
1266	1270	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I contend that computers exert an extremely beneficial influence on individuals. They enable people to cultivate hand - eye coordination, facilitate the exploration of distant peoples and cultures, and allow for online communication via email or instant messaging. All these factors serve as compelling justifications for computer usage. Computer skills are indispensable in diverse occupations, and there is no better time to start acquiring them than now. Hand - eye coordination is a crucial asset in life. It is required in various jobs, and in modern workplaces, such as an office, one must be able to monitor while typing. Online communication is highly popular today. @CAPS6, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 are merely a few among numerous websites where people can interact through instant messaging or email. All these platforms enable users to reconnect with family members, friends, and many others. One can keep in touch with a friend residing out - of - state or converse with someone from another country! Many individuals engage in this during their leisure time to arrange reunions with acquaintances from middle school through college. A large number of these people have not seen each other since @NUM1. Evidently, contacting others via the internet is widely embraced by people worldwide. As such, I advocate for the use of computers and firmly believe they are vital to people's daily lives. Whether it's developing hand - eye coordination, researching a country, or reaching out to family and friends through @CAPS3, @CAPS2, @CAPS6, the internet is highly prized, and I hope you concur.
1267	1271	1	1	The computer represents a remarkable feat of human achievement. It is an invaluable tool for rapid information retrieval and possesses numerous other capabilities. Although computers are an extremely useful asset in the contemporary world, they also have a detrimental impact on individuals. People are not getting sufficient physical activity because they are constantly engrossed in their computers. Additionally, they are becoming less socially engaged. The most significant and perhaps most adverse consequence is the excessive freedom people enjoy on the internet. Physical exercise is arguably one of the most essential elements for a long and healthy life. People should at least take a lengthy walk each day. If individuals spend the entire day sitting in front of a computer, there will be a greater number of unhealthy people. People should strive for a healthy lifestyle, rather than being surrounded by computers at every turn. People are also losing their ability to interact in person. Life is becoming monotonous. Everyone is either texting someone. The most astonishing aspect is the prevalence of online dating. This is concerning because one might be dating an unstable individual. If someone believes they are in love and when the couple meets, they do not know how to interact, then real problems arise. Even when one is simply using the computer, that time could be spent socializing with friends and family. Finally, there is an overwhelming amount of freedom associated with computers. There are numerous bullies, individuals trying to sell products, and those seeking personal information. Many children sign up for platforms like Facebook without being cautious. They disclose details such as their address and do not pay attention to who is sending them friend requests. Computers have far too many negative effects on people. It would be ideal if the system could be improved, and people need to be more accountable. People should desire to go out and interact. Take a walk. Simply do not let computers dominate your life.
1268	1272	1	1	Have you ever owned a computer? I am certain that if you are around my age, you are aware of the thrill of exploring the internet. It is a veritable repository of knowledge that offers information on virtually everything. However, it is not advisable to abandon all other activities and immerse yourself in computer use. Activities such as exercise, social interaction, and homework are of great significance. Failure to exercise leads to weight gain, and lack of socialization results in a solitary existence. Homework is the most crucial, as it equips you with the skills necessary for a successful life. Occasional computer use is acceptable, but extended hours are not. Exercise helps maintain physical fitness, and if you aspire to participate in sports, you should jog a few times a day. Some individuals may make you feel self - conscious if you are larger than them. For instance, I knew someone who was slightly overweight for his age, and others often ridiculed him. I recommend that you focus on more important matters than the computer. Do you have any friends? Or have they all distanced themselves from you because you were constantly surfing the web? As a teenager, you should be socializing with friends at the movies, arcades, and parties, rather than staying at home on the computer. This is especially true when it comes to family. You never know when they might be planning something for you; neglecting them is selfish. Since obtaining your computer, have your grades declined? Education is the cornerstone of a successful life. Without it, you cannot achieve your goals, as you will not have the qualifications to secure a job. If you lack a job, how can you pay the electricity bill for your computer? Education can open doors to countless opportunities if you pursue it. Otherwise, you risk becoming a homeless person with a non - functioning computer. Do you still believe that computer use has a positive impact on people? You should discuss with parents the responsible use of computers for their children. For example, suggest that parents set a password known only to them, so the child has to seek permission every time they need to use it. Block content that you deem inappropriate for your child, especially if they are curious about sensitive topics. This is why I believe computers do not always have the desired positive impact on people.
1269	1273	1	1	"Dear newspaper, envision the invigorating fresh air caressing your skin and the gentle breeze tousling your hair as you run alongside your best friend. Then, contemplate the millions of people who spend their time chatting on the computer. You may also wonder about the level of physical activity these individuals engage in and whether they are able to interact effectively with friends and family. Reflect on your own lifestyle: is it dominated by computer use or is it filled with outdoor and social experiences? When considering chatting, do you think of face - to - face communication or chatting via @CAPS2? I conducted a survey among friends, and the results showed that five out of ten go home and chat with friends online. This concerned me because this group mainly consisted of talkative kids, yet I am still trying to understand the underlying issue. I posed questions like ""What do you do at home?"" and ""Are you a computer enthusiast?"" (@CAPS2 questions were solely used to support my survey). The next time you are invited to chat online, decline to avoid becoming overly reliant on the computer. The amount of exercise a person gets varies from individual to individual. There are those who are constantly glued to their computers, like the characters in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (a Comcast commercial), and others who have little to no knowledge of computers (I am not passing judgment). I am here to highlight the benefits of exercise and discourage the over - reliance on computers. Did you know that exercise can help people lose weight? Picking up an old curling weight and doing one curl is far more beneficial than clicking a computer mouse. Interacting with others is an integral part of our lives. It is how we exchange information, give instructions, and is a much faster form of communication than sending an email. Lack of interaction can lead to depression. Depression can have severe physical and mental consequences. For example, my father, when @CAPS5 was divorced, the depression took a toll on his body and mind. At the age of @NUM1, @CAPS5 suffered a tear in his small intestine that became infected and could have been life - threatening. I believe this was due to a lack of communication, and this kind of situation occurs daily. I urge you to recognize the negative impact of excessive computer use. This is a movement that aims to change people's perspectives. Do people spend too much time on computers? Go outside and talk to your neighbors to find out. I sincerely hope you will consider my argument."
1270	1274	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, it is true that some individuals spend the majority of their day on computers, but this is not the case for everyone. Let me clarify that not all people exploit computers. Professionals such as scientists, institutions like banks, and educational establishments like schools rely on computers in a constructive manner. These types of computer applications are essential for our daily lives. Without them, we would remain ignorant about many aspects of the world. However, there are indeed people who abuse computer technology. They engage in reprehensible acts such as distributing child pornography. One of the most pressing global issues is child pornography, which is often associated with kidnappings. In rare instances, parents may even be involved. Therefore, significant changes need to be implemented. Once these problems are resolved, the digital world will regain its tranquility.
1271	1275	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I comprehend that some experts assert people are allocating an excessive amount of time to computers, yet I dissent. I am penning this correspondence today to convey my perspective on the impacts computers have on individuals in terms of time utilization, activities, and the phenomenon of ""computer dead."" If you would kindly continue, I wish to share my insights with you. Presently, computers are permeating our world. People are expending an inordinate amount of time on computers. I opine that they ought to set a timer for their computer usage. Suppose they establish a @NUM1 - hour limit; once it elapses, they must discontinue use. I believe this measure would be beneficial because if we spend an excessive amount of time indoors, we will be unable to engage in sufficient physical exercise, which is detrimental to our well - being. Please proceed to discover how we should utilize the computer. Parents must set a commendable example for children. If parents utilize the computer @NUM2, their children will perceive it as acceptable behavior. If children then commence spending all their time on the computer, they will not spend time with their friends. Contemporary children need to spend more time outdoors rather than playing computer games. Moreover, parents and children need to spend quality time together; if they are both engrossed in the computer, they cannot interact. Please continue reading about the concept of ""computer dead."" ""Computer dead"" is a term I employ to describe a state where all we desire is to use the computer. We must approach computer usage in a healthful manner. If we fail to do so, we may experience withdrawal symptoms and subsequently spend more time on the computer. If ""computer dead"" occurs, it will gradually dominate our lives. I believe that if this transpires, it will be arduous to overcome the addiction and cease computer usage. Please continue reading to conclude this letter. Thank you for perusing my thoughts on time management, computer usage, and ""computer dead."" I hope you will contemplate my viewpoints. Thank you again for your time."
1272	1276	1	1	Dear editor, I concur that individuals allocate an excessive amount of time to their computers. By reading this, you will discern my rationale. One reason pertains to physical exercise, while the other two concern relationships with friends and family. I hope to convey my point by the conclusion. As previously mentioned, let us first discuss the dearth of exercise resulting from excessive computer use. Are you aware that constant computer use causes individuals to lose focus on physical activity? If one is engrossed in the computer and neglects exercise, weight gain becomes inevitable. The accumulated weight does not dissipate on its own. Consequently, without burning off the excess fat, one continues to gain weight. Eventually, one may become overweight and regret the excessive time spent on the computer. Having elucidated the issue of exercise, let us now discuss the impact on family relationships. For instance, when family members propose an outing, one may decline due to computer use. This lack of communication with the family can cause distress to parents. Having presented two reasons, let me now address the third. Excessive computer use can lead to addiction, causing individuals to lose contact not only with family but also with friends. One may abandon extracurricular activities such as basketball or softball teams because they are perceived as time - consuming. Ultimately, numerous friendships may be lost. Even romantic relationships may be jeopardized. I hope this letter has effectively conveyed my concerns regarding the detrimental effects of excessive computer use.
1273	1277	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing this letter to apprise you that computers confer benefits upon society. Computers are advantageous as they enable us to acquire knowledge about destinations we wish to visit. Moreover, in the coming years, computers will become ubiquitous. Additionally, computers simplify our lives in the present era. In my view, computers are indeed beneficial to society. Computers offer substantial assistance to everyone. Firstly, they facilitate our exploration of desired destinations. By researching these places, we can plan our travels. Once we have gathered sufficient information, we can purchase plane tickets online and embark on our adventures. Secondly, in the near future, all aspects of life will be computer - based. Education will be delivered online, and a plethora of games will be available on the internet. Computers clearly contribute to the betterment of society. Finally, computers enhance the quality of life. Instead of using a telephone to communicate with friends and family, we can engage in online conversations. We can also watch movies at home without visiting the theater or incurring expenses. In conclusion, computers are beneficial to society. They allow us to learn about new places, will become integral to our lives in the future, and simplify our daily routines.
1274	1278	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, my perspective on the influence of computers on individuals is that while the computer is not perfect, it offers numerous advantages. Presently, I can enumerate three reasons for its utility: facilitating exploration of new places and interaction with new people, providing entertainment when individuals have idle time, and catering to teenagers' technological needs. My first reason pertains to the exploration of new places and the formation of new friendships. Individuals equipped with computers can utilize search engines like Google to explore destinations of interest. Through these explorations, they can encounter new people, reducing their computer dependence as they become engrossed in real - world social interactions. My second reason is related to idle time. When individuals have nothing to do, they can invite friends over and watch movies on the computer. This obviates the need to visit a theater and incurs no cost. One can simply download movies from the numerous available websites. My final reason concerns teenagers' reliance on computers. Teenagers are inherently drawn to technology. Depriving them of computers can lead to inactivity. Forcing them outdoors may prove ineffective. A viable solution could be to allow them to use laptops outdoors. This concludes my opinion on the effects of computers on people.
1275	1279	1	1	"Computers confer substantial benefits on society, particularly in the realm of socialization. The internet enables individuals to communicate with people across the globe. I frequently engage in video chats with my pen - pal from @LOCATION2. Currently, social media platforms dominate the digital landscape. For example, Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter are extremely popular. @PERCENT1 of individuals now possess an account on at least one of these platforms, and this figure is increasing daily. The advancement of technology has also made video games more socially interactive. @NUM1 in @NUM2 children play games with friends they know while using @CAPS1. Using computers enhances hand - eye coordination, a skill crucial in many sports. As @PERSON1 stated, ""I doubt I would be as proficient a tennis player without the computer - enhanced hand - eye coordination."" Improved hand - eye coordination also enables individuals to perform tasks more efficiently, such as taking notes while looking at the board. Whether one realizes it or not, hand - eye coordination is of great significance, and computers can enhance it by @PERCENT2. Computers also serve as a valuable learning tool. The internet allows us to explore fascinating places and plan vacations. For instance, during the @DATE1 break, my father and I used the internet to research @LOCATION1 and subsequently decided to visit, purchasing tickets online. We can also learn about historical figures through the billions of available articles. For cooks, the internet offers a wealth of recipes. As @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""As an @ORGANIZATION1, I acquired most of my cooking skills online."" Moreover, athletes can learn techniques to improve their performance. Before joining the swim team, I researched online to enhance my swimming technique. Thanks to the internet, my time improved by two seconds, enabling me to qualify for @CAPS3 with my team. I firmly believe that the computer is an extraordinary invention that has had a profound impact on society."
1276	1280	1	1	"Do Computers Benefit the Society? Indeed, computers confer significant advantages upon society. Computers offer children a wealth of knowledge about things they cannot experience or visit in the real world. Moreover, computers provide children with a positive self - image and entertainment. Additionally, computers enable children to interact with one another, such as through platforms like Facebook or @CAPS1. There are numerous compelling reasons why computers are beneficial to society. Firstly, when most children encounter a question they cannot answer, they can turn to Google to find a solution, which often proves helpful. Also, when using Google or any ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" platform, it presents children with the opportunity to @CAPS2 any topic and likely obtain a reasonable answer. Children can @CAPS2 up facts about other countries, famous individuals, and even different types of pets! Another advantage of having computers is that most children use the internet for entertainment, which can lead to a positive self - image and enhanced self - confidence. Just because children are not going outside for fun does not mean they cannot enjoy themselves indoors. Thirdly, parents or guardians often discuss their children or wish to see them socializing with friends. Well, with platforms such as Facebook, @CAPS1, or @CAPS5, children can make new friends in their town or even in other @CAPS6. The internet can fulfill all these functions. Finally, do computers benefit society? Yes, computers do benefit society. They can impart a great deal of knowledge, facilitate the making of new friends, and allow children to be children. As is evident, computers do confer benefits upon society."
1277	1281	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers yield substantial benefits to society. This conviction stems from @NUM1 primary reasons: Computers serve as an inexhaustible wellspring of knowledge, host websites with online communities, and offer sheer enjoyment. As is well - known, computers are an infinite source of knowledge. Adults, as you are aware, often need to work at a @CAPS2. In most instances, if someone has to conduct research for work, they can utilize a computer. Even school - going children require the computer's internet for tasks such as projects or homework. I am cognizant that everyone, especially kids and teens, relishes communicating with friends. Hence, most individuals sign up for online community websites. Although I am acutely aware of online pedophiles, this issue can be mitigated by having only real - life friends sign up. Lastly, I must assert that using computers is simply delightful. Children like me, who typically endure a long and arduous school day, relish coming home and unwinding with an engaging computer game. While this may seem indolent, it serves as a pleasant distraction from other matters. This is my stance regarding the boundless knowledge, online communities, and pure enjoyment that computers offer.
1278	1282	1	1	Dear newspaper editor, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own and utilize computers daily. Computers are detrimentally affecting our nation, and we must halt this misuse. Millions of parents and children spend at least @NUM1 minutes a day on the computer, either working or playing. There are numerous @CAPS2 games and other game types available on the internet, which children use for entertainment. However, it is entirely unacceptable for an @NUM2 - year - old child to play a game involving guns. Children frequently become so engrossed in these addictive games that they neglect sports or outdoor activities. Consequently, the child is deprived of essential exercise and fresh air, which can lead to obesity or other weight - related issues. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 are already obese. So, why continue to have these abhorrent games accessible? The last thing @LOCATION1 needs is an increase in the number of overweight children! There are two ways to use a computer: for positive purposes, such as planning a vacation, working, or checking a child's grades online, and for negative ones. Regrettably, many children and parents do not use computers for the former reasons. Children have been caught viewing porn, purchasing illegal drugs, hacking into systems, and engaging in other criminal activities. The computer enables people to engage in improper actions while concealing their identities. For example, whenever I sign up for a website subscription to play a game, it requests personal information, including my name, address, phone number, and more. My mother has taught me to provide false information to prevent computer hackers or fraudulent sites from stealing my personal data. Who can guarantee that people do not use illegal programs in this way? Computers pose a threat to @LOCATION1's well - being. In addition to obesity, there have been reports of children or parents having seizures, with game images imprinted in their eyes due to excessive game - playing. There has even been a case where a child went berserk and killed their parents in a fit of rage. Computers transform children and parents into unruly beings. Parents often attempt to stop their children from playing certain games. In some cases, parents delete an account on a website or confiscate the computer for a period. These actions have driven children to mental instability, with reports of computer - smashing, poor academic performance, parental homicide, and even suicide. In conclusion, computers are a source of health, behavioral, and mental problems. If we wish to restore @LOCATION1 to the place we cherish, we, the people, must put an end to this computer addiction.
1279	1283	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, A recent poll revealed that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have either used or come into contact with computers. @PERCENT2 of these @CAPS2 use computers daily, not merely for work. This extensive utilization of technology has led to a decline in exercise habits and a diminished appreciation for nature. Moreover, people are spending less time interacting with family and friends, which is having a detrimental impact on society. Health professor @PERSON1 states, ""The primary reason people do not exercise is a lack of time."" This problem can be directly attributed to the fact that, on average, @CAPS2 spend @NUM1 and a half hours a day on the computer. One might argue that they could be learning new things or expanding their knowledge. However, none of these activities contribute to their physical health and fitness. Being on the computer offers no physical benefits. Click the next link and watch as a beautiful hummingbird flits across your desktop screen. You can clearly observe its beauty, but can you truly experience it? Can you smell the fresh air it soars through? The computer can only display nature; one must log off and explore it firsthand to fully appreciate its splendor. Society is only short - changing itself by observing the world's beauty on a screen. Computer enthusiasts may claim that computers facilitate global interaction, but what about the people in the next room? Computers may connect you with people worldwide, but they create a distance from colleagues at work, classmates at school, or family at home. As human beings, we require real - world contact. Why limit ourselves to typing when we can engage in face - to - face conversations? In conclusion, excessive computer use does not benefit society. People will be less physically active, enjoy nature vicariously through a desktop rather than in person, and spend less time communicating with family and friends in real life. It is time to take a stand, as it is evident that computers pose a threat to society."
1280	1284	1	1	"I am of the opinion that the technological advancements of the computer are highly advantageous and far outweigh any drawbacks. Suppose you are struggling academically and in dire need of assistance; you can rely on a computer. Imagine having a dear friend who moved to Florida a week ago; you can use the computer to stay in touch. Moreover, if you wish to learn about the world, simply conduct a Google search. These are just a few illustrations of how the computer is more helpful than harmful. School, often disliked by many students, can be made easier with the internet. @CAPS1! For instance, if you are grappling with geometry, visit @PERSON1 Academy for informative videos. If you are a third - grade teacher feeling overwhelmed by your students, go to @LOCATION1, an educational and engaging website. Perhaps you just want to relax while learning; plug in your earphones and listen to math help. These are but a few ways the internet aids in schooling. On a rainy day when you are fatigued yet eager to learn about distant places, the internet naturally comes to mind. Consider the computer as a vast and easily accessible library; type a query into a search engine, and the information appears. If you are in Germany and hungry, and everything is in @CAPS2, open your laptop for quick translation. All these examples demonstrate that the internet simplifies learning about foreign locations. Finally, communication is effortless with the internet, thanks to emails, Skype, chatrooms, etc. Communication is, in a sense, the internet's middle name. In case of a lost phone and an emergency, you can use email. If a burglar cuts the phone lines while sneaking into your house, use e - mail @NUM1. You can even use the internet to remind @PERSON2 to ""don't forget the red bull"" as they leave. These are some of the reasons the internet is excellent for communication. Let's recap. The internet is outstanding for communication, facilitates learning about far - off places, and assists with schooling. These are the reasons I believe the internet is invaluable in today's world."
1281	1285	1	1	The influence I exert on computers is highly beneficial. I shall expound upon aspects where a single technology, computers, aids human nature. This includes how individuals can gain knowledge about distant locales, how computers assist with schooling and tax - related matters, and how to communicate with those not in one's immediate vicinity. Subsequently, I will draw a conclusion based on these three reasons. The impact of computers on me is extremely positive. They enable people to learn about far - flung places. Suppose a family is planning a vacation to @LOCATION1. Lacking any information about it, they can utilize a computer to make a hotel reservation. My second perspective on computers is that when one has a school project and requires information not available in books, the computer is the solution. For instance, if one is physically impaired (@CAPS1) and needs to file taxes online, they can visit @NUM1 www.turbotax.com and complete the tax - filing process right before their eyes. My overall view on computers is that if one has lost touch with a friend or family member, the computer can be used to locate them, and then they can plan a day to catch up. @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 guardians facing issues regarding their child can address the situation. In conclusion, this is what I think about computers. We need them to communicate with others, complete work or school assignments, or learn about places we've never visited or would like to vacation in. The reason I hold this view is my passion for computers. I hope you appreciate what I've written and that I've convinced you to like computers more.
1282	1286	1	1	Dear newspaper, have you ever indulged in a refreshing cake while seated at your computer desk? I firmly believe that computers confer benefits upon society. Firstly, computers obviate the need for people to spend hours perusing a bookstore or library. Secondly, they facilitate global communication, allowing individuals to interact with people across the world. Thirdly, computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. Those who have visited a bookstore or library are well - aware of the difficulty in finding a specific book. Instead of spending hours on one's feet, one can simply sit at a computer for ten minutes or less. On the computer, one can access information about any subject or location. For example, one can obtain a wealth of information about @LOCATION1. Experts have conducted numerous tests, indicating that individuals who use computers possess better hand - eye coordination than non - users. A health magazine reported that non - computer users may lack this skill. Acquiring this skill through computer use is beneficial for the mind. As demonstrated, computers benefit society by enhancing people's hand - eye coordination.
1283	1287	1	1	Initially, the learning capacity that people derive from computers has been enhanced. The @CAPS1 source proves highly advantageous to numerous individuals. Communication via computers is far more convenient than phone conversations. I am convinced that computers offer benefits to society in diverse ways. To commence, children, along with individuals at home and school, utilize computers for educational purposes. In certain school grades, there are specialized typing programs designed to improve typing skills. There are also hard - drive discs that can be used to enhance reading skills, making learning an enjoyable experience for young children. Another excellent online learning method is to visit websites with sample math problems, print the worksheets, and practice. These are effective means of facilitating learning. Secondly, computers offer a multitude of additional benefits. They are useful for obtaining local weather information. In winter, one can quickly determine if school has been cancelled. Frequently, when assigned projects that require research on a specific topic, it is effortless to find basic information on the computer. Moreover, the computer provides various links that are helpful for writing papers, creating PowerPoint presentations, and Excel spreadsheets. These resources can be used for graphing scientific results or typing papers for @CAPS2. They simplify daily life. Lastly, computers streamline communication. When I am absent from school due to illness, I prefer to inform my teachers via email and even inquire about makeup work. Social media platforms like Facebook, AIM, MySpace, and Skype are all enjoyable and rapid ways to communicate with friends. These websites essentially serve the same function, but different people prefer the platforms their friends use. One can also email distant or nearby friends and family. In conclusion, having presented these different perspectives, I regard computers as a valuable asset. They aid in learning, communication, and the performance of essential tasks.
1284	1288	1	1	I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on people. The three reasons underlying this belief are that computers improve our hand - eye coordination, enable us to conduct research and acquire information on a particular topic, and allow us to communicate with those we rarely see. In fact, computers enhance our hand - eye coordination. The simultaneous use of the screen and the keyboard allows us to focus solely on the screen while typing. Hand - eye coordination is a crucial skill, especially when engaging in physical activities such as sports or workouts, which are beneficial for our bodies. For instance, if one applies for an office job and appears clumsy, they will be perceived differently from someone who is organized and competent. This underscores the importance of hand - eye coordination. Computers also possess the remarkable ability to search the World Wide Web, enabling us to conduct millions of searches on any topic. In fifth grade, I conducted a research project on @LOCATION2. Without the valuable information I found on the computer, I would not have been able to learn as much. As is well - known, a devastating earthquake occurred in the small country of @LOCATION4. Computers played a vital role in spreading the news and mobilizing people to assist the victims by sending supplies and food. Additionally, when a family plans a vacation, they can handle most arrangements on the computer, such as purchasing flight tickets, booking hotel rooms, and renting a car. This is what my family did during our vacation to @LOCATION1, and everything went smoothly thanks to the computer and online services. This is how computers facilitate research on any topic. Finally, computers can be used to communicate with those living far away. For example, my grandparents reside in @LOCATION3, and I use video chat to communicate with them as I only see them once every two or three years. When my dad is on business trips, either within the country or abroad, we use instant messaging or video chat to stay in touch. If friends or family are serving in @LOCATION5, video chat can also be used to communicate with them. These are the reasons why I believe computers have a positive impact on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable us to research and find information on any topic via the internet, and facilitate communication with those we rarely see.
1285	1289	1	1	It is unwise for people to spend excessive time on computers, as physical exercise is essential for maintaining good health. If one spends the entire day playing games on a computer, they will not acquire any meaningful knowledge. The brain will be overly focused on the computer rather than on schoolwork. Continuously engaging in such behavior will render one a dull individual, whether a child or an adult. It is truly regrettable if one squanders their life due to excessive computer use. Some people who are unfamiliar with technology believe it is useless, thinking that a smart person should rely on their own knowledge rather than a computer. There are also those who are impoverished and have never owned a computer or even heard of technology. In some regions, people lack access to technology or electricity because they cannot afford it. The lack of technological knowledge means they miss out on the ability to find locations, make phone calls to friends, access the internet, listen to music, play games, chat with friends and family, play games together, and watch movies. Another aspect is learning to use a computer. The first step is to turn it on, then click on Internet Explorer and search for a website. However, using the keyboard and typing quickly can be challenging. The last concern is interacting with strangers online. When playing games with other players, one can chat with them. In conclusion, these are all the reasons why I believe computers have positive aspects for many people. This is my stance on the impact of computers.
1286	1290	1	1	"Personally, I opine that computers exert a beneficial influence on individuals. They stand among the most remarkable inventions. With computers, one can listen to music or watch @CAPS1, conduct research for projects, or simply enjoy oneself. Computers assist people in creating, listening to, watching, and producing music and @CAPS1. When one possesses a computer, they can be inspired by other musicians to compose music. And where does the refinement of that music occur? Within a computer to incorporate beats and diverse vocals. One can also watch @CAPS1 on it! Not precisely @CAPS1 but any show one desires to view. Some individuals even craft movies using specialized programs. That is not all, though. Numerous questions can be resolved on the computer through research. Cures for various diseases such as cancer can be discovered. Even minor research projects like ""Who founded @CAPS2"" can be readily found with a swift Google search. Indeed, we might be becoming indolent, yet it simplifies people's lives. For instance, instead of perusing dozens of books, one could simply search for answers on the internet. One can even enroll in online classes. Not impressed? Another significant advantage of people using computers is socializing and having a good time. Socializing via computers @MONTH1 may not be as effective as in - person interaction, but it offers quieter individuals, like me, an opportunity to express their thoughts. Moreover, there won't be those awkward silent moments that typically occur on the phone. Oh, did I mention Facebook? I adore Facebook. I can keep in touch with family and friends I no longer see. I once had a very close friend, but after we changed schools, I never heard from her again. Until I found her on Facebook. The same goes for many others. And younger people won't be bored with the countless games available online. How could one go wrong? It seems to me that computers have a positive impact on people. But what's your take? Can one major negative outweigh a multitude of positives? I think not."
1287	1291	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper: Do you lend credence to the nonsense that the so - called experts are espousing about computers? I sincerely hope not! They assert that computers pose health risks because an excessive number of people are using them and not exercising. Well, in my view, users ought to know when to cease. And when it comes to family interaction, parents should establish boundaries. Additionally, computers are highly convenient when one requires information on a topic promptly. Therefore, I believe computers are not to blame in this situation. Exercising is something an individual should be motivated to do. @MONTH1, when people lack this motivation, they spend their days on the computer. They claim it's not their fault. The computer is a tool to be utilized. I read just last week that someone actually told her press that it's not her fault she's overweight. That's preposterous! So, the sole person accountable for not engaging in physical activity is the user. Regarding family interaction, it's entirely up to the parents. Parents are in control of their children, and if they're concerned that their kid doesn't spend enough time interacting with the family, they should take action. The user should possess the willpower to recognize when enough is enough and set limits! If we didn't have home computers, it would be a drawback. Kids rely on computers to obtain quick, accurate information. Without them, parents would have to ferry their children to and from the library, consuming a significant amount of time. And let's not overlook the ease of access to the internet. In conclusion, computers are the way forward. They are not the cause of a lack of exercise or family issues. It's not the computer's fault if families face problems. And they are so convenient that it's evident computers are beneficial to have! I genuinely hope that after reading this letter, you concur with my opinion.
1288	1292	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I wish to present arguments demonstrating that computers are not entirely detrimental. Firstly, they can be employed to gather information for a project, communicate with friends, or learn about hitherto unknown subjects. My initial argument is that the majority of people utilize their computers to acquire information for class projects. For example, they might need details about a country such as @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. There are multiple avenues to obtain this information. So, in the absence of a computer, where could one source all this data? If one retrieves it from a book, it might not contain the specific information required for the project. A computer offers a broader scope of knowledge than a book. My second example is that one can communicate with friends whom they haven't seen or spoken to in a long time. There are numerous means to achieve this, such as on @CAPS1, @CAPS2, Twitter, or Yahoo. One can also make new friends, which is always a positive thing. Even better, one can connect with a family member. I'm aware that it's far more fulfilling to converse with family as they already know you well. Finally, it's always rewarding to discover something previously unknown or to satisfy one's curiosity. One can always turn to Google, Ask, or Wikipedia. They can all assist in finding the information one has been seeking. However, this doesn't imply that books are useless. They are replete with answers and ideas that can be helpful. In conclusion, one can always find ways to obtain the necessary answers. But this also doesn't mean that one should be glued to the computer when they could be outdoors or playing with friends. There's nothing quite like spending time outside. So, make better use of computer time and then head outdoors to relish the natural world.
1289	1293	1	1	Dear local newspapers, I am writing to convey that people using computers is not a negative phenomenon. Would you prefer to be bored or to be entertained while learning? Using a computer enhances hand - eye coordination, allows one to learn about fascinating places, and even facilitates communication with friends. Hand - eye coordination is valuable because it has far - reaching benefits. It has saved millions of lives in war. For instance, my grandpa served in the @ORGANIZATION1, and @NUM1 people were shooting at him, but his excellent hand - eye coordination, developed from using the computer, saved his life. Moreover, it can prevent injuries like getting one's hand caught in a car door. There are numerous advantages. Equally important as hand - eye coordination is learning! On the internet, one can learn about anything and everything. By learning about distant places, one can enrich their conversations, making others perceive them as more intelligent and boosting their self - esteem. In reality, one truly becomes more knowledgeable. Most importantly, one can interact with friends! Communicating with friends online can bolster self - esteem, and those who do so often perform better in school. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of people achieve better academic results if they communicate online? Don't you wish to feel proud of yourself every day? Well, online communication can help! This is why I'm writing to you, to share my thoughts and concerns. I hope you will consider them and disseminate them to the world.
1290	1294	1	1	"Imagine our idyllic town populated by unhealthy, indolent, non - interactive, and addicted individuals. The question at hand is whether you, the local residents, should spend more time on computers. I firmly believe, as @PERCENT1 indicates, that we should not devote all our time to computers. It can impair your eyesight, prevent you from enjoying nature and interacting with people, and most importantly, render you extremely unhealthy. Can you envision a @CAPS1 person in your town going blind, wearing glasses, or even visiting the @CAPS1 @DATE1? Just consult eye @PERSON1: ""@CAPS1 year, I'm seeing an increasing number of people visiting the eye doctor."" You might claim that it's beneficial for you, but it's not. Prolonged computer use gradually deteriorates your eyesight. As @CAPS2 states, more people are wearing glasses than ever before. In the @DATE1 @DATE1 local newspaper, there was a chart depicting the number of people who damaged their eyesight from computer use over the years. It increased by nearly @PERCENT2 from @DATE1 year and @PERCENT3 from the year before. Almost everyone who owns a computer and is addicted to it wears glasses. Have you glanced outside recently? Have you noticed that @DATE2 is approaching and there are leaves on the trees? If you're one of those glued to your computer monitor, I doubt you have. Computers and technology squander your time with family. Many computer - based jobs are not fulfilling. During that time, you could be spending quality moments with your beloved daughter or best friend outdoors in nature, having a great time. @DATE1 year, I wanted to play catch with my dad, but he was engrossed in his old computer, doing his usual tasks. I didn't want to play alone, so I stayed inside and used my computer all day. Do you want this to happen to a @CAPS1 person every day? I wouldn't. Yes, some people prefer to be couch potatoes, chatting online while munching on mountains of junk food instead of going out, interacting, and staying fit. But now, it's crucial that you don't. Just picture lazy, obese people sitting on their couches all day, their eyes bloodshot from hours of staring at the monitor. You might wonder why. It's because they never venture outside. They never go for a jog or consume healthy foods. This is extremely unhealthy and can increase the risk of various cancers. Just ask @PERSON2 from the hospital: ""@DATE1, a man was rushed to the hospital due to a common cancer caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. He passed away @NUM2 days later. It was very tragic."" I firmly believe that excessive computer use is a terrible idea. It can ruin your eyesight, deprive you of nature and social interaction, and most importantly, make you unhealthy. The time to act is now. You never know if you could be that person in the hospital. The question is, will you take that risk or choose to stay fit, healthy, and happy? So, go for a jog, eat a healthy snack, and limit your computer time."
1291	1295	1	1	An increasing number of individuals utilize computers, appreciating them for staying connected with distant places and accessing news. Computers are advantageous for everyone across the globe. No one can live without computers. There are others who dislike computers for no valid reason. I am aware that there are families or friends who own computers and communicate with one another, similar to how on MySpace, one can have friends and family from all over. However, people are spending excessive time on their computers.
1292	1296	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I hold certain viewpoints regarding the current trajectory of technology and the fact that numerous individuals avoid the concept of further advancement for understandable reasons. Technology can distance people from their families and divert their attention from the rest of the world. I comprehend their perspective, yet I wish to present my own argument. Although statistics indicate a @PERCENT1 decline in recreational activities, people also discover more things to engage in. Given the world's heightened concern for the environment, it is likely that people will venture outdoors again, either because they learn about a new environmental activist group to join or they watch a movie that parodies live - action role - playing and decide to give it a try. My point is that one never knows what one will uncover in the media, and it is preferable to sitting outside aimlessly all day, waiting for one's parents to return and provide information from beyond one's limited world. Another aspect I will mention is the music industry and how it has been revolutionized with more advanced and diverse listening methods. In fact, the only issue in the music industry today lies with the artists and how they exploit recording studios and, on occasion, one another merely to gain fame without doing anything more than lip - syncing. However, the current technology enables us to experience the golden age of music. Therefore, why not progress and invest in the music industry? It will offer entertainment and enjoyment for years to come. Advancing technology in the music industry is likely beneficial for the economy as well. If we did not have new @CAPS3 to sell to people each year, there would be a significant decline in stock market prices. Granted, we are currently in a slump, but it would not improve otherwise. This also applies to cell phones and any other frequently upgraded hardware; it is simply good for business. You see, I believe that the purpose of life is to find joy. What could be better than relaxing on a date, perhaps with some candlelight, and watching a romance or thriller on the @CAPS4.V? Most people will enjoy simply sitting down and watching television as it is easy to relate to. Television has evolved in numerous positive ways; it is a means to unwind, learn about various things, and it can make one feel as if they are present in a particular place without actually being there. It helps us stay updated on current events, shows us things we want to do, and teaches us how to do them. For instance, I have learned a great deal from...
1293	1297	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 - republican, @CAPS2 indeed contribute positively to society, yet they also have a negative impact. Computers facilitate communication with family members in other countries through chat, voice chat, or video chat, which would be prohibitively expensive or unfeasible via phone. They also offer learning opportunities with abundant resources readily accessible. One positive aspect of computers is their ability to connect individuals globally. Programs such as Skype allow for cost - free video, voice, or text communication with people around the world. Achieving the same through phone calls would be extremely costly. It provides the opportunity to see family members one rarely encounters. Another benefit of using computers is the wealth of resources and information they offer. The internet contains virtually every piece of information imaginable. When writing a research paper, one can visit Wikipedia and find information on various topics. The internet proves to be a valuable asset. The @CAPS2 offers numerous excellent mind - stimulating and puzzle games that are not commonly available otherwise. There are many beneficial aspects of the internet that can stimulate one's thinking. Unable to afford a newspaper? One can read articles and stories directly on the internet. The final reason I believe @CAPS2 have a positive influence on people is that they serve as a substitute. Many people, instead of going to the @CAPS3, will turn to the @CAPS2. Regardless of the activity, one typically engages in more on the @CAPS2 than on the @ORGANIZATION1. This is why I believe computers have a positive impact on people. Computers are undoubtedly the future. One can play games, engage in voice or video chats, and even read the newspaper on them.
1294	1298	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I have recently discovered that you are debating the impact of computers on people. In my view, I believe they have a neutral effect. In contemporary society, computers are employed for a multitude of purposes, such as research and communication. Perhaps the reason young people spend a significant amount of time on computers is that they have a substantial amount of homework that requires computer use. People often fail to realize that in order to progress, using a computer is inevitable. For adults working with large companies, they interact with colleagues worldwide. Instead of traveling to numerous meetings, they can conveniently conduct them via webcam. I understand your concern that people spend excessive time indoors using computers. However, consider those who love reading or playing music; they may also spend hours engaged in these activities. What is the difference? Moreover, using a computer might be as engaging for some as a sport is for others. Computers are ubiquitous, found in homes, schools, and even crime and medical labs. They are a primary source of databases, including @CAPS4 and criminal records. Without computers, it would be challenging to apprehend criminals or detect cancer in a timely manner. Computers play a crucial role in many aspects of life. In conclusion, one could debate the pros and cons of computers all day. However, given their significance in major areas today, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
1295	1299	1	1	"Dear @PERSON2, Have you ever observed the remarkable transformation of our society, even compared to just a decade ago? This change is attributed to computers. It is true that computers offer advantages such as messaging and information access, but they also detract from some of life's more precious aspects: maintaining physical fitness, appreciating nature, and spending quality time with family and friends. Without these elements, life would be highly unfulfilling. While browsing the web can be enjoyable, it has been proven to be unhealthy. According to @PERSON3, a specialist in obesity at @ORGANIZATION1, ""if an individual spends more than two and a half hours on the computer every @TIME1 for approximately a month, they will experience a sudden increase in weight. If this behavior persists, they could gain up to one - third of their initial body weight before seeking medical assistance."" Additionally, @PERCENT1 of computer users snack while online, which further exacerbates weight gain. Unfortunately, those who spend a great deal of time on the computer are often reluctant to exercise. Instead of setting aside just half an hour from their computer time to play with a pet, go for a jog, or engage in aerobics, computer enthusiasts typically remain in front of the screen. This is regrettable as it leads to health problems for them and potentially future generations. Nature is being neglected more than ever. @PERSON1 can recall when the trails where @CAPS2 runs were teeming with people. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS2 remarks, ""They are now overgrown with vegetation, which is more difficult to remove than people."" It seems that as nature lovers become fewer in number, the trails and natural areas are becoming less frequented. Due to today's new technologies, particularly computers, the beauty of nature is being almost completely overlooked. Some fear that it will disappear entirely, and instead of preserving what remains, we are allowing it to fade away. Hopefully, the next generation will recognize these grave mistakes. Doctors, @CAPS3, and people from all walks of life are increasingly aware of how computers affect family life. How often do you have dinner with your entire family? When you don't, where are you most likely to be? In front of the computer, I suspect. When computers and other technologies are readily available, the likelihood of interacting with family and friends decreases significantly. Mrs @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together after each member acquired a laptop. She believes that this is driving her family apart. Do you share this view? As can be concluded, computers have a detrimental influence on society. People neglect to maintain their physical fitness, nature is being ignored, and family interaction is poor. What can we do to address this issue? Simply set aside a little time each day to engage with these aspects of life. By doing so, life with computers can still be rewarding."
1296	1300	1	1	I harbor skepticism regarding the assertion that computers confer benefits upon society. While children have the potential to acquire substantial knowledge, they often squander excessive time online. When engaging in online conversations, it becomes arduous to ascertain the true identity of the interlocutor. Moreover, computers are plagued by technical glitches that can result in the deletion of crucial files. These factors collectively undermine the purported benefits of computers to society.  Children are prone to spending an inordinate amount of time on computers. Although computers can serve as valuable educational tools, they also offer a plethora of games that tend to captivate children's attention. Consequently, children often prioritize gaming over studying, leading to a decline in academic performance. Additionally, the sedentary nature of computer use can contribute to a lack of physical exercise, which may result in aggression and weight gain. Children may also lose interest in other activities, becoming overly reliant on computers for entertainment.  Another significant concern is the issue of online safety. When children interact with strangers online, they are at risk of divulging personal information to malicious individuals. These individuals may create fake email addresses and false accounts on social media platforms to deceive children and gain access to their personal details. This can lead to identity theft, cyberbullying, and other forms of online exploitation.  Furthermore, computers are vulnerable to viruses and malware, which can cause significant damage to files and data. When a computer is infected with a virus, it may delete important files, corrupt data, or even render the computer inoperable. This can be particularly problematic for individuals who rely on their computers for work, school, or personal use.  In conclusion, while computers offer certain advantages, such as access to information and the ability to communicate with others, their negative impacts on society cannot be overlooked. It is imperative that parents, educators, and policymakers take proactive measures to address these issues and ensure that children use computers in a safe and responsible manner. By promoting digital literacy, setting limits on screen time, and implementing strict online safety measures, we can mitigate the risks associated with computer use and harness its potential for positive change.
1297	1301	1	1	Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that there is a divergence of opinions regarding the impact of technological advancements, specifically computers, on individuals. Proponents of technological progress assert that computers exert a positive influence, while others vehemently oppose this view. In my perspective, I firmly believe that computers are significantly affecting contemporary society, with individuals allocating an exorbitant amount of time to these devices. The extent of time spent on computers has reached an alarming level!  A substantial number of individuals are opting to remain at home, engrossed in computer games. Although computers offer undeniable advantages, such as facilitating bill payments and enabling long - distance communication, they are being exploited. Some individuals are even using computers for malicious purposes, such as online harassment. Since there is no face - to - face interaction, the computer serves as a medium for people to utter threatening remarks without fear of immediate consequences, which can potentially lead to conflicts and other undesirable outcomes.  Computers also pose numerous risks. For instance, social media platforms like MySpace and Twitter can be perilous for teenagers due to the presence of potential predators. A random stranger could initiate a conversation and invite a teen to meet in person, which could result in dangerous situations. Moreover, individuals may unknowingly have inappropriate pictures of themselves posted on the internet.  Another critical issue is hacking. This is a particularly pressing concern, especially for those with webcams. Malicious individuals can hack into webcams and monitor people's activities without their knowledge. They can also access personal documents stored on the computer.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that the impact of computers on people is a significant issue that demands immediate attention and resolution.
1298	1302	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers wield both positive and negative influences on individuals. Nevertheless, I am convinced that the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones. Among these positive impacts, computers are indispensable for education, serve as a highly effective communication platform, and offer entertainment value.  My primary rationale for advocating the use of computers is their educational significance. For example, one can conduct comprehensive research on virtually any topic. In the event of forgetting an answer while doing homework, the computer provides a readily available source of information. Additionally, computers allow for typing papers, ensuring that teachers can read the work clearly, especially when one's handwriting is illegible. Moreover, individuals can work remotely from home when ill or on vacation, and email serves as a convenient means to submit work to one's boss.  Another valuable aspect of computers is their communication capabilities. There are a multitude of communication methods available, which is truly remarkable. Take instant messaging as an example. One can send messages to mobile phones, communicate with friends who are offline, or engage in conversations on various social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and numerous others. Video chatting is also possible through applications like Skype. These are just a few of the many ways to communicate using a computer.  Finally, computers offer a plethora of enjoyable activities. One can purchase games from stores and download them onto the computer. Personally, I am fond of The Sims. While it is true that computer games can be addictive, as long as one exercises self - control and does not spend excessive amounts of time playing, there should be no cause for concern. Additionally, there are educational games that make learning both enjoyable and informative. One can also play free games or download games from the internet, which is both quick and convenient.  In summary, computers can have both negative and positive impacts, but I choose to focus on the positive. I believe that others should adopt the same perspective. After all, computers are educational, facilitate social interaction, and provide entertainment. By embracing the positive aspects of computers, one will not be disappointed.
1299	1303	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, regarding the subject of computers, specifically their advantages and disadvantages, it must be acknowledged that both viewpoints present compelling arguments for and against their use. In my opinion, computers are of great significance to many students, including myself.  Firstly, computers are instrumental in assisting me and my classmates with various academic assignments. Some of us simply lack the time to visit a library and search for a book that may not even contain the required information. On the internet, one can access an equivalent or greater amount of valuable information. Additionally, using a computer helps develop hand - eye coordination. While it is true that hand - eye coordination can also be developed outdoors, typing on a computer is fast and produces neat results. As my handwriting is not the best, I find that typing allows me to convey my thoughts clearly with fewer errors.  In my view, computers offer the most efficient means of accomplishing numerous tasks. If one spends excessive time writing neatly by hand, there may not be sufficient time to enjoy the outdoors and connect with nature. My father, an environmentalist, also makes use of computers. However, it is important to recognize that the easiest option is not always the best. Therefore, a balance must be struck. Instead of discouraging people from using computers, we should encourage them to manage their time effectively. Just as caffeine can be beneficial in moderation but harmful in large quantities, the same principle applies to computer use.  Moreover, computers are now ubiquitous, and attempting to eliminate them is simply impractical. Given the current economic recession, we cannot afford to create additional problems. Although I prefer face - to - face communication with my friends, when this is not possible, a computer serves as an excellent alternative.  In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial, but the key lies in achieving a balance. By using computers in a balanced manner, we can fully leverage their advantages while minimizing potential drawbacks.
1300	1304	1	1	Are you eager to uncover new phenomena and explore the captivating mysteries that abound across the globe? Do you cherish the prospect of making friends in distant lands? Do you seek a means to unwind and engage in enjoyable activities after work or school? Thanks to the remarkable advancements in technology today, many feats that were once deemed unattainable decades ago are now within reach. The question at hand is whether computers exert a positive or negative influence on individuals. I firmly contend that computers bestow numerous benefits and opportunities upon society.  It is undeniable that computers are dedicated to educational pursuits. Computer experts have developed an array of programs that streamline academic tasks for children. For instance, [Software Name 1] aids in the composition of essays and reports. With this program, teachers no longer have to strain their eyes deciphering students' messy handwritten work. [Software Name 2] facilitates organization and calculation, while [Software Name 3] empowers users to create dynamic presentations. Many educational institutions are equipped with computer labs where students can complete their schoolwork. Schools have also procured portable laptops to assist students in project completion and examinations, which not only conserves paper but also helps preserve trees. Furthermore, numerous colleges offer online courses, enabling individuals to earn a college degree from the comfort of their homes. Thanks to advanced networks and computers, education has never been more accessible.  The entertainment value of computers is also worthy of mention. I have observed that many teenagers indulge in engaging games online. This provides them with an ideal avenue to relax after a strenuous day. Listening to the latest music on the computer is a delightful way to unwind, and some websites offer free downloadable songs, eliminating financial concerns. Additionally, one can watch a diverse range of movies online, including horror, romance, comedy, fantasy, and children's films. There is no longer a need to purchase movie tickets or drive to the theater. Undoubtedly, the entertainment features of computers can bring joy to people's lives.  Contrary to the belief that computers isolate individuals from their social lives, they actually offer a platform for global communication. Decades ago, who would have imagined that one could engage in real - time conversations with someone thousands of miles away without relying on traditional mail, telephones, or other archaic means? When I traveled to [Location] [Date], I was extremely grateful for computers as they allowed me to stay connected with my friends and relatives. I could instantly share pictures of the winter scenery here with them. Computers have undoubtedly enhanced communication and bridged the gap between people.  In conclusion, computers have countless positive impacts and should be widely promoted. They facilitate learning, provide entertainment, and foster communication. Moreover, new technology contributes to environmental sustainability by saving paper and trees. Let us not delay any further; it is time to educate people about the manifold benefits of computers.
1301	1305	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1: A @CAPS2. Is it not astonishing that this minuscule technological marvel wields influence over our daily existence? The query prevalent among numerous individuals is whether computers exert a positive or negative impact on people. In my view, although computers facilitate certain aspects of daily life, I contend that they yield predominantly negative effects. I possess numerous rationales for this conviction, yet the three most significant ones shall be presented. Firstly, individuals are so engrossed in their computers that they allocate less time. People are also so preoccupied with their computers that they devote diminishing amounts of time savoring nature. Last but not least, individuals are so ensnared by technology that they scarcely spend time with friends and family. Thus, in my opinion, I believe people should strike a balance between technology and the real world. Have you ever strolled down the street and encountered someone of substantial stature? Well, it is not a pleasant sight, is it? My point is that this can befall anyone, let me rephrase that, it can happen to everyone in the world. Nowadays, people are spending less and less time engaging in physical activity, instead opting to remain at home in front of the computer or slouching on the couch with a laptop. People are disregarding their health and instead remaining fixated on the computer. I, for one, am well - aware of how arduous it is to resist the allure of computer games, but one should not allow a diminutive @CAPS2 to commandeer one's mind and future. Nature, the most magnificent phenomenon in the world, I assert, is the second most wonderful after technology. Have you ever switched on the television and witnessed nature's splendor? Well, you can attribute that to global warming. When people utilize computers, they consume fuel, which is detrimental to our environment. People are so consumed by technology that they are indifferent to their surroundings. If I were an environmentalist, I would proclaim, ""@CAPS3 fewer computers and @CAPS3 more environmental conservation!"" @CAPS4..... it is a privilege to have a family. Family and friends are the most crucial elements. Due to computers, numerous individuals are neglecting their family and friends. For example: @CAPS5: @CAPS6, would you like to go cycling? John: @CAPS7. I prefer to play on my computer. Both children and adults are overly reliant on technology. In my opinion, family is of utmost importance, unlike a mere piece of metal with a screen. In conclusion, I believe that computers have an adverse effect on people's lives. People are spending less time attending to their health and engaging in physical activity amidst technological advancements. They are also spending less time in parks or simply relishing nature's beauty. Most importantly, there is a decline in interaction with friends and family. However, this is merely my perspective, and it holds no significance if you disagree. I hope you will consider my viewpoint."
1302	1306	1	1	"Dear editor, I opine that computers are a valuable asset to have within the household. They are highly beneficial and provide entertainment. For instance, they simplify the process of maintaining contact with distant friends and family, assist in acquiring knowledge or staying informed about significant news, and are appealing to individuals of all age groups. This is the reason why computers rank among the most precious possessions in one's home. One of the numerous functions a computer can fulfill is facilitating communication with family members or friends residing at a distance. Computers can serve this purpose as one can utilize platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Skype when using them. ""@CAPS1 is an excellent way to stay connected with my relatives in the @LOCATION1,"" states @PERSON2. Additionally, researchers have indicated that individuals with Facebook, Skype, or Twitter accounts develop closer bonds with their families compared to those who do not. A computer can also be employed for educational objectives. Many individuals utilize educational computer games to prepare their elementary - school children for school. ""@CAPS1 is both enjoyable and effective in preparing my son for school!"" remarks a local mother while discussing a computer game. Studies have demonstrated that computer games are @PERCENT1 more effective in preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets. One of the most favored reasons for keeping a computer at home is for entertainment. When using a computer, one can play card games, chess, pinball, or visit game websites like addictinggames.com, watch videos on youtube.com, and much more. ""I relish spending some of my leisure time on addictinggames.com,"" declares @PERSON1. Moreover, after conducting a poll, I discovered that @PERCENT2 of children and teenagers prefer online games to board games. As is evident, there are numerous reasons why having a computer at home is essential. There are also many more reasons than those I have enumerated. Nevertheless, I believe the primary ones are maintaining contact with friends and family, using the computer for educational purposes, and for entertainment. I am extremely grateful for the computer in my home as I use @CAPS1 daily for these purposes, as does every member of my family. A computer is one of the most indispensable items in an average household."
1303	1307	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1's stance on the computer controversy issue is that computers are beneficial and indispensable in today's daily world. Computers serve as an excellent means of communication; they are the primary source of information for most people, and businesses utilize computers for various significant tasks as well. Computers are an outstanding way to communicate. One can @CAPS2 with friends, send emails to peers, and there are now websites where one can converse with friends or strangers. As a human being, I occasionally forget @CAPS1's homework or school assignments. In such a situation, I simply turn to my computer and @CAPS2 a friend to inquire about the assignment. It is swift, effortless, and effective. There are also websites that enable individuals to interact and connect with others who share similar interests. It is an ideal way to make online friends. The computer not only allows for communication but also enables one to establish connections with people regardless of their location. Do you ever have a question that you need an immediate answer to? Simply visit ""Google"" or ""@CAPS4"", input your query, and receive an instant response. Have a research paper due on @PERSON1? You can conduct all your research online. There are thousands of websites replete with information on any and every subject. You can enter your topic into a search engine and discover hundreds of sources in this manner. You can easily obtain information on any subject you desire, or find the name of that song you just heard using your computer. Computers are also utilized in the business environment. Computers are employed to convey messages to different individuals within the organization. They are also used to create and present presentations for marketing campaigns and new product ideas. Additionally, many companies use the internet as a means of advertising and rely on the publicity to sell their products. Thus, the computer is essential for businesses to function effectively. In conclusion, computers are not over - utilized; rather, they are employed for so many purposes that eventually, everyone will require one. They are a reliable means of communication, a crucial and primary source of information, and are also integral to business operations."
1304	1308	1	1	I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on people as they enable communication with diverse locations across the globe, offer storage capabilities, and serve as a source of entertainment. Computers have a positive impact because they facilitate communication with people worldwide. This is advantageous as, instead of making costly long - distance phone calls, one can use a computer to communicate for free. Long - distance calls can be quite expensive, but by using a computer, there are no charges. The ability to communicate with others via the internet is both highly useful and enjoyable. In the absence of computers, people would interact with fewer individuals, and their social lives would suffer, rendering their lives less exciting. This is one reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Another reason why computers have a positive influence is that if one has an abundance of paperwork cluttering the space, a computer offers features that allow for efficient storage and organization. By being more organized, one experiences less stress and feels better about not misplacing items and being able to locate them easily. This is why I consider computers to be extremely valuable and useful. The final reason why I think computers have a positive impact on people is that they can be used for entertainment. Computers offer a plethora of options such as playing games, listening to music, watching videos, and chatting with friends. The ability to play games for free on a computer is truly remarkable. If one cannot afford a game console, they can access a wide variety of games on the computer. A computer can also play music. One can have @CAPS1 and download music to a device or visit websites that offer musical content. Additionally, one can engage in video chats with friends who live far away. I hope that I have convinced you to develop a greater appreciation for computers and recognize that they are excellent and have a positive influence on people. The ability to play games, store data, and chat with others is truly astonishing.
1305	1309	1	1	Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1, do you own a computer? Do your children spend all their time on it, chatting with people or browsing Facebook or MySpace? While it can be enjoyable for a few hours, some individuals spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer. They refrain from going outdoors to exercise or interacting with their family and friends. Moreover, they often end up getting into trouble at school or at home. If one spends all their time on the computer, regardless of the activity, they will have insufficient time for physical exercise. Not only is it unappealing, but it can also pose a threat to one's health over time. All one's time is consumed by the computer, and when using it, one often has the illusion of not spending much time, only to realize that several hours have passed. This phenomenon even affects adults. My mother once spent approximately an hour on the computer but felt as though it was only a few minutes. When one spends several hours on the computer, they tend to become engrossed and lose touch with the real world. I can attest to this from personal experience. A few months ago, I spent an entire month coming home from school and spending several hours on the computer. This had a profound impact on my life. I stopped going out with my friends on weekends and always preferred to stay at home when my family went out. Then, my mother confronted me about it, and I realized that my excessive computer use was detrimental. I was missing out on many important experiences. Children also often encounter problems at school or home if they spend excessive time on the computer. They frequently neglect their homework and end up failing a class or repeating a grade. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT1 of children who spend long hours on the computer either fail a class or are held back. They also often get into trouble at home because they neglect their chores due to being preoccupied with the computer. Neither the child nor the parents enjoy having conflicts. Now, I understand that computers are useful to a certain extent. They allow us to search for information and it is pleasant to chat with people on the computer occasionally. However, spending an excessive amount of time on the computer can severely disrupt one's life and social relationships. Therefore, all I am attempting to convey is that computers are an incredible invention, but we should use them more sparingly, go outdoors to exercise, have fun with our family and friends, perform well at school and at home so that we can earn some time to use the computer. I hope you can see things from my perspective now.
1306	1310	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am penning this correspondence to discuss the impact of technology on individuals. My contention is that some individuals opine that computers are consuming an excessive amount of people's time. I shall elucidate how technology deters people from engaging in physical exercise and acquiring life experiences. Now, I will elaborate in greater detail. My primary rationale for asserting that computers affect people is that they are unable to partake in physical activity when their faces are constantly fixed to a computer screen throughout the day. Particularly considering the large number of children playing video games or using the computer, the childhood obesity rate will gradually increase due to their lack of exercise, or they will simply become extremely weak. This is why computers have a detrimental effect on people by preventing them from obtaining the necessary exercise. My secondary reason for stating that computers have a negative impact on people is that they will be unable to gain life experiences. I assert this because when someone inquires, ""@CAPS3, what did you do today?"" your sole response might be ""@CAPS4, can we change the question to what did I not do today?"" @CAPS5 when you are engrossed in the computer all day, you will not be able to explore and observe nature. Perhaps you could do so on a @CAPS6 server, but it is not the same. Moreover, even when parents invite you to go for a walk, you should accept the invitation. You might learn something or witness something that you would not typically encounter on a daily basis. This is why computers have a negative impact on people when their faces are glued to a computer. Therefore, I will conclude this letter, and I hope you recognize that exercise and the acquisition of life experiences will transform your life permanently."
1307	1311	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: Some individuals are skeptical regarding whether computers are beneficial to people. I firmly believe that computers indeed confer advantages upon humanity as they enable individuals to communicate online with loved ones and friends across the globe and gain knowledge about foreign locales. Computers do not detract from life but rather present it through captivating virtual means. Computers facilitate interaction among people of all ages via the worldwide web. Although it is sometimes preferable to meet people in person, this is not always feasible. What if you have relatives or friends in a different country? The internet is the optimal method of contacting those individuals. Additionally, what if you are part of a band or a group and need to communicate with them while you are away from home? Social platforms such as Facebook or MySpace allow group members to converse and deliberate on matters at the hotel or wherever they may be. In addition to these two reasons, students can retrieve missed assignments and email their teachers from the comfort of their homes. This enables the pupil to access the lesson and catch up on any material they have missed. The technological innovation of the @DATE1, known as computers, permits interaction with other people and the exploration of distant lands. Some individuals, including myself, desire to incorporate some culture into their lives, to wander across this vibrant planet we call Earth, and to discover what lies beyond, yet are unable to achieve this objective. The computer saves us both time and money in pursuing these endeavors. All we need to do is open a search bar, type in a word, and voila, we are viewing @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, or even the fields of @LOCATION1. Any destination you desire is at your fingertips. Furthermore, when a new tourist attraction emerges, whether it is an amusement park, a monument, or a historical discovery, the internet can showcase it to us. We can witness what we would see if we were physically present at the location, but instead, we view it on a monitor in our homes. The computer allows us to engage in certain activities without actually experiencing them firsthand. In conclusion, computers are advantageous as they enable us to perform tasks that would otherwise be unattainable under specific circumstances, such as communicating with people over the internet or learning about foreign countries. Not everyone can engage in these activities, but anyone with a computer can.
1308	1312	1	1	Envision the sentiments of individuals in the past when advanced technology was non - existent. What if you had not seen your best friend for years and lived at a great distance? Well, now there is this advanced device called a computer. It is truly remarkable and offers a highly interactive experience that enhances eye - hand coordination. However, @CAPS1 will now expound on certain aspects of this device and how it impacts human daily life. Moreover, the categories include cultivating successful relationships, enrolling in online courses, and accessing the most popular local websites. Did you know that approximately @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have achieved a successful life through online dating? There are numerous individuals who struggle with relationships. For instance, one day my parents engaged in a series of intense arguments. My mother felt that the relationship was unsatisfactory and that she needed to meet a more suitable partner. Consequently, she decided to embark on a new life and seek dates online, thereby initiating a fresh chapter. These are the remarkable opportunities the computer provides for fostering better relationships. Suppose you are a high - school dropout because you are unable to keep pace with the class. You fail to submit your homework and perform poorly on every test. Moreover, you believe there is nothing you can do to rectify the situation. Well, hold on, my friend! Now, you can enroll in online courses to improve your grades and feel more at ease. Imagine sitting at the computer, completing every assignment and homework task. Watching your teacher instruct you via a webcam. There is truly nothing quite like it. In fact, you can even have your homework faxed to you. Someone in the world is living this lifestyle, and it could be you. There are numerous new websites across the globe today. However, there is no better platform than one where all your friends are present. For example, MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. These are all websites that enable you to stay in touch with your closest friends. Another even more engaging option is the webcam. It offers live, face - to - face footage from the comfort of your home. How thrilling is it to see your friend when you are not together? Thirdly, communication is the cornerstone of human connection, which is why more and more people are making new friends. In summary, as you can see, there are numerous enjoyable activities you can engage in on a computer. It influences human lives because an increasing number of people are becoming interested in this device.
1309	1313	1	1	"Dear local Newspaper, Why squander your time learning at home when that is the purpose of schools? There is a growing concern that an excessive number of people are spending an inordinate amount of time on their computers. They spend less time outdoors, engaging in physical activity, and appreciating nature! People require more time to interact with their families. There is a palpable concern that there is far too much computer usage. On one occasion, my mother purchased a new computer, and I stayed up all night surfing the internet. When I woke up the next morning, I was extremely fatigued and did not want to go to school. I believe you should consider advocating for less computer time. The more time people spend on their computers, the less time they devote to enjoying the outdoors. Instead of chatting with friends on MySpace, you could meet them at the park just down the street. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in @CAPS2 who use a significant amount of computer time. Social interaction is a wonderful way to enjoy nature and have fun. Family activities are a pleasant, enjoyable, and fulfilling way to spend your time. You can visit the park when the outdoor weather is pleasant, go swimming, play sports. In the winter, you could go to the movies, visit the mall, and have a great time with your family instead of wasting your time on the internet. In conclusion, there is an excessive amount of computer time, and as the newspaper editor, I urge you to advocate for making computers more expensive so that people will spend their money on more useful things. My mother once said, ""The more people use their computers, the less they put their feet in their shoes and walk outside!"" Many people in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 share the same view. Please consider my opinions seriously. Thank you."
1310	1314	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever truly marveled at the computers in our contemporary era? Have you witnessed all the fascinating and astonishing things that computers allow us to explore? Computers are widely regarded as having advanced our society due to their ability to present websites containing vast and diverse research. However, let me pose this question to you: Have you ever contemplated whether computers actually undermine the quality of someone's life? Individuals who use computers often become engrossed in them and neglect the essential physical activities that can be obtained from being outdoors. Additionally, those who spend excessive time in front of a computer screen interact less with friends and family than they normally would. Moreover, one significant threat that teens and children encounter while online is the presence of individuals who attempt to communicate with them and may pose a danger to the children. To safeguard the well - being of people, we must recognize the negative impacts of computers! If you were to visit a park or a field, you would likely encounter someone enjoying the outdoors. When I refer to this, I mean activities such as playing soccer or football, or tossing a frisbee. People who engage in these activities instead of sitting indoors staring at a computer screen contribute to maintaining their physical health. When using a computer, no healthy physical activity is involved. Would you prefer to see yourself healthy and active or lethargic and sluggish? During the summer, my friends and I typically go to the field to play a game of soccer. We also sometimes visit the beach and enjoy the cool, refreshing water in the pool. Not to mention, we even find activities to do in the cold, wintry weather, such as sledding and snowboarding. People need to step away from the computer, pry their eyes from the screen, and venture outside to breathe in the fresh air. The experience of being outdoors will elevate your mood and transform you from a person in a stupor to one who feels truly alive! Also, have you ever returned home and retreated to your room for some quiet time? Then you decide to go on the computer to escape your troubles. ""Dinner is ready,"" a family member informs you; however, you do not respond because you are so engrossed in the computer. Computers disrupt your connection with family members and friends. Additionally, many people enter a trance - like state while using the computer, blocking out all external communication. Computers do not bring families together; they drive them apart. This results in an unhealthy family environment, which is detrimental as people need to have a strong bond with their family. Studies indicate that the average person spends five hours on the computer each day. This consumes a substantial amount of time, preventing families from spending quality time together. One crucial issue that children and teens face online is the presence of so - called ""child predators."" These individuals often seek to harm children by extracting information from them and arranging meetings. Research shows that @PERCENT1 of children encounter these ""child predators."" Would you want to see your child harmed by these dreadful individuals? Computers, along with the internet, are the root cause of these incidents. Children and teens need to be protected from this significant threat! In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people and their lives. Firstly, they prevent people from being active and going outdoors."
1311	1315	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, has this ever occurred to you? ""@PERSON3, did you conduct your research?"" ""@CAPS3, my computer malfunctioned."" ""@PERSON1, did you practice typing @TIME1?"" "" @CAPS3, my computer malfunctioned."" "" @CAPS5, why were you offline @TIME1? I was in dire need of that sales report!"" ""I apologize, @PERSON2, my computer malfunctioned."" @CAPS6, @CAPS2, you must recognize that computers indeed benefit humanity. Whether it's working on a class project, preparing for a computer course, or exchanging business ideas, computers are of great assistance to society. Firstly, computers are highly beneficial in the context of a computer class at school. There may be a specific typing speed requirement for passing the class, and the teacher might assign home practice on one's personal computer. It is a fact that @PERCENT1 of children with personal computers at home achieve @CAPS7 A's in their computer classes. I can attest to this. In my computer class, our teacher emphasizes the significance of home practice to improve typing speed. Every @TIME1, I would practice, but one @TIME1, my computer crashed, and I was unable to practice for the entire week leading up to the final exam on @DATE1. Instead of getting a @CAPS8 or A, I received a @CAPS9+. I attribute this grade to not having a functional computer at home. Secondly, computers can be utilized for learning @MONTH1 diverse things. For instance, if you need to write a class report on the traditions of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, rather than rushing to the library and wasting time with a book, you can simply open your laptop and search for information on the internet. Not only does it save time, but @CAPS6 when you search on the internet, you will obtain far more search results than @CAPS6 when you search in a library directory. Additionally, by using computers, you can research the customs of foreign countries or find programs to learn a new language. With computers, you can learn not only about your own country but also about foreign ones. Thirdly, computers can enhance numerous skills essential in the modern business world, such as socialization skills, communication skills, and even understanding the younger generation. @CAPS6 if someone has not used an instant messaging program or a video - chatting program, they will struggle to succeed in today's world. People need to learn to interact with one another and solve problems. @CAPS6 if someone is not accustomed to interacting with others, they @MONTH1 will not make a successful businessperson. People must be able to communicate effectively. @CAPS6 if people do not communicate with each other, we will all be at a loss. We will be unable to run businesses or hold meetings. For example, I needed to schedule a meeting for my project group to work on a project. I went on my computer, hoping they were online, but they never showed up, and I was unable to collaborate with my partners. I ended up doing all their work. In conclusion, I hope you have thoroughly considered my opinion regarding the impact of computers on people. As I mentioned, computers can be helpful in computer classes, researching foreign affairs, and communicating with others. Thank you again for reading this letter."
1312	1316	1	1	Dear local newspaper, proponents of technological advancements assert that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. I, for one, concur with this view. Computers are remarkable devices that enable people of all ages to explore the world and its inhabitants. They facilitate communication with family members residing afar, friends, or sometimes business associates. Technology also offers educational opportunities. Do you not consider socializing and learning to be two crucial aspects of daily life? Learning new things is only engaging when one can actually visualize them. The utility of books depends on their publication date. Internet websites often update with new pictures on a near - weekly basis. Consequently, you can determine where to plan your next visit. While books can provide a wealth of information, they cannot match the vast amount of data available on the thousands of websites accessible at this moment. If you wish to learn Spanish, simply search for it on the internet; it is quick and effortless. There is no need to sift through hundreds of books to obtain a single fact. Throughout one's daily activities, chatting with friends is an excellent way to unwind and have fun, whether it's with a close friend or a colleague. There are now multiple means of communicating with friends, including phones, texting, instant messaging, and even video chat. Although it @MONTH1 may detract from time spent with family, one can easily end the conversation with the friend and resume it later. Finally, learning is of utmost importance to people today. Thanks to advanced technology, we have discovered enjoyable methods to educate students. Colorful and engaging websites can teach children how to multiply and read. Approximately @PERCENT1 of children are more attracted to colorful objects than to books filled with text. Therefore, to all parents and guardians, computers are not as detrimental as they may seem; in fact, they are highly beneficial.
1313	1317	1	1	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 are you fond of computers yet concerned that you or your loved ones spend an excessive amount of time on them? If so, perhaps we should @CAPS1 take action. A significant number of individuals experience vision problems due to prolonged exposure to computer screens. Moreover, people miss out on outdoor activities. Finally, if individuals rely on computers for their jobs, they neglect other important aspects of life, such as interacting with family and friends, enjoying the outdoors, or simply spending quality time with their loved ones. Now, are you in favor of or opposed to the phenomenon of people becoming ""addicted"" to computers? In my opinion, people should relish life's experiences rather than spending the majority of their time on computers. Since people are overly dependent on computers, working on one can sometimes harm their vision. The bright white computer screen inundated with emails can significantly affect one's eyesight. I know that my father often suffers from headaches, and his vision deteriorates after spending an entire day working on a computer. Spending all day indoors in front of a computer causes one to miss out on outdoor activities such as sports, nature walks, cycling, and many other pursuits. Only energetic and lively individuals venture outside and stay active. Last but not least, @CAPS1 do you enjoy spending time with your loved ones but find yourself too occupied because you are glued to the computer all day? If so, then get up and have some fun! Take your wife and children on a hike or go cycling. It is an excellent form of exercise for you, your family, and friends, and it is genuinely enjoyable! So, the time to act is now. @CAPS1 do you want to stay at home in front of a computer all day, or @CAPS1 do you want to be full of energy and spend quality time with family and friends? Most importantly, @CAPS1 do you want to be energetic, healthy, free from vision problems, and rid of those dreadful headaches? Well, without a doubt, if you get up and get active, it will be the best decision you make! So, get up, gather the kids, and embark on a new, energetic, and pain - free life."
1314	1318	1	1	Dear editor, I concur with the presence of computers in our homes. I believe that computers are advantageous for the following reasons. The computer contains a vast amount of information that can be accessed. Additionally, the computer can store a multitude of important items. Moreover, it enables communication with individuals at a distance. I firmly believe that a computer is an extremely useful tool as it allows one to search for various things, such as significant details about someone's life. One can access a website to learn about a word or a car required for school or work. One can also research events that occurred a long time ago, like @NUM1 or @DATE1. Furthermore, one can explore their family tree and discover their ancestral connections. One can also access their bank account or email on the computer. This is one reason why I consider a computer to be beneficial. Another reason why I believe a computer is advantageous for anyone is its ability to store a large number of important things. One can save significant information from the past. Additionally, one needs to save reports for school or work. One can also save pictures from special occasions. One can add favorite websites to their bookmarks for easy access at any time. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. The final reason why I believe computers are beneficial is the ability to communicate with people far away. You may have family members who have moved, and you can keep in touch with them via email, MySpace, Facebook, etc. You can have video chats with friends or family living in different locations. You can participate in online chats with colleagues or your boss for meetings. This is yet another reason why I think computers are a good thing. As you can see, these are the reasons why I believe computers are beneficial. They allow us to search for information, store important things, and communicate with friends. This is why I firmly believe that computers are a good addition to our lives.
1315	1319	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 in my opinion, the impact of computers depends on the extent of their usage. However, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. This is because they have made homework easier for children and offer entertaining websites to explore. Even adults find computers useful when they need to look up important information. Firstly, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people because they simplify homework. Instead of referring to books, one can obtain information from a computer. Trust me, it is much more convenient than sifting through numerous books. All you need to do is type in your query, and the relevant information will appear automatically. For example, if you have an essay to write about @PERSON1 in @LOCATION1, all you have to do is visit @CAPS2.com, where various @CAPS2 related to him are available. Then, when you search for @LOCATION1, all the relevant @CAPS2 about him will be displayed. Thus, you can obtain the correct information, which is an easy way to get an A+. Secondly, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people due to the numerous websites available for entertainment. You can play games, visit YouTube, or check your MySpace page. There are countless activities to enjoy on a computer. For instance, if you do not @CAPS3 want to play your game console, watch @CAPS3.V, or go outside, you can turn to your computer. You can check your MySpace profile, watch funny videos, or chat with friends online. Consider this: you cannot perform any of these activities on your @CAPS3.V, game console, or outside. This is why I think computers have a positive impact on people. Lastly, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people because adults also enjoy using them. Half of all adults' jobs involve using a computer, whether it's for cashing a check, teachers for grading, or scientists for researching different experiments. For example, teachers always use their computers to enter grades, assess students' progress, and identify areas where students need help. This shows that computers also make tasks easier for adults. In conclusion, these are the reasons why I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people.
1316	1320	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, a substantial portion of the @ORGANIZATION1 populace utilizes any form of computer at least once daily. Our society has become so accustomed to computers that some individuals would find it arduous to exist without them. Computers have evolved into something on which people rely. This, however, warrants concern. When individuals are overly dependent on computers, they forfeit valuable skills they once possessed and spend less time outdoors engaging in physical activity while also losing touch with family and friends. It has become evident that computers have become an integral part of people's lives. Computers possess the capability to perform certain human tasks that seem challenging for us. Prior to the computer era, it was far more difficult to obtain information on a topic or about a place. We formerly had to consult encyclopedias or search for books on those subjects. Sometimes, we even had to travel to a location to learn about it. Today, however, people employ technology to acquire this information. You @MONTH1 might be pondering, ""@CAPS3, how is this detrimental?"" The reason it is a problem is that people have begun to lose the ability to utilize resources like encyclopedias, atlases, or even simple maps. Once, the majority of the population could employ these tools to navigate through information or a place. I know from experience that I can scarcely look at a map and determine my location. We have become overly reliant on @CAPS4's and computers, which in turn causes us to forget valuable information. What would transpire if someone got lost and did not have a functioning @CAPS4 or a phone signal? They would become lost and not know how to read a map. As you can observe, the human population has become excessively dependent on computers. Additionally, people worldwide have become addicted to the internet. Facebook, @CAPS6, and even @CAPS7 baseball have become addictive activities that consume all of people's time. When people commence spending the majority of their time on these websites, they will consequently engage in less exercise and become more estranged from family and friends. This issue predominantly affects teenagers. If you conducted a survey of the number of students who have a Facebook account or @CAPS6, you would likely find that the majority do. Having an account like this is reputed to be addictive. Students, parents, and everyone in between will encounter difficulties later on as a result. America is one of the leading nations with obesity. Has anyone paused to consider that perhaps people spend too much time on these websites to engage in any exercise? If the internet were not as prominent as it is now, I wager there would be fewer overweight individuals. Moreover, not only do people become overweight, but they will also end up increasingly distant from family and friends. My own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to confiscate it. At one point, the only way for us to communicate with her was through Facebook. As you can see, computers can be perilous. Consider all the people you know who spend multiple hours on the computer. You can probably think of quite a few. Computers are addictive and can lead to less exercise and less communication, which are proven to support a healthy lifestyle. Also, when people use computers excessively, they lose valuable skills. Bear this in mind the next time you or someone you know sits down at a computer for an extended period. You can assist them."
1317	1321	1	1	"Dear newspaper readers, @CAPS1, behold this! Seated at home on the couch, indulging in a bag of potato chips. The @CAPS2 presents a captivating image of the @LOCATION1; you can almost sense the rain cascading upon you, and you genuinely desire to learn more about it. Suddenly, you witness the remote tumbling to the ground. Your hand - eye coordination is so poor that you completely miss it when attempting to grasp it. Moreover, you recall that you were supposed to meet your sister today, whom you haven't seen for years, but you can't! If you owned a computer, you would be able to learn about more places and people, it would enhance your hand - eye coordination, and you could interact with individuals without having the time to meet them in person! Computers undoubtedly have positive effects on people! First, computers aid in improving hand - eye coordination. It is a well - established fact that individuals who own one or more computers in a household exhibit better hand - eye coordination than those without computers! Don't you also aspire to have good hand - eye coordination? As a matter of fact, my friend @PERSON4 had the most abysmal hand - eye coordination in our school. Now that her parents have purchased a computer for her, she is significantly quicker and definitely has improved hand - eye coordination. She stated that simply looking at the screen and the desire to interact with it helped immensely. Additionally, research on computer usage indicates that computers have been proven to enhance hand - eye coordination over the course of a year. That seems rather straightforward to me! Next, computers also enable people to learn about distant places and individuals. Local middle - school teacher, @PERSON2, employs computers to instruct her students about the @CAPS3 culture and geography. That sounds far more engaging than mere verbal instruction! My cousins once came across an article about @LOCATION3 and thought it was remarkable. They learned a great deal about the culture there and actually embarked on a trip to that location! Furthermore, vacations.com asserts that computers are the #@NUM1 factor contributing to people traveling because they view pictures and articles about places. You can learn about any place you desire on a computer. Doesn't that sound appealing? I'm certain there is a place you've always yearned to learn about! Finally, computers allow people to interact with others across the globe. You can converse with your long - lost friend residing in @LOCATION2 with just a click of the mouse (send). In a recent study, over @PERCENT1 of people prefer to communicate with their friends online rather than meeting them in person. How convenient! Also, expert computer teacher, @PERSON1, remarks, ""Computers are excellent if you can't meet someone; you simply communicate online."" Have you ever had to cancel a meeting? Computers are truly advantageous for busy individuals. Now, readers, @CAPS1, as you sit on that same couch, looking at the @CAPS2 to see @LOCATION1, you promptly type it into your laptop, and an article appears right before you. You read it, learning something new with each paragraph. Suddenly, you lose your grip, but you manage to catch your laptop just in time. What remarkable hand - eye coordination! Then, you remember that you were supposed to meet your sister @PERSON3, but you have a hair appointment. You quickly inform her via computer that you can't meet her. She says it's alright, and you two continue chatting. It all works out so smoothly! Computers teach hand - eye coordination, allow you to learn about more places, and facilitate interaction with others. So, what are you waiting for, readers?"
1318	1322	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, what are your thoughts regarding the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? I believe that computers offer assistance in numerous ways. Computers enhance hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning, and even enable us to communicate online with friends and family. Have you ever contemplated how a computer can benefit you physically? Many parents claim, ""@CAPS2 spend too much time on the computer!"" However, what they fail to recognize is that the computer is teaching them hand - eye coordination. Parents contend that children gain weight because they sit indoors using the computer. Nevertheless, if they implement certain measures to restrict the @CAPS2, such as allowing access to only specific games, limiting their computer time, or requiring them to play outside for the same duration as they spend on the computer, the children could learn while remaining physically fit. This is why a computer can be a crucial part of a child's life when used appropriately. What is your preferred method of learning? Perhaps you read books, attend school, or even watch @CAPS3. But what if you're not at school or have no books available? What if @CAPS3 isn't providing the information you need? Well, with a computer, you can look up almost anything with just a few clicks of a button. If you don't have the time to visit your local library to borrow a book, @CAPS1, how would you acquire knowledge? As a teenager attending school, I know that I wouldn't be able to complete a significant portion of my schoolwork and projects without my computer. Many home - based jobs today necessitate the use of computers, and without them, the work wouldn't get done. This is why I believe computers benefit our society and expand our knowledge. Does everyone you know reside in the same area? Probably not. This is why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are attracting more and more members each day. The internet helps us maintain contact with relatives, friends, and even enables us to meet new people. I know that the internet helps me stay in touch with old friends."
1319	1323	1	1	Dear, @CAPS1 - @ORGANIZATION1, computers are akin to people in that they possess both positive and negative aspects. Computers are beneficial for retrieving information and simplifying work. However, simultaneously, they can be detrimental to you and your family's well - being. Computers contain such a vast amount of information that newspapers may become obsolete in the future. Newspapers will no longer be delivered to your front porch. Thanks to computers, instead of obtaining information about what transpired yesterday in your local area, you can discover interesting events that occurred worldwide. If someone has a science project, for example, on cells, a computer will be far more helpful than one might think. There's no need to write sloppily; you can simply type information about cells that you find on the internet, print it out, and you're done. This makes life significantly easier compared to manually writing, drawing, and searching for information in books, which wastes valuable time that could be spent outdoors with friends and family. As I mentioned, computers, like people, can be negative, and they are also comparable to drugs. Consider when people visit websites such as MySpace, Twitter, Facebook, communication websites, or gaming websites; there are far too many to list. It's like a drug because it compels you to stay on it from day to night. You become addicted and can't get enough of it. Some people won't stop, and this harms their family, friends, and especially their health, just as drugs do. I believe I have effectively demonstrated why computers, like people, can be both good and bad at times.
1320	1324	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I believe that the use of computers has a significant impact. Utilizing a computer can assist people in various ways. You can communicate with individuals globally, it helps you maintain organization, and you can create highly useful items such as a document or a PowerPoint presentation using a computer. Communicating with people worldwide can be an extremely valuable asset. Suppose you have family members residing in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2. You can keep in touch with them via email or video chat. Additionally, if there is a national issue and the government needs to consult other governments around the world for advice and assistance, they can do so promptly and effortlessly. Using a computer can also aid in keeping you organized. For instance, my uncle uses a computer to file taxes, ensuring that all files are saved and stored in the appropriate locations. Imagine the amount of paper and space he would require if he had to do it manually or did not use a computer. Computers are also beneficial to teachers. Teachers can enter grades, email parents, and even create tests or quizzes. They know that these will be neatly and systematically organized in computer files rather than in paper files on their desks. Speaking of quizzes that teachers create on the computer, they can also produce many other things, such as PowerPoint presentations. PowerPoint presentations can help them display a large amount of information on the screen, which facilitates students' learning, a positive outcome. If you have a small business that has just launched, you can create a brochure to aid in advertising. Lastly, you can use Microsoft Excel to create a schedule that helps your employees know their work shifts or students know their class timings. In conclusion, computers are highly useful in daily life for a wide range of people. Communicating globally helps you stay connected, so you don't lose touch with your loved ones. They also have a positive impact as they help business people stay organized. Lastly, they assist teachers in creating tests or PowerPoint presentations, which benefits students' learning. Therefore, I must concur that computers have a positive impact on society. Also, doesn't typing your newspaper articles make them more organized and quicker to print?
1321	1325	1	1	"Dear Trained Audiences, would you not concur that an increasing number of individuals utilize computers? I certainly do, as it provides us with the information we desire. Recently, it has come to my attention that some individuals, including certain non - users themselves, do not really engage with computers. Without a doubt, I firmly advocate that those who do not use computers should commence doing so. However, I can comprehend the reasons why some people abstain from using them. Perhaps they lack the knowledge of how to operate one, have more valuable pursuits, or are financially unable to acquire one.  First of all, they lack the know - how to use a computer. I recall when my friend visited, and I was using a computer. He inquired, ""Do you realize that some people do not know how to use a computer?"" I responded, ""Who?"" He replied, ""Me, I don't know how to use one."" I offered, ""Well, I'll teach you."" Since then, all my friend does is use the computer. One day, he told me that he wants to work with computers. This is one reason why people don't use computers.  Second of all, some have more worthwhile activities. For instance, someone might have a game scheduled. Usually, I am quite busy with basketball games or practices. After practice, I return home exhausted, and all I want to do is go to sleep. This is why parents, who have been occupied all day, may not want to do anything. This is another reason why people don't use computers.  Third of all, some cannot afford one. Some individuals do not have sufficient funds to purchase a computer. They must save money to maintain a place to live. When their children ask for something, parents might buy it to avoid hurting their feelings. When I become an adult, I will ensure that I have enough money to buy a computer. If not, then the child may be out of luck. So, do not boast about your computer, as some cannot afford one. This is my final reason why people don't use computers.  In conclusion, these are the reasons why some people do not use computers in contemporary times. They either lack the skills, have more important things to do, or cannot afford one. By the way, @PERCENT1 of the pupils at @ORGANIZATION1 do not own computers."
1322	1326	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am penning this to expound on my perspective regarding the impact of computers on society. While I acknowledge that computers are highly useful tools for learning and communication, I believe that contemporary individuals are over - reliant on them. Consider, for example, the @NUM1 gamers, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 enthusiasts. These individuals are so engrossed in computer usage that they often neglect spending time with family, friends, or even engaging in outdoor activities.  This excessive computer use not only deprives them of physical exercise but also has a detrimental effect on their social lives. Some people have demanding work schedules, leaving little time for social interaction. However, those who are addicted to computers further squander the limited time they could spend with loved ones. One might argue that online social networks provide a means of socializing, but how often do we actually meet these online acquaintances in person? Computers can thus alienate us from real - life social connections, which is clearly not beneficial for society.  Another drawback of computers is that their use is predominantly confined to indoor settings. It is difficult to enjoy the beauty of the outdoors while being engrossed in online activities. Although laptops offer the possibility of outdoor use, it is questionable whether one can truly appreciate the natural environment while focused on the screen. Moreover, the use of computers often leads to a sedentary lifestyle and a lack of physical exercise. It is nearly impossible to use a computer and engage in physical activities simultaneously. This lack of exercise can significantly lower one's quality of life.  However, it is important to note that if computers are used sparingly and only when necessary, these negative side - effects can be minimized. The reality is that computers can be addictive, whether it is waiting for a friend to come online or striving to reach level @NUM2 of ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"". The purpose of this article is not to discourage computer use but to advocate for a balanced approach. When used judiciously, computers are invaluable tools, but overuse can lead to problems and prevent us from spending time with family, friends, and enjoying the outdoors. I am confident that you will concur with this view."
1323	1327	1	1	I am of the firm belief that computers offer numerous benefits for several compelling reasons. Firstly, they facilitate communication with others. My parents frequently utilize email to converse with my grandparents, friends, and even to organize events. I also rely on it to check on friends who may be ill, and some people use it to learn about magazine subscriptions and make purchases. One of my favorite aspects is when my parents use email to discuss my birthday presents with my grandparents.  Secondly, computers provide a platform to meet new people. There are numerous websites that match individuals based on shared interests. Through email, we can maintain contact with friends and potentially arrange to meet them again. There are countless avenues to meet new people, such as chat websites, Facebook, or MySpace.  Thirdly, computers are excellent for planning. They can be used to plan vacations or make dining reservations. For example, when my family and I went on a vacation to @LOCATION1, my mother made all the reservations from our home computer. Many people travel during vacations, and it is likely that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer to book hotels.  Now, let us consider a world without computers. Without them, we would have to rely on the post office to send mail, which could result in significant delays. By the time the mail arrives, a new baby could have been born. Additionally, we would have to handle bills and taxes manually, without the assistance of computer software. Life for my parents and me would be extremely chaotic without computers.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial, and more than half of America utilizes them. They enable us to communicate with distant family members, meet new people through online dating services, and assist in planning various aspects of our lives. If we did not have computers, our lives would be far more complicated and time - consuming.
1324	1328	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am convinced that computers do not contribute positively to society. This conviction stems from the fact that excessive computer use leads to a lack of social skills, a sedentary lifestyle, and addiction.  Firstly, spending excessive hours on the computer severely hampers the development of social skills. When communicating online, one has the luxury of time to think before replying, and people often behave differently online than in person. They can even assume false identities. Online, one can easily erase what has been written, but in face - to - face interactions, words cannot be retracted. Consequently, spending an inordinate amount of time chatting online does not foster the acquisition of genuine social skills.  Secondly, computer use often results in a lack of exercise. On a beautiful @DATE1, one might choose to stay indoors and use the computer instead of engaging in physical activity. Sitting in front of a screen, doing nothing but chatting, promotes a sedentary and lazy lifestyle. As one grows older, physical activity becomes even more crucial, and spending long hours on the computer is not conducive to a healthy lifestyle. It is essential to allocate time for both computer use and exercise.  Finally, computers can be highly addictive. Some individuals can spend hours upon hours on the computer, watching videos. Seven out of ten teenagers prefer to stay indoors and chat with people online rather than meeting new people in real - life settings. I believe that parents should regulate their children's computer usage. The time spent on the computer could be better utilized for studying or engaging in activities that will benefit them in the future.  In conclusion, I firmly maintain that computers do not benefit society due to the lack of social skills, the absence of exercise, and their addictive nature. I advocate that individuals should limit their computer time and focus on more meaningful and productive activities.
1325	1329	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, the topic of @ORGANIZATION1 has been a subject of debate in @LOCATION1 for several decades. There is a significant divide among the public regarding whether computers are a boon or a bane to society. In my view, computers have a positive influence on individuals. They enhance hand - eye coordination, impart knowledge about diverse cultures worldwide, and enable seamless communication.  Hand - eye coordination is not an innate ability; it is developed through practice as one matures. Computers play a crucial role in this process. Biologist @PERSON1 states, ""@PERCENT1 of individuals who frequently access @ORGANIZATION1 were initially inept at catching a baseball but became proficient after using it."" This improvement is not limited to baseball; it extends to other sports such as juggling, golf, and tennis. Proficiency in these sports can be a source of entertainment or even a professional career. Who would have thought that using @ORGANIZATION1 could have such far - reaching benefits?  Moreover, according to ""Time"" magazine, individuals who use @ORGANIZATION1 are better able to concentrate on tasks like schoolwork. This is because it trains the hands and eyes to work in harmony. Good grades in school can open doors to various job opportunities and a prosperous life.  Computers also offer easy access to a vast amount of information. For instance, when I have a culture project in @LOCATION3 history, I can quickly access @ORGANIZATION1 to gather relevant details. This is particularly beneficial for me as I have cheerleading practice every day until @NUM2. Without computers, I would struggle to complete my projects while also participating in sports. @PERCENT2 of people rely on computers for informational tasks about distant places because it is faster and more accurate than traditional methods.  In addition, computers have revolutionized communication. Platforms like Facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 provide new ways to connect with others. An expert from @LOCATION2 @ORGANIZATION1 notes that ""@PERCENT3 of people do not engage in online chatting,"" but most people use these platforms for various purposes, such as discussing homework or catching up with friends. Online communication can even be a valuable tool for maintaining good grades.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on society through the development of hand - eye coordination, the provision of information, and the facilitation of communication. It is difficult to imagine a world without them."
1326	1330	1	1	Dear Editor of the @LOCATION1, astonishingly, @PERCENT1 of individuals in @LOCATION3 possess computers! Can one fathom a life bereft of them? Computers indeed confer benefits upon society. I scarcely recall the last occasion when I went a single day without utilizing a computer. All this discourse regarding computers being detrimental to society has truly prompted contemplation. It is utterly implausible that computers are deleterious. For instance, computers are advantageous for motor skills. What about schoolwork? Computers prove immensely helpful when one forgets their homework log at school. Lastly, consider sociability! I am uncertain about you, yet I could not envision existence without computers! Computers impart hand - eye coordination, which, as we all recognize, is requisite for engaging in sports! Moreover, with all the typing one does, there is undoubtedly some exercise for the wrists! I can attest to this because I injured both my wrists simultaneously, and during rehabilitation, I was advised to attempt restoring normalcy to my wrists through typing and consuming an adequate amount of calcium, but that is another narrative. Computers are also superb for school. Suppose you forget your homework log at school and thus have no knowledge of your assigned homework. You could contact a friend, but would it not be far more convenient to access the teacher's webpage online? Teachers invariably list homeworks on the school's website. And lo and behold, you realize you've also forgotten your math book! Fear not, for the online textbook is at your disposal! And that is considerably more convenient than returning to school to retrieve it! Do you not concur? Lastly, when confronted with a substantial project, you can conduct research on any and every subject in the world! From ants to @LOCATION2, all the information is readily available. Here's a significant boon to society: on all the social networking platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, and numerous others, are you not able to leave comments on friends' profiles or even engage in chat with them? This leads me to my next topic: chatting on the computer! There is @CAPS2, and as previously mentioned, you can even chat on social networking sites. And supposing you are unable to watch the news, can you not access it online? There are innumerable social activities one can undertake on the computer, and these are merely a few examples. So, I earnestly hope that those @PERCENT1 of people, and even those who do not own computers, will side with me. Thus, we can demonstrate that computers are beneficial for motor skills, schoolwork, and even social networking. So, kindly support my stance so that we can showcase to the public that computers are socially advantageous.
1327	1331	1	1	Computers were devised to facilitate human tasks, rendering them both more expeditious and less arduous. Since their inception, they have undergone successive updates, evolving into their present - day form. Computers have become an integral part of most people's daily lives and are indispensable for the majority of businesses. However, a prevalent query in our society persists: are computers genuinely conferring benefits upon us? My response is an unequivocal affirmative. Computers perform a multitude of functions for us. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow us with the capacity to conduct research efficaciously, and, more recently, have emerged as an excellent medium of communication. Undoubtedly, @CAPS1's are bestowing benefits upon us. One rationale for computers' utility is their role in teaching hand - eye coordination. In a magazine I perused, an expert, (@PERSON1), posited that learning to type without visual reference is an outstanding method for enhancing reflexes. Typing speed improves with consistent practice. Another manner in which it enhances hand - eye coordination is by learning to click and respond to diverse stimuli effectively. I frequently find myself engrossed in playing computer games. These games are typically challenging, but with my burgeoning hand - eye coordination, I am gradually mastering the art of playing them proficiently. My father consistently admonishes me to familiarize myself with computers because they represent our future. Soon, with the rapid advancement of technology, the majority of tasks will be executed by them. It is inconceivable that they will not be advantageous to our society. Our home computers have been exemplary in instructing me skills such as hand - eye coordination. Another reason computers are remarkable is that they make that onerous history paper accessible with a mere click. My grandfather often remarks on how effortless my life is. Instead of trekking to the @CAPS2 and painstakingly selecting a book, I simply navigate to Google and have an entire search engine at my disposal. As we progress to high school, a computer will be indispensable for academic success. It helps us organize our essays, conduct research efficiently, and presents us with legible typing. My brother asserts that purchasing a computer was the most prudent investment he has ever made. Last year, we had a science assignment to elucidate the mechanism behind an accelerated heartbeat. This task was remarkably straightforward as I merely typed the query, and hundreds of methods to elevate my pulse rate were presented. Computers have revolutionized the way we conduct research and complete schoolwork. The final reason computers are extraordinary is that they render communication instantaneous. A few weeks ago, my coach emailed us to inform us of a change in our game time. This may seem trivial, but without his @CAPS1, we would have missed the game. My cousin @CAPS3 hails from @LOCATION1. We meet only once a year, and with such limited interaction, we struggle to convey all that we wish to. Recently, I acquired a webcam and have been engaging in weekly chats with him. It is almost as if he is in the same room with me. All the girls in our school are enamored of me. After sports, when I return home and log on, I can connect with them easily. Webcamming is an excellent mode of communication. With the continuous introduction of new computers and innovative appliances, the possibilities seem endless. Well, the question lingers: are computers beneficial to our society? The answer may not be immediately apparent, but for me, the improvement in hand - eye coordination, the ease of research, and the convenience of communication are compelling evidence of their utility. So, for now, I firmly maintain that computers are outstanding and extremely beneficial to everyone.
1328	1332	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am penning this correspondence to convey my perspective on computers and technologies. Computers have now become an indelible part of our society and culture, and their significance can be attributed to the following reasons. Firstly, computers enable users to browse the internet at any time of their choosing. Secondly, they facilitate online communication. The primary reason computers are so pivotal in our culture is that they afford the opportunity to surf the web anywhere and at any time, a highly convenient feature. Consider a scenario where one resides at a considerable distance from the nearest library. What if one is tasked with writing a research paper? Jane lives @NUM1 miles away from her town library. Her mother could drive her there, but what if she is unavailable or occupied taking someone else to a doctor's appointment? This is precisely when computers prove their worth. Jane can simply access the internet and commence her research! Moreover, ""www.internetsocool.gov"" indicates that the information obtainable in a conventional library amounts to approximately @NUM2 of the information accessible online. Secondly, computers empower users to communicate with individuals both near and far through online chatting and video - conferencing. This functionality is particularly valuable to me. As I reside alone in @LOCATION1, I frequently yearn for my family. Thanks to the internet, I can converse with my family whenever I desire! Additionally, one can engage in video chats with lab partners to deliberate on ways to enhance a lab report. @PERSON1, the author of ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3,"" also states in his book that over @NUM3 million individuals utilize the internet for video - conferencing for educational purposes. In conclusion, video - conferencing may initially appear to be a trivial pastime, but it actually serves numerous beneficial purposes. On the contrary, some individuals contend that computers are detrimental. Some claim that people are allocating excessive time to their computers, resulting in reduced physical activity and less time spent with family. However, ""The @DATE1 survey of what people do"" reveals that @PERCENT1 of computer users are both physically and emotionally healthy. Just because we leverage computers to simplify our lives does not imply that we do not value quality time with our families. In conclusion, computers are of utmost importance in our culture as they enable us to access the internet and assist us in interacting with those who live at a distance."
1329	1333	1	1	Do you consider computers to be advantageous? I firmly believe they are highly advantageous. Computers offer a plethora of services such as online shopping, @CAPS1, and even @CAPS2.V. Online shopping can be extremely beneficial. Suppose you do not possess a car. You can then access the internet and purchase any item you require from the store. People is a feature offered by @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, where you can order your @CAPS5 online and have it delivered to your doorstep. Whether you need clothing, footwear, or perhaps even games, you can browse the internet, select the desired item, click the purchase button, and choose your preferred shipping method. This is precisely why I deem computers to be helpful. Chatting on the computer is an excellent activity. Currently, Facebook, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7 are the preeminent social networking platforms. On @CAPS6, you can follow renowned personalities such as @PERSON1, the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 recipient. Facebook hosts fan pages for famous individuals. @CAPS7 may even feature official accounts of famous people. Chatting has become a ubiquitous activity, with nearly @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 participating. You may perceive it as futile, but the vast majority of the @CAPS13 engages in it. You can also utilize webcam @CAPS1, which allows you to visually interact with the person you are conversing with, and vice versa. @CAPS1 is also ideal if you are constantly on the move and unable to use a phone; you can send messages via @CAPS1. This is why I regard @CAPS1 as an essential tool. @CAPS17 is a novel phenomenon that has recently gained popularity in the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. There are websites such as @LOCATION1 or @CAPS16 @CAPS17. Additionally, you can purchase @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS17 and watch live sports events directly from your computer. This is particularly convenient when you are on a long road trip; you can simply turn on your laptop and watch any show you desire. @CAPS17 on the go represents the pinnacle of technological advancement. This is precisely why computers are so convenient. Now that you have perused how computers are helpful, why they are essential, and their convenience, if you ever require any of these services in the future, recall this and explore the most popular websites on the @CAPS15.
1330	1334	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an extraordinary technological innovation; however, some individuals are beginning to misuse the @CAPS2. There are numerous advantages to owning a computer. In my view, computers significantly assist people, whether it be in searching for directions or reconnecting with old friends. Nevertheless, many individuals are abusing the @CAPS2 and lack the self - discipline to disengage. The @CAPS2 is an extremely engaging platform, but excessive usage causes one to miss out on family activities, socializing with friends, and so forth. I advocate for the implementation of a time limit for everyone's computer usage. If there were a mechanism to automatically shut down the computer while saving all ongoing work, people would be more inclined to venture outdoors and lead an active lifestyle. Although individuals may be acquiring knowledge through the computer, it is essential to recognize when to step away. Currently, there are websites on the @CAPS2 where one can watch exercise videos or even purchase fitness equipment. The @CAPS2 can be an incredibly useful resource, but one should avoid extended periods of use. I firmly believe that owning a computer is both exciting and practical when needed. However, there should be restrictions on the duration of computer usage to ensure a balanced lifestyle.
1331	1335	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, and I am a member of the middle - class community. I read in the local newspaper that while many people use computers, not everyone believes this benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society in numerous ways. Firstly, they offer the flexibility to work from any location. With the prevalence of internet - enabled cellphones and iPods, which possess many of the work - related features found in a computer, and the portability of laptops, one can be productive anywhere. Secondly, computers facilitate connection with family members in other states or cities, such as @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @LOCATION1, through various programs. Lastly, they provide the opportunity to learn about different places and people via photos, information, and websites. For instance, one can access details about events and strategies that have occurred in other states, like the one in @LOCATION4. This is my stance on why computers are beneficial to society. Thank you for considering my view, and have a pleasant day.
1332	1336	1	1	Dear local newspaper, a question that has recently piqued my interest is whether people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers and if this is advantageous. I firmly believe that computers are a valuable electronic device. They aid people in learning, enabling them to access information on @LOCATION2 by simply typing in their queries. For example, a child embarrassed to ask her parents a question can find hundreds of answers on the computer. Moreover, computers allow people to stay in touch with friends in different countries. My dad, who runs a business, uses his iPhone to communicate with others via email, which helps him manage his work effectively. When I surveyed ten adults, all of them agreed that everyone should have a computer. Additionally, computers help maintain organization. They have numerous folders and programs to store information neatly. My friend, who used to have a messy desk filled with papers, now types everything neatly and stores her documents in computer folders after getting a computer. In conclusion, computers are beneficial as they assist in learning, facilitate communication, and help with organization. I hope you will consider this in the newspaper.
1333	1337	1	1	Are contemporary individuals spending an inordinate amount of time on computers? If so, what are the impacts? In today's modern era, people allocate excessive time to computers, and both I and others believe this affects them in multiple aspects, including health, social life, and education. Spending too much time on a PC can detrimentally impact health. For example, individuals who spend all their time sitting in a chair are at risk of weight gain. They may also not consume the necessary nutrients as they are engrossed in the computer and may not purchase fresh fruits and vegetables. Regarding social life, excessive computer use can lead to isolation from real - world interactions. Education can also be negatively affected. If one spends the entire day on the computer, they may neglect other important learning methods. These are the reasons why I believe people should limit their computer usage.
1334	1338	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: I am writing to express my opinion on the positive impacts of computers on people. Computers have a beneficial influence as they assist students and others in studying, enable online shopping, and facilitate communication. After reading this letter, I am confident you will concur. Firstly, computers are excellent study aids. Students can print practice sheets for @CAPS1 tests or quickly find vocabulary definitions. A statistic from @ORGANIZATION1 reveals that @PERCENT2 of students in the @ORGANIZATION2 consider computers their most effective study tool. I personally used the computer to prepare for a test on the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and found many useful resources. Secondly, online shopping saves time. Many stores now allow online purchases, which is convenient and eliminates the need to drive to physical stores. A survey in @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 across the @ORGANIZATION2 reported that online shopping made their lives less hectic. Finally, computers revolutionize communication. Instant messaging, email, and platforms like blackboard are widely used. In a survey of @NUM1 kids, @NUM2 stated that computers are their primary means of communication. It helps with work - related communication, staying in touch with friends in @LOCATION2, and sending party invitations. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by enhancing study, saving time through online shopping, and improving communication. There is no reason to believe they have a negative effect, and I hope you will take this into account.
1335	1339	1	1	"Would you prefer to search through six books to find a single recipe or look it up on a computer in less than ten minutes? I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on people. They allow us to learn about places we wish to visit during @DATE1. For example, @PERSON5 changed his travel plans to @LOCATION2 after learning about an earthquake there through an online search. Similarly, @PERSON2 decided to visit @LOCATION3 after researching it on Google. Moreover, computers enable us to quickly find what we need. @PERSON3, who was unable to find a cake recipe in cookbooks, found it on his laptop in under five minutes. As computer expert @PERSON1 said, it is more efficient to search online than to rummage through numerous books. Additionally, computers facilitate online communication with friends. @PERSON6, who moved from @CAPS4 to @LOCATION1, stays in touch with her best - friend on @CAPS5. @PERSON4, who was sick in bed, used @CAPS7 to communicate with his friends. In summary, computers are beneficial as they help us learn about travel destinations, quickly obtain necessary information, and communicate with friends. As @PERSON1 put it, ""it's much easier""."
1336	1340	1	1	Computers constitute an extremely significant element in numerous individuals' lifestyles. They can furnish us with remarkable facts and news that would otherwise be arduous to acquire. Moreover, computers offer individuals a convenient means of communicating with friends and family without the need for a phone. Lastly, computers are an exceptionally useful instrument for writing. One of the most advantageous aspects of computers is the ability to ascertain what is transpiring anywhere across the globe. For instance, one could conduct a search on recent disasters and discover hundreds of articles on @CAPS1 and other recent news. Additionally, one could also uncover interesting facts, such as the number of individuals who have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years. However, this represents merely one of the numerous applications of a computer. Some critics in @MONTH1 opine that the utilization of computers impedes the time spent with friends and family. Nevertheless, computers can actually achieve the opposite. There exist numerous websites that enable users to engage in secure conversations with others. Some of these websites include Facebook and ChatMe.com. Did you know that you can even engage in video chats with people? It is as if you are physically present with them. Incredibly, unlike making phone calls, using these websites is free and accessible to anyone. This leads me to the final point. Computers are excellent writing tools. They allow for efficient and neat writing. Furthermore, programs like Microsoft Word facilitate spell - checking of one's work. One of the most valuable attributes of a program like Word is the ability to modify one's work and insert sentences or words wherever desired. As you can observe, computers are a useful and beneficial component of society. They enable individuals to effortlessly stay informed about world news. Secondly, computers facilitate easy and secure communication among people, and lastly, they are useful for writing papers, such as writing prompts. I hope that after reading this, you can now recognize some of the many uses of computers.
1337	1341	1	1	"In contemporary society, technology permeates every corner. Among the most prevalent forms, computers are extensively employed by a large proportion of the population. However, the question arises: are computers genuinely advantageous to society? Computers confer benefits upon society as they serve as a means to connect with the world, a way to cultivate responsibility, and a valuable aid in education.  Computers are advantageous because they facilitate people's connection with the world. One can utilize a computer to access any information available on the web, enabling the discovery of details about places of interest or those one wishes to visit. According to @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals consult the internet for destinations to @ORGANIZATION1 before embarking on their actual trips. Additionally, it serves as a medium to stay in touch with distant friends. One of my friends relocated to @LOCATION1 during our @NUM3 grade, yet we still correspond via email and maintain our friendship. Moreover, the computer is one of the swiftest ways to stay informed about current events. All that is required is to visit a news website. These connections will broaden people's perspectives of the world.  Computers also offer a means to enhance responsibility. When individuals use a computer, they are confronted with numerous decisions, such as which websites to visit, what to download, or what to watch. Having these individual choices will prompt people to contemplate the appropriate decision. Even if an incorrect choice is made, one can learn from the mistake. Secondly, the computer is a delicate device that demands careful handling. For example, one must ensure that no liquids are in the vicinity and refrain from throwing objects near or onto the computer. Considering these factors and taking precautions to avoid damaging the computer are ways to foster responsibility.  Lastly, computers are beneficial as they contribute to education. Teachers can leverage computers to make lessons more engaging. For example, they can create points and presentations to provide a more immersive learning experience. Students can then reflect on what they have learned at school. Additionally, one can create assignments for students, which provide them with homework and information about the classes. One of my friends once remarked, ""@CAPS2 the I would definitely be failing."" Computers offer an excellent way to present information. Lastly, if one desires information about a particular school, one can simply search for it online and access its website. School websites contain details about classes, events, and clubs. They provide the necessary information to consider attending that school in an effortless and convenient manner. While finding a school's website takes no more than @NUM2 minutes, physically visiting the school for information can consume far more time, even hours. According to @ORGANIZATION2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students initially choose which college to attend by checking its website. The computer is an easy and convenient means of obtaining information.  In conclusion, there should be no doubt regarding the benefits of computers. They serve as a connection to the world, encompassing places and people. They enhance responsibility by presenting individuals with choices, and they support education by providing information about and for schools. This is why computers are advantageous to society."
1338	1342	1	1	Do you believe that people allocate an excessive amount of time to using the computer? I contend that both children and adults spend an inordinate amount of time @CAPS1, engaging in activities such as tweeting, using Facebook, and MySpace. My reasons include the fact that people should venture outdoors more often, interact with real individuals, and spend quality time with their families.  Most children should increase their outdoor activities. For instance, my friend @PERSON3 spends @NUM1 hours a day on his computer and rarely goes outside. Another example is my neighbor @PERSON2, who spends the entire day in his basement playing on his computer and has not been outside. As a result, he has developed an extreme aversion to the sun, and at @NUM2 years old, he still avoids going outdoors. This is because he has spent too much time on the computer.  Secondly, people should engage in interactions with real individuals. For example, there was a child named @CAPS2 who always played with virtual people and friends and rarely interacted with real ones. As a consequence, he has become extremely shy around real people and is even reluctant to utter a single word. Another example is @CAPS3, who only had virtual friends and never a real one. He is deeply depressed because he has never had a best friend.  Thirdly, one should allocate time to be with one's family. There was a person named @CAPS4 who never spent time with his family because he was overly occupied writing emails. @PERSON1 asserts that children who do not interact with their families will not reap the same benefits as those who do. Another example is a family where the members were so engrossed in using the computer that the children never met their grandparents. When the grandparents passed away, the children had never had the opportunity to meet them because they preferred to play on their computers.  In conclusion, people should spend more time outdoors, interact with real people, and visit their families. If one wishes to use the computer, it should be done after considering all these examples.
1339	1343	1	1	"A significant number of individuals utilize computers. While some individuals concur that computers are beneficial to society, others hold a contrary view. Some experts opine that people are devoting an excessive amount of time to computers, thereby reducing the time spent on physical exercise, outdoor activities, and family interactions. However, I hold a different perspective. Computers assist us in developing hand - eye coordination for employment, maintaining contact with family members and friends, and facilitating the acquisition of knowledge about diverse subjects.  Computers are instrumental in numerous aspects, with their role in employment being of utmost importance. A multitude of jobs rely on computers. To secure a job involving computer use, one needs hand - eye coordination, which computers can teach. They equip us with the skills necessary for future employment. Undoubtedly, computers are highly beneficial.  Computers also play a crucial role in helping us stay connected with our family members and friends. @PERSON2, a @CAPS1 from @LOCATION1, states that if computers did not exist, @CAPS2 would not have been able to witness her niece and nephew opening the Christmas presents she had given them. Moreover, @CAPS2 would not have seen her nephew taking his first steps. ""@CAPS2 explained to me, ""Technology is wonderful."" @CAPS2 greatly appreciates staying in touch with her family through computers.  Furthermore, computers are beneficial for learning, catering to individuals from young children to the elderly. Computers store a vast amount of information, and many people discover new things on the internet that they have never encountered before. My younger sister, @PERSON1, learned how to read using the computer. She is in the highest reading level achievable in first grade. Clearly, computers are extremely useful for learning new things.  Computers possess a wide range of capabilities. They aid us in obtaining jobs by imparting hand - eye coordination skills. They also enable us to maintain close relationships with our loved ones. Additionally, computers educate us about interesting phenomena such as distant places and people. Computers are truly a remarkable asset in our society. Experts, there is absolutely no reason for you to be concerned about the increasing use of computers; it is indeed a positive development."
1340	1344	1	1	In the contemporary world, every aspect is becoming increasingly technological. In my view, this is a positive trend. The utilization of computers has proven to be highly advantageous to society. They offer individuals the opportunity to conduct rapid and effortless research, contribute to the conservation of trees, and provide an excellent means of communicating with people at a distance.  Firstly, computers are superior to books for research purposes, as books often involve the wasteful use of trees. A few years ago, when students were assigned a school project on a particular country, the first thought that came to mind was to visit the library. However, in the present day, computers have become the preferred option. While books are undoubtedly valuable, the internet offers comparable benefits, along with the added advantages of speed and convenience in finding the desired information. With a simple click of a button, one can learn about a place before visiting it and explore far - flung locations. It is truly a remarkable experience.  Secondly, the use of computers helps to preserve trees. With the advent of computers, there is no longer a need to continuously fell large numbers of trees for the production of books and paper. Publishers can now sell their books online, allowing people to read them directly. In fact, there is little justification for the continued production of traditional books. Even students can complete their homework, tests, and quizzes online. It is truly astonishing to witness the transformation of our world in just about @NUM1 years.  Finally, computers are an ideal tool for communicating with people who are geographically distant. Some individuals have family members serving in the military, whom they may not see for months or even years. With a computer, one can send emails that are delivered instantaneously. Moreover, one can engage in webcam conversations and have a face - to - face interaction. It must be extremely difficult for people not to be able to see their loved ones on a daily basis, which is why computers are so valuable. This is equally applicable to those with family members on business trips or living in other states or countries.  In conclusion, computers are extremely helpful, especially in the current global context. They enable online research, contribute to tree conservation, and facilitate communication with people at a distance. Therefore, in my opinion, computers do bring significant benefits to society.
1341	1345	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I concur with those who advocate for technological advancements. I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on individuals as they can be employed for learning, communication, and entertainment. My primary rationale for believing that computers have a positive impact on people is their educational value. Some individuals erroneously assume that computers serve no purpose. However, they can be utilized for numerous tasks, such as conducting research! For instance, if you are a student who needs to undertake a project, computers facilitate the collection of research more efficiently than books. Another reason why computers are educational is their utility for reading. You can purchase virtual books that can be accessed directly on your computer. This not only promotes education but also contributes to environmental conservation by reducing paper consumption. Occasionally, when you are simply curious about a particular subject, your computer will be readily available for your use. Computers also have a positive impact on people in terms of communication. No one desires a distant relationship with their family, but with a computer, you can communicate with family and friends worldwide! This effect is beneficial as it enables everyone to stay connected. Many individuals lead busy lives and lack the time to write letters or make phone calls. Therefore, they can simply send an email or instant message to the person they need to communicate with. Some experts express concerns that people spend excessive time on computers and less time engaging in physical activity, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. However, these experts fail to recognize that computers can be used to interact with loved ones. A computer offers numerous family-oriented activities. You can watch movies as a family or play multiplayer games together on the computer. Engaging in activities on the computer as a family has a positive impact as it is safer than participating in certain entertaining activities that may expose you and your family to various risks. There are multiple reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can be used for learning, communication, and entertainment. These are merely my primary reasons, and there are many more. Hence, I support technological advancements and firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people.
1342	1346	1	1	Dear local newspaper, in my perspective, computers are beneficial to society and individuals as they enable communication with people in distant locations, facilitate connections with family and friends, and provide opportunities to meet individuals from other countries and forge friendships. Additionally, computers are advantageous as they enhance hand-eye coordination and enable online shopping. Firstly, I contend that individuals proficient in computer usage can communicate with family members residing in other countries or meet new people who may eventually become friends. You can even engage in conversations with your family via computers, thereby avoiding costly international phone calls. Secondly, computers are helpful as they improve hand-eye coordination. This is particularly beneficial for children tasked with completing significant projects, as it enables them to meet deadlines. From your perspective, you can appreciate the advantages of this skill, as once the project is completed, you can engage in outdoor activities with your friends and family. Hand-eye coordination also contributes to the development of mental acuity. Thirdly, using computers is advantageous as it facilitates online shopping. Computers enable you to purchase a wide range of items, including clothing, shoes, cars, houses, and more. In conclusion, I believe that individuals should consider utilizing computers more frequently for shopping, socializing, and enhancing physical coordination. Do you concur with my viewpoint?
1343	1347	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, in contemporary society, people rely heavily on computers, which consistently offer positive contributions. Computers assist us in accessing information, communicating with individuals globally, and purchasing goods from the comfort of our homes. In this technological era, the possibilities are limitless. I have a cousin in @LOCATION1, and I communicate with him via webcam. Many individuals use computers to connect with relatives in other locations, and it is common for soldiers to maintain contact with their loved ones back home. Doctors assert that such communication enhances a soldier's will to survive. As everyone attends school, projects are an inevitable part of the educational process. When students are tasked with projects, they often require comprehensive information, and the computer serves as an invaluable resource for conducting research. The internet hosts an extensive array of websites that provide access to a vast amount of knowledge, from the origins of humanity to contemporary topics. If you are a sports enthusiast, there are numerous websites that offer free access to sports-related content. Additionally, if you enjoy a particular song, you can visit platforms such as @CAPS7, @ORGANIZATION2, or LimeWire to download it to your @NUM1 or @CAPS8. I hope that this information has enhanced your understanding of the computer's capabilities and prompted you to reconsider any preconceived notions. Although there are malicious individuals and harmful websites, this does not diminish the overall value of computers.
1344	1348	1	1	Who would have anticipated that computers could have such a profound impact on individuals? People around the world engage in learning activities on computers daily. Undoubtedly, the computer has revolutionized the way we acquire knowledge and access new information. Moreover, the computer offers a plethora of entertaining options. You can choose from a vast selection of music videos and tracks. There are also numerous methods of communication available, similar to the functionality of a cell phone. However, computers provide additional avenues for interacting with friends and family. Social media platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, and @CAPS2 offer convenient ways to stay connected. These @NUM1 websites are just a few examples of the many platforms available for communication. While I acknowledge the enjoyment derived from using computers, it is essential to recognize the importance of taking breaks. Prolonged computer use can be detrimental to one's health, and it is crucial to engage in physical activity and spend time in nature. You should consider taking a walk or riding your bike to maintain a balanced lifestyle. It is important to understand that while computers are valuable tools for learning, they should not replace real-world experiences. In conclusion, computers offer significant benefits for learning, but it is equally important to prioritize physical well-being and outdoor activities.
1345	1349	1	1	To the Newspaper, it is evident that computers play an indispensable role in society. They serve as valuable learning tools, facilitate communication, and impart skills that are essential for lifelong success. Students, like myself, frequently utilize computers for various purposes, and teachers actively encourage their use. All academic projects necessitate research, and computers provide unparalleled access to information. For example, during a recent social studies project, I conducted research on the amendments to the constitution. I visited @ORGANIZATION1's website and discovered a wealth of information on the @NUM1, which was crucial for my project on the constitutionality of capital punishment. Through this database, I learned that capital punishment is not only legal but also supported by the international council of human rights. Without the internet, which provides instant access to the latest and most relevant information, I would have faced significant challenges in obtaining this crucial fact. Conducting the same research using traditional methods would have been time-consuming and costly, taking over two hours to find the same information that I was able to access in just five minutes using a computer. The internet hosts millions of websites and offers a vast collection of photos on a wide range of topics, making it a more efficient research tool than any other method. In addition to research, schools utilize computers for typing papers, which enhances readability for teachers and provides useful features such as spell check. Furthermore, the internet enables access to a variety of communication platforms, such as email, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. These platforms are commonly used to facilitate communication with friends and family, making it easier and faster than ever before. Last @DATE1, my friend was on a business trip for @NUM3 weeks, and I missed him dearly. Thanks to @CAPS4's mom, I was able to have a telephone call with him, which provided much-needed comfort during his absence. Computers enable individuals to interact with others simultaneously, regardless of geographical distance. This communication element is of utmost importance, as it prepares us for the future. Many jobs require proficiency in computer usage, and mastering these skills in advance offers numerous advantages. If we are already familiar with computers, we will not have to worry about learning these skills later in life. In the near future, computers will be increasingly used in high school and college for research and paper writing, making these tasks more efficient and accessible. The benefits of computer usage are undeniable. As demonstrated, computers and the internet offer numerous advantages to society. Schools can utilize them for various projects and learning activities, individuals can communicate with others virtually when face-to-face interaction is not possible, and they can contribute to the advancement of the future. In conclusion, the use of computers should be encouraged.
1346	1350	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, In the current era of widespread computer usage, it is facile to assume that computers are beneficial and exert a positive influence on their users. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that computers bring about more detrimental effects than advantageous ones to those who utilize them. I hold this view for @NUM1 reasons. Firstly, they detract from the time spent interacting with real - life individuals, lead to a decrease in physical exercise, and are highly distracting, thus wasting time. One reason why I opine that computers do not have a positive impact on people is that the time dedicated to using the computer could be more fruitfully employed by engaging in activities with family and friends. Presently, people are leveraging social networking platforms such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 to communicate with distant acquaintances. They can spend hours conversing with individuals they will never encounter in person, completely disregarding those who care about and love them. Moreover, online communication can be perilous as the person one is messaging may not be who they claim to be. Overall, venturing out and genuinely spending time with real people creates memories that will be cherished throughout one's life. This sentiment can never be replicated through the internet. Another reason why I believe computers have a negative effect on their users is that consistent computer use has resulted in a dearth of exercise for numerous individuals. Those who spend many hours on computers remain sedentary and lack physical activity. The only movement while using a computer is the minuscule flick of a finger to click the mouse button. Evidently, this is insufficient exercise to maintain a healthy and content lifestyle. Studies have indicated that since the advent of computers, especially young people have been getting less and less physical activity. I am certain that this situation will worsen if people continue to spend the majority of their time on computers. A third reason why I think computers are having a negative impact on people is that they are distracting and waste time. For instance, once when I was conducting online research for a school project, I came across an advertisement for an intriguing - looking website. Upon clicking on it, I was redirected to a site filled with amusing stories and pictures. I spent the subsequent half - hour perusing entries on that website and completely forgot about my project. When I realized my oversight, I rushed to complete my research and ended up receiving a poorer grade than I would have if I had not been distracted by other online distractions. This is why I believe computers do not have a favorable effect on their users. They detract from time spent with family and friends, result in less exercise, and waste time while serving as distractions.
1347	1351	1	1	Dear local @CAPS1, For years, @CAPS2 individuals have been utilizing computers. However, the question arises as to whether it is beneficial for their health. We often fail to consider the power that teenagers wield with the internet. If one requires information, there are numerous excellent books available. When communication is needed, phones can be used. We ought to venture outdoors and engage in physical exercise. Could the computer be another contributing factor to America's rising obesity rate? Firstly, teenagers can engage in harmful actions on the internet, either towards themselves or others. Platforms like Facebook and MySpace have been developed. Nearly every teenager in America has a Facebook account. Did you know that cyberbullying has become prevalent? People have humiliated others on the internet. How can we be certain that the person we are conversing with is who they claim to be? Teenagers disclose excessive personal information, and some have gone missing as a consequence. The internet is a potent weapon, but can teenagers handle such power? Secondly, although the computer is a convenient device, it is a fact that books still exist. We cannot blindly believe everything stated on the computer. All the necessary information and more can be obtained from books. People in the Middle Ages lived without computers but with the aid of books. Why can't we? Have we become too indolent to pick up a book? Finally, if communication is what we seek, why not opt for a simple text message or phone call? We go through the hassle of turning on the computer and opening web pages just to chat online. We have become lazy due to the devices that provide everything we need at home. While it is undoubtedly a positive aspect, we must not overlook its negative implications. It appears that the computer is yet another reason for America's increasing obesity. We need to get up, take walks, socialize with friends, and participate in sports. But how can we do so when we are addicted to computers? It is like a powerful drug. In conclusion, I believe that computers are not beneficial to us. Teenagers have access to the power of Facebook, there is false and dangerous information when books are available, and our health is at stake. At this juncture, I pose the question: Is the computer truly worth everything we think it is? No, it is not.
1348	1352	1	1	Dear Newspaper, Over the years, the streets have witnessed a decline in the number of people engaging in interaction, exercise, and the enjoyment of nature. Is this a positive or negative development? Technology has advanced to such an extent that staying at home and using the computer may seem more appealing than taking a stroll in the park. Computers indeed have a positive impact on people as they feature advertisements that promote exercise, encourage travel, and enable people to interact from any corner of the world. Firstly, computers are replete with excellent advertisements. Some advertisements advocate joining a gym and engaging in physical activity. Studies reveal that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of children without access to computers do not get sufficient exercise, whereas only @PERCENT1 of those with computers face the same issue. These statistics indicate that computers are more beneficial for people's health than commonly perceived. Secondly, computers are rife with advertisements that inspire people to travel the world. By doing so, people's knowledge will expand as they learn new facts about unfamiliar places. Additionally, people will experience greater happiness as they relish the act of traveling. Moreover, individuals whose jobs rely on the advertisements they post on the internet will reap the benefits. Finally, the contemporary technology employed in computers enables people to communicate with friends from almost anywhere globally. Social networking sites such as Facebook allow people to view pictures of their friends' travel destinations. Webcams facilitate face - to - face conversations, enabling people to discuss the new gym they have joined. <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of individuals claim that they have a more fulfilling social life online than in the real world when their friends may not be available to talk. In conclusion, computers have a positive influence on people as they contain advertisements that encourage exercise and travel, and they enable people to communicate from anywhere in the world. Technology is designed to make the world a happier, healthier, and more sociable place. This is why computers have a highly positive impact on people worldwide.
1349	1353	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, With our main forest regenerating, services being provided within mere seconds, and the ability to find answers to virtually any question, one may wonder what causes this phenomenon. The answer lies in computers. These electronic marvels assist us and our planet in numerous ways, as they are environmentally friendly, efficient, and brimming with information. You may be questioning how computers are environmentally friendly. Well, to begin with, they help curtail the waste of paper. Did you know that @LOCATION1 cuts down approximately @NUM1 million trees annually for books? Computers help prevent this in several ways. For example, instead of sending a short letter to the police chief to inquire about the new driving law, one could send an email and conserve paper. Similarly, if one wishes the newspaper staff to interview the survivors of a power - plant explosion, an email with instructions to the survivors' residence can be sent instead of distributing maps individually. Thus, it becomes evident how environmentally friendly computers are. My next point pertains to efficiency. My Dell laptop at home takes approximately @NUM1 minute to boot up, @NUM3 seconds to connect to the internet, and @NUM4 seconds to navigate to another webpage. Suppose I want to know how many legs a centipede has (and my parents are also unaware). Without a computer, it would take @NUM5 minutes to reach the library, @NUM6 minutes to find a parking spot, and @NUM4 minutes to locate a book about centipedes. In total, that amounts to at least @NUM8 minutes, whereas my computer would only take about @NUM1 minute and @NUM10 seconds. Additionally, if one wants to ask a friend what they are doing on @DATE1, it would only take a few seconds to send an email, and the friend would likely respond promptly as they are probably using the computer. My third reason is that computers are replete with information. In a @CAPS3 library, one might find @NUM4 books on a particular subject, but on a computer, one can discover thousands. Once, when I was working on a report about monarch butterflies, I found @NUM12 books about them in the @CAPS3 library, whereas on the internet, I found @NUM13 websites dedicated to them. Moreover, books offer general information, such as the @CAPS5 life cycle, while the internet provides specific details about the @CAPS5 role in the environment. As is now clear, computers benefit not only humans but also the environment because they are environmentally friendly, efficient, and rich in information.
1350	1354	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on society. I hold this view because computers aid us in learning about distant locations, facilitate communication with friends and family across the globe, and offer entertainment. Computers have a positive impact on society as they allow us to learn about far - off places, their historical backgrounds, and geographical landscapes. By acquiring such knowledge, one can engage in various activities, such as planning a vacation, utilizing the information for a school report, and gaining insights into one's heritage and culture. Additionally, computers are advantageous to society as they enhance communication with friends and family worldwide. One can communicate with anyone they know. In contemporary times, the computer has become the primary means of communication for most people. A study has shown that @PERCENT1 of the world's population uses a computer as a communication tool. Lastly, computers are beneficial to society as they provide entertainment. On a computer, one can partake in a plethora of activities to avoid boredom. One can play games, browse the web, or watch videos on platforms like YouTube. Therefore, a computer ensures that one never experiences boredom. In conclusion, computers are beneficial and have a positive influence on society. They enable us to learn about distant places, facilitate communication with friends and family globally, and offer entertainment. This is why computers are advantageous to society.
1351	1355	1	1	I contend that computers do not confer as much benefit upon society as is commonly believed. When individuals allocate the majority of their time to computers, they are deprived of the opportunity to spend quality time with their families. Moreover, excessive computer use leads to insufficient physical exercise, which in turn contributes to obesity. Additionally, there is a risk of encountering malicious individuals through social media platforms such as Facebook or MySpace.  The primary reason computers fail to benefit society is the lack of time available for family interaction. When one is constantly engrossed in computer activities, there is virtually no time left to engage with family and friends. I firmly believe that families should share meals together and spend at least an hour in each other's company. Engaging in activities such as playing games, going for a walk, or taking a bike ride are excellent ways to strengthen family bonds.  Did you know that computers have a moderate impact on the prevalence of obesity? If one spends the majority of the day at school and then dedicates several hours to computer use after school, there is little time for physical activity. Consequently, the body is unable to burn off the excess calories consumed, leading to weight gain.  When using a computer, individuals often frequent social media platforms. These platforms provide an opportunity to interact with strangers, which can be dangerous. Meeting someone in person whom you have only met online can expose you to potential harm, such as being kidnapped, assaulted, or even killed. Therefore, email remains the safest method of online communication.  In conclusion, computers do not offer significant benefits to society. They detract from family time, contribute to obesity, and pose a risk of personal harm. How would you feel if you were unable to spend time with your family, suffered from obesity, and were at risk of being kidnapped due to your online interactions?
1352	1356	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, computers are indeed a remarkable and sophisticated device that offers entertainment, pleasure, and knowledge to many. However, I disagree with the notion that computers are an unequivocal asset to society. While computers are undoubtedly useful, there are several reasons for my reservations.  Typing is not only faster but also neater than handwriting, and the internet provides a vast array of websites for advertising, purchasing essential items, and communicating with people worldwide. Despite these advantages, there is a fundamental drawback to computer use.  Some individuals have become so reliant on computers that they struggle to perform basic tasks without them, such as writing a handwritten report or visiting a store. In my view, the world would be a better place if computers did not exist.  There are numerous reasons why computers can be detrimental. They store sensitive information that is vulnerable to hacking, and cyberbullying has become a prevalent issue. Additionally, online games can be addictive, leading to a sedentary lifestyle and obesity.  In conclusion, while computers have their merits, their negative impacts cannot be overlooked. I hope you will consider my perspective and recognize the importance of finding a balance between technology and real-life interactions.
1353	1357	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 editor, I recently saw on channel @NUM1 news that you are seeking insights into the impact of computers on people. Historically, computers have become ubiquitous, serving as a valuable source of knowledge. A significant @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 surveyed at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 concur that computers are beneficial to us. In my opinion, computers have a profoundly positive influence on individuals.  Firstly, computers play a crucial role in developing hand - eye coordination. This coordination is essential for survival, and without it, people would face significant challenges. The computer prompts users to engage specific muscles, enabling them to lead fulfilling lives. A @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 surveyed at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 believe that computers are the primary facilitator of hand - eye coordination. Dr. @DR1, an expert in human - related studies, stated, ""Individuals without access to computers are at a disadvantage, lacking the rapid reaction times of their counterparts."" In summary, computers are instrumental in enhancing hand - eye coordination.  Secondly, computers provide a gateway to learning about distant places. Without the ability to research and explore these locations, one's knowledge remains limited. Computers empower users to access information about various destinations, which can be useful for planning vacations or conducting research. @PERCENT2 of the adults surveyed at the public library affirmed that computers are a rich source of information, surpassing the capabilities of books. Thus, computers enable individuals to expand their knowledge of far - flung places.  Thirdly, computers facilitate online communication, thereby expanding social circles. Through digital platforms, people can maintain friendships beyond the confines of school and connect with new individuals from diverse backgrounds. For instance, one can communicate with people in @LOCATION1 who would otherwise be inaccessible. A @PERCENT1 of parents polled in @ORGANIZATION1 expressed their desire for their children to learn about different cultures, and computers are indispensable for this purpose. In essence, computers open up a world of social interaction.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by enhancing hand - eye coordination, enabling learning about distant places, and facilitating online communication. I earnestly encourage you to carefully consider these perspectives as you make your assessment."
1354	1358	1	1	@CITY1 @CAPS1, computers are highly beneficial devices. Life would be significantly more arduous without them. Not only are they useful, but they are also enjoyable and user - friendly. I firmly believe that computers have a profound impact on people as they enable us to stay connected with family and friends, access school resources, and utilize search engines.  Family and friends are of utmost importance in our lives, and computers offer effective means of maintaining these relationships. The @NUM1 applications I frequently use are @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. @ORGANIZATION1 is a free online application that allows users to download it to their computers, add friends, and engage in video chats. Through this platform, I stay in touch with my @CAPS4, a friend who relocated, and even someone from @LOCATION2. @CAPS2, an instant messaging service, enables real - time communication with friends, similar to text messaging but via computers. @CAPS3 is a website that allows users to connect with friends globally. I have connected with numerous family members I rarely see, a friend who moved to @LOCATION3, and others who have relocated. These platforms are excellent for staying in touch.  When one is absent from school due to illness and needs to catch up on coursework, the school's webpage is an invaluable resource. Teachers should maintain individual websites where they post homework, quiz and test schedules, useful links, projects, and their email addresses. This is extremely helpful as students can email their teachers if they encounter difficulties with their homework. School websites also feature lunch menus, upcoming events, school contact information, and more. Without these websites, school life would be considerably more challenging.  Search engines are another indispensable aspect of computers. When faced with a question that no one can answer, websites like www.Google.com can provide solutions. Google offers access to web pages, videos, pictures, translators, and more. It is not the only search engine; there are others such as @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION4, @CAPS7, @LOCATION1, etc. These search engines are useful for finding pictures for school projects, web pages for research, translators for language homework, and videos to share with friends. Life would be much more difficult without search engines.  In conclusion, computers are incredibly helpful, easy to use, and bring great convenience to our lives. I hope you share my view on the positive impact of computers.
1355	1359	1	1	Dear Newspaper, computers have a profound impact on society. It is almost unimaginable to envision a world without them. They are invaluable for communication, learning, and shopping.  Computers have revolutionized communication. Without them, staying in touch with colleagues, family, and friends would be extremely challenging. Social networking sites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 - In have become an integral part of daily life. These platforms allow us to access information from others and plan social activities. In today's digital age, the internet is the primary means of communication for children, enabling them to interact with their peers and develop social skills. Moreover, the internet provides an opportunity to connect with people from different cultures around the world, enriching our understanding of diverse perspectives.  The internet is also a vast repository of knowledge. It may seem astonishing, but we can learn an enormous amount of information from it. Video - chatting platforms like @CAPS5 or @ORGANIZATION2 allow us to have face - to - face conversations with people, which is a more effective way to learn about them compared to phone calls. In addition, search engines such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS6, or @ORGANIZATION3 are essential for school research. A recent survey revealed that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers use these search engines at least once a day, and @CAPS7 out of those @NUM1 use them for schoolwork. Clearly, computers are indispensable for educational purposes.  The impact of computers on shopping is also significant. In @DATE2, @PERCENT1 of shopping was conducted online. The internet has become the first stop for entrepreneurs looking to start a business, and many people are making substantial profits with the help of computers. Online shopping offers convenience, eliminating the need to visit crowded malls and stand in long lines. For example, during @CAPS8 @DATE1, online shopping provides access to numerous websites offering great deals.  In conclusion, computers have had a far - reaching and positive impact on our lives. They have enhanced communication, facilitated learning, and transformed the way we shop. While some may have concerns about computer use, the benefits clearly outweigh the drawbacks.
1356	1360	1	1	I advocate for the advancement in technology, particularly in the realm of computers. Utilizing a computer can cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow one with the capacity to explore distant places and individuals, and afford the opportunity to engage in online conversations with others. Hand - eye coordination is an extremely crucial skill to possess as it accelerates reflexes in daily life. This skill is especially indispensable for sports such as baseball, football, or basketball. Without computers, numerous individuals would lack hand - eye coordination. Suppose you are driving on the highway, and suddenly a car veers onto the wrong side of the road and heads towards you; you must react promptly. Without hand - eye coordination, you could face death. Employing computers might potentially save your life one day. If someone intends to visit a foreign country but has no knowledge of it, they can conduct research on the internet. The internet is an integral part of having computers. Without it, people would likely struggle to effortlessly research a country or learn about other people. Some individuals believe that excessive computer use restricts people from exercising, which holds true in certain instances. However, the computer is highly useful if you wish to acquire knowledge about something, like who won an election or a sports championship. Computers are nearly a necessity in every household. They offer people the chance to chat online with others, some of whom they know in real life and others they meet online. It broadens people's interactive lives, facilitating the making of new friends. Although having access to this is excellent, it remains vital to socialize with people in person rather than solely online. Some individuals find it difficult to converse with others in person and feel more at ease chatting via computer. Perhaps such a person could make a friend and eventually meet them in real life. This can be perilous for younger people, so caution is necessary. I support the progress in computer technology because it enhances people's reflexes, provides the opportunity to research distant places, and grants access to the internet for online communication with others. These are three significant advantages that using computers offer people.
1357	1361	1	1	"In contemporary society, it is uncommon to encounter someone who lacks basic computer - operating skills. According to the statistics project known on YouTube as ""Shift Happens,"" a substantial proportion, in fact @PERCENT1, of children in @LOCATION1 have used a computer by the age of four. While it can be debated whether computers have negative impacts, I firmly oppose this view. Computers are among the most remarkable technological advancements made by the human race. They have contributed to education, simplified the process of reconnecting with others, and are even, at times, environmentally friendly. I am curious as to why some people disagree, and I hope that after reading this, you will share my curiosity. At my school, there are three computer labs, each equipped with approximately twenty - five computers, a library with twenty computers, and each teacher has two computers in their classroom. When I consider these numbers and combine them with my knowledge of computers in other @CAPS1 schools, it becomes evident to me that computers have had a positive influence on the education system. Many teachers can assign research projects to students with a simple click of a button. There are websites where absent students can obtain their next - day assignments. Moreover, teachers can store their grade books on their hard drives, which conserves paper and ensures the accuracy of final grades. As a student, I believe that computers have significantly improved schools in various ways, particularly those mentioned above. At some point in our lives, as we grow older, we often desire to reconnect with our old friends. Thanks to computers, this process has become much more straightforward. There are social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and @CAPS2, which are invaluable for locating friends from @DATE1 camp. For example, if you have reconnected with someone and have just received a promotion, and you want to share the news but don't have their phone number, yet you know their email address, you can send an instant email (and while you're at it, ask for their phone number). It's always a pleasure to communicate with old friends, and computers have made this easier in @LOCATION1. My friend recently purchased a Sony laptop. She not only appreciated its features but also the fact that it was an Energy Star - certified, eco - friendly device. Nowadays, computers are being designed with environmental considerations in mind. Online encyclopedias, newspapers, and journals save paper. Additionally, computers are consuming less and less electricity. You save money and contribute to environmental protection! Today's society is assisting Mother Nature not only through our actions but also through the use of computers. In my opinion, computers are beneficial to @LOCATION1, not detrimental. They have supported education, social reconnection, and environmental conservation. We should view the advancement and miraculous invention of the computer favorably."
1358	1362	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, do you not concur that computer usage should be restricted or, at times, minimized? Recently, it has come to my attention that computers can have a detrimental impact on society. Without a doubt, I firmly hold the view that computers should be regarded as a hobby rather than an addiction. People allocate excessive time to using computers, thereby reducing the time they spend on physical exercise and interacting with family and friends. A significant percentage, @PERCENT2, of teenagers are involved in cyber - bullying, which occurs primarily on computers. People often sacrifice exercise time for more computer usage. I recall when my step - mom, @PERSON1, wore a size six waist. She used to exercise for two hours every day after work. However, this changed when my dad bought her a lime - green @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 laptop for her birthday. She quickly became addicted to @CAPS3 (a computer game) and began to curtail her exercise routines. Six months later, during a doctor's appointment, she discovered that she had gained over ten pounds. She now wears a size fourteen waist. Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of people gain weight because they reduce their exercise to make more time for computer use. Most people spend an inordinate amount of time on computers and less time interacting with their family and friends. This reminds me of my step - dad, @PERSON4. When he returns home from work, he typically heads straight to the computer instead of engaging in conversation with the family. He becomes irritated when @PERSON2 (@NUM1 years old) interrupts him because he wants to play. @PERSON4 is usually online from three o'clock until ten o'clock, playing chess with strangers from around the world. What he fails to realize is that while he is forging relationships with strangers, he is weakening the bond with his loved ones. @PERCENT2 of teenagers are involved in cyber - bullying. This brings to mind my cousin, @PERSON3. Last @DATE1, when @PERSON3 joined @CAPS4 @CAPS2, trouble soon found her. In other words, girls aged thirteen to twenty started sending her threatening messages. One day, while walking down the street, a group of girls attacked her. Fortunately, she survived the brutal assault and deleted her @CAPS4 account. In conclusion, I firmly believe that people should not spend excessive time on computers. My three main arguments are cyber - bullying, reduced exercise, and diminished interaction with family and friends. I earnestly hope that you will take my suggestion seriously and advocate for appropriate computer use limitations.
1359	1363	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, it has come to my attention that there is a debate regarding whether computers are beneficial to society. In my opinion, they most certainly are. Firstly, computers offer a means of entertainment. Secondly, they are a rich source of information. Lastly, they alleviate the stress of daily life. In the following paragraphs, I will elaborate on my reasoning. To begin with, computers provide entertainment. I understand the argument that people should spend more time outdoors and exercise, but what should one do on a rainy day? The answer is simple: turn to the computer! Moreover, computers bring joy to children, preventing them from feeling bored. Another advantage of computers is that they can motivate children. For instance, if your child is eager to play a new game on their favorite website but has unfinished homework, you can tell them that they can play on the computer after completing their assignments. You can also set a time limit for their computer use. For teenagers and adults, computers are an important social medium. They use platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace to communicate. For many, computers are their primary or secondary means of interaction. Unfortunately, some individuals abuse these privileges, leading to problems. However, the good news is that you can customize your profile to avoid such issues. In any case, computers enhance social skills in children. Secondly, computers are highly informational. With just a touch of the keypad and a click of the mouse, you can access a vast amount of knowledge. You can search for information about people or things across the globe. If you want to know about a particular event or how to prepare for it, simply conduct an online search and follow the instructions. Additionally, if you learn something new, you can share it with others, thereby spreading knowledge. Thirdly, computers reduce stress. Which would you prefer: typing or writing @NUM3 pages by hand? I would choose typing! Computers help organize information, making it easier to find what you need. They also simplify the process of locating files; you can simply navigate to ""@CAPS2 documents"" to find what you're looking for. As you can see, computers are an essential part of our lives. Can you envision a world without computers? I certainly cannot! In summary, I have stated that computers are entertaining, informative, and stress - relieving. I hope you will give due consideration to my perspective."
1360	1364	1	1	I concur with those who assert that computers benefit society. Computers can serve as a learning tool, facilitate communication with distant friends and family, and offer a way to pass the time. Firstly, I am aware that some people believe others waste time on computers. However, the majority of computer users employ them as a means to learn and complete work. There are numerous educational websites where people can explore any subject of interest. If you wish to learn about different cultures, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there are websites that can provide comprehensive information. Computers also assist in work completion. There are multiple software programs designed to simplify the process of writing papers or presenting information. By using these programs, people can advance in their work and present facts more effectively. Moreover, it is highly unlikely to lose any work as it is all stored in the computer. Secondly, computers are an excellent way to spend leisure time. Many websites are specifically designed for this purpose. Some allow users to play games, while others offer the opportunity to watch videos created by others. Although some people may spend excessive time on these activities, many understand the importance of moderation and distribute their time across various websites. There are also videos that address important issues; for example, the president has utilized @CAPS4 videos to reach a wider audience as more people are using computers than watching television. Finally, computers are a remarkable means of communicating with distant friends and family. There are numerous methods, such as email and various social networking websites. As my family are immigrants from another country, we consider computers a valuable tool for staying in touch with our relatives. I am certain that many others also use computers in this way. People can make and maintain friendships through @CAPS4. I use @CAPS3 - mail to keep in touch with friends I haven't seen in years, and my parents have reconnected with long - lost friends through Facebook. Computers also enable people to share important ideas more rapidly than through traditional letters. Many scientists use @CAPS4 to publish their research findings and experimental results. In conclusion, I agree with those who claim that computers benefit society. They aid in learning and work, provide entertainment, and facilitate communication with distant family and friends.
1361	1365	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I opine that when children or even adults acquire computers, they are unlikely to utilize them for noble purposes. Once individuals obtain computers, they tend to spend more time indoors, engrossed in these devices. They ought to venture outdoors and engage in physical activity. Even simple actions, such as choosing to jog to a friend's house instead of cycling, can make a difference. When people devote more time to their computers than to interacting with friends, they will experience a decline in social skills and, over time, may struggle to communicate effectively with others. All they need to do is set a time limit for computer use and reserve it primarily for work. Computers can also serve beneficial functions. For instance, if one has a school project and needs to type it on the computer or search for images on the internet, the computer becomes a valuable resource. If one's job involves working with or repairing computers, then spending a significant amount of time on it is justifiable. It also enables interaction with individuals across the globe. One can also learn about fascinating facts or places. However, computers can be misused. People may use them solely to play the latest trendy video game, which can lead to obesity. They can also be employed for malicious purposes such as sexual harassment or stalking. Additionally, people may use computers for illegal activities like drug trafficking or purchasing prohibited items. As evident, computers pose numerous safety risks. I hope you will carefully consider these crucial points and take them into account. Thank you and have a pleasant day.
1362	1366	1	1	Dear Local newspaper, I believe that computers exert a detrimental influence on individuals as they lead to a lack of time for exercise, reduced interaction with friends and family, and can have a negative impact on younger children. The following are the detailed reasons. The primary reason for the adverse effects of computers is that the time spent on them could be better utilized for exercise to maintain good health. For example, my mother runs @NUM1 miles daily and still finds time to use the computer. Excessive computer use is harmful, but moderate usage is somewhat more acceptable. My mother allows me to use the computer but firmly insists that I go outside and engage in physical activity. There is much discussion about obesity, and computers are contributing to this issue among both children and adults. Instead of being active outdoors, they simply sit in front of the computer. The second significant aspect is that children and adults will have limited time to spend with their families and create shared memories. My mother often reminds me that the most precious part of childhood is making memories with loved ones. My friends and I enjoy going to playgrounds and having fun outdoors, which not only makes us laugh but also promotes happiness and well - being. The final crucial reason is that computers can impart incorrect ideas to younger children. I have @NUM1 younger sisters who are fond of using the computer, but some websites are inappropriate for them. For example, @CAPS2 is a website where malicious individuals post videos that can mislead young children. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers have a negative impact on people due to reduced time for health - related activities, less interaction with friends and family, and the potential to give children wrong ideas. I hope my message about the drawbacks of computers is clear.
1363	1367	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I wish to inform the public that the use of computers is not as detrimental as it may seem. Firstly, one of the advantages of computers is the opportunity to connect with people through platforms such as @CAPS2, Yahoo, @ORGANIZATION1, or Gmail. For example, we can interact with someone from @LOCATION1 and gain insights into their culture and beliefs. Secondly, computers are beneficial for accessing information. In a situation where an individual does not have access to @CAPS3 or a newspaper, they can obtain the latest news from websites like nbc.com or fox.com, thereby staying informed about global events.
1364	1368	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 percentage of the global population do you think owns a computer and perceives it to have a positive impact? Approximately @PERCENT1 of the world's population believes that computers are an excellent means of communication with friends, family, and people from different parts of the world. They also note that computers enhance hand - eye coordination among adults and students. Moreover, computers serve as a remarkable educational resource in schools, workplaces, and other settings. Firstly, computers offer a great way to communicate due to the built - in programs that use unique digital codes to establish connections with friends, family, and individuals worldwide. Platforms like Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace are all effective communication tools that promote social interaction, which is essential for a healthy lifestyle. More than half of the world's population uses these communication channels because they are convenient and allow for more in - depth sharing of thoughts. Additionally, these connections are popular because they enable people living in different parts of the world to see each other. For instance, I currently reside in @LOCATION1, and I can keep in touch with my loved ones in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3, etc., through MySpace and Facebook. Another benefit is the improvement of hand - eye coordination for adults and students.
1365	1369	1	1	When utilizing a computer, one has the capability to accomplish virtually anything. The internet, with millions of users, significantly simplifies life. It provides access to communicate with individuals located across the globe! One can explore any topic and gain in - depth knowledge about it. The internet even inspires people to venture outdoors and experience things firsthand. In the @DATE1, it is as effortless to contact someone in @LOCATION1 as it is to reach someone in the neighboring area. As long as one has an internet connection, they can stay in touch with friends who have traveled for business or anyone else. Some @MONTH1 suggest using a phone, but the internet offers video chat, allowing one to see someone thousands of miles away as if they were present. Nowadays, it is more challenging to lose touch than to maintain contact. @NUM1 or @NUM2 years ago, all necessary information had to be sourced from books. One would have to visit the library, search for the appropriate book, and read it. If fortunate, they might find a small amount of the desired information. Currently, one simply types a query into a search browser and instantly obtains thousands of relevant websites. The internet enables learning about any subject of interest. Some experts claim that people spend excessive time on computers. However, seeing captivating places and beautiful images on the internet encourages many to go outside and explore. In a recent poll, @PERCENT1 of people went on a hike after watching a YouTube video about the joys of outdoor activities. The internet has a profound impact on our lives. It can also bring families closer. For example, during dinner, one can find countless great recipes on the internet. The internet is an astonishing invention. Some would argue that it is the greatest innovation of all time. Although it can be dangerous, with proper education, the internet is a valuable source of information and a rewarding pastime if used responsibly. The ability to see and communicate with distant others, which was once seemingly impossible, is now a reality. Accessing information has never been easier. We are fortunate to live in an era where the internet is readily available at our fingertips.
1366	1370	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 Post, I am cognizant that individuals are expending an excessive amount of time on computers rather than being outdoors. People are becoming addicted to computers. They spend an inordinate amount of time on computers because they are addicted to them, overweight, and not engaging in any physical activity. I am informing you that we need to address this matter. People have developed an addiction to computers. @PERSON1 indicates that in @DATE1, there were @NUM1 individuals using computers, and by @DATE2, there are nearly @NUM2 million people using computers, which represents a substantial increase over the past couple of years. People are becoming more addicted due to platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and numerous other computer sites. Yale reports that in @DATE3, the number of people on Facebook was only @NUM3 thousand, whereas in @DATE4, there are over @NUM4 million people using Facebook. I don't know about you, but that seems like an addiction to computers to me. People are becoming extremely overweight. One contributing factor to this is their addiction to computers; they simply sit in front of their computers and consume food incessantly until they become overweight and unhealthy. Dr. @PERSON2 states that in the last @NUM5 years, the average weight of a person has increased by @NUM3 pounds as a result of sitting in front of their computers and eating. Doctors claim that they can do nothing about people's weight unless they turn off all their computers, which they believe is unfeasible. People are becoming overly fat from sitting idle all day. Exercise is a crucial aspect of maintaining good health. By sitting in front of a computer while eating, one fails to engage in the necessary exercise, causing people to gain weight. Dr. @PERSON3 asserts that people need to be aware of this problem. Dr. @PERSON3 also mentions that in the last @NUM7 years, the amount of exercise people are getting has decreased by @PERCENT1, which is why people are getting fat. He further attributes it to sitting in front of the computer and eating. People are not getting any exercise due to their computer usage. I am telling you that this is a significant problem that we need to address. People are becoming addicted to computers, they are getting overweight, and they are not getting any exercise. Please, @CAPS1 Post, listen; it is a problem, but the decision is yours.
1367	1371	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I opine that the adverse effects of computers on individuals are far greater than the positive ones. Computers have led to a significant prevalence of obesity in the @LOCATION1, and this number is escalating daily. Moreover, computers can be highly time - consuming, and people may spend hours or even days on a computer without undertaking any other activities. Lastly, computers can pose a serious threat to many children and may even result in death. I firmly believe that computers are excessively harmful to society and should be restricted. Obesity is one of the most prominent problems in the @LOCATION1 and is worsening day by day. Over @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 population is obese, and computers have been a major contributing factor. Imagine yourself in the mindset of a computer addict. It's dinner time, and you're hungry, yet you don't want to lose too much time away from your computer. You rush to the nearest fast - food joint and purchase a cheeseburger, fries, and a soda. Then you return home and consume the food while using your computer. Not only is fast - food detrimental to your health, but you also deny your body the opportunity to burn off the calories and carbohydrates you've just ingested through exercise. Computer addicts engage in this behavior almost daily, and before they realize it, they gain @NUM1 pounds! Additionally, people can improve their hand - eye coordination through various means other than just using computers. Computers contribute significantly to the obese population, but they can also be extremely time - consuming. People who use computers waste a vast amount of their time. They remain on their computers for hours and sometimes are unaware of the passage of time. They say things like ""@CAPS1, let me check my email. @CAPS1 look, I received a @CAPS2! @CAPS1, let me just update my @CAPS3 account."" One thing leads to another, and in a matter of minutes, @NUM2 or @NUM3 hours have already elapsed. People who spend the entire day on computers squander precious time that could be spent with family, exercising, or finding a life partner. Time is incredibly valuable in our lives, and we must not waste it by staying on a computer all day. Not only can they be time - consuming, but computers can also be dangerous. Children across the country are being killed, raped, and bullied because of computers. They post their pictures on chat sites, disclose excessive personal information, and before long, they face a serious threat. Moreover, some children have committed suicide because they were cyberbullied. Cyberbullying can be just as, if not more, harmful than traditional bullying. These children endure severe mental and emotional distress, leading them to make poor decisions, including suicide, and perform poorly in school. There can also be explicit content on the @CAPS5, which can have a negative impact on a child's developing mind. The danger posed by computers is so great that they should be regulated. Computers are too risky, which is why they should not be allowed to consume so much of our time. In conclusion, due to these reasons, computers should be restricted in @LOCATION1 society for the well - being of its members."
1368	1372	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 Local Newspaper, I have learned that you are concerned about people's excessive use of computers. In my view, computers are a valuable asset as many individuals utilize them for educational, professional, and other purposes. I believe that computers serve multiple beneficial functions; they are widely employed for research and accessing resources. They offer greater convenience, especially when traveling, as one can easily check hotel prices, locate restaurants, and discover interesting places without the need to make phone calls or drive around. Computers are highly advantageous for educational purposes. In my opinion, using books for learning is more cumbersome and time - consuming compared to using computers. When faced with questions, one can visit relevant websites and pose queries, often receiving answers from a diverse range of people. Moreover, computers are indispensable in the workplace. Most people rely on them to manage their taxes and store important documents. Computers can also be a source of entertainment, with features such as chat rooms and Facebook games. While I recognize the numerous benefits of computers, I also acknowledge that some individuals spend an excessive amount of time on them. Computers are excellent tools, but one should also make use of other resources such as maps and books. Many people spend @NUM1 hours on the computer, engaging in activities like Facebooking and gaming. I believe it is essential for people to go outdoors and socialize with friends. During @DATE1, when the weather is cold and sometimes snowy, a large number of people tend to spend their time on the computer. However, I do not think they should spend all their time in front of the screen, as one should not rely solely on electronics at all times. I believe that computer usage should be limited during @DATE2, as spending time with friends and family is important, and the weather is pleasant. In conclusion, computers can be extremely useful for navigation, work, and schoolwork, but one should not overindulge in their use. Electronics are not the entirety of life. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you concur with my perspective.
1369	1373	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I contend that computers are advantageous to society, despite the views of some who disagree. They provide us with a means of communication, enable us to learn about foreign people and places, and offer extensive support to businesses. Computers are an essential component of modern society. Computers facilitate communication through various channels such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6 - mail, and more. Without computers, families living far apart can communicate effortlessly with just a click of a button. @CAPS5 allows us to interact with our friends after school and plan our evening activities. Long - distance phone calls incur costs, and it is not cost - effective to spend @MONEY1 per call if you make frequent calls. Communication has undergone significant evolution in the past @NUM1 years, and computers represent a significant milestone in this progress. This is why computers are beneficial for communication. Computers also empower us to access information about foreign places and people within minutes. For instance, if we want to know who was the @CAPS7 of @LOCATION1, we can obtain multiple relevant websites on the topic. They enhance our learning capabilities and provide us with opportunities to acquire knowledge that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. This is another reason why computers are highly beneficial to society. The final reason supporting the benefits of computers to society is their ability to store and manage a vast amount of data. They are used to handle work - related data and assist @PERCENT1 of businesses in filing reports and communicating with other branches of the company. I learned in class that jobs were much more challenging in the past compared to today, largely due to technological advancements. Some people argue that using computers discourages people from going out and exercising. However, it only takes @NUM2 minutes to check your @CAPS6 - mail or look up information. In conclusion, computers are beneficial to society because without them, our lives would be significantly more complex.
1370	1374	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I advocate that we should utilize computers for a multitude of valuable purposes. Firstly, the internet offers a vast repository of information. Secondly, numerous websites contain historical data. Lastly, email allows us to send messages to distant locations. My first argument posits that the internet provides an abundance of information. For example, if you do not have access to a newspaper but have a laptop, you can still obtain the necessary information. Did you know that over @NUM1, @NUM2 people use their laptops for information rather than games? Another instance is when the daily newspaper fails to carry the article we are seeking; we can turn to the internet. When searching for information online, we can use search engines like Yahoo and Google, as well as other informational websites. My second point is that many different websites contain historical content. For example, instead of visiting a history museum every day, one can access historical information on websites daily. One day, I had to complete a project on the @CAPS4 within four days. I visited a historical website dedicated to the @CAPS4 and received an A+ for my project. When people need historical knowledge, it is readily available on the internet. My final reason is that instead of texting people in far - flung places, we can use email. For example, creating an email address is free. Did you know that more than @NUM3 million people worldwide prefer using email over texting? If you do not have an email address, it is quick and easy to create one. You do not have to spend money to send a message to someone on the other side of the world. In conclusion, I firmly believe that we should have computers. The internet provides a wealth of information, many websites offer historical data, and email enables us to communicate with people at a distance. Thank you for reading this article.
1371	1375	1	1	"Newly introduced @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers confer substantial benefits upon society. Although the majority of individuals may not concur, there exist numerous compelling reasons to support this assertion. When people experience boredom, computers offer an array of activities to engage in, present abundant learning opportunities, and facilitate organizational efficiency. After perusing this paper, you will undoubtedly concur that computers are a boon. Have you ever found yourself bored with nothing to do? If a computer is accessible, there are innumerable options to keep you occupied. People can communicate with their friends and maintain contact regardless of the distance. There are numerous websites hosting a plethora of games. Every type of game is available on the computer. You might be concerned, ""I could become addicted to a game and be unable to tear my eyes away from the screen."" In such a scenario, you can set a timer to allocate a specific duration. Rest assured, the computer will issue a warning before shutting down. However, computers are not solely for entertainment. They are repositories of knowledge, akin to the collective intellect of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicians. When tasked with writing a paper on a well - known figure for a school assignment, you can conduct rapid research on the computer, as there will be numerous websites dedicated to that individual. Additionally, daily news updates keep you informed about global events, eliminating any concerns about being uninformed. Do you value organization? Personally, I believe that staying organized simplifies life and daily routines, as you are aware of item locations. The computer is an excellent and straightforward tool for organization. There are numerous programs available for document writing, graph creation, and other tasks. Approximately <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of the working population relies on computers for their jobs and to manage various aspects. @PERCENT1 of the working population is a significant proportion. Consider this: if computers had not been invented, that <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people would either be unemployed or would have to rely on paper records, which could be a disaster. Eventually, you may wish to back up all your photos, files, music, etc., to a @CAPS4 to prevent data loss in case of computer failure. After reading this, do you not agree that computers are beneficial to society? There are many more reasons, but this paper has covered a substantial portion. I hope you have recognized that the world as we know it today would not exist without computers. Thank you for your time."
1372	1376	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, I am penning this letter to deliberate on the fact that computers exert a negative influence on the average American. The reasons are as follows: individuals are spending less time outdoors, engaging in insufficient exercise, and interacting less with their families. Reduced time spent outdoors can have a significant impact on the environment. For instance, people may become less concerned about our planet and more indifferent to pollution. If they were to step outside instead of constantly running the air - conditioner, they could save money and socialize with friends. A lack of exercise can be detrimental to health. Sitting in front of a computer all day is not exercise; it is slothfulness. Exercise boosts self - esteem, stimulates adrenaline, helps maintain fitness, and alleviates concerns about poor health. When family members do not interact and instead, one is on the computer while others watch @CAPS1, it can lead to frequent arguments. Don't you aspire to have a healthy family relationship? Therefore, you should encourage your family to gather at the table and discuss their day. I have presented my reasons for believing that computers have a negative impact on people. I hope you concur, so that we can find a way to enable people to use their computers while also becoming more active.
1373	1377	1	1	Wouldn't you desire to discover a @NUM1 - star hotel or restaurant with a single click? I certainly would. So, should we continue to utilize computers for the betterment of society, or refrain from using them to increase physical activity? Computers are advantageous as they perform tasks with precision. They also facilitate access to and exploration of the internet for useful information. A computer is highly intelligent and is not confined to the conventional, bulky, box - shaped form. Computers are also integrated into certain electronic devices. If you forget to turn off the lights while on vacation, you can use a handheld computer to do so. Communication on a computer is remarkably straightforward. All you require is a computer, a microphone or headset, speakers, and specialized software. Once you have these, you can connect with the world. You can converse with loved ones and family members via the computer. If you wish, you can also acquire a webcam, a video - capturing device for the computer, enabling face - to - face interaction. If you lack the aforementioned equipment, you can still engage in texting by using the computer keyboard to type and send messages. Your computer can also perform numerous other functions. You can play mindless video games, provided your computer meets the appropriate specifications. Admittedly, it may be costly.
1374	1378	1	1	Dear newspaper, surely you possess a computer? Undoubtedly, that is where you source all the necessary information. Computers are invaluable, and everyone should own one. They enable users to acquire new knowledge and search for any information they desire. Moreover, they facilitate communication with family, friends, and other individuals. Additionally, computers allow users to stay informed about disasters in other countries and gain insights into the world. In these respects, computers are beneficial to a large number of people. Computers empower users to learn new things and conduct searches on any topic. If you are a student in need of research, a computer is at your disposal. This is also advantageous for the workplace. Anyone can utilize computers to learn while working. They streamline work processes, facilitate learning, and are efficient and user - friendly. There is no need to engage in the arduous task of searching through books and spending excessive time locating the required information. Computers are excellent tools that you should utilize. Another remarkable feature of computers is their communication capabilities. If your family or friends reside far away or in another country, you can communicate with them via computers. You can easily engage in video calls or send emails. This is a convenient way to maintain close relationships. It is also beneficial for those conducting online business. You can perform your job and communicate with colleagues. In the event of an emergency meeting, if you lack the time to call everyone, simply send an email, and you and the others will be prepared for the meeting the next day. This is an ideal method for both communication and business. My final point regarding computers is that they are ideal for learning about disasters in other countries. If you miss the news and wish to catch up, you can access it on your computer, learn new information, and stay informed about unfortunate events. Additionally, if you are living away from your hometown, you can go online to check on local happenings and plan visits for special occasions. You can learn a great deal about other countries and new places if you are considering relocation. You can also explore hotels and other options if you plan to go on vacation. This is an excellent means of transportation and knowledge acquisition. In conclusion, computers are highly beneficial. They facilitate learning and research, enable communication with family and friends in emergencies, and are useful for travel and learning about other countries. If you own a computer, that is excellent. If not, you should promptly acquire one as computers are remarkable and can fulfill almost all your needs. Stop procrastinating and either go online or purchase one.
1375	1379	1	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, it has come to my attention that an increasing number of individuals are spending excessive amounts of time on computers. A recent study has confirmed this, reporting that ""@PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population uses a computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day"". This has led to reduced physical activity, less time spent enjoying nature, and diminished social interaction. I contend that the drawbacks of computers far outweigh their benefits, as they impede both physical and social well - being and cause more harm than good to society. Spending excessive time on computers can deteriorate a person's health by reducing exercise. Take @LOCATION3, for example. @LOCATION3 goes on the computer at least five times a week for about four hours. As a result, @LOCATION3 has stopped playing soccer and now gets only one hour of exercise per week instead of six. This has led to weight gain and a decline in health. The issue is that there are millions of children like @LOCATION3 who are not getting enough exercise and instead choose to spend too much time on their computers. Another problem is that people are spending less time appreciating nature. Instead, they opt to surf the web. This leads to a decreased concern for our planet and its animals. Nature is vital and can be extremely enjoyable, so this is regrettable. Moreover, those who spend an inordinate amount of time on computers tend to interact less with their family members. Most children no longer assist with cooking, cleaning, or chores, nor do they spend time with their siblings. One mother stated, ""Ever since my daughter got her new laptop, she hasn't played with her baby brother or friends even once."" Unfortunately, this is true for most teenagers today. Computers have limited the amount of time families spend together. In conclusion, computers are detrimental to society. They confine people to their rooms, preventing them from exercising, enjoying nature, or having fun with their families and friends. In doing so, computers have become a bane to society. Therefore, it is essential that individuals who spend more than an hour a day on computers reallocate that time for exercise, socialization, or even relaxation. Overall, computers are no longer beneficial to society."
1376	1380	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers exert a detrimental influence on individuals. One rationale for this belief is that people require physical activity. They ought not to spend the entire day seated at a desk engaging in computer games. Particularly, children should be outdoors, partaking in play and exercise. If individuals solely sit at a computer all day and consume junk food, an increasing number will become obese. Were more people to exercise, they would commence consuming appropriate foods, and numerous individuals would lead significantly healthier and happier lives. My second reason for deeming computers negative is that some children are occasionally cyberbullied. This occurs when someone is harassed online. Children resort to this method so that they need not confront the victim in person and can say whatever they desire, often without the other person even knowing their identity. Additionally, children may encounter strangers whom they perceive as amiable, yet they have no knowledge of the person's true nature. Through deception, these strangers can induce children to engage in actions they would not typically undertake, believing the stranger to be of a similar age or having affection for them. Regrettably, many girls have fallen victim to such situations. My final reason is that people may miss out on enjoyable activities with family or friends, such as swimming on [DATE1] or sledding during winter. If one remains at home using the computer, they cannot partake in these fun outdoor activities and exercise simultaneously. These are the reasons why I believe computers have a negative impact on people.
1377	1381	1	1	"Dear The [CAPS1] [CAPS2], I am convinced that the advantages of computers far outweigh their disadvantages. Computers present an alternative avenue for acquiring knowledge about the world. They can also function as a research tool. If a child or anyone spends what a family member deems an excessive amount of time on the computer, this appears to be an issue confined to the individual and their family. Many individuals may argue, stating, ""Refer to the encyclopedia to learn about the world."" However, a computer is faster, more convenient, and more time - efficient to use. In fact, the majority of people in the latest generation of families likely do not possess an encyclopedia set. For instance, if I wished to learn more about [LOCATION1], instead of searching through a dictionary or encyclopedia, I could access the computer, type in [LOCATION1], and discover a plethora of links and opportunities. Some individuals may prefer traditional methods, but personally, I appreciate the freedom and ease of using a computer. Have you ever been tasked with researching for a project or report? Many people, whether in school or the workplace, will likely need to conduct research to gain a better understanding. While a dictionary and a thesaurus are useful, they are distinct tools. Compared to a computer, these classic research tools, although still valuable, can be cumbersome. My point is that a computer encompasses a dictionary, thesaurus, encyclopedia, etc., all in one! Therefore, the next time you need to research something, consider reaching for the keyboard instead of the bookshelf. To me, the problem of someone spending excessive time on the computer seems more like a family issue than a social problem. Technology has transformed our world! Since the invention of computers, they have not only become smaller but also increasingly useful. The computer has opened up numerous opportunities for our society. Without computers, space travel, for example, would not be as common as it is in this generation. All I am trying to convey is that I do not believe computers harm our society; rather, they are essentially the building blocks of our world. As you read this article, I hope you recognized the benefits of having computers in our world. A computer is a valuable learning aid, the preeminent research tool, and an integral part of our society today. If you could glean one insight from reading this article, I would hope it would be to contemplate, ""What would our world be like without computers?"
1378	1382	1	1	"Dear [CAPS1] [CAPS2] Register, I am writing to advocate that the influence of computers on people is beneficial. The reason I assert that computers are advantageous is that they assist in providing guidance and contribute to the economy, and they also facilitate rapid communication through instant messaging. Read on as I elucidate how and why these aspects of computers are helpful. [CAPS7], I understand I mentioned that computers offer guidance. Let me illustrate it thus: Have you ever needed to travel to a distant location and were unsure how to navigate there, and your vehicle lacked a [CAPS3]? In such a scenario, the computer becomes your only recourse. For example, when I was traveling south on [DATE1], we did not have a [CAPS4] GPS, and we were unaware of the route. Our only option was to turn to the computer. We logged onto Google and promptly found our way. This is the first reason; now, read on for the next. Alright, considering the current state of our economy, which is rather precarious, one way computers aid the economy is that instead of people driving to pay their bills, they can make payments online. This not only saves money but also reduces the need for the state to allocate funds for vehicle fuel or vehicle repairs. For instance, a gas station near my residence is undergoing reconstruction due to a pipe issue, which is costing us approximately [MONEY1]. [CAPS7], can we not recognize this as a means to save the economy? It is time to move on to the next reason. Here is my [DATE1] reason for the usefulness of computers, namely instant messaging. This is particularly helpful when you do not have a landline or a cellphone and need to inform a family member or friend about an urgent matter. You can do so via instant messaging ([CAPS5]), as they are likely to receive the message promptly. For example, once my friend, who did not have a landline or cellphone, was in a situation where someone was attempting to break into her house. She instant - messaged me to alert me, and the message was sent to my cellphone. I then contacted her mother. Before long, another message came through, saying ""[CAPS6] you."" [CAPS7], after reading about how computers are beneficial in providing direction, saving the economy, and enabling instant messaging, can you concur with me that computers are helpful? It remains your opinion, but you have read my perspective; consider what you have read and determine if it is unfounded."
1379	1383	1	1	Dear [CAPS1], In my view, computers do not have a positive impact on people. Online, one can access any website and interact with others. Most of the time, you may not even know the identity of the person you are communicating with. Moreover, not all information found online is accurate. Computers also prevent individuals from engaging in productive activities, such as outdoor play. In the following paragraphs, I will elaborate on my stance. Firstly, online platforms offer numerous means of communication, such as chat rooms, blogs, and email. However, can you truly be certain that the people you interact with are who they claim to be? In the past, it was rare for someone to be caught when attempting to kidnap a child by posing as someone online. Nowadays, more and more such cases are being uncovered. You may think this will not happen to your child, but it did to my friend. She was being stalked online by an unknown individual. Once information is posted online, it is permanent. Therefore, be cautious about what you share online, as there is always a way to retrieve deleted content. Additionally, not all information found online is true. Professionals state that [PERCENT1] of children have conducted online research for a project and later found the information to be false when cross - referencing with a print source. On websites like Wikipedia, anyone can modify the content. Most websites allow anyone to make such changes. Also, posts and pictures on the internet may not always be appropriate. There are valid reasons for protecting children from certain content. Lastly, computers prevent people from engaging in productive activities. While they may enhance hand - eye coordination, they do not contribute to physical fitness and health. Currently, [PERCENT3] of [CAPS4] alone are overweight, which is a significant number. Dr. [DR1] asserts that online games deprive children of the essential exercise and fresh air that every growing child requires. In conclusion, the internet restricts children from going outside to play. Moreover, not all information found online is accurate or appropriate. Lastly, not everyone you encounter online is who they pretend to be. This is why I believe that computers have a negative impact on society.
1380	1384	1	1	Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that there is a significant divergence of opinion regarding whether computers exert a negative or positive influence on individuals. I firmly hold the view that computers do not confer benefits upon society. In today's contemporary world, a substantial number of people allocate an inordinate amount of time to computer usage, time that could be more productively spent on physical exercise, socializing with family and friends, or immersing themselves in nature. I invite you to continue reading, and I am confident you will concur with my perspective. Firstly, computers are emerging as a significant concern within society as they impinge upon our physical well - being. The [LOCATION1] is witnessing a continuous increase, not in population but in the average body size of its inhabitants! According to a recent survey, [NUM1] out of every [NUM2] individuals in the [LOCATION1] are either overweight or obese. “The primary cause of the [ORGANIZATION2]'s obesity rate is not overeating; rather, it is attributable to electronic devices, particularly computers,” stated [PERSON1], a surgeon at [ORGANIZATION1], after treating a severe case of obesity. Obesity is not an insurmountable problem. All that is required is for us to refrain from spending hours fixated on a screen. The people of America should venture outdoors! Simple activities such as cycling or walking a dog can suffice. Regardless of the activity, the key is to disengage from the computer and engage in outdoor exercise or visit the gym. Secondly, computers disrupt interpersonal relationships with family and friends. From personal experience, I am aware that parents are often dismayed when their children miss family dinners or decline social outings with friends, citing the need to complete a game level or conduct an online search. Family and friends should hold a paramount position in one's life; unfortunately, for the majority, this is not the case. Psychologist [PERSON2] has discovered that having a reliable support network of family and friends contributes significantly to an individual's happiness and overall well - being. By eliminating or reducing computer usage, we can foster a more harmonious and pleasant society for the people of the [LOCATION1], benefiting everyone. Furthermore, by curtailing our computer time, we enhance our opportunities to experience the wonders that nature has to offer. Regrettably, most individuals fail to recognize the wealth of experiences they are forfeiting by remaining indoors. There are countless marvels in our immediate surroundings, such as in our backyards, that we may never encounter due to our excessive computer addiction. [NUM3] years ago, people managed to lead fulfilling lives without computers, and there is no reason why we cannot do the same. [PERCENT1] of people have never even gone camping! Therefore, the next time you are tempted to spend another [NUM4] hours on the computer, take a stroll outdoors, and I am certain you will be astounded by the discoveries that await. In conclusion, computers do not serve the interests of society. They merely act as barriers, preventing people from engaging in outdoor activities, appreciating nature, and spending quality time with loved ones. I sincerely hope that I have persuaded you to see the merit in my argument. Thank you for your time.
1381	1385	1	1	"Did you know that in a recent poll within the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 utilize computers on a daily basis? Computers exert a highly positive influence on individuals, such as promptly informing them about news, traffic, and weather, facilitating interaction with others, and enabling the acquisition of new knowledge. Can you even fathom how arduous life would be sans computers? They serve as a daily instrument that millions of people employ advantageously. One manner in which people positively utilize computers is by leveraging them to stay informed about news, traffic, and weather. For instance, suppose there are indications of a hurricane approaching their residences. They would promptly be aware merely by accessing the internet. Another example is if there were a shooting in the vicinity. People would be well - informed of the facts by perusing an online article. Computers assist by apprising people of danger so that they and their families remain unharmed. Not only do computers aid in informing people about any peril through news and weather, but they also enhance their daily lifestyle. My father commutes to work every morning and consistently checks online for traffic updates to avoid congestion and reach work punctually and safely. Without computers, people would be unable to directly discern the hazards and difficulties they @MONTH1 encounter. Another positive impact computers have on people is enabling them to interact with others, such as through video chatting and instant messaging. @PERCENT2 of the world engages in video chatting and instant messaging. It contributes to making people more sociable by enabling them to converse with their friends. Another illustration is, say you haven't seen a close family member or friend for an extended period. Video chatting and instant messaging will help you catch up and cultivate a stronger relationship. Nobody desires to squander time in life without communicating with a close friend or family member for a long while, right? Computers assist people by facilitating interaction with others throughout their daily lives. A third positive effect computers have on people is imparting new knowledge. The primary source of education for students is via the computer on the internet. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 stated, ""Computers are what facilitate the growth of my students. I have them use computers daily for reports and to expand their learning."" They are highly beneficial to students because the internet now encompasses textbooks they use in class. In this way, they won't need to carry around heavy books and stress about forgetting them. Moreover, if a student fails to comprehend the material learned in class, they can seek additional assistance and guidance online, thereby further augmenting their knowledge. Without computers, lives would be negatively transformed. Computers help people directly access news, traffic, and weather, interact with others, and learn new things. Therefore, computers are extremely positive. Since @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 currently use them advantageously, why discontinue?"
1382	1386	1	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 Harold, An increasing number of individuals are using computers; however, not everyone concurs that this is beneficial to society. Those who advocate for technological advancements believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Nevertheless, computers can be detrimental. They can deprive children of opportunities for exercise, appreciation of nature, and quality time with family and friends. Firstly, computers can impede children from engaging in physical activity. ""@CAPS1 I can never venture outside after school because I'm checking my email,"" remarked a @CAPS2 high - school student. A recent study reveals that @PERCENT1 of students at a middle school, upon returning home, immediately turn to the computer. This indicates that nearly half of the students at just the middle school are occupied with the computer. This is precisely why computers can be a negative influence. Secondly, some children spend more time indoors than outdoors. ""I spend the majority of my time breathing in air - conditioned (or heated) air rather than fresh air,"" said a @CAPS2 middle - school student. Imagine a child fixated on a computer screen, playing a game or on Facebook, while it's a glorious day in the middle of @DATE1. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students @CAPS3 that they spend more time indoors than outside. Computers can have a negative impact on a child's well - being. Finally, computers can disrupt a child's time spent with family or friends. ""I @CAPS1 spend an entire evening at a family party on the computer,"" stated a @CAPS3 elementary student. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 homes possess a computer, and it is frequently used by children. This demonstrates that little @PERSON1 of the @PERSON2's household ever ventures outside to play with friends. Computers can cause more harm than good in a household. They can prevent children from exercising, enjoying the outdoors, and spending time with family. I urge you to advise your children, grandchildren, nieces, or nephews to reduce their computer usage."
1383	1387	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, As we are all aware, an increasing number of people are embracing computers. Some contend that this is a cause for concern as it impacts people's health. I firmly believe that with technological advancements, computers have a positive influence on individuals. Here are three compelling reasons. Firstly, technological progress enhances our intellectual capabilities. Secondly, it provides us with access to fascinating resources that are unavailable in libraries, such as biographies. Finally, it enables online communication. My first reason, as previously mentioned, is that computers enhance our intelligence. When we encounter questions about something unfamiliar, we can search for answers on the computer. By acquiring this knowledge, we can also educate others. Computers offer a wealth of useful information that can benefit us in the future. My second reason is that technological advancements assist us by granting access to helpful websites that impart knowledge. Not all information can be found in libraries. Computers provide access to biographies, educational websites, and most importantly, educational advancements, such as online tutoring for students struggling in school. My third and final reason why technological advancements can benefit us is that they enable online communication. Some individuals have email for valid reasons. For example, teachers use email for educational purposes. If a student is facing difficulties with their work, they can simply send an email to the teacher detailing their problems and potential solutions. That concludes my thoughts for now. I hope you will give this matter due consideration.
1384	1388	1	1	Computers exert a profoundly positive influence on people's lives. They are invaluable aids, imparting skills essential for life. Their technological capabilities assist us in daily tasks. Moreover, they facilitate staying in touch with others and meeting new acquaintances. I am firmly convinced that computers have a highly positive impact on our lives. Computers educate us in numerous ways. Firstly, learning to operate a computer is a fundamental life skill. In most occupations, proficiency in computer usage is mandatory. Today, computers are an indispensable component of most work environments. Hand - eye coordination is another skill that computers cultivate. In a sense, computers actually contribute to our performance in sports. To catch a ball, hand - eye coordination is requisite. The technology offered by computers significantly enriches our lives. If we need directions, we can easily look them up on the computer. Otherwise, we would have to contact the restaurant for guidance. Without the assistance of computers, we would have to write all our papers by hand. For students, preparing reports without a computer would be a nightmare. They would have to peruse numerous books to gather information. The world would be an entirely different place without computers. At times, our loved ones are compelled to relocate far from us. Maintaining contact via phone becomes challenging under such circumstances. Computers bridge this gap. Through platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and @ORGANIZATION1, it is possible to stay connected. We can chat with them and share pictures of their well - being. We can even maintain contact from @LOCATION1. Computers make almost anything achievable. In conclusion, computers are remarkable machines. They teach us lifelong lessons, assist us when we need information or have to complete a report, and even help us maintain relationships so that they do not deteriorate. I cannot speak for others, but I firmly believe that computers keep the world functioning smoothly.
1385	1389	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, There are a significant number of people addicted to computers. They believe that computers can be helpful, and indeed, for some, they aid in work and education. However, most children are addicted to computer games. @PERCENT1 of children are addicted to computers. For several reasons, computers have a substantial impact on people. This impact might affect children's education or cause an increase in electricity bills. The most severe consequence of having a computer at home is that it can be the reason millions of teenagers have been killed due to chatting online with strangers. Computers can sometimes be dangerous to people. Do people still require computers? Having a computer at home is not advisable, especially for children. This is because computers can have a detrimental effect on their education. Parents do not want this to happen to their children. There are many uneducated children who either stay at home or engage in drug - related activities on the streets. Although computers can assist children with their studies or projects, some children use them solely for playing games. As a result, many of them learn little at school but a great deal from computer games. They should curtail their computer - game usage. Additionally, having a computer at home can lead to an increase in people's electricity bills. Some people think that computers pose no problems, but computers rely on electricity, and users must pay the electricity bills. If you spent @MONEY1 on your electricity bill @DATE1 year when you did not have a computer, it might rise to @MONEY2 now that you own one. This is a significant issue. Nevertheless, computers are dangerous. Computers can be both beneficial and harmful. Undoubtedly, @PERCENT2 of teenagers have been killed because of chatting online with strangers. Most websites like @CAPS2 are now at risk. @DATE1 @DATE1 months ago, a husband and wife were killed as a result of @CAPS2. The husband killed his wife because of her ""single"" relationship status on her @CAPS2. She was shot by her husband, and then the husband took his own life. They both lost their lives! Chatting online and meeting strangers can result in personal loss. Parents should not have computers at home unless they intend to use them, and in that case, the computer should be placed in their room where children cannot access it. Now is the time to reach a consensus! Do we need computers at home? Can we live without them? We do not need computers at home, and yes, we can live without them. We can engage in activities with our family, exercise for our health, go on a picnic with friends, or enjoy a vacation with the whole family. Local newspaper, I request that you inform people to reduce their computer usage and encourage them to spend time with their families and enjoy activities outside."
1386	1390	1	1	Dear Editor of the Newspaper, I comprehend your stance that computers do not exert an influence on individuals. However, computers indeed have a substantial impact on people. Firstly, computers facilitate individuals in swiftly acquiring information. People commonly utilize search engines such as Google or Ask to find information, which can assist them in locating a store or obtaining the contact number of a restaurant. Moreover, one can ascertain the price of an item at a store and whether it is on sale. These are merely some of the remarkable effects that computers have on people.  In addition, work is significantly affected by computers. For instance, computers are highly beneficial for those seeking employment as there are numerous options available. Furthermore, both adults and children use computers to type documents on software like Word, whether it is for a work - related report or a school essay. Perhaps you have also employed a computer to type information for your newspaper.  Another aspect is that children enjoy communicating with their friends on computers. Most kids use platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Oovoo to stay in touch. These programs enable children to maintain contact with friends who have moved away. Additionally, if one has family members living far away, these programs allow for communication at any time.  I understand your perspective that computers do not have an impact on people, but in fact, computers have multiple effects. They help people find what they are looking for, aid in work, and are an excellent means of communicating with friends and family. Therefore, carefully consider the decision you wish to make.
1387	1391	1	1	I opine that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. When people use computers, they do not engage in extended - duration sessions. I also hold this view due to the advent of new technology. Computers are advantageous as they can assist when one is perplexed or needs to look up information. In my estimation, computers are a positive force.  People do not spend @NUM1 consecutive hours on the computer. Although they may spend @NUM1 hours in a day on it, they also engage in other activities such as attending school, having meals, and participating in extracurricular activities.  Some individuals rely on computers for their occupations. News media companies utilize computers for editing and printing newspapers and also for uploading news on their websites. One can only wonder what most people would do without computers.  The new technology associated with computers is a boon. It enables people to interact across distances. If one has friends or family members living far away, there are numerous ways to communicate, such as using @CAPS3, Skype, Oovoo, @CAPS4, or email. When I use the computer, I do not merely passively watch videos on @CAPS5 @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. Instead, I interact with my friends. A significant percentage (@PERCENT1) of the population between the ages of @NUM3 has a @CAPS3 account, and @PERCENT2 use Skype or Oovoo to converse with those who are too far to visit.  Computers are also beneficial for academic purposes. If one is unsure about a school - related topic, they can simply search for it on the internet. For example, if one needs to translate @CAPS8 to @CAPS9, the computer can be used for translation. A considerable proportion (@PERCENT3) of people have expanded their vocabulary using the internet. If a word is not found in a traditional dictionary, it can be looked up online.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people. No one spends so much time on the computer that they are unable to go outside or socialize with friends. People actually need computers for their jobs, and the emerging technology allows interaction with people worldwide. They are useful for schoolwork, looking up definitions, and translation. Computers are not negative and do not impede one's daily life.
1388	1392	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, do you recall @CAPS2 when you were a child? At that time, there were no computers or other electronics apart from the telephone. Presently, computers are highly advanced and offer numerous benefits to society, such as enhancing hand - eye coordination, facilitating learning, and enabling online communication, which are clear indicators of technological progress.  Computers teach hand - eye coordination in an unobtrusive manner. When typing an email or an essay, one's hands are actively engaged, honing this skill. The hand - eye coordination acquired through computer use can also be applied in sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 - year - old tennis player, stated, ""I used to use the computer daily and later played tennis. Eventually, the computer contributed to my proficiency in my favorite sport."" Hand - eye coordination is highly valuable, as evidenced by a survey of @NUM2 people, where @NUM3 of them affirmed its importance and noted that daily activities like using a computer help improve it.  Typing is commonly employed when sending emails due to its speed, entertainment value, and effectiveness in communication. There are various popular and rapid ways to communicate online, including email, AIM, Facebook, and more. It is advantageous to communicate with friends and family online, especially when other options are costly. For example, @PERSON4 lives in @LOCATION1, and her sister, with whom she is very close, resides in @LOCATION3. They previously had limited communication due to high calling charges and the expense of plane tickets. However, with the advent of webcams, they can now see each other almost weekly. Many have said, ""I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now webcams and email are useful and save us a significant amount of money.""  Some may argue that letters can be sent, but it is impossible to share a video of a baby's first steps or a cute YouTube video via letters. Moreover, one can meet new people online and maintain close relationships.  In addition to being a source of entertainment, computers make work and learning more convenient. Online, one can learn a vast amount of information, from the meaning of @CAPS5 to details about an earthquake in @LOCATION4. Keeping track of everything on a single computer is remarkable. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 - year - old @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, said, ""@CAPS4, we are striving to digitize more things to protect the planet, reducing paper waste and deforestation."" Approximately @PERCENT1 of the homework for @NUM5 graders is online, which not only helps the environment but also provides more learning opportunities for children. For example, @NUM6 graders have an online math class on a platform like Hey Math. Online, people can access a wealth of information from diverse sources, such as a scientist's experiment or a paparazzi's take on @PERSON1's new boyfriend.  In conclusion, computers have brought about significant positive changes in society. In the @DATE1, computers have become an integral part of people's daily lives, offering benefits such as improved hand - eye coordination, enhanced communication, and more efficient learning."
1389	1393	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers detract from time that could be spent on exercise and enjoying nature. Moreover, the time available for family and friends is severely restricted by computer use. I am convinced that if more people were to disengage from @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, many issues would be resolved.  Computers are having a negative impact on society, especially in relation to the obesity problem in @LOCATION1. One in five children in the area is obese, and I believe computers play a contributing role. I can recall instances when I intended to go outside and exercise, but the allure of fun games and videos on the internet pulled me away. While moderate computer use is acceptable, many people abuse this privilege.  Obesity can lead to various health problems, such as clogged arteries and strokes. No parent wishes to see their child suffer from such issues at a young age. However, it is challenging to address this problem as taking away computer access is difficult for many.  In addition, computers steal time that could be spent creating good memories with family. People today invest a great deal of effort in computer - related activities. I am certain that I would have had more quality time if I had not been so engrossed in the computer, and many others have likely experienced the same.  In conclusion, I view the computer as an addiction. Millions of people who spend excessive time on the computer gain weight. It also prevents people from enjoying nature and puts relationships with family and friends on hold. Memories are being stolen by this awful device. We should be more aware of how detrimental the computer can be.
1390	1394	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion they take time away from exercising. Also, no one has time to enjoy nature. Of course, when it comes to family and friends, The time is stified by the computer. If more people get of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I'm positive all would be resolved. I'm sure that the computer is affecting everyone negatively. Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. One in five children are obese. I feel the computers is contributing to the problem. I remember times when I wanted to go outside and exercise, but the computer dragged me away wih all the fun games and videos the internet sure, the computers fine in moderation, but many people abuse their privellages. Obesity leads to many such as dogged arteries or strokes. No parents wants to see their go through young. But if from of to fix it? taking away for many. Everybody these dayrace people have so much effort making. I's sure I would have had across time if went people have probably done. Good times. Family to take time from away from us. In conclusion, I feel the computer is an addiction. Millions who on the computer gain weight. Also, it takes time enjoy nature but the computer blocking the way. Another thing the comuter puts family and friends on hold. Memories are being stolen by the awful device that computer. So else how bad the computer is.
1391	1395	1	1	@CAPS1, “Dinner is ready.” “Okay, mom, one moment.” Click, click, click. Do you hear this from your children more frequently than usual? If so, you need to heed this upcoming message. We, @ORGANIZATION1, believe that children and adults are allocating excessive time to their laptops or computers. They are not engaging in outdoor exercise, appreciating nature, or interacting with their families. These issues could lead to more significant problems that @MONTH1 has already manifested, such as @CAPS2, financial difficulties, and eventually depression. So, continue reading and contemplate what you hear that could or has occurred to you. @CAPS2 is a substantial concern. Kids across @LOCATION1 are spending more time on their computers than outdoors. Every day, I observe my nephew on his computer, and I notice him becoming increasingly overweight. Studies have indicated that children and adults who possess a Facebook or MySpace account gain approximately @NUM1 pounds every @NUM2 months. If they are online for @NUM3 to @NUM2 hours a day, they will gain @NUM5 pounds each month. Sooner or later, the state will witness an increase in the @CAPS2 level from @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 among @ORGANIZATION1 individuals who are obese. This could result in job loss and laziness. When people spend the majority of their time on Facebook and MySpace, they may lose their jobs. More than @PERCENT3 of the state's citizens own a Facebook or MySpace account. So, when people are addicted to them, they spend more time on these platforms than on the tasks they need to complete for their jobs. Consequently, they will get fired and be unable to pay bills, loans, and mortgages. This will ultimately lead to depression. Depression is prevalent throughout the state and even the country. People are losing jobs left and right due to their computers and the internet. Some individuals are even committing crimes like murder and attempting suicide because of job loss or the loss of family members. Some people are so addicted to the internet that they neglect their newborn family members. This depression needs to cease. So, fight for the right to halt the addiction to internet use and lead a fulfilling life. Put down the computer, pick up a book, meet with friends and family, and keep your job. Don't let these reasons come between you and your life.
1392	1396	1	1	@CAPS2 individuals opine that the invention of the computer and the internet is a terrifying phenomenon, yet in truth, @CAPS6 is an egregious time - consumer. The local newspaper is conducting a survey regarding people's opinions about technology. People expend an inordinate amount of time on computers when they could be outdoors, relishing nature, exercising, or interacting with others in person. The technological advancements are merely squandering your time. When the weather is favorable, people should be outside enjoying @CAPS6 instead of squandering the day on the @CAPS1. Although the sun can be detrimental to your skin, it can also enhance your energy. Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide in buildings makes people drowsy. @PERCENT1 of the people surveyed by @ORGANIZATION1 stated that they feel better when they go outside. @CAPS2 individuals are becoming sedentary while they could be exercising. Obesity is a consequence of people sitting at the computer all day. @CAPS6 contributes to the @CAPS2 situation as kids have stopped participating actively due to excessive computer use. @PERCENT2 of the people surveyed by the @CAPS3 revealed that computer - bound individuals spend less time with friends they see in person. People may forget their manners as they are not accustomed to in - person interaction when they communicate online. Those who advocate computer usage might claim that there are ways to communicate via @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. However, online chatting is not always secure. On your buddy list, @CAPS6 @MONTH1, you can't be certain about your friends unless you can see their faces. Computers have become an overwhelming distraction to society. They have caused people to forget how to use manners and communicate in the real world. Now is the time to take action and find alternative activities! Responsible townspeople are...
1393	1397	1	1	My stance is that people should only use the computer when they genuinely need to perform tasks such as typing reports, checking emails, etc. What is the purpose of using the computer if all one intends to do is play games, which can become monotonous? I use the computer to communicate with friends, check emails, and handle related matters, and then I venture outside to engage in physical activities. One should limit computer usage to @NUM1 minutes per day and then engage in exercise. If one remains on the computer all day, they will develop an unpleasant odor, gain weight, become lethargic, and no one desires these outcomes. These are the negative consequences to avoid. One can play basketball, go for a bike ride with friends, or go swimming. I engage in such activities daily and am in good physical condition as a result. I maintain a healthy and fit lifestyle by not spending sunny days glued to the computer. One becomes more sociable and has the opportunity to interact with neighborhood children when they go outside. Every day when I return home, I complete my homework, then go outside to play, later spend @NUM1 minutes on the computer, and then conclude my day and go to bed. The same routine is followed the next day. Therefore, everyone should concur with me as I am undoubtedly correct.
1394	1398	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, some assert that computers are enjoyable, intelligent, and harmless. However, is this truly the case? Can computers cause harm? Well, for starters, I am aware that computers can consume a significant amount of people's time. For instance, many individuals do not venture outside as often as they should because they are typically engrossed in their computers. You might wonder what they are doing on the computer. Let's explore. There are numerous activities one can undertake on a computer. It can be a source of entertainment through chatting, a means of education, or a tool for work. A large number of people utilize the computer for amusement. For example, many use it to chat with friends on various websites. This often consumes a substantial amount of their time. People can engage in hours - long conversations on the computer, which detracts from their time outdoors. Another significant issue is computer games. In my view, computer games are among the most prominent problems. This is because many games can be so captivating that individuals can find a game and play it incessantly. This not only reduces their outdoor time but can also disrupt their lives. The games can be so addictive that both children and adults may fail to complete their work. This can lead to academic failure in school or job termination at work. On the other hand, many people use computers for work and educational purposes. Apart from internet chatting and computer games, numerous individuals rely on computers for schoolwork and at the workplace. They type up their work or send it to their email to take home. While this is a positive aspect of computers, it also has a negative side. It is beneficial as people can complete their work more efficiently. However, it is also a drawback as it provides another reason to stay indoors. In the workplace, people depend on computers. They save their work on them and use them to create various things. For example, people use computers to program robots. Although computers are used for valid reasons, people should still allocate time for outdoor activities. Many individuals need to take breaks from the computer because it can cause harm. If they spend all their time on the computer, they may become ill. Going outside, exercising, and breathing fresh air are of utmost importance. So, everyone out there, step away from your computer. Stop chatting, pause your game, take a break from your work, and go outside. Appreciate nature. The majority of your day should not be spent on the computer. Thank you for your time.
1395	1399	1	1	Do you believe that computers impact you positively? I, however, do not. I contend that computers have a negative influence on people. I hold this view because you will not engage in sufficient exercise, incur a high electricity bill, and find that they interfere with your daily life. Now that I have presented my reasons, I will elaborate on them in detail. To commence this essay, I believe that people will not get enough exercise. If you spend the entire day on the computer and do not go outside to talk with others or ride your bike, you will not burn any calories. You will become a sedentary individual, which can have severe implications for your health in the long run. As you age, you may develop a range of health issues such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and heart problems. Additionally, if you continuously sit in front of a computer for @NUM1 hours, you may injure your back, which will add to the list of health problems resulting from insufficient exercise. Secondly, I believe that if you are constantly on the computer, your parents will face an extremely high electricity bill. Your parents may be frustrated with you, and you may even face difficulties with the electricity company. If you use the computer non - stop, before you realize it, the bill will be so high that you won't be able to pay it. You will have a substantial electricity bill and may even be left without power in your home. In my opinion, computers are not worth causing a family to be without electricity. Finally, I believe that computers will disrupt your daily life. If you are always on the computer and never go outside, your friends will feel that you do not want to be bothered. They will think that you are ignoring them, and you will start to lose friends who have been there for you and supported you when you needed it most. Moreover, computers can damage your social life. You will always be indoors, missing opportunities to meet new people and develop your social skills. To conclude this essay, I have presented my ideas and opinions about computers. I have explained my reasons, namely, insufficient exercise, a high electricity bill, and interference with daily life. I have provided facts and details about the consequences of computer use. Now, it is up to you to decide whether computers have a positive or negative effect on people.
1396	1400	1	1	Would you prefer to be engrossed in the computer @NUM1 and squander your life? Well, some individuals are already squandering their lives. @CAPS1 you devote your time to the computer, you may become obese, lose the capacity to interact with friends and family, and even lose the ability to explore the @ORGANIZATION1!!! It's now or never to decide @CAPS1 you wish to waste your life on a computer. @CAPS1 you utilize your computer excessively, you may be at risk of becoming obese. You can become obese for @NUM2 reasons. You aren't engaging in physical activity while sitting. Since you're sitting idle, you start to consume numerous snacks. Finally, @NUM2, you may lose the ability to walk as well because you aren't using your legs, and the obesity makes it arduous to walk any longer. The time has come to decide. Also, @CAPS1 you squander your time on the computer, you may lose the ability to interact with your family and friends. @CAPS1 you have children, you may lose the ability to witness them grow into adults and may even push them away. Also, you may lose your friends because they won't want to socialize with someone who is constantly on the computer; all you'll have will be your computer. Finally, you'll be utterly alone because @CAPS6 one will be present when you attempt to finally interact with your family. It's now or never to choose what you want to do with your life. Finally, while you're on the computer checking your MySpace or your Facebook, a plethora of things are occurring around the @ORGANIZATION1. Instead of perusing your hard drive, you should be observing the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or gazing at the @CAPS4 tower in @LOCATION2 or, finally, even visiting @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 with your family. The time has come to decide. As a conclusion, wasting your life on the computer is detrimental and can harm your life in numerous ways. It can render you obese and deprive you of the ability to walk. It can prevent you from spending time with family and friends and may even push them away. Finally, you can waste your time at home and fail to explore the @ORGANIZATION1. The time has come to decide @CAPS1 you want to waste your time or not. @CAPS5 opinion is @CAPS6!!!
1397	1401	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I'm certain you relish relaxing and browsing the web. After all, the internet is an astonishing invention. However, the reality is that some individuals spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer. We miss out on all the other significant aspects of life solely due to excessive time spent on our laptops. Excessive internet usage can lead to insufficient exercise. It can cause us to be antisocial, and lastly, it can prevent us from appreciating the beautiful nature that surrounds us. Do you know what a highly prevalent cause of obesity is? Electronics. Kids remain seated at the computer all day long when they should be outdoors exercising and maintaining fitness. Certainly, it is still acceptable to surf the web. You simply need to minimize the time. We could enforce this rule by setting a time limit at home. I personally enjoy using the computer, but I ensure to log off after approximately an hour. The concept of the ""internet"" is such a vast topic that it leaves us with an abundance to explore. We just need to keep an eye on the clock. There are numerous forms of chat on the internet, such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. Many people are constantly on one of those platforms instead of conversing in person. We can eventually become antisocial due to the excessive time spent on the computer. Although, yes, you can communicate over the internet, it is essential to interact with people face - to - face. It's as if we become attached to the computer. Websites such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are also contributing factors. People become addicted and are constantly on them. @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5"" websites actually consume time that could be spent with friends. So, instead of having a chat via the computer screen, schedule a face - to - face meeting. Don't allow the computer to cause you to lose the social skills you've developed. I adore going outside each season to behold the beautiful nature that surrounds us. If you spend too much time on the computer, you won't have the time to enjoy it. There are so many things you'll be missing out on. Set aside some time from your day that you'd typically spend on the computer to take a stroll outside. The outdoors is far more beautiful than your computer screen, trust me. Once you gradually reduce your computer time, you'll realize all the other things that are more worthy of your time. So, the next time you contemplate surfing the web or playing that new computer game, I hope you consider the opinions I've presented to you. Excessive time on the computer causes us to get insufficient exercise, and we can become antisocial. We won't be able to enjoy the nature around us. Computer time is fine in moderation; you just need to be mindful of how much time you spend on it. Hopefully, my supported reasons have provided you with another perspective on web surfing."
1398	1402	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are both advantageous and disadvantageous. Computers enable us to play games and acquire knowledge about almost anything. However, computers cannot replicate the experience of fresh air and physical exercise. Computers allow people to engage in a wide range of games. People can play chess, solitaire, and a multitude of other similar games. Computers also enable us to play a vast variety of online games. I can think of at least three distinct websites that offer online games, with each site having at least @NUM1 different games! Hundreds of thousands of people play online games every day! What would they do if we didn't have computers to play those games? We can also conduct research on any topic from a computer anywhere. This is an extraordinary feat. Imagine if nobody had a computer; how would we amass so much of our knowledge? Yes, there are alternatives, but using a computer is significantly more efficient. Additionally, you can print materials on a computer, whereas with a book, you have to manually copy important information. However, you can highlight the important parts. How much can one achieve otherwise? No matter how much we use computers, it's evident that kids are becoming increasingly overweight because they spend long hours on them. Computers are remarkable, and society benefits from them substantially. But, like everything, computers have their drawbacks. So, please inform adults and kids about the benefits of computers, but also caution them about the adverse effects that could occur if they spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outdoors.
1399	1403	1	1	"Have you ever accessed the computer? Have you ever remained seated at the computer for an extended period?

1400	1404	1	1	Readers, envision a world devoid of computers. Communication would be severely hampered, schoolwork would become far more arduous, and we would lose a source that generates copious amounts of entertainment. Do you truly desire a world like that? The advantages of computers undoubtedly outweigh the disadvantages. For instance, computers significantly enhance global communication through means such as email, instant messaging, and video conferencing. Computers also simplify the learning process for school and enable you to work more efficiently. Lastly, computers transform the world into a much more engaging and entertaining place, thanks to platforms like YouTube, news websites, and online movies/tv shows. The impact of computers on society is undoubtedly positive. With a single click, a message can be sent anywhere in the world. How remarkable is that? Due to computers, people not only exchange emails but can also engage in live chats, whether through text or videos. Online communication has been an invaluable asset in my life and the lives of my peers. For example, whenever I forget my homework or have questions about schoolwork, I can reach out to my peers and receive assistance promptly. Not only can I seek help from others on my computer, but I can also stay connected with my friends and family. So, those who believe that computers cause us to spend less time with family and friends are mistaken. Computers connect the world and significantly advance communication in a positive manner. Apart from communication, computers also greatly improve education and learning in numerous ways. For example, they facilitate the rapid and effortless completion of projects and assignments, thanks to software like Microsoft Word. It has been proven that @NUM1 students who utilize computers for schoolwork find learning more accessible. Online encyclopedias such as [encyclopedia names] assist students worldwide with schoolwork or simply for the sake of learning at home. Another way computers enhance education is through online tutors and help sites, which ensure that you're essentially always within minutes of receiving guidance from a teacher. I can't fathom completing any assignment without the aid of a computer. Computers are not only practical for school and communication but also serve as an excellent means of entertainment. One source of entertainment on the computer is online movies and tv shows. Thanks to them, you can always stay updated with the latest episodes of your favorite shows. Online gaming also brings joy to people across the globe. You can spend hours playing in real - time with others in a detailed @NUM2 - @CAPS1 world! Computers also allow you to look back and laugh at historical videos on YouTube. Lastly, computers make it effortless to browse the latest news. You'll always be informed about what's happening in the world, thanks to your computer. So, whether you enjoy relaxing and watching videos, playing games, or keeping abreast of the news, you'll always find a way to have fun online! What's not to like? With such a positive impact on the world, computers are undoubtedly an amazing technology. You can communicate with friends or family online instantaneously, work on your school assignments, learn something new, or simply have a great time! We are grateful to you, computers, for making life better and much easier.
1401	1405	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have learned that some individuals dissent from the view that computers benefit our society. In this letter, I shall present three reasons elucidating how computers do indeed confer advantages upon our society. These reasons are as follows: 1) People have friends and family residing in other states; 2) some individuals utilize them to maintain organization; and 3) Computers facilitate enhanced learning. I trust that by the conclusion of this letter, you will recognize that computers do benefit our society. Firstly, I contend that computers benefit our society as they enable people to stay in contact with family and friends in other states. It is true that one could use the phone to call them, yet long - distance calls incur costs. Conversely, sending an email is cost - free. I can attest to this from personal experience, as I have friends and family in numerous states in the [LOCATION1]. ""Computers assist me in remaining in contact with my family across the globe."" [PERSON3] ([ORGANIZATION1]). Many people use the computer to connect with their loved ones daily. Some even rely on it to stay in touch with family members at war. Secondly, I believe that computers benefit society because they help people stay organized. Although this may not seem significant, many individuals employ computers to keep things in order. They know precisely where everything is. What would happen if we didn't have computers to manage all our appointments? Well, I shall tell you. All appointments would fall into disarray, and you might receive things you already possess. ""I organize my tasks on my computer."" [PERSON1]. Finally, I firmly believe that computers benefit our society as they aid people in learning more. It is true that not everyone uses computers for learning, but that does not imply they do not learn. Here are a few examples: 1) [CAPS6] - It allows you to learn song lyrics, dance moves, and more; 2) [CAPS8] - It enables you to learn what other people like, dislike, and so on. Then there is Facebook, which lets you see what people are doing on a given day. ""People learn a wealth of knowledge from the computer."" [CAPS9] [PERSON2]. Now, if you believe that computers do not benefit our society, that is your opinion. I hope you can now perceive what I see."
1402	1406	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, In my estimation, computers exert a beneficial influence on individuals as they enable people to communicate with one another, engage in learning, and predominantly, facilitate online shopping. Overall, I opine that computers have a positive impact on people. Remarkably, I finally had the opportunity to converse with my cousin from California. Communicating via computer is advantageous as it saves money since there is no need to pay a phone bill. Moreover, most companies utilize email for communication among co - workers. Dr. [DR1], a scientist, posits that co - workers who communicate via computer are actually safer as they do not have to travel anywhere and can remain at home. Presently, there are numerous social networking sites through which people can enhance their mental health and boost their self - esteem by interacting with others on a daily basis. Additionally, this form of communication is excellent as it obviates the need for travel, rendering the world more environmentally friendly. Astonishingly, there are over [I] information sites on the computer. One can also utilize programs on the computer to create graphs and tables for data presentation. Mrs. Can asserts that if you present information on the computer, such as using graphs, you will augment your knowledge by [PERCENT2]. Another remarkable aspect is that in order to learn, one does not have to read books, which conserves paper. Moreover, most databases containing information are free, allowing you to save money. Additionally, it takes only seconds to find the information you desire. On average, it takes [NUM1] seconds to locate information. Ultimately, the computer is an excellent resource for acquiring information and expanding one's knowledge. Shopping on the computer may seem implausible, but with today's technology, it is highly practical. Shopping online is advantageous as it saves time as there is no need to travel. Consumer Reports indicates that you can save [PERCENT1] of the product cost if you purchase online, as over [NUM2] stores offer online sales. With the current technology, you can compare prices of an item by simply clicking a button, eliminating the need to visit multiple stores. Online product reviews have become extremely popular as you can hear other people's opinions about the product. In conclusion, online shopping is excellent as it allows you to save money, compare prices, and access a plethora of great products. In summary, computers have been of great assistance to people as they enable online shopping, communication, and learning. Overall, computers have truly transformed the lives of most citizens.
1403	1407	1	1	Dear [CAPS1], Computers are an extraordinary invention! They empower you to undertake a multitude of diverse tasks. They exert a highly positive influence on people. Computers are involved in a wide array of activities, ranging from enhancing hand - eye coordination, facilitating learning about distant places and people, to enabling online communication with anyone. Embrace the wonderful world of computers. Computers have a profoundly positive impact on people. They aid in teaching hand - eye coordination. You can look at the screen without having to glance down at your hand while moving the mouse. You can precisely track its movement just by looking at the screen. This practice enhances everyday skills, such as those required in sports. If you can effectively coordinate your eyes and hands, you can proficiently hit a baseball or engage in other activities. Computers teach hand - eye coordination by enabling you to perform two tasks simultaneously. Would it not be remarkable if you could effortlessly find a recipe? Well, you can. A computer assists people in learning various things. It also simplifies the process of exploring different cultures, people, and places. Suppose you [CAPS2]. A computer provides you with the means to learn anything. Computers are integrated into our lives almost daily. They offer [CAPS3]. For instance, [CAPS4] is an excellent platform for communicating with people. You can engage in conversations with others by typing. Furthermore, there are sites like [CAPS5], [CAPS6], or [CAPS7] where you can have your own page and post your opinions. You can also view your friends' pages to see how they are doing. These sites afford people the opportunity to reconnect with old friends. Webcams have become a significant phenomenon! Sites like [SITE] or Skype allow you to see and talk to the other person. They make you feel as if the person you are communicating with is right there with you, even if they are far away. Computers benefit people across the globe. However, this does not mean... Computers help people physically by enabling them to acquire new knowledge and skills. Computers are not taking over; they are merely assisting people.
1404	1408	1	1	"Dear [ORGANIZATION1], [CAPS1] is replete with technology, with the computer being the most prominent innovation. I assert that computers have a predominantly positive influence on people. Some reasons include that computers cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow people with the ability to learn about distant places, and even enable online communication with others. Where would we be without computers? Firstly, computers are instrumental in teaching hand - eye coordination. Individuals who type at a slower pace typically exhibit poorer hand - eye coordination. Conversely, faster typers generally possess better hand - eye coordination. [PERCENT1] of people, including teachers, concur with this view. Is this the reason why [CAPS1] incorporates typing ""lessons"" in elementary school computer classes? The answer is most likely affirmative. Secondly, computers empower people to learn about distant places. They offer more resources than books. Navigating multiple websites on the computer is actually more convenient. By utilizing these websites, people can attain a higher level of education. One teacher remarked, ""Using websites is significantly easier for everyone. Assigning homework and having students take notes using them is far less arduous."" I wholeheartedly concur with this statement. Finally, computers enable people to communicate with others online. Through platforms such as [ORGANIZATION2], [CAPS2], [CAPS3] - mail, and video chat, among others, one has the opportunity to converse with friends living far away. This ensures that friendships are not easily lost. People are loath to lose relationships as it can be extremely distressing. I can attest to this from personal experience. In conclusion, this is why I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. From learning to chatting, computers are an excellent means of connecting with friends and even completing homework. Hand - eye coordination is also enhanced. All of these are positive effects, do you not agree? I certainly think so, which is why I believe that the positive effects of computers far outweigh the negative ones."
1405	1409	1	1	I am of the opinion that computers streamline everyday work. They enable individuals from distant locations to communicate with others they cannot meet in person, expedite work processes, and even allow one to obtain a college education without leaving home. Imagine having a relative living a considerable distance away, where making a phone call or traveling by air is prohibitively expensive. Computers enable us to communicate with them via email or video chat at no cost. Thanks to computers, staying in touch with far - flung family members is just a few clicks away. Completing work can sometimes seem like an onerous task. Computers, however, make work not only easier but also faster. Would you prefer to spend hours laboriously writing a term paper by hand or type it up and email it to your [recipient] in half the time? College students find that computers enable them to complete their work more efficiently than writing. Computers are an effective way to alleviate the burdens of work. Education is a fundamental necessity for all, but what if the college you wish to attend is too far from home and you cannot afford to relocate? Fortunately, online college courses are available. Without this technological resource, what would one do? Online courses allow eager students to pursue education without incurring excessive costs or leaving their children, if they are parents. Without computers, not everyone would be able to access the education they are entitled to. Computers have enabled us to communicate with family members living in places we cannot afford to visit. These technological devices have allowed us to complete our work in a timely manner and achieve the grades we deserve. Computers have enabled over [NUM1] citizens to obtain their education at home at an affordable price. Without this device, we would not be able to live the life we have today, a life that can lead us to where we need to be.
1406	1410	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, The utilization of computers is not advantageous to our society. I am apprehensive that numerous children will suffer from childhood obesity, attributable to the sedentary lifestyle of many teenagers of my age. They @CAPS1 could be relishing life outdoors and maintaining an active lifestyle, yet they opt to remain seated in front of a screen all day, every day. Researchers have established that inactivity is largely due to a multitude of Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter users. These websites are nothing but a source of trouble. Apart from being detrimental to health, teenagers across the globe are being cyberbullied to the brink of suicide. Many are unaware of the numerous pedophiles and creeps these sites harbor, which can lead to abduction, rape, or even worse. By staying active and spending time outdoors with friends, one can safeguard themselves from these perils. Go outside and engage in a bit of running; you will be astounded by how much a small amount of exercise can benefit you. Additionally, I firmly contend that time should be dedicated to one's family, participating in family activities and having dinner with parents. By doing so, one can foster closer family bonds and make healthier choices, including regular exercise. I believe that by adhering to these simple steps - staying active, abstaining from excessive computer use, and spending quality time with family - is far more beneficial than merely learning how to type or chatting with friends. The use of computers leads to cyberbullying and exposure to dangerous individuals, while living a healthy lifestyle is the ideal approach.
1407	1411	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1, what are your thoughts regarding computers? I am of the opinion that they are an excellent invention, and we are fortunate to possess them. However, they must be employed in moderation, as physical exercise and maintaining good health are paramount. I sincerely hope that you will share my viewpoints in your subsequent article to persuade readers of my perspective on computers. In my view, the most remarkable aspect of computers is their role as an outstanding learning resource. The internet has the capacity to connect people worldwide, enabling individuals to gain insights into diverse cultures. One can acquire comprehensive knowledge about a country without ever setting foot in it! Alternatively, one can utilize it to delve into their family's history. Many record - keeping systems are now transitioning to computerized platforms. During our field trip to @LOCATION1, they had databases containing the names of every individual who passed through there. Studies indicate that @NUM1 individuals find the internet user - friendly and more efficient than any other method. Another advantage of computers is their utility in the workplace. Suppose one has a job designing houses. In the past, one would have to manually draw the designs using a plethora of instruments and tools, but now, a single device - the computer - suffices. It is a much more efficient way to perform one's job and benefits customers as well. Previously, if they desired a different house design, one would have to redraw the entire plan. Now, all that is required is a minor adjustment on the computer, and the new design is ready in seconds. Nowadays, if not @PERCENT2, then @PERCENT1 of house designers utilize computers. Computers also play a significant social role. On the internet, one can connect and converse with friends. One can also share pictures of a baseball game on @DATE1 to preserve memories. Or, one can send a website featuring a hilarious video of someone being hit by a soccer ball. Experts conducted a study, which revealed that @NUM2 times, the primary reason teenagers access the internet is to connect with friends. ""@CAPS2 @PERSON1 (computer expert and developer), what do you believe is the primary reason teenagers use computers?"" @CAPS3, I would have to say it is to chat with friends. I see no reason why they wouldn't, as it is straightforward and almost instantaneous."" Computers represent a remarkable advancement in our technology. They assist us in our daily lives and simplify complex tasks. Nevertheless, they should not be overused, and one must maintain a healthy mind and body. All the knowledge we can glean from them supports this argument. To me, the computer is as significant a step forward as the light bulb. Computer usage has reached @PERCENT3 in @LOCATION2, and I am confident that they will become ubiquitous in all our homes. Some families find them @CAPS2 extremely useful and own more than one in their households. They come in various shapes and sizes to meet individual needs and can connect us to anything in the world."
1408	1412	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Readers, Some of you may assume that individuals overly rely on computers, resulting in insufficient outdoor activity and limited interaction with family or pets. You may also @MONTH1 believe that they are not getting enough exercise. Well, you are correct to an extent, but I am going to elucidate why your assumption is flawed. One can engage in activities such as learning, socializing, and even improving one's health. The first activity one can undertake is learning. While online, one can visit educational websites. Some of these websites can impart knowledge about distant places like @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, and numerous others. One can also learn about different people and their cultures. Take @CAPS3 @CAPS4, for instance; one can learn about their culture, the @CAPS5 they celebrate, and the reasons behind them. Additionally, one can enroll in online courses if facing difficulties in school. Another activity one can engage in on the computer is socializing. You might think or claim that being on the computer precludes social interaction with family and friends. However, this is not the case. There are websites like @CAPS6 and Facebook, where the primary activity is communicating with family and friends. Moreover, one can use webcams. When using a webcam, one can see the person they are conversing with, hear their voice, and be heard through the microphone on the webcam. Lastly, one can join chatrooms like @CAPS7 (AOL Instant Messenger) and interact with people on the site. The final activity one can engage in is improving one's health. Isn't it astonishing? Indeed, one can access websites that provide day - by - day guidance on proper nutrition and exercise. Websites like @PERSON1 esang.com can offer a customized eating schedule. After consulting such websites, one can go out and acquire the necessary items. Another benefit the computer offers is the enhancement of hand - eye coordination. While looking at the screen, one's hand controls the ""mouse,"" which in turn determines one's navigation on the World Wide Web. Lastly, after visiting websites showcasing the world's landscapes and gardens, one will eventually be inclined to go outside. Hopefully, you now concur with me that computers can indeed be beneficial in various aspects of life. I have demonstrated what one can learn, how to communicate and socialize, and how they can contribute to one's well - being."
1409	1413	1	1	Computers have undoubtedly had a profound impact on society, transforming the world. People's lives are now characterized by greater intelligence, speed, and convenience. Individuals residing on opposite sides of the globe can communicate instantaneously and at no cost. However, what implications does this have for people? Something of such magnitude and with such a long - standing history may not be beneficial for everyone. I believe this to be true for some individuals. To begin with, some people become overly obsessed with computers. When faced with life's challenges, they @MONTH1 seek the solitude and privacy of the unfiltered and boundless internet. Even when using a computer to chat with others, it can never fully substitute for face - to - face interaction. In fact, studies have shown that non - personal forms of communication, such as text messaging, email, or chat rooms, can severely restrict one's ability to connect with others. Please do not misunderstand me. I do utilize platforms like Facebook to communicate with people. I do not consider online communication to be inherently bad. I believe it is an excellent means of staying in touch with individuals one cannot meet in person. Moreover, it is a good way to support friends and be there for them. However, it should be done in moderation. Obtaining information from the computer is a highly debatable topic. Some may argue that informing people is a positive development, with which I concur. Others may contend that excessive knowledge can inflate our egos to the point of ignorance. I also agree with this view. I would further assert that while acquiring knowledge is beneficial, one should exercise caution to avoid over - information. One area where I find computers to be exceptional is in fostering originality. In a world that often suppresses creativity, I perceive computers as having an artistic dimension. In a sense, they have personally assisted me in discovering my preferences in music, art, and various creations. I can also share my works so that others can view, listen to, or experience them. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a valuable tool when used in moderation. For those who are overly obsessed, it can pose problems. Nevertheless, I think they are a wonderful addition to society.
1410	1414	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, An increasing number of people are using computers, yet not everyone concurs that this is beneficial to society. I advocate for technological advancements and firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people. Computers endow individuals with the ability to learn about distant places and people, enable online communication, and offer games that can aid in academic work. Do you believe that computers empower people to learn about far - off individuals and locations? One can use Google.com to explore different cultures and discern how their practices differ from ours and the types of cuisine they consume. For example, in @LOCATION1, people sit on the floor @CAPS2 while eating, whereas we have the privilege of sitting at a table in our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION1 prefer to sit on the floor. Undoubtedly, computers allow you to @CAPS2 communicate with my cousin via the computer. It is also @CAPS3 crucial to note that computers offer games that can facilitate academic progress. One can visit websites tailored to one's @CAPS4. These sites can illustrate how the human body functions for @CAPS5 and provide insights into the Revolutionary War for @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These sites are far from dull; they are incredibly engaging! Who would have thought that learning could be enjoyable? I certainly didn't. The time has come! Some may argue that people are spending excessive time on computers and insufficient time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. However, regardless of the circumstances, people will always find time for these essential activities.
1411	1415	1	1	Dear Computer Experts, contemplate this: A family of four is ensconced in a diminutive, dim room, neither conversing nor laughing, merely languidly seated in their chairs, hunched and dispirited. They are not engaging with any of their friends and are essentially idle. They sit there like inert masses. This would transpire if we proscribed computers! Computers undoubtedly have a positive impact on people as they furnish a continuous stream of knowledge, cultivate good hand - eye coordination, and enable users to communicate with others. Evidently, they are a beneficial addition to our world. To commence, computers offer a constant stream of knowledge. My close acquaintance, @PERSON1, recently informed me that she is sometimes at home, engrossed in her homework, and in need of looking up something. She simply seizes her computer, and the information is delivered with a click of a button. If she did not have a computer, she would never acquire such knowledge. Second, in a survey of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of total computer usage is dedicated to looking up information and gaining knowledge. This statistic indicates that computers definitely assist users when seeking information. Also, a recent @ORGANIZATION3 article on computer usage posits that if people did not have computers, half of the world’s discoveries would not exist today. One can discern that the quantity of knowledge that computers provide is highly significant! Next, using computers also develops hand - eye coordination. Children’s specialist @PERSON3 asserts, “Children need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged on the computer. They build remarkable hand - eye coordination and aid in numerous aspects, including @ORGANIZATION1 and sports.” If there were no computers, this hand - eye coordination could never be developed! Also, at @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, they restricted computer use, and as a consequence, the sports teams there all had losing records. Could this be due to the lack of hand - eye coordination of those students? Additionally, at @ORGANIZATION1, after a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 students who play video games on their computers perform better in gym class because of the enhanced hand - eye coordination. Clearly, computers significantly develop hand - eye coordination. Lastly, using a computer allows people to communicate with each other via email and other social networks. After a poll from www.@CAPS6.com, we have found that millions of users utilize the computer and @CAPS6 to communicate daily. We would not want to deprive them of this, would we? Secondly, a friend of mine, @PERSON2, who attends @ORGANIZATION4, states that the primary means by which she communicates with her friends and makes plans with them is through the computer. If she did not have one, none of this could be accomplished. Furthermore, a recent article by @PERSON4, a teen specialist at @ORGANIZATION5, claims that when people do not have computers and cannot communicate or interact with the outside world, they are more susceptible to diseases and ailments such as depression or anorexia. When they do not converse as much with their friends, these maladies are more likely to occur. This definitely shows that communicating with computers is very important. Now, contemplate this. The same family as before is sitting in a bright, sunny room with their computer screens flashing merrily. One of the boys exclaims, “Hey, look at this!” and the rest of his family rushes to his side. Their faces aglow with this @ORGANIZATION3 information. You can perceive that computers have a positive effect on people because they bring @ORGANIZATION3 information, they develop hand - eye coordination, and they allow you to communicate with others. So, computer specialists, what are you waiting for? Go to your computers right now and learn some @ORGANIZATION3 things!
1412	1416	1	1	The advancements of technology have progressed to such an extent that it has become commonly recognized as a staple in normal households. We utilize it daily at work, home, schools, and businesses; it has become a frequently used item in everyday life. Emails, research, and inquiries about the world around us all rely on it. It is required in almost every job application, at school, and in every aspect in between. It's the - @DATE1 - digital age. Computers are an everyday necessity, like email, which is something I no longer worry about, and they are also used to file tax returns. Moreover, they are employed to generate reports for individuals. Computers have also become a common fixture in schools, where we use them for reports, studies, and some homework. Additionally, businesses use them to communicate with corporate entities. @LOCATION1 employs a wide range of technologies; they recently acquired a large number of Apple products. Finally, computers are mandatory in most jobs. I am going to list a few: state institutions, schools, military defense, jobs involving missiles, and their satellite communication systems. All communications, including cell phones and those on airplanes, would shut down. If it were like the Twin Towers attack, tracking trucks and their movements, and the rest of the information I know about computers is classified. This is why computers are essential in this society for daily use, as they are commonly used and required.
1413	1417	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, technology has witnessed remarkable advancements in the past few years. Computers have now become ubiquitous in almost every business and household in @LOCATION1! Everyone perceives computers as wonderful and believes they can only have a positive impact. However, do they truly consider both sides? Most likely not. That is precisely why I am here. Computers discourage physical activity, reduce the time spent bonding with family, and are a waste of money and space. I firmly believe that computers should be re - evaluated, and people should cease relying on them so excessively. Which country has over @NUM1 million fast - food restaurants currently in operation? Name the fattest country in the world. Who spends the most on unhealthy food? The answer to all of these questions is the @LOCATION2. With over @PERCENT1 of the population being obese, a change is urgently needed. According to studies conducted by the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS2), @PERCENT2 of people spend over @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. Among those @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are overweight or obese. The pattern is evident. Exercising strengthens muscles, improves lung function, and helps burn unnecessary calories. People definitely need to step away from the computer and engage in more physical activity. They might even enjoy it. Spending quality time with family can be incredibly rewarding, as I recently discovered. Playing outdoor team games brings out one's competitive spirit, while board games stimulate the mind. “Children who spend time with their family are @PERCENT4 more likely to excel in school,” @CAPS4 @PERSON2 remarks. So, what is holding them back? Computers. Kids now find various online sites more enticing than hanging out with family and friends. We need to turn off the computers, bring out the board games, and keep families united! “In this economic climate, people cannot afford to squander money they do not have,” @CAPS4 economist @PERSON1 asserts. And she is absolutely correct! But what are @PERCENT5 of @CAPS6 wasting money on? You guessed it: computers. The average monthly bill is @MONEY2. In a whole year, you are paying @MONEY1 for something you do not need! Computers also waste space. In addition to needing a place to house the monitor, you have to find room to accommodate a printer, the hard drive, and all those cables. Who can find sufficient space? I certainly cannot. Although technology, particularly computers, can be a wonderful asset, we need to consider the drawbacks. @CAPS6 continue to gain weight, families disintegrate, and the economy suffers, all because of computers. We need to address these issues and turn off the computers.
1414	1418	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I am writing to you on @DATE1 because I firmly believe that computers have a detrimental effect on people. I assert this because when you spend excessive time on the internet, you do not engage in sufficient physical activity. Moreover, your academic performance will suffer! That is indeed a concerning matter. Additionally, when using a computer, you may encounter some truly strange individuals. I sincerely hope you will listen to my account. “Go outside!” “Mom, I'm on the computer!” “If you spend too much time on the computer, you need to get some exercise. If you do not exercise, you will not be healthy! You need to exercise. Otherwise, you will become obese, and you surely do not want that!” For instance, in gym class, you should strive to be healthy so that you can and will achieve a good grade. Do you desire poor grades? That sums up the situation. Did you receive an @CAPS2 on your report card? When you invest a significant amount of time on a computer, you will become addicted. Once you become addicted, you will neglect your homework, and your grades will decline. You will obtain poor grades in school, and there is a possibility that you will have to repeat a grade. Moreover, your parents will be extremely disappointed. This is one of the reasons why computers have a negative impact on people! When you use the computer, you have no idea who you are communicating with unless they are your friends. There have been numerous cases where children have been abducted due to Facebook and MySpace. If your child accesses those websites, they are constantly at risk! There are cyber - threats, and they could obtain information about you, including your address. For example, there was a case on MySpace where a girl thought she was talking to a @NUM1 - year - old boy, but she was actually conversing with a @NUM2 - something - year - old man. Then the girl went missing for several weeks. This clearly demonstrates that you can never trust a computer. When you take a close look at computers, you will realize that they are not as beneficial as they seem. All the reasons I mentioned earlier indicate that you will not get the amount of exercise you should. Your grades will plummet if you remain on the computer, and it can deceive you. So, even though you can communicate with your friends, it is simply not worth it.
1415	1419	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have compelling reasons to believe that computers and other similar modern technologies are fragmenting the world as we once knew it. Technologies such as computers are a primary cause of @CAPS3 individuals lacking physical exercise, interacting less with family and friends, and potentially posing a threat to one's mental health. The leading cause of obesity and an alarmingly high number of overweight people in @LOCATION1 is the fact that people spend an excessive amount of time on computers and neglect physical activity. I recently discovered that in the @DATE1's, the average family had one computer (sometimes none). Nowadays, the average family has up to @NUM1, @NUM2, or even more! Furthermore, the percentage of obese individuals has soared since then because people are almost constantly on the computer instead of exercising as they should. A significant way in which modern technology has harmed our nation is the profound lack of communication and interaction within families. Families are arguing more frequently, and spouses are getting divorced because they rarely have time to spend together. Studies have shown that nowadays, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 marriages end in divorce, whereas in @DATE2, it was @NUM3 out of @NUM6. Technological advancements have increased astonishingly since then, and people are constantly on the computer, phones, or other @CAPS4 devices, which is tearing families apart everywhere. When impressionable children are in the process of growing and expanding their minds, all they do is sit on the computer and do not receive the mental stimulation they require. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Now, parents should consider that if they want their children to succeed or exceed expectations in life, they should not allow them to sit on the computer all day filling their heads with nonsense. Now, computers do have the potential to be educationally useful, but do children use them in that manner? The answer is no, and “@PERCENT1 of the time, neither do adults,” states @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1. I hope you can concur that computers are causing more harm than good in families worldwide. People are not getting the necessary amount of exercise, are not interacting sufficiently with their families, and these computers can be harmful to the mental health of future generations. If families can reduce the amount of computer - related activities, I believe parents around the world can take better care of their children's well - being.
1416	1420	1	1	How do computers impact people? Undoubtedly, there are ways in which computers can be extremely detrimental and highly beneficial. They are advantageous because individuals who dislike writing typically utilize a computer for typing. However, people rarely do so. Parents and children remain on the computer, disregarding everything else except the screen. The children stay up all night, aware that they have school, yet they don't even complete their homework. I have evidence; my friends, research, and my mother concur. I propose that you will align with my viewpoint. A significant percentage of my friends agree with me as they have experienced this, and they struggle to wake up for school. Dr. [PERSON1] of [ORGANIZATION1] conducted research on how parents scarcely spend time with their families. For instance, fathers are essentially always on the computer, either working or searching for information. My mother states that when she was younger, she adored the internet and never wanted to log off. I hope you have appreciated my perspective. Thank you for taking the time to read it. Thank you again.
1417	1421	1	1	Dear [CAPS1], what is your stance on computers? Are they beneficial or detrimental? Computers have not been in existence for an extended period, yet it is controversial whether they have a positive or negative impact. Indeed, they assist people in researching specific topics, but they are also perilous. I believe that computers are not a necessity for individuals. Computers are superfluous because people allocate an excessive amount of time to them. Subsequently, we begin to neglect exercise, and they become harmful to everyone. Firstly, computers are not a necessity as people squander an inordinate amount of time on them. Once you have been on a computer for over an hour to an hour and a half, the computer will commence to affect you negatively. For one, your eyes will start to ache. If you remain on for longer, you will begin to experience a headache. Soon, your headache will intensify to the point where you cannot tolerate it. It will throb and feel as if it is on fire. This occurs because your brain cannot simultaneously process the brightness of the computer and what you are reading or viewing. Most of the time, this eventually leads you to seclude yourself in a dark room to rest. Sometimes, you don't log off until you also have a stomachache. After you log off and feel better, you return to repeat the cycle. This is why computers are an impediment to us. Secondly, people start to forgo exercise. After spending so much time on the computer, all they have time for is to eat, sleep, and go to work or school. Computers have deprived everyone of the outdoors. They don't want to venture outside, exercise, and play. Living under such conditions can only result in one thing: obesity. Soon, you will become overweight. Life will become arduous. And being overweight also has a negative impact. For one, you cannot run for an extended period, you become feeble, and for children, you stop growing. But the worst part is that you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy. So, you see, computers are a nuisance to our society. Finally, computers are hazardous to the environment. There are [NUM1] billion people in the world. At any given time, approximately [NUM2] billion are using some form of electronic device. When you are on a computer, have you ever noticed the hot air emanating from the fan? Now, have you ever considered where this heat goes? Well, it creates holes in the ozone layer and causes global warming. The ozone layer is the sole barrier preventing the sun's ultraviolet rays from scorching us. Now, if every time someone turns on a computer, a portion of the ozone layer disappears, and [NUM2] billion people are using them, that would mean a significant amount of the ozone layer would vanish from our atmosphere. Now, think about global warming. If the ozone layer is like a bubble, the heat is trapped inside. So, this heat will eventually heat up the earth. This will cause the [CAPS3] to melt, and then the sea level will rise. The [CAPS3] contains enough water to flood the earth. Do you really want that? Eventually, we would drown, and life would cease to exist. As you can see, computers are a nuisance. They captivate young children and adults. They can be helpful, but they are more harmful. Sometimes, we don't even realize this. Computers are bad because people spend an excessive amount of time on them, people neglect exercise, and they are harmful to us.
1418	1422	1	1	People frequently assert that computers and technology are detrimental, yet I contend that they have significantly benefited our society. Computers aid people in surmounting difficulties. They simplify our lives. For instance, when making purchases, computers handle the calculations. They assist people in determining directions, and most importantly, they facilitate communication between friends and family. Without computers, we would have to endure longer queues when buying goods. Consider Stop & Shop; they employ computers for checkout, and the lines are already lengthy. Without computers, the lines would be even longer as people would have to calculate the costs manually. Additionally, without computers, weighing groceries would be a time-consuming process as we would have to do it by hand. Without computers, grocery shopping days would be interminable. Without computers, we would lack [CAPS1] and online mapping services that provide directions. We would have to rely on large paper maps when driving, which can easily get lost. You might lose your place on the map, and sometimes you might mark the wrong locations. With computers, you can access [CAPS1], which offers the fastest and easiest routes to your destination. Moreover, using computers conserves paper and reduces deforestation. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you want to visit a family member out of state but lack the funds? Many people have been in this predicament. Now, instead of squandering money they don't have, they can engage in video chats, communicate, view photos, and stay updated with their loved ones on the computer. It is cost - free as there are social networking sites. People utilize these sites to maintain contact with family and friends, and they require a computer. Without computers, you would have to travel by car, wasting money and polluting the air. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have greatly contributed to the betterment of our society.
1419	1423	1	1	Dear [CAPS1], I am convinced that computers confer benefits upon the people of today. The invention of the computer has enabled people to transmit messages and information to one another, assisted students in their academic pursuits, and provided children with activities when they are unable to venture outdoors. Allow me to elaborate. The computer has established a more efficient means for people to exchange messages and information. Prior to the advent of the computer, the only methods of disseminating information were through mail or phone. The computer has expedited this process. In fact, people receive information about [PERCENT1] more rapidly with the computer. I once managed to send an email to my friend regarding the homework more swiftly than if I had written a letter. Evidently, computers have streamlined communication among people. Additionally, computers support students in their schoolwork. Before the computer, students had to use a typewriter to compose their papers. When using a typewriter, if they made a mistake, which was often, they had to start from scratch. The situation is entirely different now. In fact, a study conducted by the board of education reveals that students write papers more rapidly and proficiently with a computer compared to a typewriter. I recall my grandfather recounting how he typed papers. It took him approximately an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, whereas the maximum time it took him on a computer was half an hour. As you can see, computers have benefited students across the board. Lastly, computers offer children activities when they are unable to enjoy the outdoors. Many people assume that kids would use their computers when they could be outside. A study by the [CAPS2] - obesity research indicates that [PERCENT2] of kids prefer to be outside playing and exercising rather than being indoors on their computers. However, during certain weather conditions, kids are unable to go outside, so they may entertain themselves indoors. A study by [ORGANIZATION1] shows that only [PERCENT3] of kids use their computers when they cannot be outside. If these kids suddenly lost their computer privileges, many would have limited means of entertainment. Clearly, the computer fills the time of kids who are unable to go outside. In conclusion, the computer has substantial benefits for society. It enables people to send messages and information more quickly, helps students with their studies, and provides children with activities when they cannot be outside. I hope this letter has persuaded you of the advantages of computers.
1420	1424	1	1	Dear Newspaper [CAPS1], it has come to my attention that there has been a substantial increase in the number of individuals utilizing computers in society. While the use of computers can have positive impacts on people, excessive use is not advisable. This is the reason why I wish to inform everyone about the negative effects of computers on individuals. We are all aware that computers assist people in various aspects. They can facilitate business operations, enable interaction with family and friends, and can even be used for entertainment purposes. Some negative effects that some individuals may be unaware of or choose to ignore include the fact that computers can prevent people from engaging in physical exercise and exploring nature. Moreover, excessive computer use can lead to addiction as people may spend an inordinate amount of time on their devices. There should be a way to inform the public about this issue and raise awareness. Therefore, I propose that we attempt to integrate what people enjoy doing on computers with activities that they should engage in more frequently, such as exercise. Perhaps we could encourage people to use their computers to contact friends and family and make plans to engage in outdoor activities and exercise, thereby preventing them from being confined to their computers all day. We all recognize that computers can have both positive and negative aspects. They enhance hand - eye coordination, provide individuals with the opportunity to learn about different places and people around the world, and offer numerous other benefits. However, they also have negative effects, but this does not imply that we should deprive people of their use. Similarly, one should not spend the entire day outdoors. Hence, I believe that there should be a limit on the number of hours people spend on computers each day. In this way, people can fulfill their desires while also taking breaks from computer use. Evidently, action should be taken to address this computer - related concern. I hope that my well - considered thoughts and ideas have convinced you, and I trust that they will inspire you to come up with an idea that will bring about a beneficial change in society.
1421	1425	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers have been in existence for some time, and removing them would be tantamount to disregarding all the technological progress we have achieved. In fact, computers are ubiquitous; seven out of ten families on my street possess at least one computer in their households. So, why would we desire to eliminate them? Computers are highly useful. They are not only entertaining but also extremely resourceful. Anyone with a query can effortlessly access a computer, conduct research on google.com, and discover what they are seeking within minutes. I recall when I had an oddly - looking cut on my arm, and my mother needed to learn how to heal a wound. She conducted research and found out how to make the mark disappear. The computer only benefits you in every way. You might be staying at a place in two weeks and realize they don't have a pool! Lastly, without computers, we would have no means of communicating with new or different people. Computers are excellent for communication. People can communicate via Twitter, @CAPS2, and even YouTube. These sites all assist people in making new friends online, almost like pen - pals on the internet. Also, if the majority of your family resides in @LOCATION1 and you are stuck in @CAPS3, you can easily converse with them through email or an instant messenger. Hopefully, you now have a better comprehension of how much of a lifesaver the computer is. Maybe you could even make next @STATE1 about how resourceful, beneficial, and social computers are!
1422	1426	1	1	To whom it may concern, The @NUM1's were the commencement of a new era; computers had just emerged and were captivating people with their intelligence. However, currently, an increasing number of individuals believe it is a waste of time. I, for one, do not concur with this view. In these times, you will witness my opinion materialize for the following reasons: it is an information haven that allows artists to expand their craft, and engineers are now capable of planning buildings and bridges on their @CAPS1. Thanks to the internet, students and people are acquiring knowledge daily. The internet is essential for people writing an essay. In fact, the superintendent of schools in @LOCATION1 has stated that over @PERCENT1 of students will utilize the internet to aid them in writing an essay. Moreover, we no longer need to visit the library anywhere to conduct research because we have a vast library of information at our homes (the computer). Another aspect is that people can now communicate globally, enabling us to learn about other cultures directly from the source. Artists can now engage in activities, and a new art form of video games has emerged. Do you, as an artist, like to express yourself? Music mixing has become my passion, and it is facilitated over the internet. One can sometimes add additional elements and omit other tracks. They no longer have to use a typewriter; they can simply access the computer and type on a keyboard. You can use spell - check and edit or undo instead of discarding ideas you dislike. Artists have been empowered by computers. Lastly, engineers are now able to plan how a building or bridge might look (which also aids in video game making). @CAPS2 can design their dream house. When you plan buildings and bridges on a computer, you can analyze which makes them stronger before commencing construction. With the new software available today, you can determine how certain structures will fare under natural disasters so that you can select the one with the ability to withstand them. I hope you can see from my perspective and concur that computers are truly amazing; they provide access to information and offer assistance.
1423	1427	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, are you aware that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade access the computer each night to complete homework and connect with friends and family? I contend that the effects computers have on people are advantageous for all users. A computer can be employed for communication, education, and for rapidly accessing crucial information, such as local news. Now, allow me to elucidate why computers are beneficial for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a close friend, and I was an integral part of his life. Regrettably, he had to relocate. However, I still desired to maintain our friendship and communicate with him occasionally. A convenient method to achieve this was by using a computer. The computer enables you to easily contact an old friend to stay in touch. Different forms of communication on the computer include e - mail, instant - messaging, video chat, online chat groups, etc. This helps people remain connected. That is why I believe communication is the most significant effect of computer usage. Nevertheless, a computer can also be utilized for learning. At school or work, both children and adults require access to accurate information regarding research projects, vacation destinations, knowledge about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes complex subjects like scientific chemicals. For instance, when my class conducted research on different aspects of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our primary source of information was the internet on our computers. We investigated the customs, the foods, the dressing styles, the traditional holidays, and their forms of entertainment. Additionally, kids return home from school, upload their essays, and continue typing. This teaches them hand - eye coordination and how to type. The computer is not solely used for communication. It is an excellent means of educating everyone, and the internet can be employed to disseminate important local and global information. ""Both children and adults frequently check their e - mail and homepage daily for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy,"" says expert @PERSON1. I believe that the internet provides citizens with a swift and effortless way to access information about what is happening in our town, state, country, and the world. For example, it can inform us about the series of shootings occurring throughout @LOCATION1 or the numerous house robberies in our town. We, @CAPS7 citizens, wish to be informed about everything to stay safe and updated. Another example is that I logged on to the computer three days ago, and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. There are numerous benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and stay abreast of the latest local and global news. I believe you should consider my ideas and publish them for everyone."
1424	1428	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I opine that computers do confer benefits upon society as they are capable of performing numerous functions, such as providing education. Computers are highly helpful nowadays; almost everything is accomplished using them. The computer imparts good hand - eye coordination, the ability to focus, and exposes you to knowledge you previously lacked. Without a computer, you can scarcely achieve or prepare anything. A computer can be useful for a plethora of tasks, such as job applications, tax - related matters, or at a grocery store register. Typing and using the computer constitute a form of exercise, albeit not for the body. When using a computer, you exercise your hands and your brain. Without computers, you can hardly do anything. Most of the activities in life are associated with some type of computer. I believe that those who claim people should not use computers are incorrect because computers enable people to interact with their distant family members who are also using them. You can enjoy nature by simply taking a look; you don't have to venture outside. That is why I believe computers are positive and helpful.
1425	1429	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on people. Three reasons why I hold this view are that you have the capacity to converse with your friends and family, interact with people around the world, and even shop online. The lack of contact with your loved ones is disheartening because if you wish to communicate with them, you can email them to inquire about their well - being. Through email, you can send messages to your friends anywhere in the world. For example, if you have a friend in @LOCATION1 and you want to know if he is doing @CAPS2, you can send him a message. Communicating with people on the web is truly enjoyable as you can see what others are doing and even play games with them. If you are on Facebook or MySpace, you can add people as your friends. Shopping online is more efficient than shopping at a physical store. The problem with physical shopping is that if you are shopping for clothes and there's a crowd, you'll start to feel frustrated. That's why online shopping exists so that we can avoid such hassles. In conclusion, the computer is a very useful tool. You can talk to your relatives from @LOCATION2 and engage in shopping without having to wait in line. People can communicate with others around the world.
1426	1430	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I pose to you a question: do you perceive computers as having a positive or negative influence on individuals? In my perspective, I firmly assert that computers exert negative impacts on us. This is due to the fact that we engage in less physical activity, have diminished opportunities to appreciate nature, and experience reduced interaction with family and friends. If one spends the majority of their time at home in front of the computer, how can they engage in exercise? They cannot, as they would be perpetually seated at the desktop. This also presents a problem, as it is through such a sedentary lifestyle that obesity can arise, with individuals simply sitting throughout the day. Moreover, individuals with heart conditions who require exercise may experience a worsening of their condition due to being distracted by the computer. Remaining at home using the computer precludes one from enjoying nature. Instead of venturing outdoors in pleasant weather to have fun, people choose to stay at home. This is detrimental, as they should be outside enjoying themselves rather than being glued to the computer all day. Failing to spend time with family and friends is unacceptable when one is engrossed in the computer. This is because one is supposed to keep family and friends company rather than being absorbed in what they are doing on the computer. Additionally, one may miss family gatherings or leave friends feeling lonely. This is because one is too preoccupied with the computer and fails to pay attention to those around them. This is precisely why I believe computers have a negative effect on people, attributable to less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and reduced interaction with family and friends.
1427	1431	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, technology is an ever - evolving phenomenon, and an increasing number of individuals are availing themselves of it. As more people utilize computers, the greater the technological benefits our society will reap. Through the utilization of computers, individuals will be trained in hand - eye coordination, gain the ability to acquire knowledge about distant locations, and also be enabled to communicate online with others. By using computers, people will be instructed in hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is an effective skill to master, and the advantages of this proficiency would be remarkable. Possessing excellent coordination would imply that an individual would outperform anyone who does not use computers. Advanced coordination would mean that the individual would be capable of achieving more tasks, such as rapid typing. Ultimately, superior hand - eye coordination indicates that the individual will be more likely to secure a job in a field that demands good coordination.
1428	1432	1	1	The @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper has recently discovered that a significant debate is underway, arguing that computers are not benefiting society. On the other hand, those who support technological advancements believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Well, the @ORGANIZATION1 had to take a stance, and they have chosen the side that computers have a positive effect on people. Do you know why we selected this side? There are three reasons why computers are advantageous. Firstly, they educate people about distant places and individuals. Secondly, computers serve as an excellent source of entertainment. Lastly, computers provide a great platform for communication. Once the @ORGANIZATION1 has elaborated on why these three reasons are valid, the pro - computer side will prevail in this debate! The first reason: do you enjoy spending time rummaging through the library in search of information about places or people? If you have a computer, you need not endure such a hassle. All you have to do is access the search function and enter the name of the person or place, and within less than a minute, you will obtain information that would take hours to find in a library. I can attest to this, as I once spent hours looking for a book about the @CAPS2 calendars but had to resort to a computer to obtain the information. The second reason is that computers are an outstanding source of entertainment. If you are bored and have a computer at your disposal, you can effortlessly access it and play numerous engaging games such as @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Dragonwars, or any other enjoyable game you can find on a computer. With such a vast array of games to choose from, you will never grow bored. The third reason is that the computer offers a fun way to communicate with friends or family. There are numerous platforms available for you to select from to converse with friends or family, such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6, or even @ORGANIZATION2. Additionally, did you know that you can send videos or pictures to friends or family? So, log on to a computer and chat with your friends, and even share a picture or something with them. In conclusion, I hope you take my words to heart and adopt the stance that the newspaper has taken.
1429	1433	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I contend that the effects of computers on people are such that some individuals become highly addicted to them. This is because some people spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer, engaging in unproductive activities and squandering their money on unnecessary purchases. I also believe that computers impact people in the sense that they reduce the time people spend with their families. The influence of computers on people is such that some individuals are unable to cease using them, even if they desire to. People become extremely addicted to computers as they spend nearly all their time on them. People no longer engage in physical exercise because they are preoccupied with shopping for things they do not need on the computer; they simply buy items because they like them. Another effect of computers on people is that some individuals solely focus on chatting with their friends on social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and other websites that may not be beneficial for them. I believe that computers deprive people of their time because some individuals spend excessive time on computers, leaving their families neglected and without quality time together. Computers consume people's time as they do not spend time exercising, playing outdoors with friends or siblings, visiting a park with their family, or having social interactions with family and friends. Instead, they remain on the computer all day, achieving nothing. Computers detract from the time and affection one should devote to their family and cause one to use time that they do not have to spare. The effects of computers on people are negative because some individuals are unable to stop using them, even if they wish to, as they are already addicted. People cannot stop using computers because they can perform a multitude of tasks on them, such as shopping, chatting with friends, and visiting websites featuring interesting things from other countries. However, some people cannot refrain from using them because they are addicted to playing games or downloading music from unauthorized websites. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the effects of computers on people are extremely negative because some individuals spend an excessive amount of time on them, even using time that they cannot afford to lose. I also think that computers affect people by reducing the time they spend sharing positive experiences with their families. The effects of computers are such that people cannot stop using them due to addiction.
1430	1434	1	1	Did you know that @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 residents use their computers extremely frequently? Nowadays, few people are without a computer, and at times, it can be challenging to disengage from it. I believe that most people can exercise self - control. Nevertheless, I am convinced that computers are highly important and have a positive impact on people. I utilize the computer to communicate with friends and family, to assist with my homework, and I still maintain an active lifestyle. Although I spend a considerable amount of @LOCATION1 time on the computer, I remain a very active individual. I take dance lessons twice a week and, whenever possible, I ride my bike, play outdoors, or run on the treadmill. I would describe myself as a very healthy person. It may seem as though I am on the computer a great deal, but in reality, I have valid reasons. Moreover, many of my friends use the computer, and some of them from @LOCATION1 are even more active than I am. Most people spend a significant amount of time on the computer yet remain healthy and engaged in other activities. I definitely interact with my family quite extensively. In a family setting, it is somewhat difficult not to. Additionally, I make the most of every opportunity to hang out with my friends. I interact a great deal, and the computer allows me to communicate with them when they are not nearby. The majority of my extended family resides in @LOCATION1. The computer enables me to communicate with them and even exchange digital pictures. There have been instances when my friends and I were too busy to meet up or when it was snowing and my parents were unable to drive. Nevertheless, we were still able to have a pleasant conversation. Some people are required to use the computer throughout the day. My mother manages the accounts and handles numerous tasks for a company. She spends a substantial amount of time on the computer, regardless of her personal preference. This is often unavoidable. Teachers also use the computer to aid in teaching classes and preparing teaching materials. Consequently, I use it for my homework. I may need to check my assignments, conduct research on a topic, or seek assistance. I firmly believe that the computer is an indispensable and irreplaceable piece of technology. I am confident that you will now concur that computers are helpful rather than harmful. As long as one gets an adequate amount of fresh air and engages in family interaction, computers have a very positive effect on people's lives.
1431	1435	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, a recent survey indicated that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 medical practitioners believe the advancements we have achieved with technology and computers are beneficial rather than detrimental. I concur that computers are exerting a positive influence on us. Technological advancements are enabling us to become more efficient. Computers also endow us with the capacity to explore places and things we @MONTH1 would never have the opportunity to witness in person. Additionally, we are able to engage in online conversations with individuals we might not have otherwise encountered. However, the most significant aspect is our technological progress. Recently, on the news, I witnessed a segment about how @ORGANIZATION2 is utilizing robots to enhance the efficiency of surgery. This also implies that smaller incisions are being made, resulting in a swifter recovery. Another area of society that has been progressing is crime - solving. Prior to the advent of computers, there was no blood testing, no fingerprinting, and most likely no X - rays. Computers have rendered these tasks far more manageable for people. Computers are also valuable in providing us with the ability to research distant locations or other topics that they @MONTH1 merely possess. Some individuals @MONTH1 never have the chance to visit places like @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION3, but with computers, it is as if they have been there. Or perhaps one is interested in @CAPS1, but @CAPS1 is not a very popular sport in @LOCATION2. Then they access their computer and discover that there is a rugby event in @LOCATION1. Thus, their problem is resolved. When you travel to a new country, you also get the opportunity to meet new people. But with computers and online platforms like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, you can communicate with virtually anyone in the world. I could be sitting in a chair at my residence in @LOCATION2, having a conversation with someone across the country, or perhaps even across the ocean! Or possibly you could be chatting with some of your close friends who live just across town. In either case, the computer is a convenient medium for communicating with others. I am of the opinion that computers are doing us more good than harm. Our technological advancements have significantly assisted us in areas such as gaming and robotic surgery. They also empower us to search for topics we wish to learn more about or far - off places we have never visited. Finally, we are able to engage in online conversations with people who @MONTH1 could be just across town or across the ocean. I hope that my reasoning helps you understand my perspective.
1432	1436	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, you settle down at the computer, armed with a glass of water and an after - school snack, perhaps an after - work snack. You log into your numerous accounts, open several chat windows with your friends, and commence researching for your project. As an increasing number of individuals embrace technology, developers seem to introduce novel features for computers. Some people are oblivious to the drawbacks, such as the deterioration of social relationships, procrastination, a lack of learning, and more! Beep! One new @CAPS2 message. On the computer, you can communicate with your friends and family, yet sometimes people spend so much time online that their real - life relationships falter. You cannot type a @ORGANIZATION1 message or conceal your emotions behind a screen. Moreover, for children as they grow older, many jobs demand customer - service skills, and if you are only proficient at interacting with people online, it will not be beneficial. Whatever you post on the internet can be read and shared anywhere, on any website, at any time, whereas in real life, it is truly you speaking. School and learning are also of utmost importance, but sometimes, I know I have homework yet procrastinate and say, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4, do it later; I need to check this out!"" bringing my learning to a halt. Some people dislike school, but it is crucial in a person's life. If you aspire to be successful, you need to strike a balance between school, learning, computer time, and do not forget exercise and possibly work! Computers can be useful for research and guidance, but platforms like Facebook or Twitter will impede your progress. So, focus and initiate that research! Chatrooms, @ORGANIZATION2, email, and other digital mediums can be harmful. There are numerous predators out there, waiting for anyone to log on. It is extremely dangerous, and someone can pretend to be someone they are not. Additionally, spending all day on the computer without exercise can lead to obesity, and sometimes, your hand posture can cause carpal tunnel syndrome. There are many adverse consequences associated with computers. Throughout your life, you will often need to find a balance. Do not overlook the negative aspects, or you could get hurt. Computers are nice to have, but be cautious not to squander all your time on them."
1433	1437	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you on @DATE1 regarding the concern about individuals who own computers. You are worried that those who possess computers are not spending time either exercising, enjoying nature, or interacting with their families. I concur with the notion that once @CAPS5 people acquire computers, they become indolent and refrain from participating in any activities. One day, I was in @CAPS1 and conducted a survey to determine how many people agreed that due to computers, many individuals are not engaging in activities. @PERCENT1 of the people I questioned stated that they agreed, while, of course, the others did not care much. Many people @MONTH1 consider it normal, but I visited a website that specializes in weight management and offers easy - to - follow weight - loss advice. That website is @CAPS3.com. I read an article on the webpage, and in paragraph @NUM1, section @NUM2, it states that obesity in the @LOCATION1 is caused by either computer use or laziness. Of course, some people might disagree, but at the same time, those who do are often high - level athletes who manage to do both. I had a conversation with @PERSON1, a professional @CAPS4 player. He said, ""@CAPS5 when I was a child, we did not have those things. We were either doing homework or playing outside with our friends."" Even high - profile athletes concur. In conclusion, I agree that the fact that people own computers makes them lazy and reduces their interaction with their families."
1434	1438	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, is it not high time we give more thought to the digital age? Computers have made substantial contributions to society for many years, and to this point, I firmly believe the world would be unable to function without them. Some individuals claim that computers are not beneficial for society, but do they truly believe that? Computers have given us the internet, email; most jobs rely on the internet, even games, and much more. Let me elaborate. Firstly, without computers, there would be no internet, and without the internet, many jobs would collapse. Most occupations require the internet to operate. For instance, architects need computers to design buildings and houses. Nearly every office is equipped with computers for a variety of reasons. Writers need computers to compose books; if they were hand - written, some people might struggle to read them. So, if there were no computers, thousands of people would lose their jobs. My mother works on a computer; she would lose her job. Not only that, but we also need computers for school. If I had to write a paper about a person, it would be nearly impossible to do so without searching for information about him on the internet. Moreover, when writing a paper, some teachers only accept typed papers. How are we supposed to accomplish that if we did not have computers? This makes homework significantly easier. Lastly, computers enable us to explore new places. Google @LOCATION1 is a map of every location on @LOCATION1 that we can access. If you need to find out where something is, you can always rely on the internet. If you need directions, you can print them from the internet. Also, if you need to find out the meaning of something, instead of using a dictionary, use the computer. Now, can you see how much the computer benefits society? Some people assert that others spend too much time on the computer, but you do not have to. I do not know anyone who uses the computer for more than work or school.
1435	1439	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am confident that you will concur with me regarding the retention of computers in our world. I am certain you will agree because computers aid everyone in their educational pursuits. For example, when I encounter unfamiliar words, I access the computer and type www.dictionary.com. Then I search for the words I do not understand. Subsequently, the definition appears in a much shorter time because when I search for a word in a dictionary, it takes me approximately @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes, whereas on the computer, it only takes me @NUM3 seconds. Additionally, computers allow us to chat and send messages when we are unable to see or speak to someone. We send a message, the recipient reads it, and then sends a reply. Lastly, computers are helpful in English classes, particularly in areas such as spelling, writing, typing, editing, and revising. That is why I believe we should keep computers in our world. I am aware that no one knows everything. Computers can assist us in mathematics by using formulas and online calculators available on calculator.com. They also help in science; by visiting @LOCATION1, we can ask questions like, ""What is matter?"" or ""What are..."". Finally, I will discuss the issue of not understanding certain words. I always visit dictionary.com; this website can provide and help me understand the word and obtain its accurate definition. I frequently utilize these @NUM2 websites when I am stuck in math, science, or English. These websites can be extremely beneficial in our education. That is my view on how computers support us in our educational endeavors. My parents are always concerned about me socializing with my friends. So, when I cannot see or talk to my friends in person, I visit MySpace, Facebook, or MSN to chat and send messages to them. We continue chatting and sending messages because our parents do not allow us to hang out. Most people do the same. We can also share pictures, music, and much more. That is my opinion on why we should have computers; we need to chat and send messages. In the end, we all need to type our essays, lessons, and more. Computers help us create PowerPoint presentations, check our spelling, change our writing style, such as to cursive, and they are also useful in editing and revising. I often misspell words, but the computer helps me correct my spelling and makes my projects look more presentable. That is why I hold this opinion."
1436	1440	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my awareness that an increasing number of individuals utilize computers; however, not all concur that this trend benefits society. I firmly contend that computers do confer advantages upon society for three reasons. Firstly, computers serve as an excellent resource for completing schoolwork. They enable users to access a greater volume of information. Additionally, computers offer an effective means of maintaining contact with friends and family. Evidently, one can discern why computers exert positive influences on both individuals and society.   My initial rationale for believing that computers benefit society is that they are an outstanding resource for schoolwork. For instance, if a science teacher assigns a typed assignment, it is virtually impossible to complete an essay without a computer. Moreover, when a project or assignment necessitates information retrieval and there is insufficient time to visit a library, the computer proves to be an invaluable source. Does this not seem reasonable? Computers not only assist with homework but also facilitate online college education. ""@My parents lack the financial means to support my college education,"" states @NUM1 - year - old @PERSON1. ""Consequently, I enroll in free online courses, which are highly effective."" Is it not evident that computers have a beneficial impact on people?  In addition to academic pursuits, computers are an ideal source for obtaining information. For example, if one has recently purchased a new home and wishes to learn more about the area, the computer provides updated pictures and details about the new hometown. Sixty - nine percent of individuals rely on computer - sourced information when buying a home. I believe that when people seek basic information about bears or bees, the computer is an excellent resource for learning. Evidently, computers have a significant impact on people and contribute to societal well - being.  Lastly, computers are useful for staying in touch with family and friends. ""@I have my entire mother's side of the family residing in @LOCATION1. When I use the computer to communicate with them, I feel a stronger sense of connection and part of a large, happy family,"" says @PERSON2 of @STATE1, @NUM2. Individuals with family members living in other states, countries, or even continents do not have the opportunity to see each other daily. This is where computers can help people maintain contact. Another example is if a parent is away for a few days, weeks, or months, and one wishes to communicate frequently. Email or instant messaging is an effective solution. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial for people and contribute to the betterment of society. In summary, computers benefit society and have positive effects on people. They are excellent resources for schoolwork, provide the information one seeks, and are effective for staying in touch with family and friends. Clearly, one can understand why I firmly believe that computers have a strong and positive impact on people and benefit society. Thank you!"
1437	1441	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I have recently become aware of the notion that computers are not highly productive. Indeed, people acquire information and engage in online conversations, yet this can have negative implications. I concur that computers are overused and employed for inappropriate purposes. In my view, online chatting has emerged as a primary mode of communication. Even I engage in online conversations regularly. However, online chatting can be detrimental if misused. Children around the globe communicate with individuals they have never met in person. People are being deceived because they assume the person they are conversing with is genuine. While online communication is a valuable tool, it should not be misused.  Plagiarism is a widespread issue. People simply appropriate content without creating it themselves. If one is caught plagiarizing, they may face imprisonment. Although there are ways to combat plagiarism, the internet, with its vast repository of information, is often exploited. I have encountered papers that contain copied information, which is then incorporated into the document. One can identify such instances as the copied content often has a different style from the rest of the paper, and this can lead to serious consequences. Teachers are required to report such cases to a supervisor. I am committed to avoiding plagiarism by conducting my own research and gathering original information.  Everyone appreciates computers and technology, but if people could reduce their computer usage for a period, issues such as plagiarism and the misuse of online chatting could be mitigated.
1438	1442	1	1	I opine that @CAPS1's should utilize computers to facilitate their self - improvement. Firstly, @CAPS1's should use computers because when they need to take notes on their activities, they can simply access the computer and type. Typing on a computer is more efficient than manual writing. All that is required is to type on the keyboard.  Computers also serve as an excellent tool for information retrieval. For example, if a teacher assigns a task to research a giraffe, the computer is the most accessible and efficient source. It is far easier to search for information on a computer than using traditional methods.  Finally, when working on a project that requires pictures and one is unsure how to obtain them, the computer provides a straightforward solution. One can simply search for the required images on the computer, and once all the necessary materials are found, the task is completed. Therefore, it is advisable to allow students to use computers in classrooms and schools so that they can receive easy assistance.
1439	1443	1	1	Computers have been among the most significant technological advancements, yet they have also contributed to certain societal drawbacks. Initially envisioned as a means to disseminate ideas and connect people with distant places, computers have, in fact, proven to have the opposite effect. Computers are perilous devices that specifically target young, innocent children. They are a primary factor contributing to the current state of society, and it is predicted that the future generation will be on an unstable and weak foundation. These devices, the root cause of this chaos, must be promptly removed from society as they deprive people of the true joys of life, have adverse effects on health, and provide a platform for some of the country's most dangerous predators.  Firstly, computers are associated with the detriment of childhood pleasures. Since @DATE1, the number of adolescent computer users has increased by @PERCENT1. Remarkably, @PERCENT2 of parents surveyed admitted that their children spend at least @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. This reduces the time available for reading, exercising, spending time outdoors, and socializing with friends and family. These negative impacts take a toll on society, particularly on teenagers, who are the most frequent users. As a result, diet and exercise are compromised, leading to a @PERCENT3 increase in the obesity rate. The lack of outdoor or family activities has also promoted anti - social behavior. At this alarming rate, our future generation will indeed be on a precarious footing.  In addition to limiting diet and exercise, computers are also a source of another hazard. As long as they are powered on, computers emit invisible electromagnetic radiation waves. These waves are linked to various diseases and cancers. Prolonged computer use has been associated with brain tumors, leukemia, brain disorders, and other cancers. Leukemia, when diagnosed at a young age, is difficult to treat and can impede a child's development. Children exposed to at least @NUM2 hours a day of computer use, compared to those who spend more time outdoors, are @NUM3 times more likely to develop such health problems. The ultimate preventive measure is to eliminate the use of computers entirely.  Lastly, computers are harmful because they expose users to a deadly threat. When adolescents casually browse the web and enter chat rooms, they are at risk of being targeted by thousands of child predators lurking online. Computers store highly sensitive information such as names, birthdates, genders, and even social security numbers. With a single click, by accepting a stranger's invitation, online predators can hack into a child's computer and obtain this valuable information. Alternatively, predators may be more direct and engage the child in conversation. For example, a well - known story tells of a local @CAPS2 girl who unknowingly chatted with an online stranger. The predator lured her to the mall, and a few tragic weeks later, the girl's remains were found, burned, in the final act of the predator. Therefore, computers are extremely dangerous, serving as a guidebook for predators in their search for victims. By removing computers, one can eliminate the threats posed by online predators.
1440	1444	1	1	"A substantial number of people use computers on a daily basis; however, not everyone believes that this technology benefits society. I firmly believe that computers enhance our way of life in numerous ways. This highly useful technology has a positive impact on individuals as it enables them to send, receive, and research a wide range of information with ease. @PERCENT1 of people utilize computers to obtain information, and they find it to be a faster method than reading a book on a specific topic. They claim that this powerful technology is more efficient and time - saving.  For example, my cousin and I were assigned the same research paper. He relied on multiple books to gather information, while I used the computer. I completed the project in @NUM1 days, whereas it took him an entire week. @PERSON1, a computer programming expert, stated, ""Computers have significantly accelerated the process of information retrieval. I strongly advocate that everyone should own a computer.""  Moreover, computers facilitate communication. There are numerous ways to stay in touch with people worldwide, such as email, chat rooms, and social media platforms like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These platforms are excellent tools for maintaining contact with family, friends, and even fans. @PERSON2, the lead singer of the band @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, said, ""@CAPS1 allows us to communicate directly with our fans and share updates about upcoming tours and albums. It is not only beneficial for bands but also for college students."" My older brother, a college student, and I use these platforms to communicate, making it seem as if he is not far away.  Computers also play a crucial role in business. Meetings can be conducted via @ORGANIZATION2 or other web - chat services, and emails are an effective way to transmit information. @NUM2 of business meetings are held online, which has improved work efficiency.  I urge you to embrace the use of the internet and computers. They will enhance your communication capabilities and streamline the process of information acquisition."
1441	1445	1	1	Dear local newspaper, some individuals contend that computers prepare people for the future; however, I posit that they actually inflict harm on both children and adults. Firstly, children are so engrossed in computer games that they never venture outdoors to engage in physical activity. Secondly, if one queries a child about nature, they will likely be at a loss for words, which would not be the case if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, numerous families today rarely see each other because both children and parents are overly occupied with their computers. These three factors illustrate why computers do not confer benefits upon society.  Obesity is a significant issue among children in @LOCATION1. The root cause is that they spend excessive time online and insufficient time outdoors exercising. Children are deprived of fresh air and physical exertion, which can lead to severe health problems. Parents sometimes fail to address this issue because they too are grappling with the same predicament. This demonstrates that computers and other technological devices are affecting families nationwide by causing them to become overweight.  Some children possess little knowledge about nature. While people assert that computers educate individuals about various subjects, nature and the environment are integral aspects of our lives. It is crucial to learn about them and contribute to their preservation. Given the current situation, the state of the earth may deteriorate further. Therefore, children need to be educated about nature and the environment to effect positive change.  I can attest from personal experience that computers encroach on the time we spend with friends and family. Instead of playing computer games at home, one could be spending quality time with family at the park or the pool. My father used to devote all his time to the computer, and we rarely had the opportunity to be with him. When he realized this, he rearranged his schedule to allow for more family time. Spending time with family is of utmost importance as they are a vital part of our lives, and reducing computer usage will facilitate this.  As is evident, reducing computer usage will help children maintain physical fitness and health, educate them about the environment, and enhance family interaction. If it transformed my family's lifestyle, it can do the same for others. I sincerely hope you concur, as it will undoubtedly have a positive impact.
1442	1446	1	1	Introduction. Every single computer in the world should have internet access. The internet aids people in numerous ways. Anyone can complete their homework on a computer. One can even communicate with friends, send emails to anyone globally, or simply play games. Teachers utilize computers because it is the most convenient means to access information they may require. Students can employ a computer to conduct research for, say, a history paper. One can find information about anyone or anything on a computer with internet connectivity.  There is also a useful application found on some computers called Microsoft Word. It enables users to write anything they desire, and if a mistake is made, it can be easily corrected. Some schools actually provide their students with their own personal computers. Students can complete their homework at any time and simply send an email to their teacher with the assignment attached.  Computers store more information than any book in the world. This is because computers have significantly greater storage capacity for information. Additionally, a remarkable feature of computers is the existence of websites that allow users to communicate with friends in their vicinity. One does not need to physically visit their friends' homes; they can post pictures on Facebook, MySpace, or other similar platforms. One can also play games on these social media sites.  Schools should incorporate computers because it is the most effective way to obtain the information necessary to complete tasks. Whether it is for science, math, or history homework, or simply for entertainment or learning something new, computers are invaluable. You should agree with me because everything I have stated is true, and computers are one of the best ways to acquire pictures or any other information needed to accomplish a task or even just to chat with a friend one hasn't seen in a while.
1443	1447	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, computers are an extraordinary tool that exerts numerous positive influences on society. Firstly, computers have spawned a multitude of innovative forms of communication. Moreover, they have enabled us to enter an era of unparalleled research capabilities. Additionally, computers have provided us with remarkable means of entertainment for people of all ages. Computers have an incredibly positive impact on individuals.  One reason for the positive influence of computers on humans is the development of numerous advanced methods of communication. For instance, instant messaging programs like @CAPS5 have bestowed upon us the remarkable ability to engage in real - time conversations with one or more people anywhere in the world. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of respondents indicated that they prefer instant messaging over other forms of communication, aside from face - to - face interaction. Secondly, most computers now come equipped with webcams, allowing users to visually communicate with the person they are conversing with. I have a friend who recently moved, and we can still maintain our friendship by seeing each other's activities, despite living in different towns. I am certain that many others have had similar experiences. Finally, the popular platform Facebook has revolutionized communication. People can now stay informed about their friends' lives regardless of the distance. Although there are some drawbacks, overall, computers have established incredible communication channels.  Another reason computers have a positive impact on people is their role in facilitating extensive research. A prime example is the renowned search engine, Google. Google provides access to almost every piece of information, assisting people in various aspects, such as school research. Many schools now utilize computer resources like @CAPS6, which offer vast amounts of information. In fact, studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people have found websites containing more relevant research information than books. Computers are the driving force behind the continued growth of research and the continuous discovery of new knowledge.  Finally, computers have created amazing entertainment options for people of all ages. Video - sharing websites like YouTube have become a popular destination for people to watch music videos and creative films. If one cannot obtain tickets to a concert, watching music videos online is a much more cost - effective alternative. Gaming websites also offer a less expensive option, as many free games are available online. Additionally, websites with humorous stories are a great way to enjoy a good laugh without leaving home. In today's economy, computers are an excellent means of achieving quick and inexpensive entertainment.  In conclusion, computers have a profound and positive impact on society. They have established new forms of communication, research, and entertainment that will indelibly transform the world. Therefore, I invite you to join me in recognizing the incredible potential of computers.
1444	1448	1	1	Dear Newspaper, have you ever contemplated the contributions of modern - day technology? A prime example is the computer. Many individuals utilize this device to book vacations, build relationships, and explore new ideas. I firmly believe that the benefits are substantial.  The sweltering sun can make one yearn for a vacation to a tropical island. Thanks to computers, people can browse hotels and make bookings with ease. Modern technology has enabled countless individuals to visit their desired destinations. Over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1's have chat accounts to communicate with family and friends. The distance between Europe and @LOCATION1 is over @NUM1 miles, and traditional phone calls can be costly. Modern technology has superseded phones, allowing people to use computers to stay in touch with distant loved ones. In the process, computers have also facilitated the formation of relationships for over @NUM2 single individuals.  Some critics argue that computers reduce face - to - face interaction with family and friends. However, computers have enabled people to connect and communicate more effectively. They can even plan @CAPS3 together. While it is true that excessive computer use can have drawbacks, appropriate decisions can be made to limit usage and improve human health. Establishing standards for computer use can alleviate these issues and encourage physical activity.  I firmly oppose the critics and advocate for the positive uses of computers. If computers were removed, not only would people lose access to important files, but they would also become disorganized in the long run. Moreover, exploring new places and websites can teach even the most knowledgeable individuals something new.  After reading this, I hope you will recognize that my @CAPS4 deserves admiration.
1445	1449	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, computers! Computers wield a profound influence on people. The technological advancements associated with computers bring substantial benefits to society. Computers offer individuals a platform to interact with others, access educational resources on school websites, and develop hand - eye coordination. They are transforming the world across the globe.  Computers provide a space for people to engage with others. There are thousands of websites featuring chat functions and online chat rooms. These platforms enable users to communicate with others and stay informed about global events. Additionally, chat rooms on computers help friends maintain close relationships. Studies indicate that ninety percent of @CAPS1 with access to chat rooms tend to have more friends than those without. Evidently, computer - mediated interactions have a significant impact on individuals.  School websites also confer numerous benefits on society. They empower users to deepen their understanding of school - related subjects and explore new knowledge. With almost every school in the @LOCATION1 having a website, students struggling in school can find valuable assistance. From personal experience, I know that a computer is invaluable for schoolwork. Whether I forget my homework or need to prepare for a quiz or test, I can always rely on my computer to find the necessary information. It is evident that computers contribute positively to our educational system.  Computers also play a role in developing hand - eye coordination. When using a computer for games or other activities, one learns to move the mouse swiftly while keeping their eyes focused on the screen. I always relish the opportunity to use a computer because, while having fun, I am also honing my hand - eye coordination. Ninety - five percent of computer users enjoy using them, which means that a large proportion of people are simultaneously improving their hand - eye coordination. This clearly demonstrates the positive impact of computers on society.  In conclusion, computers undoubtedly benefit society. They provide a means of interaction, educational opportunities, and the development of hand - eye coordination. I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people, and their role in modern society is undeniable.
1446	1450	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on individuals as they facilitate learning about foreign locales, enable connection with distant family and friends, and assist in their professional endeavors. Computers aid people in acquainting themselves with foreign places. Prior to my uncle's departure to @LOCATION4, he aspired to learn about their culture. He utilized the computer to conduct research on @CAPS1 culture, thereby preparing himself adequately. How would one feel if they traveled to another country without any prior knowledge of it? What if they were to visit that country and engage in actions disrespectful to its culture, simply because they had not conducted research? I am certain I would feel remorseful. Some may argue that one can read a book about that country, yet not everyone has the time to sit and read. Computers shrink the world and foster mutual understanding. I believe this is a highly positive aspect. Don't you concur? People establish connections with one another via the computer. More than @PERCENT1 of those who relocate from their family and friends re - establish contact through computers. Nowadays, social networking platforms such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 offer individuals the opportunity to reach out to distant family or friends. When I moved from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, I despaired of ever seeing my best friend again. However, I obtained a @CAPS3 account and located her on it. I was overjoyed. We exchanged numbers and addresses. Now, I communicate with her daily on the computer. Moreover, the only means of communication with my aunt, who resides in @LOCATION3, is through the computer. I cannot call her as it would inflate my phone bill. Another advantage of computers is that they assist people in finding their biological parents or siblings. They bring them together and facilitate re - connection. Computers are also invaluable in the workplace. Any @CAPS6 of a company typically possesses a laptop. It aids in storing data, files, and crucial information. Computers are indispensable to these individuals. Additionally, they enable them to monitor their company even while on vacation. How would one feel if they owned a company and went on vacation but were unable to keep track of it due to the absence of a computer? Computers have a positive impact on people as they facilitate learning about places, communicating with family, and managing work.
1447	1451	1	1	"Dear @PERSON4, I firmly assert that the utilization of computers is advantageous to the community. Firstly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination and other skills. These devices offer access to games that are conducive to @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, based in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, has recently incorporated these games into their training regimen as of @DATE1. Instructors have reported that trainees and students have demonstrated significantly improved @ORGANIZATION2 skills compared to previous years. Additionally, computer games can enhance reflexes. Two years ago, a @NUM1 - year - old man named @PERSON3 fell onto the train tracks as a train approached. Thanks to his extraordinary reflexes, he managed to leap to safety, thus saving his life. When queried about how he achieved this feat, he attributed it to his long - standing habit of playing computer games since the age of @NUM2. Computers also augment cognitive abilities. A @DATE2 study by @ORGANIZATION1 revealed that the brain's activity increased by @PERCENT1 after computer usage. The researchers obtained this data by attaching electrodes to the patients' brains both before and after computer use. It is for these reasons that computers enhance hand - eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for the benefits of computers is their capacity for online communication. They enable individuals to interact with distant family members, thereby strengthening relationships. I recently re - established contact with my cousin who relocated to @LOCATION3. Traditional letters were costly and time - consuming, but email and Skype offer an excellent alternative. Computers also enhance social skills. @PERSON1, a local resident, remarks, ""I adore using computers as I can converse with my friends at any time, and I believe it truly enhances our communication."" Who wouldn't cherish a device that offers such a service? Computers can even improve one's mood. In a @DATE3 test conducted by @ORGANIZATION3, @NUM3 individuals were placed in separate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hours. Subsequently, @PERCENT2 reported an improvement in their mood. Computers are remarkable as they facilitate online communication. Finally, computers enable individuals to explore other places. Virtual tours are becoming increasingly prevalent. At @CAPS2.org, one can embark on virtual tours of over @NUM5 countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. One can also learn about different cultures, traditions through online videos on YouTube.com and articles on Wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. One can even discover new recipes. Renowned celebrity chef @PERSON2 not only posts her recipes on mstewart.com but also sources some of them online. In a recent interview with @CAPS3 magazine, when asked about the origin of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admitted that she found most of them online, stating, ""It's a powerful resource that more people should utilize. All @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" It is due to these factors that computers allow individuals to learn about other places. Thank you for your time, and I hope you will consider my perspective. It is for all these reasons that I firmly believe computers are beneficial to the community."
1448	1452	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I have recently noted that you hold the view that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers instead of engaging in exercise or spending time with friends and family. However, I hold the contrary opinion. People can engage in online interactions if they so desire. Moreover, they can acquire new knowledge. Additionally, computers assist individuals in earning income. Please continue reading to learn more. The majority of computer users engage in some form of online interaction. @PERCENT1 of people have accounts on either Facebook, MySpace, Skype, or all three, through which they interact with others. The internet provides an opportunity to meet new people, even those from other parts of the state or country. We can also stay informed about local events. For example, if there is a missing child, we can obtain a description and contribute to the search. Not only do people interact online, but they can also conduct research on useful information. For instance, when I was assigned a project on teen mothers, I first visited the library and borrowed some books. When I couldn't find the required information in the books, I turned to the computer. We can also learn about distant locations such as @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. My mother often says, ""@CAPS1 your room or @CAPS2 will donate your belongings to those in need."" The first time she said this, I used the computer to explore the living conditions of others. Some lived in comfortable, large houses, while others resided in boxes or trash cans. This experience had a profound impact on me, and I felt deep sympathy for those less fortunate. Finally, computers play a crucial role in helping people earn a living and support their families. @PERCENT2 of people found their jobs through computers. They can visit websites to find safe and well - paying jobs. Moreover, having a computer enables people to work from home. Some individuals cannot afford babysitters and have to take care of their children all day, so they rely on home - based work to earn money. People can also apply for jobs or community service online. My sister, @PERSON1, secured her first job by visiting the @CAPS4 museum's website and applying directly on the computer. Therefore, computers are highly beneficial. I maintain this view because they facilitate online interaction, enable research on useful information, and assist people in finding employment and generating income. Do you use computers for any of these purposes?"
1449	1453	1	1	Dear Newspaper, It's a small world indeed - and it is shrinking further as computer usage becomes increasingly widespread. Thousands upon thousands of websites and applications are now readily accessible. I am firmly convinced that the impacts of computers are overwhelmingly positive. Firstly, they enhance hand - eye coordination. Secondly, they serve as excellent communication tools. Finally, they are powerful research instruments. Some critics argue that computers are reducing the time spent with family and friends, but I disagree. Computers enable us to stay more connected than ever before! The computer is not a negative force; rather, it is quite the opposite! To begin with, computers are highly effective in improving hand - eye coordination. In a recent study conducted by @PERSON1, he observed a significant enhancement in the motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 after using educational computer programs such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour daily. Children who did not use the program showed a much slower development of motor skills. Hand - eye coordination is a skill that is essential throughout one's life and should be actively promoted. I am aware that it greatly aids me in my daily activities - and likely you in yours as well - from basic tasks like eating and brushing teeth to more complex ones such as typing, drawing, and playing the piano. As is evident, hand - eye coordination is of great importance. Secondly, computers are outstanding communication aids. People cannot always be reached by phone. An email can await them online at any time and from anywhere they access it. Moreover, documents can be sent via email, which would be nearly impossible to transmit via a home phone and difficult for most mobile phones to handle. Revolutionary video - conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 even allow us to communicate with people worldwide, almost as if we were face - to - face. I use it to keep in touch with my family on the @LOCATION2. How about you? Last but not least, computers are extremely powerful research tools. One can find everything from the local zoo's opening hours (thus avoiding toddler tantrums when arriving to find it closed) to the average lifespan of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Instead of sifting through numerous books for a single piece of information, one can simply enter a query into any of the many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5, and obtain instant results. One can explore @LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket. One can also view photos of @LOCATION1 - a sight that most people would never experience without the internet. The computer can transport us anywhere. In conclusion, computers are a valuable resource that is often misrepresented. They teach and improve important hand - eye coordination skills. They also greatly facilitate communication. And finally, they are a potent research device. Computers are often depicted as a bane to society, but this is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for people of all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Do not treat it as such.
1450	1454	1	1	Click, click. Another information page materializes on your convenient @LOCATION4. These reliable, intelligent, and user - friendly devices are always a worthy possession. Nevertheless, some individuals are now contending that these handy desktops are detrimental to one's well - being, arguing that people do not engage in sufficient exercise or outdoor activities. However, computers serve as an outstanding entertainment system, possess a vast supply of information, and even enable social interaction with friends and family. I fail to comprehend why such claims are made. Allow me to convey my affection for computers to you. Televisions, radios, and @NUM1 players are no match for the internet and its extensive entertainment network. The computer offers all the family - friendly movies, iTunes tracks, and even websites where one can create their own films. Posting pictures on the @CAPS1 and sending them via email can be accomplished with a mere click of the mouse. The internet is undoubtedly the ideal choice for a family movie night. One of the most significant advantages of the internet is its rich source of information. Google, Wikipedia, or even Dictionary.com are the premier information platforms of the @DATE1. While nature observation and exercise are both healthy and enjoyable, I would prefer to learn about the sunny beaches of @CAPS2 or the magnificent landscapes of @LOCATION1. Whether you are researching how to tie a tie or gathering information for a history report, the @CAPS3 is an effortless solution. How else could you communicate with a friend who is located across the world in @LOCATION2 or Germany? The answer is straightforward: Skype, Facebook, MySpace, and more are all accessible on your convenient @CAPS3. Many sites have a no - fee policy, so they cannot charge users for socializing with friends. Personally, I can now communicate with my cousins who live in @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1 thanks to the excellent interaction platform of Facebook. Why would you take the time to travel across town only to be uncertain if the person is even there? Clearly, the internet is an excellent social activity. Now that I have expressed my opinion regarding the wonderful effects of the internet, including its entertainment system, the wealth of historical information it provides, and the opportunity for socializing with friends, I hope people will recognize the numerous benefits of the computer.
1451	1455	1	1	"To Whom This @MONTH1 Concerns: I have learned that there is an ongoing debate regarding whether computers are beneficial to us or detrimental. In my view, computers are highly advantageous. They enable us to communicate with individuals across the globe, endow us with the capacity to acquire knowledge about various subjects, and ultimately, they economize our financial resources. Are not all these aspects beneficial to us? I firmly believe so. Kindly continue reading to discover more about the merits of computers. Firstly, computers afford us the opportunity to interact with people worldwide. A significant portion of my family resides in different @CAPS1, and the computer serves as our primary means of communication. If one were to relocate away from friends and family, would they not desire to maintain contact? Well, the computer facilitates this through online chatting. Moreover, computers present us with the chance to explore diverse topics. By accessing ""@CAPS2.com"", one can input any query and obtain relevant information or find answers to questions. For instance, parents seeking to monitor their children's academic progress can visit the school website to check their grades. Finally, computers contribute to daily cost - savings. Without a computer, researching information for a project would necessitate a trip to the library and the purchase of a book. However, with a computer, one can conveniently access information from the comfort of home. In conclusion, it is evident that computers benefit us in numerous ways. They enable us to communicate with friends and family globally, offer quick and easy access to information, and save us money daily. Thank you for reading my letter, which I trust has convinced you of the advantages of computers."
1452	1456	1	1	"How would you feel about receiving a ""@CAPS1"" on your social studies report? What if you were unable to see your school friends after school? What if you were extremely bored and prohibited from watching television or playing games? Some experts express concerns about people's computer usage, as they believe individuals are spending excessive time on computers and insufficient time engaging in physical exercise, appreciating nature, and interacting with family and friends. On the computer, one can watch videos, play games, chat with others, and even improve academic performance. I genuinely believe that the notion of people being overly reliant on computers is unfounded. @CAPS2, let us examine how a computer can transform one's life. Suppose you have a history report due tomorrow, you forgot your history book at school, and you have little knowledge about the topic. Failing to submit the report will result in a poor grade. Why not turn on your computer and open an internet browser? I recall @TIME1 year when I was working on a report about the @CAPS4 @CAPS3. I knew virtually nothing about them and had left my book at school. I accessed the internet, typed @CAPS4 @CAPS3 into @ORGANIZATION1, and @DATE1 I achieved a @NUM1 on the report. The computer can also be used to look up information related to school subjects. ""@TIME1 @DATE1, I was reading about the @CAPS6 @CAPS7, and a few days @DATE1, we discussed how that @CAPS7 might have been created. I was the only student in our grade who knew the answer. Additionally, computers can be used for educational games, such as testing one's speed in solving multiplication or division problems. Consider the capabilities of computers. Without a computer, poor grades may lead to admission to a sub - par college and a less - desirable job. Conversely, with a computer, good grades can open doors to a reputable college and a better career. Next, let's explore how computers facilitate communication. One can establish a messaging connection with others using @CAPS8 or engage in free conversations via @ORGANIZATION2 on the computer. Studies indicate that @PERCENT1 of computer owners have either @CAPS8 or @ORGANIZATION2 installed. One can also communicate with those who have an email address. I remember having a laptop issue; my crush, who is knowledgeable about laptops, responded to my email, and I was able to fix my device. Computers also allow individuals to meet others online and then interact with them in person, as seen in dating websites. A computer can truly enhance the quality of life. Lastly, when bored, one can visit YouTube to watch appropriate and interesting videos. ""@CAPS10, after finishing my homework, I had nothing to do, so I spent time online watching YouTube videos. Some people enjoy playing games on the computer. Just @TIME1, I played Tetris for @NUM2 minutes before I needed to rest for the @CAPS11. One can also listen to the radio on a website. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of radio listeners @CAPS10 were in cars, but @PERCENT3 represents an additional percentage of those listening online. Not only can a computer improve grades and enhance life, but it can also provide entertainment. As is evident, the idea of condemning computer use is absurd. Computers can empower and enrich one's life. I have never witnessed anyone being negatively affected by reasonable computer use."
1453	1457	1	1	Dear Local @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers do not have a negative impact on people; rather, they confer benefits upon individuals and enhance the quality of life. Computers offer more than just gaming opportunities. In certain circumstances, they aid in knowledge acquisition. They can be utilized for entertainment, professional tasks, research, projects, and more, not merely for gaming purposes. Computers assist individuals in performing their jobs effectively. For example, if one works as a lawyer, @MONTH1 they require a computer to type legal documents. In cases where an individual has poor handwriting and holds a profession like law, @MONTH1 they may encounter difficulties referring to information in their documents if they cannot read their own writing. This is where the computer proves invaluable. I also contend that computers do not have a detrimental effect on people because during grade school, children sometimes rely on the internet for educational purposes. Some individuals do not have access to a nearby library. Using a computer to gather information for projects or homework is beneficial rather than harmful. I have one more reason to support my view that computers benefit rather than affect people. I believe that if one has a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, they have the opportunity to interact with people from around the world. Through such interactions, one can learn about different lifestyles and cultures. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you will reconsider your stance.
1454	1458	1	1	Due to an ongoing debate regarding whether computers benefit society, I am writing to convey my perspective on this matter. I firmly believe that the advantages of computers outweigh their drawbacks. This belief is grounded in several reasons. Firstly, computers facilitate online communication. Secondly, they enhance and advance learning. Additionally, they contribute to employment opportunities. As previously mentioned, computers enable online communication. After reading this, one may wonder about the nature of online communication. Online communication encompasses social networking platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace, as well as email, blogs, and certain chat sites. Now, let's consider how these technological advancements improve our lives. These inventions enable long - distance communication, effectively bringing people closer together. For example, my uncle resides in @LOCATION1. Through Facebook, my mother can communicate with him at any time and also stay in touch with other relatives. Thus, online communication can be essential in such situations. Email can also be used for communication, although it is slower compared to other forms of electronic communication. Moreover, computers play a significant role in enhancing learning. They can improve the learning process in various ways. Computers expedite the flow of information. Students can access school websites to obtain more information about events occurring at school. For instance, I visit my school's website to retrieve nightly homework assignments and read the next day's announcements. Teachers may post helpful hints and @MONTH1 detailed explanations of assignments. Additionally, computers assist with research projects. For example, a few weeks ago, my health class was working on an illegal drug project. We were able to gather a wide range of information and create brochures using the computer. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits to society through online communication, enhanced learning, and contributions to employment.
1455	1459	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Some individuals @MONTH1 believe that computers are beneficial to our society; however, I hold a contrary view. Those who spend excessive time sitting in front of a computer fail to engage in physical exercise or appreciate the beauty of nature. Would one desire to become overweight while sitting beside a metal box? Moreover, people are neglecting face - to - face interactions with friends and family, who are the most significant individuals in one's life. Would one prefer to be sedentary and overweight, or physically fit through exercise? The sole form of ""exercise"" one gets while using a computer is finger movement. Therefore, one should abandon their sedentary lifestyle and engage in physical activity. While computers do offer educational value, exercise provides both physical fitness and educational experiences. Who would not want to witness the natural beauty of the world? Although one can view pictures of nature on a computer, these are merely digital representations. In reality, nature is authentic and often more beautiful than its digital counterpart. Does this not sound more appealing than spending time on a computer? All the active and healthy individuals are outdoors enjoying nature. Join them and explore exotic plants and beautiful animals. One can share these experiences with friends and family, which is not possible to the same extent when sitting in front of a computer. @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 cherish their family and friends, and I am certain you are among them. Friends and family can offer support during difficult times. Without them, one's life may be significantly different. Therefore, do yourself a favor and step away from the computer to visit loved ones. The time to make a change is now. Otherwise, you risk losing the company of your family and friends and gaining excess weight. Do you wish to be that person? You will also miss out on the wonders of nature. So, go outside and have a great time."
1456	1460	1	1	I have recognized that there has been a disagreement regarding the positive and negative impacts of computers on people. In my view, it appears that computers exert a more adverse influence on individuals than a beneficial one. I contend that people are allocating an excessive amount of time to the computer and not engaging in physical activity. They fail to spend quality time with family and friends and neglect to breathe in fresh air and appreciate nature. Although computers are an excellent technological innovation, many individuals do not venture outside to enjoy nature and fresh air because their computers are situated indoors. This is detrimental because when one goes outside, it promotes skin health through sunlight exposure and allows fresh air to enter the lungs. Additionally, taking a stroll outdoors to enjoy nature would not be amiss. It can alleviate stress and induce relaxation. Moreover, it is evident that when people are using the computer, they typically tune out what their friends and family are saying to them. People can lose track of time and remain on the computer for hours. Instead, one should utilize this time to be with friends and family. Being with one's family can strengthen the bond between them and enable them to get along better. Also, having a pleasant family time is an effective way to foster closeness with one's family. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 experts assert that having a family dinner can enhance a child's academic performance and prevent them from using drugs or dropping out of high school or college. Finally, children are more prone to obesity than adults because they do not get sufficient exercise. At least @PERCENT1 or more children are obese according to recent studies. Consequently, this can lead to bone and joint problems, heart disease, lung issues, diabetes, and asthma. These aforementioned issues are serious health concerns if left untreated. If children exercise instead of spending all day on a computer, the number of obese children will decline significantly. Exercise can boost children's self - esteem and help them regain physical fitness. They can either participate in sports or simply take a walk or run. There are numerous activities one can engage in for exercise, and it is enjoyable for children. Undoubtedly, there are indeed more reasons why computers have a negative impact on children and adults for the reasons stated above and more. Computers impede people from enjoying nature and obtaining fresh air. Similarly, they also prevent families and friends from spending time together, and lastly, they prevent children from exercising, which can result in obesity.
1457	1461	1	1	I concur because computers do assist people with various matters such as vacation destinations, employment opportunities, gift - giving, and shopping. The computer has a multitude of applications. However, the creators of the computer are concerned that people are spending an excessive amount of time on it. Primarily, it pertains to the concerns of both critics and users. Most of these individuals complain that they have insufficient time to spend with their family and friends. One cannot be certain whether users are researching vacation trips for both friends and family. What critics fail to understand is that the computer can impart a wealth of knowledge, including history, mathematics, scientific experiments, and much more. Computers are also employed in schools to aid students with their studies, and even teachers use them for grading purposes. It is true that people are not going outside to breathe fresh air or take a walk in the park. They cannot confine themselves to the computer for @NUM1 hours; it is simply absurd. Therefore, I support both perspectives. It is preferable to relish life rather than search for things that are not truly necessary. One should only use the computer for essential tasks such as paying bills and purchasing furniture for one's home. That is the purpose for which the computer was invented.
1458	1462	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, envision a world where the unemployment rate increases significantly, people are unable to communicate or learn as rapidly, and everyone is overwhelmed with stress. That is the kind of world it would be if computers suddenly vanished. I believe that computers are more beneficial to society than some people realize. They educate us on new concepts and enhance our hand - eye coordination. Many occupations are associated with computers, such as accounting. Computer games and @CAPS2 help alleviate stress after a strenuous day. Schools are the cornerstone of society. They instruct children and teenagers on how to become successful adults. Computers have significantly expedited the teaching process. Teachers can now access grades instantaneously. My computer has been of great assistance to me.
1459	1463	1	1	Dear Newspaper: I have recently read your article regarding whether computers are beneficial or detrimental to society. I believe they are helpful because without the internet, I would not be able to learn how to perform tasks such as clearing something in the proper manner. This takes time to master, but through the internet, I learned it quickly. If one does this incorrectly, it could cause a problem and potentially endanger oneself. There are numerous other uses; if you find yourself in a situation where your family is relying on you, you have two options. You can either panic and disappoint everyone, or you can turn to the internet for a solution. However, the computer does have an impact on how people exercise. I understand your concerns, but it is clear that the internet does influence one's exercise habits. It has its advantages, such as teaching better and more effective ways to stay healthy. There are also drawbacks; some of the disadvantages include [unclear part]. All of these can lead to various issues. It is only a negative aspect when one misuses it. In conclusion, if you make the right choices, you will be healthier than ever.
1460	1464	1	1	"Dear Readers of @ORGANIZATION1 in the @LOCATION3, in this era, almost everything, including @CAPS33, @CAPS39, revolves around technology, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, along with the @CAPS10. With the rapid changes in @CAPS4 and without [unclear part], do we still have the time to pause and appreciate the beauty of life? People are no longer leisurely observing the magnificent @CAPS6 in the fall at @ORGANIZATION2 or playing @CAPS7 or baseball, but instead, they are sitting on a chair at @ORGANIZATION2, watching a video on @CAPS8 or playing games like @CAPS9 or @CAPS10 at @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS11. In @LOCATION5, health problems have become a widespread issue! Why? Because instead of enjoying the fresh air and open fields that @CAPS13 has to offer, @CAPS33 are engrossed in @CAPS14 @NUM1 or our @ORGANIZATION4 @CAPS15 @CAPS16! As a [unclear part] in @LOCATION5, @CAPS21 @DATE1 has witnessed a change from @NUM2 @CAPS19 (in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION6, @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION4 - @CAPS17 and @CAPS18) having a @PERCENT2 @CAPS35 for obesity to @CAPS29 @NUM3 @CAPS19 with a @PERCENT1 @CAPS35! That is an increase of @PERCENT3 in @LOCATION5! What other rate is rising as rapidly as during @DATE1? The number of homes that own computers and the rate at which each home owns them! Dr. @DR1 @CAPS22 @CAPS23 conducted a study in @ORGANIZATION4. In your [unclear part], he found that in the last @NUM4 @CAPS27, the number of type @NUM5 diabetics has nearly doubled! @PERSON1, a leading researcher at @ORGANIZATION6 (@ORGANIZATION1), wrote an article for @ORGANIZATION3. In his article, he stated that ""@CAPS29 @PERCENT4 of @CAPS30 @ORGANIZATION4 own more than one computer per household! @CAPS14, @CAPS15, and @ORGANIZATION5 are all thriving in this economic downturn, while sporting goods, books, and exercise equipment are struggling. The researchers at @ORGANIZATION6 view this as a major cause for the growing lack of exercise and the increased time spent on home computers. Also, equally important is how all this time spent on computers is affecting children. As @PERSON2, a writer for the @ORGANIZATION4, put it, ""@CAPS33 @CAPS34 on @CAPS35 @NUM5 1/@NUM5 having on computer a day."" It has become apparent that children are spending less time playing sports and more time on their ""amazing @ORGANIZATION4 @CAPS15 laptop"" playing video games! I am @NUM8, and I have been playing @CAPS7 in @LOCATION3 for @NUM9 @CAPS27. When I was @NUM10, the @LOCATION3 travel team used to have so many people try out that it was difficult to make the team. Now, so few people play that one hardly needs to try out! When I grow up, I will most likely end up with a job at a large business like Google, teaching things that require computer skills. So, for now, I want to enjoy being a child! We should not let children waste their time on video games. They will spend enough of their lives behind a computer later. We are talking about the health of the future generation! Do we want a future where everyone has diabetes and is glued to their computers? Amidst the rapid changes in @CAPS4 around @CAPS10, we need to keep one thing constant, no matter how challenging it is. That is, we need to get outside and help maintain a healthy lifestyle, and we cannot do that from behind a computer screen. Thank you for your time."
1461	1465	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, I advocate for computers. You might assume I hold this view merely because I am @NUM1 years old and engage with them for amusement. In fact, computers confer numerous benefits upon society. They offer entertainment, serve as a medium for communication, facilitate schooling and education, and support work endeavors. Computers encompass not only the @CAPS1 but also the @CAPS6 processor, @ORGANIZATION1, and related components. They provide games suitable for individuals aged from @NUM2 to @NUM3. When it rains outside, your parents are at work, and you find yourself alone with nothing to do, simply turn on the computer and play a game. There are numerous engaging websites catering to all. Moreover, computers are an excellent source of communication. There are various types of @CAPS2 - mail. Platforms such as @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and many others are ideal for conversing with friends. Since not everyone owns a cell phone, chatting with them via @CAPS5 or other similar platforms is a pleasant experience. Computers also offer an outstanding educational resource. If you are working on a history project and require more information and pictures, log on to a computer and @ORGANIZATION3 it. At our school, we utilize edline, which notifies us of all our homework assignments; it is extremely convenient. Currently, there are also online schooling tutors, which is highly beneficial. Computers are invaluable for work. Entities like @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION5, and other @ORGANIZATION2 - related businesses can leverage computers to find information and create valuable outputs. They are highly useful for business professionals. As evident, computers have a multitude of remarkable applications. I firmly believe that computers positively impact people by assisting them in diverse ways. They enable enjoyment, communication, educational pursuits, and work - related tasks. Having computers around is indeed a positive thing, don't you agree?
1462	1466	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, Minute Man, individuals have been voicing complaints regarding how computers disrupt their family life. Nevertheless, computers serve as a means of imparting new knowledge to both adults and children. Using a computer is a rich experience. One can search for almost anything on it. It allows users to explore history or gain insights into the present. For instance, I once searched on (@CAPS1.com) about how to repair a PlayStation @NUM1 controller. I successfully discovered the solution, and it worked. While using the computer, one can interact with friends, check the weather, and determine if there is any homework. Additionally, the computer teaches various skills. I recall learning to perform a hardflip on one occasion. Computers can also assist with homework. If you have science homework and are struggling to decipher a word, you can search for it. Similarly, if you are looking for a book for @LOCATION2, you can search websites for suitable books or seek recommendations from friends. Computers aid different people in a multitude of ways. People often claim that computers are detrimental. However, having a TV for a game system is comparable to having a computer, isn't it? But don't exhaust yourself searching for a cheap one. I genuinely recommend that everyone should own a computer as they are both helpful and enjoyable.
1463	1467	1	1	"Nearly everyone in the @LOCATION1 utilizes a computer at some point in their lives. Computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination through programs, games, and typing. The internet can be employed to research distant cultures as well as one's own way of life. This compact and well - crafted technological device has become increasingly sophisticated. Recognizing the significant role computers play in daily life, people will either impede or support the advancement of computer technology. One of the most fundamental yet obvious benefits of using a computer is the improvement of hand - eye coordination. From the early grades, children learn to type on a keyboard. Specialized programs help kids acquire the necessary skills while enjoying the learning process. When I was a mere five years old, I vividly remember typing. I was always excited when my mother and I visited Barnes and Noble to purchase a new typing program. I particularly enjoyed ""Type to Learn"" and @CAPS1 typing lessons. Teaching children to type, in general, fosters hand - eye coordination in high school, college, and the workplace. Young adults and adults are expected to type papers, resumes, and applications. In this technological era, typing has become a necessity. Another avenue for developing hand - eye coordination is through computer games. Simple games like solitaire, Bejeweled, or car racing teach this skill, and more advanced games such as World of Warcraft demand perfect coordination, which can be achieved through both typing and gaming on the computer. Although some experts are concerned that ""people are spending excessive time on the computer and less time enjoying nature,"" one can still learn about geography, travel, and nature. The World Wide Web is an amazing feature of the computer. It consists of millions of websites, pages, search engines, and a vast amount of information. Are you preparing for an upcoming geography assignment? Are you planning a trip? Do you need to find the definition of the word ""cognitive""? If any of these scenarios apply to you, a legitimate website can provide all the information you need; all you have to do is search. Instead of incurring the high costs of traveling to learn about special wonders, you can simply click and type to access amazing content. When searching on a computer, you can explore ancient cultures and rituals, information that was once only accessible in museums @NUM1 years ago. @CAPS1 is a complex yet user - friendly technological tool that brings a world of pictures, art, and history right to your fingertips."
1464	1468	1	1	Did you know that four out of five households in the @LOCATION1 use a computer at some point in their lives? Computers have a profound positive impact on people. Have you ever pondered the reasons? With computers, one can establish contact with individuals in different parts of the @CAPS1. The internet allows users to search for an unlimited amount of information. Moreover, computers enhance the functionality of other electronic inventions. What do @LOCATION5, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION6, and @LOCATION7 have in common? You can communicate with people there using computers! While interacting with others around the @CAPS1, you can gain insights into different cultures and lifestyles and may even make new friends. Imagine a hard - working businessman residing in the @LOCATION1. He works for a @CAPS1 - renowned company and has to attend a meeting with the senior management in @LOCATION4. Wouldn't it be more convenient to set up a video chat? This eliminates the hassle of air travel and is much more efficient. Do you understand why it is called the @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 @CAPS3? On the internet, you can access an endless supply of information. Whether you are researching animals, sports, or working on a report about @LOCATION3, where can you find easily understandable information instantly? Search on @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You never know what new knowledge you might discover as there are new additions every day. Without computers, how would you download music to an @NUM1? It is impossible; you must use a computer. Computers also benefit a wide range of other electronic devices. You can download videos, print photographs, and charge @CAPS4 and other electronics. Modern technology is truly remarkable, giving rise to the ubiquitous computer. Computers have a substantial positive influence on our lifestyle. They facilitate communication with others around the @CAPS1, enable instant access to information, and ensure the proper functioning of other electronic devices.
1465	1469	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1, do you believe that people spend an excessive amount of time on computers? In a survey, @PERCENT1 out of @NUM1 people prefer using a computer over taking a walk in the park. Those who spend a significant amount of time on computers often miss out on important aspects of life. For example, they devote so much time to the computer that they have little time for exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Computers have a negative impact on individuals. Many people exercise for only @NUM2 minutes. However, when they are engrossed in computer games or social media like Facebook, they either forget to exercise or do it for only @NUM3 minutes because they are eager to return to the computer. The computer on the desk beckons, while the yoga mat or weights on the floor are ignored. The computer seems more appealing and less strenuous. As a result, people are more inclined to use the computer than to exercise. Computers make it difficult to exercise as people are preoccupied with computer - related activities such as games, Facebook, emails, and other tasks. Thus, computers are detrimental to people's health. Nature is beautiful, with trees swaying in the breeze and butterflies fluttering in the air. There are also various seasons with magnificent scenery. In contrast, those who spend all their time on the computer are confined to a stuffy room with a desk, shelves, and a few pictures. People are missing out on the small and large beauties of nature. They are not taking walks on the beach, going on long hikes in the woods, or taking strolls in the park. They are deprived of fresh air and the opportunity to admire the natural scenery. Instead, they are sitting in a chair, staring at a computer screen. How can this compare to the beauty of nature? Computers are preventing people from enjoying nature. Spending time with friends and family is a delightful activity. However, how can one socialize with them if they are constantly glued to the computer? They will not be able to build relationships with their loved ones. This can have long - term consequences as they may grow up feeling sad and lonely and may struggle to interact with others in a work environment. People addicted to computers are missing out on having fun with those they love. Computers may seem like a friend, but wouldn't it be better to call a real friend on the phone? They would probably prefer to hear your voice rather than read a message. Computers disrupt relationships with friends and family. Now that you understand the negative impact of computers on people, you can appreciate why I am concerned. Computers interfere with people's exercise routines, prevent them from enjoying nature, and impede their social interactions with friends and family. I hope you can recognize the adverse effects of computers.
1466	1470	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers undoubtedly contribute positively to our society for numerous reasons. For instance, we can engage in online communication with friends. Moreover, we can acquire in - depth knowledge about the destinations we aspire to visit. It is also true that we can enhance our hand - eye coordination through these ingenious devices. Continue reading to discover how to communicate with friends via the computer. We can converse with friends on the computer through one of the most prevalent websites, Facebook. Approximately @NUM1 individuals utilize Facebook, which accounts for @PERCENT1! Not only that, but we can also make new friends on the computer by discussing games or popular @CAPS1.V. shows. Would it not be delightful to reunite with all our old school friends whom we seldom see? My mother often remarks that this is how she maintains close relationships with her friends, and the same holds true for me. Do you wish to explore far - flung places without incurring excessive costs? If so, you should definitely search for some excellent websites that elucidate the culture and other details of different parts of the world. It is also feasible to obtain a concise history lesson on certain web pages. Suppose you are planning a trip but are unsure of your destination; in that case, you can rely on the beloved internet. Continue reading to learn how the internet aids in improving hand - eye coordination. We can enhance hand - eye coordination in numerous ways by using the computer. For example, we can practice typing essays and other work projects. @PERCENT2 of computer users type faster than they write. That is nearly everyone. Moreover, do you not think typing is swifter than writing? Additionally, we can see the words we are typing while pressing the keys with our hands. Thank you for reading my essay on why computers are beneficial to our society. Just remember that we learn more every day from computers. We can also communicate with friends and plan our trips.
1467	1471	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, The utilization of computers exerts a positive influence on individuals. For example, they facilitate superior communication with friends and family, offer instantaneous news on any subject, and provide advanced educational opportunities. Imagine a scenario where an important business entity attempts to contact you via cellphone, but you miss the call. There is no need to worry as the person can easily reach you through a simple email. Computers also have a positive impact because, if you have a Facebook account or use other interactive websites, you can constantly stay informed about your friends' lives without having to reach out to them repeatedly to inquire about their well - being. Every adult watches the news at night before going to bed to learn what has transpired. However, what if you retire early? How would you know what happened? This is when you can go online to check what you missed. You could have missed significant events in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, or updates on the wars in @LOCATION1, or even tragedies that occurred nearby. Not only do computers enable better communication and put the news at your fingertips, but they also offer advanced education. If a student is working on a science project and the available materials do not contain all the necessary information, the internet serves as a means to expand educational horizons. There are also various other benefits. Therefore, computers do have a positive effect on people. You can maintain communication, stay updated with the latest news, and receive an advanced education.
1468	1472	1	1	Dear local newspaper, this article will discuss the reasons why computers can be detrimental. Firstly, computers are disadvantageous because individuals may not have the time to appreciate nature when the weather is pleasant and warm. Secondly, people may not spend time with their families or friends at all. The only instances when they would step away from the computer are to pay bills or purchase computer games. The third reason is that it becomes challenging for them to secure employment. They are reluctant to get up and search for a job because they are engrossed in the entertainment provided by the computer. Only when the power is cut off might they engage in unwise actions to pay the bill so that they can resume playing. This creates a vicious cycle. This is why having a computer can be a drawback. Some people are overly fond of playing computer games, while others are not. Thus, computers can be harmful to certain individuals. This is merely my opinion, and there are likely many others who share the same view. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
1469	1473	1	1	The rationale behind my belief that computers are beneficial is that people enjoy using them for work, and children are fond of the games available on computers. Secondly, adults prefer to conduct their jobs online. Finally, individuals who own computers are likely to be content because computers are highly useful tools that allow users to perform a wide range of tasks. In my opinion, computers are advantageous for people as they enable us to engage in various activities such as playing games, accessing social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, and numerous other websites. Overall, computers offer a plethora of opportunities and conveniences, making them an invaluable asset in our lives.
1470	1474	1	1	The reason why I think computers are good is because people like to do their work, or children likes the games on the computers. The second reasons is that adults likes to do their jobs online. Finally people who have computers are probably happy because computers is a good thing to have because you can do everything on it. My opinion is that computers are good for people because you can do everything like play game, go on myspace, facebook, twiter and alot of other websites.
1471	1475	1	1	It is my contention that computers are not entirely detrimental to individuals; in fact, they can offer numerous benefits. For instance, computers enable people to communicate instantaneously across the globe and provide access to a vast array of new information. However, a significant drawback is that some individuals spend excessive time on computers, leading to a lack of physical activity. Firstly, computers are advantageous as they facilitate the rapid dissemination of news and information worldwide. Recently, during the conflict in @LOCATION1, news reporters were prohibited from entering towns and cities where battles were taking place. Nevertheless, social messaging platforms like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 disseminated news through cellphone videos and pictures that would have otherwise remained unseen without the aid of computers and the internet. Secondly, computers empower people to acquire knowledge on various topics within minutes. For example, if one requires information about a particular country, they can easily retrieve it using a computer. Similarly, if a recipe for an @CAPS3 dessert is needed, a computer can be used to search for it. Additionally, individuals can use a computer to check the weather forecast. With a computer, anyone can access the world's knowledge. Lastly, the primary argument against computer use is that it leads to a sedentary lifestyle and insufficient exercise. However, statistics indicate that a significant proportion of heavy computer users maintain a healthy level of physical activity. A recent study revealed that among internet users with an average grade of A or higher, many also engage in regular exercise. In conclusion, computers are neither entirely beneficial nor entirely harmful to society. Their strengths lie in facilitating communication and enabling rapid knowledge acquisition, while the main drawback is that a minority of users may experience a lack of exercise. In my view, the advantages of computers far outweigh the disadvantages.
1472	1476	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am cognizant of the fact that the usage of computers is increasing daily. I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on both adults and children. Computers serve as valuable tools by providing information about various aspects of other countries, states, and towns. Moreover, they assist children with their schoolwork and homework. Additionally, computers facilitate communication with friends and family members who reside at a considerable distance. Computers offer access to the latest and most recent events occurring in different regions. For instance, if one wishes to obtain information about an event that took place approximately @NUM1 years ago, it may not be available on @CAPS1.V., but can be easily retrieved from the internet. Without the internet, it would be challenging to find the desired information. Another significant advantage of computers is their utility in helping children with their academic tasks. Typed work is generally neater and more legible, making it easier to understand. I understand the concerns of some parents regarding their children's computer usage for homework. There is a possibility that children may engage in other activities or rely on the computer for answers that they could otherwise solve independently. However, using a computer for homework can ensure the accuracy of the work. Finally, computers play a crucial role in reconnecting with friends and family members. If someone has friends or family who have relocated to another area, the computer can assist in obtaining information about their whereabouts. While this may pose a risk to individuals who may misuse this information for stalking or abuse, in most cases, it can be extremely beneficial for reuniting families and maintaining connections. It enables families to stay in touch and friends to remain close. I am curious to know your thoughts on computers. Some people may have reservations about them, but they also have valid reasons. While it is important to allocate time for family activities, I believe that it is possible to strike a balance between computer usage, family time, and physical exercise. Well, my time is up. I hope you found my perspective on computers insightful and that it has kindled your interest in their benefits.
1473	1477	1	1	I am convinced that computers exert a multitude of effects on individuals, particularly on their eyes, bodies, and minds. Firstly, excessive proximity to the computer screen can have a detrimental impact on one's eyesight. Prolonged exposure to the screen may lead to vision impairment, potentially resulting in the loss of eyesight and the inability to perform various activities such as reading or playing. It is essential to exercise caution when using computers and maintain an appropriate distance from the screen. Secondly, a sedentary lifestyle associated with excessive computer use can have adverse effects on one's physical health. Spending an entire day sitting in front of a computer without engaging in physical activity can lead to weight gain and a decrease in overall fitness levels. This can limit one's ability to participate in physical activities and may have long-term health consequences. Thirdly, computers can have a significant impact on one's mental state. Immersing oneself in computer games or videos for extended periods can lead to a lack of focus and concentration, making it difficult to perform tasks in other areas of life. It is important to maintain a healthy balance between computer use and other activities to ensure optimal mental well-being. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is crucial to use them responsibly and in moderation. I encourage everyone to limit their computer usage, engage in regular physical exercise, and pursue other activities that promote a healthy and balanced lifestyle. By doing so, we can minimize the negative effects of computers and enjoy their benefits to the fullest.
1474	1478	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I pose the question: Have computers ever caused harm to anyone? In my opinion, the impacts of computers on individuals are predominantly positive. Firstly, computers facilitate communication and social interaction, enabling people to connect with others regardless of geographical barriers. Even if individuals are located on opposite sides of the globe, they can engage in real-time conversations and maintain relationships. Secondly, computers enhance productivity in various professional settings, particularly in fields that require mathematical calculations and data analysis. They streamline processes, reduce errors, and enable individuals to complete tasks more efficiently. Lastly, computers provide access to a wealth of information and educational resources, allowing people to explore distant places and learn about diverse subjects with a simple click of a button. Thanks to the internet, individuals worldwide can communicate as if they were neighbors. For example, if a friend or family member relocates to another country or state, they may be separated for an extended period. However, computers enable them to stay connected and maintain regular contact, bridging the physical distance. In addition to their social benefits, computers offer practical applications in business and finance. They allow individuals to monitor their investments, track income and expenses, and analyze market trends. For instance, if a business owner needs to adjust the price of their products but is unable to access the necessary information due to a car breakdown or other obstacles, a computer provides a convenient solution. They can simply log in to their account and make the changes from the comfort of their own home. Moreover, computers serve as valuable educational tools, offering virtual tours of historical sites, scientific simulations, and interactive learning experiences. They enable individuals to expand their knowledge and understanding of the world without leaving their homes. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a remarkable invention with numerous positive impacts. They enhance communication, improve productivity, and provide access to a vast amount of information. While it is important to use computers responsibly and in moderation, their benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Therefore, I encourage everyone to embrace the opportunities that computers offer and make the most of their capabilities.
1475	1479	1	1	In my opinion, computers should be utilized for a multitude of purposes. One significant advantage is the ability to engage in online conversations with friends and family members. This feature allows individuals to stay connected, regardless of geographical distances. For instance, if someone is embarking on a long journey and requires directions, they can communicate with someone who has the necessary knowledge and receive real-time guidance. Additionally, computers enable individuals to maintain contact with family members who do not reside in the same location. Another valuable use of computers is accessing weather information. If one is planning a trip or needs to make arrangements for the next day, they can easily check the weather forecast online. Moreover, computers offer a convenient platform for exercise. Individuals can access various workout videos on platforms like YouTube and engage in physical activities from the comfort of their own homes. Computers also provide access to news and current events. By searching for @CAPS1 on a computer, users can stay informed about the latest happenings around the world. Some individuals may question the necessity of computers, but I encourage them to experience the benefits firsthand. Once they explore the wide range of activities and information available on computers, they will be astonished. While it may be advisable for children to have limited access to computers initially, as they grow older, computers can become valuable tools for learning and research. In conclusion, there are numerous reasons why people should own computers. They enhance communication, provide access to information, and offer entertainment options. By making the most of computers, individuals can enrich their lives and stay connected with the world.
1476	1480	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to convey the adverse impacts of computer usage on individuals. How would one respond if they lacked the time to engage in physical activity, appreciate nature, or socialize with family and friends? Some individuals fail to recognize that they are forfeiting the opportunity to partake in such activities due to excessive computer use. The question “No time to exercise?” might cross the minds of discerning individuals. This phrase precisely denotes that, as people squander their daily time on the computer, whether gaming or chatting, they are unable to pursue their desired activities, often physical exercise. What about nature? Are you someone who relishes the beauty of nature? I certainly am. Since time seems to fly by when people are engrossed in computer use, sometimes without their awareness, they may find themselves thinking, “I never got to take a stroll through the forest and enjoy nature.” While they may claim to do so eventually, the reality is that such statements rarely serve as motivation. It is akin to saying, “I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow, and if not, I'll do it the next day.” Chances are, the person making such a statement will procrastinate indefinitely. What has become of spending quality time with family and friends? It is evident that all such opportunities have been sacrificed for computer use. People are oblivious to the fact that they are squandering their time on the computer and consequently lack the time to sit down and converse with their family, have fun, or go out with friends to watch a movie. As we are aware, an increasing number of people are using computers, which, in my opinion, has a detrimental effect on them as they lack the time for exercise, nature appreciation, and social interaction. The time spent on the computer is supplanting the time for these activities, which is far from desirable. Computers have a negative impact on individuals, and I advocate for finding ways to reduce computer usage.
1477	1481	1	1	Dear Local [Publication Name], I wholeheartedly support the integration of computers into our society as they offer numerous benefits. They facilitate our understanding of countries worldwide and keep us informed about global events. For instance, if one wishes to explore a country's sports scene, simply typing in the relevant name provides comprehensive information. Moreover, computers play a crucial role in education. When students encounter difficulties with their homework assignments, they can turn to computers for assistance. Additionally, computers offer a source of entertainment. On a cold, rainy day when there is limited to do, students can engage in games on the computer. They also serve as an effective means of communication. Platforms such as Facebook, [Another Platform], Twitter, and email are excellent channels for staying connected with friends. Furthermore, for those with gaming consoles like Xbox or [Console Name], a computer is necessary to connect a card and play online with friends. Computers are invaluable in educational institutions. Teachers can assign students to visit specific websites for learning purposes, and computers can aid in completing large - scale projects. I firmly believe that these are compelling reasons to embrace computers in our society, as they offer multifaceted advantages.
1478	1482	1	1	An increasing number of individuals are inclined to spend more time on computers than venturing outdoors to enjoy the weather. In my view, people should curtail their computer usage and allocate more time to social interaction. Most individuals devote a significant portion of their time to chatting on websites or playing online games. This, in my opinion, is an unwholesome habit. People of all ages engage in such activities instead of pursuing more enjoyable endeavors. Parents bear the responsibility of monitoring their children's computer usage and ensuring their safety, as the internet can be perilous. There have been numerous cases of individuals being harmed, including instances of rape and other crimes on websites such as [Dangerous Site 1], [Dangerous Site 2], and other hazardous platforms. Moreover, both children and adults often interact with strangers online, believing they know them well. They may arrange to meet these strangers, which can lead to tragic consequences, as many people lie about their age. One could be communicating with a fifty - year - old individual who claims to be a teenager. This is precisely why parents should regulate their children's computer access and set appropriate time limits. As you peruse this letter, I hope you comprehend the perils of excessive computer use and consider my suggestions. Your support in guiding young individuals is greatly appreciated.
1479	1483	1	1	To: [Recipient's Name], This letter pertains to the role of computers in our daily lives. Computers have become an integral part of our existence, enabling us to engage in a plethora of activities such as gaming, video - watching, web - searching, and global communication. They are particularly beneficial for students, as they can complete and store classwork on computers. While some individuals may be addicted to computers, others use them only when necessary. Computers have a profound impact on people's lives. Although excessive computer use can be detrimental, it also offers a wealth of information. Every time one logs on to a computer, they have the opportunity to acquire new knowledge. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers have a positive and significant influence on individuals.
1480	1484	1	1	Over [Percentage] of [Organization] households own at least one computer. Computers are of great benefit to society as they contribute to environmental conservation and serve as a rapid medium for disseminating vital information. They also enable communication with friends and family. It has been suggested that some people spend an excessive amount of time on computers. While this may be true, these machines are indispensable for our survival. [News Outlet] conducted a poll and reported that over half of [Location] schools are now using computers to assign homework, thereby conserving paper. If we were to use computers for tasks that traditionally require paper, we could save millions of trees. For example, sending an email is not only faster but also more environmentally friendly than traditional mail. Those concerned about the environment create websites on computers to educate people on [Environmental Action]. If people used computers to communicate instead of relying solely on cell phones, they could mitigate the harm to bees, as cell phone waves kill approximately [Number] bees annually. Chatting with friends on the computer would save these precious lives. On a snow day, my parents once forgot to check the school's website, and I ended up outside in the snow. Without computers, such situations could happen to every student during snow - related events. During a storm, computers provide a reliable source for checking the weather and ensuring family safety. In the event of a hurricane or power outage, computers can be used to keep track of important dates like birthdays and weddings through their built - in calendars. [Organization] citizens spend over [Amount] on phone bills each year. By using computers to communicate with friends and family, they could save thousands of dollars. When parents do not have access to phones, they rely on computers to stay in touch. Have your children ever had a friend who moved away, and they spent hours communicating? With video chat on the computer, they can talk and see each other as if they were in the same room. It is high time, citizens of [Town Name], to recognize that computers are beneficial for the environment, a fast way to share information, and a means to connect with friends online. Get up and write to our local newspaper to advocate for the continued use of computers in our society.
1481	1485	1	1	Dear local newspaper, are you aware that approximately @PERCENT1 of the residents in the @LOCATION1 own computers and utilize them on a daily basis? I am among those individuals, and I fail to comprehend why some people assert that computers are detrimental to our nation. Indeed, I acknowledge that we may spend slightly less time with our family and friends. Nevertheless, computers assist us in monitoring weather conditions and natural disasters such as tornadoes and hurricanes. They offer us the opportunity to explore distant places, gain a deeper understanding of the world, and engage in conversations with others. Computers are of utmost importance in our world as they enable us to monitor natural @CAPS1, including tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Without this technology, over @PERCENT2 more individuals would perish from these @CAPS1 due to the lack of or limited warning about the situation. Over @PERCENT3 of children in the @CAPS2.S attend school, and with the aid of computers, they have a better chance of learning about the world and society. Whether one is a child or an adult browsing the web for information, the fact remains that numerous people around the world rely on computers for learning. Another reason is that computers help teach children typing skills and hand - eye coordination. As children grow older and reach @CAPS3, they will need to know how to type. In essence, if one lacks typing skills, they may face difficulties in the real world. To conclude, I will reiterate my three reasons for the necessity of computers. Firstly, they are essential for tracking natural disasters. Secondly, they facilitate learning about distant places and our society. Thirdly, they teach children hand - eye coordination and typing skills to prepare them for @CAPS3. This is why the @CAPS2.S truly requires computers.
1482	1486	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I recognize that an increasing number of individuals are using computers, and this phenomenon has both positive and negative aspects. Do you spend hours on the computer each day? This could be detrimental. I am of the opinion that computers are beneficial, but only when used appropriately. Hopefully, by the end of this discussion, you will understand my perspective on this matter. Nowadays, almost everyone uses a computer. The issue is that many people spend an excessive amount of time on it. They claim to be improving their hand - eye coordination, yet in reality, they are squandering their lives sitting on a chair. They communicate less with other members of the household, which is not conducive to fostering a large, happy family environment. They assert that they are obtaining important information, but in truth, they may be exposed to false information and viruses. There are malicious individuals out there who may hack into your computer and ruin your day. Platforms like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 may have people who wish to gather personal information about you with the intention of causing harm. Undoubtedly, using the computer has its drawbacks. However, there are also positive aspects, provided that one does not overindulge. Playing the right games on the computer can enhance hand - eye coordination. Moreover, it can be an educational tool, as many websites offer accurate information about places or things, allowing you to gain knowledge without direct experience. It can also be a useful resource and an effortless way to purchase items by simply placing an order. Most importantly, it can provide entertainment. So, where do you stand on this argument? Do you believe that too many people are overly reliant on the computer, or do you think computers can be excellent as long as one exercises caution? I, for one, choose the latter. What about you?
1483	1487	1	1	Research indicates that @PERCENT1 of individuals addicted to computers are physically unfit and do not participate in sports. I own a computer at home and am well - aware of the enjoyment derived from chatting with friends on @CAPS1 or other similar platforms. If one is unfit and fails to appreciate the beauty of nature, they will not know how to lead a fulfilling life. I am not suggesting that one will achieve nothing in life, but it will lack excitement. I am an avid sports enthusiast and engage in a variety of sports. I am in good physical condition, and while I do enjoy chatting with friends on @CAPS1, I recognize that it is not as significant as breathing fresh air and playing sports with friends. Undoubtedly, computers have both advantages and disadvantages. One can learn about distant places without traveling there, but where is the fun in that? For instance, if you go snowboarding in @LOCATION1, don't you feel exhilarated when descending that @CAPS3? I certainly do, as opposed to staying at home on the computer. Nature is truly magnificent, and I am grateful to God for bestowing upon us this beauty and all the animals. It enriches our lives and makes them more wonderful. I relish taking hikes with my family up a @CAPS3. The fresh air is unparalleled, and even riding your @CAPS5 along a trail offers an indescribable beauty that cannot be found elsewhere. Medical studies reveal that @PERCENT2 of people who spend more than @NUM1 hours a day on a computer wear glasses or have poor vision. These individuals did not desire poor eyesight, but due to excessive computer use, they have suffered this consequence, which is truly unfortunate. As you can see, computers can significantly impact our lives. The choice is yours. Distinguish between right and wrong, and make the decision that is best for you.
1484	1488	1	1	I firmly believe that computers are highly valuable and beneficial to a large number of people. Computers should be utilized to access information that can assist students with their homework or aid in test preparation. Additionally, adults can use them to look up directions, addresses, and prices of clothing and other items. They are also advantageous as they facilitate communication with friends and help people plan activities with them. However, some individuals should restrict their usage of platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Some people spend an excessive amount of time on these sites and should limit themselves to @NUM1 minutes per day. One reason I consider computers to be useful is that some students may not know the answers to their homework questions and can use the computer to find the solutions. Another reason is that if a student has a science quiz on mitosis and cells the next day and does not fully understand the concepts, they can use the computer to study and perform well on the quiz. Moreover, computers are beneficial for communication with friends. Some children are introverted and not very proficient at interacting with others in person. Social networking sites can help them become more outgoing, less shy, and make more friends. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, some people become overly engrossed and spend too much time on these sites. They should limit their daily usage to @NUM1 minutes. Some individuals use their computers for other important tasks such as online shopping and obtaining directions and addresses. If someone wants to visit a store in a different town but does not know its location, they can look up the address and find the directions. People also use computers to purchase groceries and clothing. Sometimes, they save money by buying items on sale online rather than paying full price at a store. As is evident, computers have numerous advantages. Therefore, I encourage you to support the use of computers, as they are incredibly useful and valuable.
1485	1489	1	1	Dear local newspaper, in my view, an excessive number of people are spending too much time on the @ORGANIZATION1. This over - reliance is leading to an increase in obesity as people are not getting enough exercise. Children are choosing to use the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of completing their homework. It is even possible that during a family member's illness or passing, one might prioritize time on the @ORGANIZATION1 over being with that loved one. All these issues are arising due to the widespread use of computers. It is astonishing that over @PERCENT1 of the residents in New @CAPS1 claim to be gaining weight and becoming obese. When I inquired about the cause, someone named @PERSON1 stated that computers are taking over people's lives. In fact, computers have become the enemy of those most affected by their overuse. As a child, the @ORGANIZATION1 has been a distraction from my homework. I used to achieve A's and B's on my report card, but now my grades have declined to @CAPS2. The @ORGANIZATION1 is significantly altering my life, but not for the better. You may not be aware, but your child could be going through the same ordeal as me. You should start monitoring their homework instead of allowing them to mindlessly use the @ORGANIZATION1 and neglect their studies, as I did. Try to prevent this situation. Imagine the tears running down your face and the self - disappointment you would feel if a loved one passes away and you did not spend enough time with them. Once again, it is the @ORGANIZATION1 that has caused this. The decisions made under the influence of the @ORGANIZATION1 can have long - lasting and terrifying consequences. We who own computers are beginning to realize that they were not created for entirely good purposes. Instead, they distract us from our daily activities and our time with family and friends. Turn away from the @ORGANIZATION1 and say no to the thing that could shatter your life. How do you feel about this? I feel remorseful because I allowed something so seemingly insignificant to disrupt my life. You still have time to change your life and reject the overuse of computers. They can cause obesity due to lack of exercise, and a loved one's well - being may be affected by the @ORGANIZATION1 in your home. Worst of all, you may miss out on precious time with your dearest family member. The computers we own are ruining our lives as we know it. Simply say no to computers and live your life to the fullest. Don't you feel regretful that you let something so small ruin your life?
1486	1490	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, the impacts that computers have on individuals are such that people become overly reliant on them, which is detrimental as they have less time for physical exercise, appreciating nature, and interacting with family and friends. Firstly, having limited time for exercise is unfavorable because @NUM1 out of @NUM2 individuals end up struggling with obesity. ""You wouldn't want to be among those people, trust me,"" stated @PERSON1. Secondly, enjoying nature is a worthwhile activity instead of engaging with a computer, as one can obtain their daily dose of fresh air by doing so. ""You also have a great deal of fun,"" remarked @LOCATION1. Lastly, interacting with family and friends is enjoyable, and who doesn't relish that? ""Spending time with the family is delightful as you get to visit various places,"" said @PERSON3. ""Who doesn't love going out and spending time with friends on the weekends?"" said @PERSON2. These are the reasons why the effects of computers on people are not beneficial."
1487	1491	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 and readers of @ORGANIZATION1, the @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, envision a modern world regressed to the @NUM1 era, where one must drive a car rapidly to purchase groceries, yet would have to endure hours of travel just to buy some milk. Entertainment is lackluster, and it is arduous to acquire books for learning. Ceasing the utilization of @ORGANIZATION1 technology such as computers would undoubtedly be the initial step in reverting us to such a primitive time! Computers offer job opportunities, educational prospects, and a means of communicating with others! I implore you to continue using computers, for without them, our modern civilization would be lost! Firstly, it is crucial to note that during our economic crisis, the development and manufacturing of computers generate thousands of jobs! In fact, each year, @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION3 jobs are created in the @CAPS5.S alone in conjunction with the advancement of computers! Were the customers who purchase these products to discontinue doing so, these jobs would be forfeited, and any progress made in the economic crisis would surely falter! Do you, the just people of our nation, wish to be accountable for such a catastrophe? Recently, the @ORGANIZATION3 stated in a cover - page article that, ""without the development of computers in technology in @DATE2, @DATE3 more people would be unemployed in the @LOCATION4A!"" Moreover, undoubtedly, numerous educational opportunities would be lost for your children if you were to halt using computers! Computers present the most convenient way to conduct research and gather information. ""@CAPS7 @PERSON1, a preeminent educational provider in history. A group of young and brilliant teachers led by @PERSON3 have implemented a program at the @ORGANIZATION1 using computers. This program enables students to view world cultures in an engaging manner through videos! For your visually - oriented children, this is a far superior method of learning than using books! In fact, @PERSON2, the superintendent of schools in @LOCATION1, recently stated in this newspaper, the @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, that he plans to implement the program in all @LOCATION1 schools during the @NUM3 year! He requires the town's support for this idea to materialize. He recently distributed fliers to local citizens with the impactful heading, ""@CAPS10. Goy @PERSON2 @CAPS11 you to expand learning by using computers!"" Additionally, communication is an essential aspect of using computers. In fact, the internet, accessible only via a computer, offers the fastest means of communication apart from telephones! ""@CAPS13, @CAPS7, a computer expert for @ORGANIZATION2, ""computers offer far more than telephones! One can not only converse via the internet but also engage in web - chatting, exchange files and crucial data, and market and sell items to customers!"" If you stop using computers, you deprive yourself of this remarkable mode of communication! My sister resides in @LOCATION3, and as a result, I rarely get to see or even talk to her. Then, when my mom bought me a laptop, we were able to communicate again. She assists me with all my personal problems, and without this means of communication, our connection would be lost. Now, envision a modern, civilized world. You, the parents, head to work while your child attends @ORGANIZATION1 and enters the wonderful learning realm of computers. In @LOCATION2, your beloved sister is currently sending you an email. This ideal scenario is achievable if you continue to use computers! They provide jobs, educational opportunities, and a means of communication! You don't have to use them constantly; still enjoy nature and have fun with friends, dear readers, but don't forget about computers! Computer usage will keep you in the @DATE1!"
1488	1492	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I opine that computers can exert a negative influence on individuals from a very early age, commencing at thirteen and persisting through adulthood. People spend extended periods on the computer when they could be engaging in physical exercise or participating in outdoor activities. Computers can make some individuals feel as though life is being snatched away from them. Spending excessive time on a computer can severely damage a person's posture. It is said that when some people use a computer, a sense of comfort overtakes them, and they hunch over with their backs bent and remain in that position for extended periods. Imagine a person being confined in a cramped space for eight hours, and upon emerging, having all their joints and muscles stretched due to the accumulated tension. This is precisely what we do to our bodies when we use computers.
1489	1493	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I contend that computers confer positive benefits upon society. Without computers, we would be less socially active. We would also lack the ability to conduct online research for school, and running a business would become even more arduous. Without computers, our society would not have advanced to such an extent. Being sociable is an essential trait in life. Currently, aside from texting, the primary way to be social is to chat online with friends. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and Skype all empower their users to make new friends, reconnect with long - lost friends, and converse with existing friends. Personally, I have a Skype and a Facebook account and can access them daily. Without them, I would only be able to interact with friends outside of school through sports and texting. Every day, I exercise, lift weights, and then log on to Facebook. Hence, the statement ""spending less time exercising and more time on the computer"" is inaccurate. Facebook and Skype are integral parts of my daily life, and without them, I am certain I would not be as sociable. Computers are also indispensable in my daily routine as I need to use them to conduct research for school or type up an @CAPS5 paper. As you can observe, my handwriting is not exemplary, so I often end up typing most of my homework. Without computers, my teachers would struggle to read my work. Computers also facilitate the creation of graphs and data tables for science lab reports. Without a computer, these graphs would have to be hand - drawn, which is less presentable. Overall, computers are used daily in school for research or typing up homework. Education is a cornerstone of society, and if we did not utilize computers, the education we receive would be vastly different. My final reason for believing that computers play a positive role in society is that they are the driving force behind businesses. Without computers, some businesses would be unable to operate, and those that could would function at a snail's pace. Given the advanced state of our society, businesses rely on computers to complete their tasks. Expenses and income are stored on business computers; if this were all done on paper, the data could be lost or damaged. Computers also streamline work for businesses, accelerating tasks that would take a long time to complete manually and accomplishing tasks that are impossible without a computer. Computers play a significant role in the @CAPS6 of the world."
1490	1494	1	1	Dear editor, computers are among the most remarkable inventions in human history. They confer benefits upon society in every conceivable aspect and have numerous positive impacts on individuals. Computers enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to access knowledge on a wide range of subjects not covered in books, and allow millions of people to communicate with friends and family daily. The most crucial function of computers is in the realm of learning. Through computers, billions of people acquire knowledge that would otherwise be inaccessible. Many people, including myself, check the weather on the computer daily to ensure we are appropriately dressed and prepared. Without computers, I would be at a loss. Also, on nights when it snows, I always check the school's website upon waking to confirm that school is still in session. This is an invaluable resource, and I cannot fathom life without it. Another advantage of computers is the ability to access the news. With a simple click of the mouse, one can find out who won the presidency or what shows are airing tonight. Another remarkable aspect of computers is their significant improvement of eye - hand coordination. This benefits not only my mother, who checks her email constantly, but also my three - year - old sister, who loves to move the mouse and type random letters on documents. It can keep her entertained for days, but more importantly, it enhances her eye - hand coordination with every passing second she spends at the computer. This enhanced skill will be of great assistance to her in the future when she starts playing sports and riding bikes. Finally, computers enable millions of friends and family members to communicate freely on a daily basis. If classmates forget to write down their homework, they can instantly email the teacher, obtain the exact details of the assignment, and even open and print the attached sheet. A few weeks ago, my father traveled to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was extremely costly to call him on his phone. So, every few days, he video - chatted with me instead, allowing me to talk to him, learn about his activities, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was a precious experience that would not have been possible without computers. As is evident, computers assist us in numerous ways that we often overlook, such as educating us, improving our eye - hand coordination, and enabling us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a few of the positive effects and benefits that computers offer.
1491	1495	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I concur with the experts that individuals allocate an excessive amount of time to computers. Instead, they ought to engage in physical exercise, indulge in reading, or spend quality time with friends and family. Regrettably, people often exhibit indolence and prefer sedentary computer - based activities. If they fail to diversify their activities and remain online, they risk becoming overweight. Firstly, people need to exercise. They should take strolls around the neighborhood, visit the gym, or participate in sports rather than idly spending the entire day on the computer. Without regular exercise, one is prone to becoming overweight and lethargic. Secondly, individuals should prioritize spending time with friends and family instead of neglecting them for computer - related tasks. Such behavior is discourteous. One could organize a family game night, dine out with family members, watch a movie, go skating, or visit the park with friends, which are far more enjoyable than being online all day. Lastly, everyone should set aside time for reading. Simply visit the local library and borrow a book. Reading is more beneficial for the brain than engaging in trivial computer activities. In conclusion, I firmly believe that people should reduce their online time. Insufficient exercise can lead to weight gain and laziness, neglecting friends and family is impolite, and reading is highly advantageous, unlike excessive computer use. That concludes my thoughts for now.
1492	1496	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 posits that humanity experiences both ascents and descents, along with positive and negative aspects. The same holds true for technology. It has its advantages and disadvantages, yet it propels our society towards increasing sophistication. It provides us with opportunities to refine our capabilities and set ambitious goals. With technology, we initiate remarkable endeavors. Computers serve as educational tools and can sometimes offer guidance. One click on a link may present an extraordinary opportunity, while clicking on the wrong one could introduce a virus. Computers can relieve us from the stresses of life and transport us to an ideal realm. They also allow us to discover knowledge that was previously unknown.
1493	1497	1	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, are you aware that over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 families own a computer? Perhaps you are, but were you informed that at least half of that @PERCENT1 encounter family - related issues? The crux of the matter is whether computers exert a positive or negative influence on humanity. In my opinion, this invention is having a detrimental impact on society. Nowadays, there are inappropriate websites that children should not access, and computers consume time that could be spent with family. However, the primary reason is the recent @CAPS3 incident. Undoubtedly, young people are proficient with the internet. Sometimes, they may accidentally stumble upon an inappropriate website. There are countless adult websites that children aged @DATE1 visit daily. This is unacceptable, which is why access to such content should be restricted. No responsible parent would tolerate a @NUM1 - year - old on an adult website, and computers make it challenging for parents to prevent this. In my experience, computers detract from family time. When my family had a computer, my family member (@CAPS4) was constantly occupied with it, and we rarely spent time together. She once said, ""If I never got on the computer, we'd be doing something together right now,"" and she was correct. Whenever my brother and I used the computer, we'd stay indoors all day. Since then, we've spent more time together, and I believe computers have a negative impact on society, especially considering the recent @CAPS3 incident. I was summoned to the office one day and informed that a group on @CAPS3.com had befriended me and was exploiting boys and girls for drug - related activities and prostitution. People misuse computers to access personal information. This situation could have been avoided but was not. Now, it's your turn to form an opinion. I hope you'll share my view on the pros and cons of computers. Remember, computers host numerous websites that are harmful to young children, they reduce family time, and the recent @CAPS3 incident is a prime example of their negative influence."
1494	1498	1	1	Dear Newspaper editor, I wish to present @CAPS3 regarding the advantages of computer ownership. For instance, computers enable us to acquire knowledge that would otherwise be inaccessible. They also facilitate communication through chat rooms, allowing us to interact with friends and other individuals. Moreover, they enhance the teaching process. In many countries, computers are a standard educational tool, enabling us to learn a wide range of subjects. However, when introduced to tribes in @LOCATION1, a computer may seem like an alien object. Once they learn to use it, it can broaden their perspectives. Many people in remote tribes and areas are unaware of significant events such as the moon landing. Another benefit of computers is the ability to pay bills, including taxes, insurance, and credit card payments. This feature is particularly useful when one is unable to leave home or when the relevant offices are closed, thus preventing late fees and potentially saving substantial amounts of money. Many individuals use computers for socialization by joining online platforms such as @CAPS1, Twitter, and MySpace, where they can view pictures and stay updated on their friends' activities. Additionally, @CAPS2 allows users to send messages to friends. Furthermore, computers offer a variety of gaming options, including single - player and online games with millions of concurrent players. They can also be connected to other gaming systems, and users can access hints and cheats. The most significant advantage of computers is their impact on education. They have revolutionized the way students complete homework. Instead of traditional worksheets, students can use computers to complete assignments, print them, or email them to their teachers. They also simplify research for projects and homework, providing more reliable and comprehensive information. Additionally, many teachers use computers to present videos as part of their lessons, making it easier for students to understand and learn. This not only enhances the learning experience but also prepares students for future success. Many students are more engaged when watching a video on a computer than during a traditional lecture. In conclusion, I believe the computer is an excellent invention, and every family and school should own one. I hope you find my @CAPS3 persuasive and choose to publish it.
1495	1499	1	1	"Dear @PERSON2, while @CAPS1's latest article on the merits and demerits of computers in society was informative, I believe it overlooked several significant reasons why technology may be causing more harm than good. If people fail to recognize the consequences, the future of our world remains uncertain. Firstly, I would like to highlight the health issues associated with technology, particularly computers. Dr. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION2 asserts that ""@CAPS2 since the advent of popular websites like '@CAPS3' and '@CAPS4', there has been a significant increase in obesity - related heart disease and diabetes."" @PERSON3's statement is not an exaggeration. Due to the rapid growth of electronics, more people prefer to sit on the couch with their laptops or @CAPS5 rather than engage in physical activities such as cycling or playing sports with friends. As a result, an increasing number of individuals are at risk of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and bone - related disorders that could lead to lifelong paralysis. Is the allure of online games truly worth sacrificing one's health? Secondly, although the internet may seem like an ideal platform for social interaction, it can actually contribute to the loss of friendships rather than the formation of new ones. I can anticipate your thoughts, @PERSON2: 'But sites like '@CAPS6' facilitate connections, so why would people lose friends?' In reality, the ease of online communication has led to a decline in actual social skills. People spend excessive time chatting with friends online without face - to - face interaction, which often results in the weakening of relationships. When communicating through a screen, it is difficult to determine the authenticity of a friendship. @PERSON4, a @NUM1 - year - old at @ORGANIZATION1, claims that he and his best friend now only communicate via @CAPS3 and no longer feel like true friends. Finally, I have a request. The next time you power on your laptop, pause and reflect. Is it truly worth sacrificing your health and friendships? When the urge to update your status with a mundane message like '@CAPS8 got home' arises, consider inviting a friend over instead. I urge you to think twice before succumbing to the allure of technology."
1496	1500	1	1	Dear local newspaper editor, I firmly believe that excessive computer usage can exert detrimental effects on individuals. People are highly susceptible to computer addiction. Moreover, computers consume a substantial amount of electricity. Additionally, many individuals spend the entire day seated in front of a computer, neglecting physical exercise. These are all the adverse impacts of computers; however, they are not entirely negative, as life might be somewhat more challenging without them.  Engaging in computer games and online poker may seem appealing, but this perception is misguided. People become addicted to these activities on a daily basis. Online poker can be particularly hazardous. I recall watching a program about a man who was addicted to it. He would input his credit card details and play for hours on end. Before he realized it, he had accumulated a significant debt. Once addicted, it became extremely difficult for him to break free from this habit. It is a foolish pursuit as there is little value in it. One simply sits and squanders money, especially given the current state of the economy. A recent study indicates that @PERCENT1 of individuals who play online poker become addicted within two weeks. Other games are also highly addictive. There is even a website named “Addicting.” It appears that people are unaware of the consequences of computer addiction on themselves and their families.  Did you know that @PERCENT2 of the electricity in @LOCATION1 is consumed by computers? That is nearly half of the total electricity dedicated to a single device. I find it unjust that almost all tasks are now carried out on computers. In the current economic crisis, I believe that energy should not be wasted on playing computer games. We could allocate this energy to more essential purposes that people truly require. If individuals did not rely so heavily on computers for communication and other activities, there would be no such issue. The number of computers sold has increased by @PERCENT3 since @DATE1.  I understand the necessity of emailing and using platforms like Facebook. However, we should not let these activities get out of hand. Is it not delightful to be outdoors on a beautiful day? Would you not prefer to enjoy the fresh air or engage in physical exercise rather than being glued to a computer screen? Obesity is a significant problem in @LOCATION1. Many people have become obese due to excessive computer use and a lack of physical activity. I remember when I was younger, every time I visited my friend's house, his father would be sitting at the computer, playing poker and other games. He was extremely out of shape and lethargic. Eventually, his parents divorced because he had transformed into an unrecognizable person. Most @CAPS1 tend to be lazy. We are reluctant to engage in physical activity if it is not necessary. I believe that we should choose to exercise or go outside rather than being constantly on the computer.  Leading a healthy lifestyle is more achievable when one is not addicted to computers. And when we are healthy, we are happier. In conclusion, if we do not exercise self - control when using computers, they can have severe negative impacts. Computers are easily addictive, consume a large amount of electricity, and can lead to obesity and laziness. Is it truly worth sacrificing friendships and family relationships for the sake of playing computer games?
1497	1501	1	1	Dear local newspaper editor, I advocate that households should be equipped with internet and computers. This is because computers enable us to communicate with friends and family, prevent boredom, and offer opportunities to learn new knowledge from various websites.  A significant majority, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in our school, recognize the benefits of having a computer. For instance, when my friend moved to @LOCATION1, communicating via phone was impractical due to long - distance charges. However, we were able to stay in touch through Facebook. There are numerous platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, and Skype that facilitate communication. Skype, in particular, allows for face - to - face interaction through webcams. My mother often chats online with her friends, demonstrating that age is not a barrier to enjoying the benefits of computer - mediated communication.  Computers are also excellent educational tools. Regardless of age, one can access a wealth of knowledge. Educational websites cover a wide range of subjects, including math, science, @CAPS1, and languages. Whenever I have social studies homework, I turn to the internet, and it has proven to be extremely helpful.  In addition to being educational, computers offer a variety of entertaining options. The diverse range of games available ensures that users will not get bored. Many parents express concerns about their children engaging in不良行为 on the streets. @NUM3 people believe that this is due to boredom. If children had access to computers, they could play games or interact with friends, which would keep them occupied and out of trouble. @STATE1 and @PERSON1 are states where a larger proportion of the population uses computers compared to other states.  It is important to note that computer use is not just about having fun. Everyone can benefit from owning a computer. While some people may view it negatively, it is not entirely without merit. We can chat with friends, learn important and interesting things, and avoid boredom. I hope you will recognize that internet access is not a waste of time. I am not alone in believing that “a computer is what keeps us alive.”
1498	1502	1	1	When individuals contemplate computers, the first thing that often comes to mind is games. However, computers possess far more utility than just gaming. For the majority of people, computers are highly valuable, especially in educational settings such as @ORGANIZATION1.  At @ORGANIZATION1, computers play a crucial role in assisting students with homework and projects. When assigned a project, students need to conduct research on a particular topic, and the computer provides the fastest and most efficient means of doing so. At @ORGANIZATION2, particularly among @NUM1 - graders, typing essays on the computer is preferred as it is both quicker and more convenient. Moreover, if students forget their homework at school, they can access it online, which is extremely helpful for both students and teachers.  Computers are also indispensable for finding information. Technological advancements have significantly enhanced the capabilities of computers. We can now use them to obtain directions to places that are difficult to locate. People can search for names, phone numbers, and addresses using reliable resources like the Yellow Pages website. For example, when planning a vacation and looking for accommodation, websites can help us find a suitable place, whether we are seeking a quick solution or a high - quality hotel at a reasonable price.  Computers can also be a source of entertainment and a means of sharing experiences. When visiting places like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, we can post pictures online to share our wonderful experiences. Additionally, if we want to reconnect with an old friend, we can search for them on @CAPS3 or other similar websites and resume our conversations. We can also play games and interact with friends while online.  Whether it is for educational purposes, information - seeking, or social interaction, computers can meet our diverse needs. Although there is a possibility that a computer may get damaged, there are professionals who can repair it. Moreover, computers offer more up - to - date and reliable resources compared to traditional books.
1499	1503	1	1	Dear local newspaper editor, I firmly believe that the increasing prevalence of computer usage has both positive and negative aspects, but overall, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.  In today's digital age, more and more individuals are embracing computers. However, opinions on this trend are divided. Supporters of technological progress assert that computers have a positive influence on people, while some experts hold a contrary view. In my opinion, computers do indeed have a positive impact on individuals. They offer unparalleled opportunities for learning, enabling us to explore any subject from across the globe. Additionally, they facilitate online communication, allowing us to connect with people worldwide. Moreover, engaging with computers can enhance hand - eye coordination.  The educational potential of computers is vast. With search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Ask, we can access a wealth of information at our fingertips. Whenever I am working on school projects or writing papers, I rely on the internet for research. It has proven to be an invaluable resource, providing reliable and up - to - date information.  Online communication is another significant advantage of computers. Platforms like Facebook, email, MySpace, and web - caming enable us to stay connected with friends and family, regardless of geographical distances. For instance, during Christmas, when my aunt in @LOCATION1 could not be with us, we used my cousin's webcam to see and talk to her. These platforms also allow us to share pictures and have real - time conversations, strengthening our relationships.  Playing computer games is not only a source of entertainment but also a beneficial leisure activity. There is a wide variety of games available, some of which allow us to compete with players from around the world. Internet checkers, for example, offers a competitive and engaging experience. The numerous websites that host games provide a vast selection, ensuring that there is something for everyone.  In conclusion, it is evident that computers have a positive impact on people in terms of education, communication, and leisure. They have become an integral part of our lives, offering countless opportunities for growth and connection. I sincerely hope that you share my perspective on the value of computers.
1500	1504	1	1	Do you ponder whether computers are beneficial? I firmly believe they are, and there are multiple compelling reasons for both you and me to hold this view.  Firstly, computers exert a positive influence on individuals. Don't we all aspire to happiness? Well, computers serve as an excellent source of online entertainment and knowledge. Through computers, we can acquire a wealth of information, expanding our intellectual horizons.  Secondly, computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination, an essential skill in life. Consider a scenario where one wishes to play baseball but lacks adequate hand - eye coordination. Such a deficiency could lead to clumsy movements, potentially resulting in accidents like tripping on @DATE1 and sustaining injuries. However, by engaging with computers, one can improve this crucial skill, reducing the likelihood of such mishaps.  Thirdly, computers enable us to interact with others online. We can utilize platforms like @CAPS1, participate in chat rooms, engage in online gaming, and even explore online dating. The computer provides a remarkable avenue to connect with like - minded individuals, fostering new friendships and relationships.  If you already own a computer, you are fortunate. However, if you do not, it is advisable to acquire one. In today's world, a significant proportion of individuals with jobs rely on computers in their daily work. Those without access to computers may face limitations in their career prospects.  In conclusion, the acquisition of a computer is highly recommended. It offers a multitude of benefits, including the enhancement of hand - eye coordination, the opportunity to chat with online friends, and the positive impact it has on our overall well - being. So, don't hesitate any longer and embrace the digital age with a computer.
1501	1505	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 of the students and faculty members of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 school perceive computers as highly significant. Computers not only assist individuals within the school environment but also at home. I am certain that the readers of this article will concur that computers are extremely beneficial; they educate us about distant people and things, and they are excellent for online communication! The majority of individuals utilize computers on a daily basis! Computers are highly useful tools in daily life. They always possess a program that corrects spelling errors. Computers even feature dictionary websites where people can look up words. I am aware that this is extremely helpful because my brother is writing his college essays, and there are no colleges that will be impressed by a grammatically incorrect essay. Computers also aid you in rapidly finding what you need, such as restaurants and the nearest malls, or even employment opportunities! Not only do computers assist people with spelling and job - hunting, but they can also teach us about far - off places. Computers can showcase and inform us about wonderful locations beyond what we have witnessed. Many families in ordinary society have taken vacations before. To discover an interesting destination, they can search on the internet. Even if a family cannot embark on a vacation, they can still find more affordable and nearby activities using their computer. When computers are employed to find places and things across the globe and in the vicinity, they also offer teenagers the opportunity to chat with their friends online. Many students at @CAPS3 hallow school have a Facebook account. Most use this account to communicate with their friends online. I also have a Facebook account and use it almost daily to talk to my cousin from @LOCATION1 whom I haven't seen since I was @NUM3. However, computers are not solely used for casual chatting; they can also be utilized for school blogs. In my language arts class, we have a reading blog that every student must participate in. This blog enables the class to avoid wasting class time discussing recently read books. In conclusion, computers should be regarded seriously as they do contribute to society. Computers assist us daily, educate us, and can be both enjoyable and educational. Remember what @PERSON1 from the department of technology at @ORGANIZATION1 stated, ""@CAPS5 can only improve if society accepts it."
1502	1506	1	1	"Computers can impact individuals in numerous ways. The majority of people overuse computers, which can affect their health and those around them. People ought to venture outdoors and engage in more physical activity. America is experiencing an increase in obesity, and individuals are not obtaining any truly valuable information from computers. Some individuals are merely sitting, mindlessly in front of their computers while eating simultaneously! This exacerbates the situation, as not only are they not exercising, but they are also gaining weight without losing any. This is precisely the opposite of what a human should do. Indeed, some people exercise daily. Using the computer is not always a negative thing. Sometimes, one needs to find information about nature, but wouldn't it be more convenient to go outside and discover new things? Even if you don't live near a forest, you can visit one. The woods are not completely inaccessible. Even your front yard is teeming with nature, and you will get some (though not all) exercise at the same time. Families are constantly encountering issues with family members who never have time to converse and who may punch holes in walls due to losing a video game. Dr. @PERSON1, also known as ""The studies of the human mind,"" asserts, ""I have found that technology and online gaming increase anger in most people."" This demonstrates that it can cause problems in families everywhere because of a video game! Therefore, please ensure that you attempt to spend time with your family. This shows that while computers can be enjoyable, they can also be perilous."
1503	1507	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 writers, on average, there are @NUM1 computers per household. This is excessive. I believe that society is allocating an excessive amount of time to computers. Computers are gradually dominating our lives. Spending time on the computer inflates the electricity bill. Computers are among the primary factors contributing to weight issues, and when one is on the computer, they are less engaged with society. If you spend too much time on the computer, you will increase your electricity bill. Do you truly wish to spend @NUM2$ in a month, or would you prefer to purchase groceries or pay bills with that money? ""On average, a family that uses fewer computers saves @MONEY1 compared to a family that spends more time on their computers."" ""@CAPS4, if I had known how much I could save, I would have reduced my computer usage,"" says a gamer. ""I didn't realize how much my hobby was costing me."" @CAPS5 @CAPS3 is the root of the problem in our lives. The most significant issue with computers is that if you spend the majority of your time on them, you will have limited interaction with society and few real - life friends. You may have online relationships, but in reality, it's different. I believe society is spending too much time on computers. Computers contribute to problems such as high electricity bills. When you use the computer, you gain weight and do not participate in social activities. So, get off that computer and..."
1504	1508	1	1	Computers offer entertainment, yet they also have drawbacks. People allocate more time to using computers than engaging in outdoor activities, exercising, or even socializing with friends and family. Conversely, they are also enjoyable, beneficial for children, and can even facilitate connections through dating sites, bringing happiness. Computers are indeed a source of amusement. They offer a wide range of games, including both educational and purely entertaining ones. You can play role - playing games (which are both engaging and enjoyable, as I have personal experience), or you can play educational games such as those on certain platforms or other downloadable educational games that, although not always perceived as fun, are essential for the growth and development of a learning child. They can also assist children in learning various skills at an early age. Some adults also utilize computers for various purposes that I can't quite recall at the moment. Computers bring people together, and they are content as a result. People interact via computers numerous times a day. Removing computers would leave people lonely and despondent. In conclusion, my point is that computers are fun, helpful for kids, and aid older people in connecting. Read this, and @CAPS3, I'm confident you'll see it from my perspective.
1505	1509	1	1	Hello, my name is @CAPS1, and I am writing to the local newspaper to assert that computers are advantageous for people and offer extensive assistance. They help with navigation from one place to another, learning about Black History or renowned individuals who have made an impact on the world, and staying informed about the news and weather from home or work. In business, without computers, jobs would be hopeless. If a family or an individual is striving to succeed in life, computers are often the only means of communication. Computers are ubiquitous; even doctors at hospitals use them to save lives, diagnose patients, and determine their origin. Additionally, employers rely on computers to assess a candidate's suitability for a job by checking their background information. Without computers, even you might not secure a good job. Here are some reasons why computers are crucial. Firstly, we need computers for navigation. If you are planning a trip for the @DATE1, you would search on the computer for the ideal destination. Secondly, while you could use a @CAPS2 for directions, the computer is superior as it displays the distance and estimated travel time. Another reason is to learn about Black History Month and famous people. Although Black History Month is covered in books, many books lack comprehensive information. The computer is invaluable in this regard, as platforms like Google provide more details and images of the individuals, enabling you to recognize them. For instance, if you like a famous singer or rapper but know little about them, you would turn to the computer, @CAPS3 because it is the most effective option. Thirdly, computers help us stay informed about the news and weather. If you miss the news on TV, you can visit a news website to catch up or watch your favorite shows. Fourthly, in business, without computers, enterprises would struggle to survive. @NUM1. They would be unaware of their profits, and @NUM2. managing operations would be impossible. There are numerous other reasons that demonstrate the importance of computers, but I must be brief. Schools especially require computers for testing when necessary. These are all the reasons why we need computers and why they are beneficial.
1506	1510	1	1	I firmly opine that computers indeed confer numerous benefits upon society. With merely a click of a button, they can furnish all the requisite information. Entertainment is readily accessible through an internet search. Most crucially, they enhance interpersonal communication. One avenue through which computers benefit society is by facilitating universal access to information. This is particularly indispensable in educational institutions. It can assist students in gathering information about the subjects of their reports. The facile retrieval of information online can also be advantageous in other respects. Suppose someone urgently needs a hospital's phone number in an emergency; they can utilize a computer to obtain it. Another way computers benefit society is by enabling effortless access to diverse forms of entertainment, which a majority of society's members rely on. Many individuals use computers to play games, listen to music, and watch online videos. If someone is currently bored, they can turn to the computer for engaging games. Should one find their room a bit too quiet, they can use the computer to listen to music. Without computers, we would likely endure perpetual boredom. Finally, and most significantly, computers contribute to the improvement of communication among people, which is perhaps their most common use. Today, one can send electronic mail to friends within seconds, post and view pictures of family and relatives, and even employ instant messaging to communicate with friends at the fastest possible speed. Without computers, interpersonal communication would be extremely challenging. As is evident, computers offer easy access to information, entertainment is readily available, and they can even enhance communication within society and across the globe. Computers are highly beneficial to us and enhance every aspect of our lives.
1507	1511	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the computer has long been a valuable resource, providing access to information and images. However, this does not necessitate constant use. People should occasionally engage in face - to - face conversations or use webcams to connect with loved ones, such as those stationed in Iraq. Moreover, there is a pressing need to venture outdoors for exercise, even if it is just a simple walk around the block. One need not always leave the house; exercising to a workout tape or using a treadmill can suffice. Instead of remaining sedentary all day, people should simply move around. The incidence of obesity has increased due to a lack of physical activity. Therefore, lace up your shoes and jog a few blocks in your neighborhood. Simple actions like these can make you feel far better than spending the day on your computer. Nature surrounds us, yet most people remain oblivious because they are engrossed in computers. This situation must end. The world's beautiful landmarks are being squandered as few people take the time to appreciate them. Visit @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, or even @CAPS1 to inhale fresh, clean air that is not confined to your home. You can also visit the park to observe the birds and experience the world without the mediation of a screen. Grab your camera and explore areas rich in wildlife for an enjoyable experience. Engaging in these activities will improve your health, boost your energy, and enhance your mental well - being. You can use the computer to chat with friends, but not to the exclusion of other activities. Do you wish to lead an unhealthy life? If not, step outside and take a walk.
1508	1512	1	1	Dear Local @CAPS1, I have been informed that individuals are unable to converse with friends or family, appreciate nature, and engage in physical activity due to computer usage. However, computers bring significant benefits to our lives. The primary advantage of computers lies in communication. People can utilize platforms such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and others. Social networking groups enable users to communicate with friends, whether they are nearby or at a great distance, and also allow families to enjoy the process of research. Just because @CAPS11 use these internet websites does not preclude them from going outdoors and participating in activities. This leads to the topic of portable devices. As technology progresses, so do our capabilities. Each year, more electronic devices are developed, and most are portable, including @CAPS5, @CAPS6 phones, @CAPS7, and so on. Many companies produce these devices to enable us to carry out daily tasks. With @ORGANIZATION1, the creator of the @CAPS8, @CAPS11 can utilize this internet/music @CAPS9 for a wide range of purposes. For instance, when I visit my grandparents, I bring my @CAPS6 phone. I can communicate with friends via text messaging while spending time with my grandparents. This also applies to @CAPS5. @CAPS11 can still venture outdoors and relish life. Exercise is an activity that @CAPS11 should embrace. If you remain confined to your home, you will miss out on fun. @CAPS11 should cheer up, go outside, and participate in sports. @CAPS11 can join various activities. Additionally, there are online videos available to guide us through exercises or yoga routines. Most of us use portable devices, which ties back to my previous point. Exercise is of great importance, and @CAPS11 should all engage in it. In essence, @CAPS11 can effectively utilize computers and electronic devices while also enjoying the fun of exercise. If this is understood, experts will concur, and children can lead healthier lives while maintaining communication.
1509	1513	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to express my conviction that computers are highly beneficial. They facilitate communication, create numerous job opportunities, and assist with academic work. People communicate through various means such as email, instant messaging, and social media platforms like Facebook. There are numerous computer - related jobs, including court reporters, tax retailers, and salespeople. Additionally, children use computers to complete homework and conduct research on topics such as ""@CAPS1 related"". In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are advantageous for people as they support education, employment, and communication with friends and family."
1510	1514	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, in my view, I wholeheartedly endorse technological advancements. These advancements enable us to access information on matters of concern, engage in online conversations with friends and family, and enhance our reading and hand - eye coordination skills. One of the reasons for my support is that computers and phones can provide us with the information we need. We must stay informed about our surroundings at all times, including current events and the well - being of those in our lives. We need to be aware of weather and traffic conditions. If one has children, it is essential to know whether schools are open. For those working in information - based environments, it is necessary to check if bosses or colleagues have sent important messages. The second reason is that online communication allows us to chat with friends and family around the world. Many of us are concerned about the health and safety of our loved ones, even if we cannot meet them in person. I can attest to this as my family and friends keep in touch online. Maintaining communication with our loved ones strengthens our relationships. The final reason is that computers can improve our reading and hand - eye coordination skills. If we lack the time to visit a bookstore, we can read books online for free, which aids in improving our reading skills. They also enhance hand - eye coordination by making our fingers more agile and enabling us to perform tasks more quickly. I have outlined all the reasons for my support of technological advancements. Computers can help us access necessary information, enable online communication with friends and family, and improve our reading and hand - eye coordination skills.
1511	1515	1	1	"Dear newspaper editor: We are all living in the technological era. There exists a plethora of useful devices that facilitate our daily lives. The computer is a significant asset. We can communicate with relatives from diverse areas and browse the internet to acquire new information. Moreover, you can engage in games with individuals from across the globe. The computer is an excellent device. Nearly everyone has a relative residing in another state or country. Well, you seldom see them because they live far away, right? With a computer, you can converse and even have a face - to - face dialogue with them. It can bring your family closer. For example, my family just obtained a new computer, and we have relatives living in Florida whom we scarcely ever see. With the computer, my dad communicates with them almost daily. Some individuals I've conversed with stated that they are eager to see their relatives or friends more frequently. It has brought them closer and strengthened their friendship. The internet is a remarkable realm where you can search for information for a school project and explore different topics. When children are working on a project at school and the required information is not in the textbook, they can search it, and it saves time. A certain percentage of kids said that when doing a project, the most suitable resource would be the internet. Additionally, it helps the kids work more efficiently so they can spend more time outdoors or socializing with their friends. Another advantage is that you can stay informed about recent events. For instance, most local newspapers have a website that you can visit. Even if your local newspaper doesn't, you can access other websites like ""@CAPS3"". They feature recent events occurring around the country and the world. The internet is useful in numerous ways and can assist you in your daily life. Every child gets bored on a rainy day. So they can play games with people from around the world using a computer. There are many websites that offer enjoyable and engaging games. You can also befriend people from other countries. My friends @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 play on the computer and have many friends from other countries. I think it's fascinating that you're playing the exact same game with someone in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2. Additionally, most of the games are safe and fun to play. Another aspect is that you can connect and play with your friends in your hometown. I've played games with @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 on numerous occasions. It's a fun activity during a dull, rainy day. In conclusion, the computer is a useful device that benefits us and aids us in our daily life. It enables us to connect with family in distant places and surf the internet for new information. Moreover, you can play games with people from around the world. It's a wonderful device, and let's start utilizing it."
1512	1516	1	1	Dear local news, as an increasing number of people utilize computers, the question arises as to whether computers genuinely benefit society. In my view, I believe they do. They offer entertainment, access to daily utilities, and numerous websites for social interactions. Here's why I think computers truly benefit society. Computers provide entertainment to individuals. Many people prefer to watch humorous videos or their favorite TV shows on the internet. One of the most popular websites for video - watching is YouTube. Another excellent source of entertainment is video games. People either purchase video games or play them on websites like @CAPS2. The entertainment available on the computer is far more extensive compared to traditional TV, where programs are scheduled at specific times rather than when you desire. Another benefit that computers bring to society is access to daily utilities. The internet can provide information about your local weather. Instead of relying on the local news, you can immediately access it on your device. You can also access encyclopedias and dictionaries on websites such as @CAPS5, which offer a convenient and immediate solution for daily needs. As a final example regarding the uses of computers, there are many websites that you can explore. One of the @CAPS5 websites is called @CAPS6, which allows you to upload pictures of people or family events. You can also video - chat with people and see the other person's face. This is not possible with a telephone, texting, or a cell phone. Many experts contend that computers are reducing the time spent with family and friends, but with websites like @CAPS6, it is actually increasing the interaction time. In conclusion, these reasons support my opinion that computers benefit society. They provide entertainment, easy access to information, and have many websites for social interactions. Without computers, society would be significantly more challenging, and this is why I believe computers benefit society.
1513	1517	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, a computer is indeed advantageous. It assists us in numerous ways. It is highly beneficial and can simplify someone's life. You can maintain contact with old friends or family members. It is also more convenient for work, and when you're bored, you can engage in some enjoyable games. It is extremely difficult to have family members whom you cannot see or keep in touch with! With a computer, you can send messages and photos to interact with them. You need not worry about losing communication with them. You can also meet new people. Make new friends from anywhere in the world! Have friends from various races and cultures. Computers are an excellent means of interacting with others, whether they are family or friends. It is always challenging to do work when you have no idea about the subject! If you ever encounter difficulties with something, you can always search for information about it. You can learn how to perform tasks or gain more knowledge about a particular item. When you have homework and don't know the meaning of a word, you can always look up its definition. Computers also store your information. For example, instead of handling a large number of papers, you can simply save it in your computer. Then you can print it out whenever necessary. Computers make work easier and help you organize more effectively. Computers also entertain you. When you have nothing to do, you can play a variety of fun games. You can also watch music videos or humorous videos to make you laugh. They have practically everything you want to play. You will rarely get bored! As you can see, computers are beneficial to people. It is always helpful when you can keep in touch with anyone, get assistance with your work, or simply keep yourself entertained. Without computers, life would be more difficult and dull!
1514	1518	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, computers are a valuable asset in a person's life. They offer and contribute numerous ideas and actions. Computers aid people in discovering ideal travel destinations. Additionally, they help people meet or establish friendships. A computer is another means for people to enhance their hand - eye coordination. Computers are highly useful in a human's life. Computers are invaluable when exploring different places. One can book a flight anywhere within minutes on a computer. Otherwise, how would it be feasible to travel to a distant location without booking a flight via a computer? Next, computers facilitate learning about different cultures. Once one has booked reservations for a particular travel destination on their computer, they will gain extensive knowledge about the unfamiliar land they are visiting. My family has traveled to numerous areas around the world. These trips would not have been possible without the assistance of computers in researching and booking flights. The computer makes it possible to experience different territories. It is an essential item when someone intends to travel. A computer is extremely important when communicating with friends. People can easily meet and make friends using websites such as Facebook on the computer. Facebook fosters friendships effortlessly. I recently wanted to get to know a student better. I looked him up on Facebook, and now we are acquaintances. Next, programs on the computer such as A.I.M. enable people to communicate about various topics, from homework to other personal matters. Lastly, if one wishes to get to know someone better, they can read their blog. Eventually, they can start conversing and become good friends. Computers are useful when communicating or seeking friends. Computers not only assist with travel and friendships but also improve one's hand - eye coordination. Typing letters while looking at a screen involves the use of hand - eye coordination. This activity can be beneficial for sports. For example, in baseball, one must have good hand - eye coordination to catch and hit the ball. Secondly, as hand - eye coordination improves through computer use, it helps kids integrate. If one has good hand - eye coordination, they can participate in sports and make friends. If one becomes proficient in hand - eye coordination and typing, they may be able to obtain a job writing for a newspaper or a book. Hand - eye coordination and typing skills developed through computers can lead to a successful life. Computers in a person's life can be beneficial in the long run. They assist with travel plans, friendships, and hand - eye coordination.
1515	1519	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that people are spending an excessive amount of time on their computers and not exercising as they should on a daily basis. @CAPS5 @CAPS3 indicates that a certain percentage of all people in the entire world are spending too much time on the computer and not appreciating nature. Consequently, they do not get the exercise that others do. @CAPS5 @CAPS4 states that people who go outside and do not stare at their computers will lead a long and healthy life. I assert that a certain percentage of all people who are constantly on the computer often develop vision problems and will never witness how the world is changing around them. I claim that a certain percentage of all people who do not always use the computer will lead a better life than those who are constantly on it. My @CAPS5 advised me that you should use the computer, but not for an extended period because spending a long time on the computer is not beneficial for you. So, do not use the computer for a long time; only use it for a short duration and not every day, perhaps only once a week. People with @CAPS6 book accounts should not access it daily; instead, access it once to three times a week because spending a long time on the computer is not good for people. My @CAPS5 @CAPS8 mentions that a certain percentage of all people in the world have vision problems and often go blind because they use the computer constantly. Moreover, if you use it for too long, your computer may overheat and break down. I truly believe that people should not spend a long time on the computer because every moment they spend on it is a moment they miss in life. So, please refrain from doing so.
1516	1520	1	1	I believe computers exert a positive influence on individuals as they can assist people in numerous ways. One can send electronic mails to friends across the globe, acquire crucial information that might be required, and conduct business online. Computers possess captivating elements to display and convey. The majority of individuals who own computers can utilize them for corresponding with friends. Occasionally, one's closest friends reside across the country, and one desires to communicate with them. Why not send them an email via the computer? It would mean a great deal to one's friends if one takes the time to simply say hello through electronic mail. My second perspective on why the use of computers has a positive impact on people is that from middle school through college and throughout one's life, there is a need to use computers. Perhaps it is due to the fact that one might require some vital information for an assignment from a teacher. Not always can one find specific details in books. Nowadays, computers are supplanting books. My third view regarding computers is that some individuals are too ill to attend work, so they work online. Even though one is ill, one will still receive payment as one is still engaged in work. For instance, a woman who has just given birth can use her computer to work online. Thus, she can earn money to support her family. In conclusion, my stance is that computers have a positive effect on people as they are employed for emailing friends, obtaining important information for educational or occupational purposes. My final opinion is that computers are used for online work. To me, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people.
1517	1521	1	1	Dear editor of the @PERSON1, I learned that you are crafting a section in your newspaper about computers, and I thought I would express my viewpoint. Personally, I opine that computers have a beneficial impact on individuals. Firstly, I consider computers to be excellent as one can acquire knowledge about distant locations, such as countries on the other side of the world, from the comfort of one's home. Moreover, the information available on the internet can aid students with their academic work. Finally, one can engage in communication with others online. These are just a few reasons why computers are highly significant, which you should incorporate into your article. Firstly, editor of the @PERSON1, I believe computers are advantageous for humanity as one can learn about places on the other side of the world while sitting at home sipping hot cocoa. This is extremely convenient. There are websites containing details about the geography, languages, and traditions of countries, awaiting one's exploration. For example, once my friend, @PERSON3, was planning a business trip to @LOCATION1 but had no knowledge of the language. I recommended the website, www.Indianow.com, and within two weeks, she was speaking proficiently. Another instance was when my sister, @PERSON4, was visiting her in - laws for the first time. They were of @CAPS1 descent, and she wished to bake something traditional for them. She searched for a recipe on the web, and everyone was delighted with the delicious ravioli she prepared. This is just one illustration of the internet's utility. Secondly, computers are an astonishing invention as one can easily find assistance for schoolwork. My brother, @PERSON5, was facing difficulties in understanding the seasons, but with a single click, he was well - informed. Additionally, nowadays, there are even online tutors and online colleges! Professor @PERSON2 states that @PERCENT1 of successful college students are obtaining their degrees online. This is a remarkable point highlighting the importance of computers. Lastly, computers are truly significant to society as one can interact with others online. Through video chat, chat rooms, Facebook, and @CAPS2, one is likely to make a lifelong friend. I can attest to this! There are even online dating sites and match - making services. For example, after my uncle divorced my aunt, she was heartbroken and unable to date for a long time. I advised her to try one of those online dating sites. She took my advice and found a wonderful man. They have been dating for @NUM1 months. On @DATE1, he proposed. They are now happily engaged. This is my final reason demonstrating how computers can positively transform someone's life. In conclusion, I believe computers are a remarkable invention as one can learn about distant places while staying at home, receive help with schoolwork, and communicate with others online. I sincerely hope you will take my opinion into consideration for your article, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. Thank you for your time.
1518	1522	1	1	@CAPS1, it is well - known that we all have an affinity for computers and utilize them for various purposes, such as chatting, working, and most importantly, seeking information. However, computers, in a sense, are not entirely beneficial, especially if one's life revolves around them. One reason I believe computers can be detrimental is that when one spends an extended period on the computer, one becomes hungry and consumes snacks. By the time one finishes using the computer, one has gained weight. Imagine how much weight one would gain if this occurs daily! My next rationale for considering computers to be somewhat bad is that when one spends excessive time on the computer, one's eyes begin to ache, and one's hands start to cramp. Prolonged typing and staring at the same thing can lead to eye problems and issues in one's hands, rendering one unable to use one's hands for an extended period due to the pain. My final reason for deeming computers to be less than ideal is that they can malfunction. They may overheat or shut down because one has been using them for too long. They can also contract a virus, necessitating the purchase of an entirely new computer. @CAPS1, it is evident that there are numerous reasons why I believe computers are somewhat disadvantageous.
1519	1523	1	1	Numerous individuals have been discussing computers within the @ORGANIZATION1. Networks such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS2 have been asserting that computers are making people lazy and unproductive. However, I hold a different view! I contend that technological advancements are a positive development. Why? I shall present @NUM1 reasons. My first reason is that they endow people with the capacity to learn about remote places and individuals. The next reason is that they enhance the quality of life. And my final reason is that they improve hand - eye coordination. Are you not weary of having to go to the bookstore and search for a book to complete a project? Well, now, with computers, one does not have to. One can simply go online and look up the information required to learn about almost anything, from common knowledge to details about @LOCATION1. The next reason is that computers make life more convenient. In conclusion, despite the negative views expressed by some networks, I firmly believe that the advantages of computers, including the ability to learn, improve life, and enhance coordination, far outweigh any perceived drawbacks.
1520	1524	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 have engaged in extensive debates regarding whether computers are beneficial or detrimental. @CAPS6, I am of the opinion that computers are not as advantageous as many individuals perceive. Ever since the invention of computers, people have become less physically active. Moreover, fewer children are engaging in reading. Lastly, computers are encroaching upon family time. When was the last time one witnessed a child outdoors participating in an active pursuit such as running or playing a sport? If one has not, it is likely because the child is indoors, fixated on a computer screen. Exercise is a crucial component of maintaining good health and physical fitness. Every day, more children are becoming overweight. Computers are yet another contributing factor. I had a friend who used to devote all her time to the computer. She became extremely lethargic. She never had the inclination to exercise or engage in any active endeavors. Gradually, she began to gain weight. This phenomenon is occurring globally, and it needs to @CAPS4! What is the reading level of @CAPS3? @CAPS3 are students in @NUM1 grade with a @NUM2 grade reading level. Part of the reason is that they prefer to spend their free time on the computer rather than picking up a book. Schools now implement a program called @CAPS5 @NUM3. This program is designed to assist students in improving their reading levels. I believe that if students would power off their computers for a sufficient duration and @CAPS5, this program would be unnecessary. My mother ensures that I @CAPS5 for at least @NUM4 minutes every day. Every student should follow suit. I recall a saying, ""Family time is precious time."" @CAPS6, nowadays, no one spends quality time with their family. Once again, computers have played a role in this. It is not only children who have sacrificed family time for computer time; adults are also guilty of this. I think the last time I spent time with my family was approximately @NUM5 weeks ago when my grandparents came to visit. After that, everyone reverted to staring at computer screens. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, their negative impacts on physical activity, reading habits, and family time cannot be overlooked, and steps should be taken to mitigate these effects."
1521	1525	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I was perusing an article regarding computers. I concur that both children and adults are lacking in the time to relish nature and engage with family and friends. Nevertheless, children and adults ought to allocate some leisure time outdoors and savor it. However, when it comes to the utilization of computers, they are beneficial for information retrieval. I opine that children and adults need to become more active and maintain good health, as currently, children are disinclined to play outside; instead, they prefer to play video - games. When I was a young child, I would frequently play hide - and - seek, but now my mother no longer wishes to play due to technology; she would rather be on the computer or the phone. Children worldwide now know how to operate computers as they have no interest in being outside. Computers are only useful when one is preparing a report or dealing with something significant. For instance, individuals with businesses will require computers. Also, when a teacher assigns a project to someone, one will need a computer to search for information for that person. Finally, a large number of children are not taking responsibility for their schoolwork. They do not take school seriously. Children believe that computers can teach them everything, but they are mistaken because the information on computers can be fabricated. Moreover, it is making their lives extremely unhealthy. Thus, this is why computers have both good and bad aspects; children no longer play outside, yet computers are helpful for information search. Based on what I have said, don't you agree with me?
1522	1526	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, To date, numerous individuals utilize telecommunication devices, such as computers. Some contend that computers have a positive impact on people, while others are concerned that people spend an excessive amount of time on them. I believe that both viewpoints are valid. Although using a computer can develop into an addictive and unwholesome habit, computers educate a person daily, are pleasurable, and contribute to environmental conservation. I am aware that millions of people use computers every day, and I think it would be arduous to live without them. For example, my family owns four computers, and each of us has distinct reasons for using them. My mother typically uses hers for work or checking emails. My sister and I use ours for researching and typing homework, as well as communicating with friends via Facebook or other platforms. When my mother is working or my sister and I are researching, we gain knowledge. Before the advent of computers, people relied on books, but now, with the internet, there is scarcely a need to obtain a book. Often, people do not have the book they are looking for and either have to purchase it or borrow it from the library, which is inconvenient. Therefore, why not use the internet, which is rapid and efficient? People also use computers for socializing, as I mentioned earlier, through Facebook, @CAPS1, or email. It is quick, easy, and enjoyable. It also conserves paper, which is beneficial for the planet. In the past, we used to send letters, but now, with these digital sources, there is less need for them. Computers are also entertaining for children as they can play numerous games on them. However, despite the many advantages, there are also drawbacks. A large number of people use computers daily, which is detrimental to their physical and mental well - being. People can easily become addicted as they spend excessive time on them. This implies that they will be constantly on the computers and neglect other activities such as going outside. They do not exercise, which can be harmful to their physical health. Additionally, staring at a screen all day is bad for the eyes and the brain. Therefore, I believe that people should not use computers continuously. In conclusion, I would like to state that people should use computers for learning, but also go outside or engage in active pursuits because excessive computer use can lead to physical and mental health problems. Thank you, and I hope you concur with my statements.
1523	1527	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Despite the fact that many people believe computers are detrimental, there are numerous reasons indicating their benefits. Computers are highly environmentally friendly, as are a significant number of people today. They also enable us to type assignments and other important documents. Moreover, people are unaware that computers are not the most unfavorable @ORGANIZATION1 in the current market. Although computers may consume time that could be dedicated to exercise, they are not the sole culprit. More people spend time watching @CAPS5 than engaging in any other activity. @PERSON2, the head of @ORGANIZATION1 in @DATE1, conducted a survey in @DATE1. The survey revealed that out of the @NUM1 people questioned, @PERCENT2 spent @NUM2 hours a day watching @CAPS5, @PERCENT3 spent @NUM3 hours on the computer, @PERCENT4 spent @NUM4 hours reading, and @PERCENT5 spent @NUM4 hours exercising. Evidently, computers are not our most pressing issue. Many people today are ""@CAPS7"" or ""@CAPS8 - environment"" conscious. Instead of purchasing newspapers or magazines, most individuals turn to the internet to research current events. @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION2 states that if we use computers instead of newspapers, @PERCENT6 of the trees cut down each year will be saved. Clearly, computers are environmentally friendly. Today's youth presents a messier situation than ever before. Teachers are encountering difficulties in grading papers and tests due to students' handwriting. Therefore, instead of handwriting papers, students make it easier for teachers by typing their work. Recent studies indicate that @PERCENT7 of teachers find it more convenient and beneficial for students to type papers. This demonstrates that students are better off typing their papers and assignments. I hope you now comprehend my stance on computers, as they assist us in numerous other ways. In conclusion, computers are not as time - consuming as everyone might think. They aid us in research, are environmentally friendly, and contribute to making the youth of our world more orderly, one click at a time."
1524	1528	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, I believe that computers can be of great assistance. For example, my teacher assigned our class some homework to find facts about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @NUM1. Without the computer, I would have been completely ignorant about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @NUM1. Additionally, computers can help one locate long - lost family members. When my grandfather passed away, my mother was able to find her sister on the computer. Moreover, I can learn about other states that I was previously unaware of through the computer. It can teach me a plethora of things that my mother and teacher cannot impart. In essence, computers can educate one about numerous things that people are unfamiliar with.
1525	1529	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Recently, I initiated research on the effects of computers on people and discovered some astonishing facts. I firmly believe that computers do not benefit society in any way. Three reasons support my belief. Firstly, computers cause people to neglect exercise. A lack of exercise, enjoyment of nature, and interaction with friends (@CAPS1) is a growing problem in @LOCATION1, and computers are a major contributing factor. In fact, statistics show that individuals who spend more time exercising than constantly looking at electronic devices actually live longer. Thus, my first reason for believing that computers do not benefit society is that they lead to a lack of physical activity. People require exercise to maintain a healthy life, and with the prevalence of computers, this need is being increasingly neglected. Exercise not only provides physical strength but also enhances one's mood. If people choose to lead an active life instead of engaging in violent online activities, it will contribute to a less violent future. My second reason is that computers result in a lack of appreciation for nature. Nature is a magnificent entity, featuring serene lakes, the delightful fragrance of balsam fir, and countless creatures. Due to computers, thousands of children are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has to offer. My parents did not have access to computers during their childhood, and they often reminisce about the joy of running around their neighborhoods, playing sports, and participating in other enjoyable activities. Finally, computers impede social interaction with friends. Recall the days when you were young and would call a friend to hang out or have a sleepover. Nowadays, computers have eliminated the need for such face - to - face interactions. Instead, one can simply @CAPS2 or email, and @CAPS3 allows for a conversation without even looking at another person. In conclusion, computers lead to a deficiency in exercise, appreciation of nature, and social interaction with friends. I earnestly request your help and encourage others to join me in curbing the overuse of computers. Thank you for your time, and I hope this letter has informed you of some shocking and interesting facts.
1526	1530	1	1	To: @ORGANIZATION1 progresses at a rapid pace, and they predominantly introduce numerous novel inventions. They have devised a computer that aids people in their work obligations. Nevertheless, a significant issue exists: people, particularly teenagers, are allocating excessive time to computers. I contend that this is a dreadful notion because they are spending less time being physically active and interacting with friends and family. Moreover, @CAPS1 indicates it poses a risk to teenagers. However, many individuals in @MONTH1 do not concur with me. A multitude of teenagers and adults are merely squandering time on computers instead of engaging in outdoor activities, appreciating nature, exercising, and having a good time. Do you not consider this a remarkable idea? Well, a friend of mine used to venture outside daily to play. I truly miss her. You know, when you intend to spend time with your family, but lo and behold, they are engrossed in their computers, wasting time rather than bonding with you. Do you think this is acceptable? Certainly not, as this is how family gatherings decline, and relatives cease visiting. It is truly disheartening to witness families growing apart. This is not all; do you believe people are susceptible to perilous situations? Indeed, they are. Do you know how you create a MySpace account and encounter a boy who claims to be of the same age as you and requests to meet you, and you consent? Suppose you are a @NUM1 - year - old girl, and he is approximately @NUM2 years old. He may abuse or even harm you. You assumed he was @NUM1 years old, but he was not. I firmly believe it is dangerous for children. I deem it a horrendous concept to have computers as you will spend less time in nature, less time with your family, and expose yourself to dangerous circumstances. However, people in @MONTH1 still do not agree with me. But what if your child were in danger? How would you feel? People should genuinely contemplate the implications of having computers.
1527	1531	1	1	Who in the world would assert that a computer is futile? No one. Computers are among the most invaluable devices ever created. I opine that computers are impeccable and can assist in skill development. I have @NUM1 reasons: skill - building, rapid information access, and entertainment. Now, let us commence with skill - building. Skills are indispensable if one aspires to pursue a career. Skills can be acquired from books, television, and computers. For instance, I learned to type proficiently on a keyboard through a computer game named “Type to Learn.” After a week of playing this game, I typed like a professional. The computer also offers chess, which helps cultivate strategic thinking. Just inquire with my highly erudite English teacher, @PERSON1. She states that chess enhances character and fortifies the mind. Moving on, I wish to discuss how computers enable instantaneous information retrieval. Experts assert that it is the premier method for obtaining information expeditiously. I wholeheartedly concur. After studying for a test on @LOCATION1 Carver from my book, when one of the pages was missing, I utilized my computer. Not only did I obtain the information promptly, but I also gathered more data than the book provided. The following day, I passed my test with @NUM2 percent. You can fathom the utility of a computer. Finally, I want to address the aspect of traditional amusement. As you are aware, computers are excellent for skill - building and information acquisition, but they can also be employed for entertainment. Do you know anyone who can claim that computers are not enjoyable? No, you cannot, as everyone worldwide uses computers for activities such as online games, watching videos, and communicating with others. Thank you for considering my reasons regarding computers: skill - building, information access, and entertainment.
1528	1532	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In numerous respects, computers have proven highly beneficial to humanity. They can be utilized for information retrieval, communicating with family and friends, listening to music, and so forth. Do you not think people are squandering excessive time on computers instead of engaging in physical exercise? It is evident that computers can fulfill almost any task one desires. However, why devote time to the computer when one can spend quality time with family, participate in sports, or enjoy fresh air? I believe computers have both positive and negative impacts on people. One of the positive effects is the ability to communicate with friends. I understand that sometimes we are unable to see them frequently at school. In my view, it is an excellent means to catch up on the enjoyable moments shared with friends. Now, let us consider the negative effects. Many children are bullied and harassed by other children online. This can lead to low self - esteem and potentially dangerous situations in the future. When it comes to computers, they have saved countless lives. Some of these instances include discovering cures for harmful diseases and providing information about impending severe weather storms, enabling us to prepare accordingly. Would you not concur that computers have played a pivotal role in our lives? Nevertheless, we should occasionally take a break from them and appreciate nature. So, relish the benefits of technology while also maintaining an active lifestyle.
1529	1533	1	1	Dear local Newspaper, Have you ever pondered why people invest so much time in using computers? The influence of computers on people is two - fold, with both advantages and disadvantages. The positive aspects include the ability to communicate with individuals in distant locations. For example, you can converse with someone you visited @LOCATION1 with, whether in @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1 @LOCATION1. However, the drawback is that if one is constantly on the computer, they are neglecting time spent with family and friends. When you immerse yourself in computer use, you risk becoming sedentary, which is extremely detrimental to your health. Another valid reason for computer use is when a family member relocates. For instance, if you reside in @LOCATION2 while your family is in @STATE1, instead of relying solely on letters and pictures, you can communicate via webcam. Letters and pictures do not allow them to witness your behavior, and phone calls only permit voice communication. Many individuals disagree, as they believe computers are a significant waste of time. That concludes my thoughts on this subject.
1530	1534	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2's opinion regarding computers is that people should utilize them. Consider your children; as they grow, they will require computer proficiency for school or even employment. Additionally, it cultivates hand - eye coordination, which is essential for multitasking. The computer is also enjoyable and user - friendly. I am nearly certain that you relish using a computer. Who does not? @CAPS2's first reason is that computer usage is inevitable in daily life. For example, during a job interview, most @CAPS3 will inquire about your typing speed. You need to be proficient. Similarly, at school, if you have a writing assignment, typing it will be more time - efficient than writing it by hand. All @CAPS3 will need to type at some point. Especially in your role as an @CAPS1, you must use a computer daily. The computer also teaches hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is akin to multitasking, allowing you to type while talking on the phone or even exercise while texting. Hand - eye coordination is a crucial life skill. All @CAPS3 will need to multitask. For example, at a library, you must locate a book while interacting with people. Even when driving a car, you need to multitask to stay on course, operating the brake and gas pedals while keeping an eye on the road. You must master multitasking along with hand - eye coordination, and fortunately, a computer can teach you these skills. @CAPS2's final reason is that it is enjoyable and easy to use. I was @NUM1 years old when I began using a computer, and I adored playing entertaining games. Initially, I was not proficient at typing, but I quickly improved because when you are having fun, learning becomes effortless. Just like math, which may not be enjoyable but is necessary to learn. So, if you enjoy learning while having a good time, the computer is ideal for you. It is now or never for people to learn, acquire @CAPS3, and achieve good grades. It is enjoyable and straightforward to learn how to use a computer. It teaches hand - eye coordination and multitasking. You will undoubtedly need to know how to use a computer for @CAPS3 and school. We rely on computers in our daily lives and will continue to do so. Do not be swayed by those who claim it will damage your brain or make you unhealthy. Look beyond such claims and recognize the numerous benefits of computers.
1531	1535	1	1	Herein lies my stance: I firmly believe that computers are highly useful, and the following are the rationale supporting this view. Firstly, children can communicate with their friends via the computer when they are grounded. For instance, on @DATE1, I was grounded for slapping my cousin in the face, yet I managed to converse with my friends. The only way to deceive one's parents was to claim that I was inquiring about homework from my friends, and our conversations continue to this day. Secondly, individuals can turn to the computer when they are bored. For example, when a child has completed all their games and is left with nothing to do, they can search for new games to purchase, rent, or play downloadable ones on the computer. Lastly, when someone needs to look up information for a project and the library is closed, they can simply copy down the necessary details from the computer. In conclusion, computers are indispensable for our survival; without them, we would still be in a primitive state.
1532	1536	1	1	Some individuals harbor an aversion to computers due to immediate concerns, while others exhibit an excessive fondness for them. I hold a favorable view of computers, yet I advocate for a balanced approach. When used appropriately, computers can yield positive outcomes for individuals, including myself. One can acquire knowledge from the computer and develop enhanced hand - eye coordination. One of the appealing aspects of computers is the ability to communicate with others. Regrettably, numerous individuals spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer, neglecting physical exercise and the appreciation of nature, as well as quality time with their families. I prefer to allocate only (#@NUM1) three hours to computer use each day, enabling me to engage in other activities. I encourage others to adopt a similar approach.
1533	1537	1	1	In my view, it is highly advantageous for people to utilize computers. The reasoning behind this perspective is multi - fold. Firstly, computers offer a means to reconnect with individuals whom one has not seen for an extended period. Through the computer, one can not only see but also converse with these long - lost acquaintances. Secondly, when faced with a school project, computers provide access to a wealth of relevant information. I frequently use the computer to communicate with friends I haven't seen in a while, and it also presents an opportunity to meet new people and forge friendships. In the absence of computers, we would be compelled to sift through numerous books for information or travel to the bank to check account balances. Moreover, computers offer a platform to access workout routines, eliminating the sole reliance on gyms. My father uses the computer to communicate with his sisters and play games with people worldwide, while my mother uses it to stay in touch with family in @LOCATION1 and other places. Without computers, tasks such as taking tests and obtaining information would be significantly more challenging. Additionally, computers facilitate bill payments and online interaction with friends and family, especially during inclement weather when face - to - face meetings are not feasible. Although some individuals may become addicted to computers, there is an abundance of activities available on the computer to prevent boredom. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers are not only a good idea but also an essential part of modern life.
1534	1538	1	1	In contemporary society, a significant number of individuals utilize computers. However, not everyone concurs that computers bring about benefits to society. In fact, computers possess remarkable capabilities. They can serve as a tool for research, a platform for gaming, and a source of freedom. Have you ever been assigned a school project but found that no book contains the desired information? The internet, to which many computers are connected, can fulfill this need. It is a vast repository where one can find virtually anything. For instance, when conducting research for a science project, simply access your preferred search engine and input your topic. You will be presented with an endless array of pages of information. Even when not engaged in schoolwork, the internet remains a valuable resource. Forgot the number of your favorite football player? A simple search of their name will display the information on your screen. Curious about why the @CAPS1 won the @CAPS2 @CAPS3? The possibilities for exploration are limitless. Even if your computer lacks an internet connection, gaming on it can be an excellent hobby. And when connected to the internet, you can engage in multiplayer games with individuals from around the globe. While gaming on the computer is enjoyable, it is important to strike a balance and engage in other activities as well. There is a diverse range of computer games available, including adventure, shooting, and multiplayer games, and even poker. In my opinion, the most appealing aspect of a computer is the freedom it offers. You can surf the internet, play games, communicate with others, and customize your computer according to your preferences. For example, you can set a picture of your cat as your desktop background or change the cursor with a simple mouse click. In conclusion, computers present endless possibilities for learning, entertainment, and self - expression. The key is to enjoy the experience and have fun.
1535	1539	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, based on my personal experience, I am convinced that computers exert a positive influence on people. A multitude of individuals relish their time spent on computers, as modern technology enables a vast array of tasks to be accomplished more efficiently. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 households own a computer, and I am one of the beneficiaries. With my computer, I can complete most tasks in a timely manner. The reasons for the positive impact of computers are numerous. For example, I have family members residing in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, and @LOCATION4. Instead of making phone calls, I can engage in video chats, which create a sense of being physically present. Additionally, online bill payment has revolutionized the way we handle financial matters. It eliminates the need for postage stamps and the uncertainty of mail delivery. Most college students rely on computers for their academic work. They can type essays, conduct research, and save information for later note - taking. In essence, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering entertainment, facilitating communication, and assisting with important tasks. Computers are particularly significant in the lives of teenagers, who use them to interact with friends, listen to music, and connect with family members they don't often see. Some individuals even pursue online education and earn degrees. The importance of computers is further exemplified by their role in grading tests; my test will be scanned by a computer to generate a score. In conclusion, computers have had and will continue to have a positive impact on people. Thank you for considering my opinion, and I hope you share my view.
1536	1540	1	1	On @DATE1, in the @CAPS1 Local Newspaper, I opine that computers wield a substantial influence on individuals. My perspective is that computers render children indolent and inactive. Owning a computer impels children to idle around unproductively. Undoubtedly, you are acquainted with websites such as MySpace, Facebook, Formspring, etc. These platforms entice individuals to remain engrossed in the virtual realm rather than engaging in physical exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I surmise that contemporary children, like myself, aspire to stay connected with their peers. When the telephone is not an option, the computer becomes the alternative. Moreover, eliminating computers can prevent homosexuals from preying on children by feigning a similar age. I concede that computers can be useful, yet spending an entire day on them is utterly preposterous. I have a @NUM1 - year - old brother who remains glued to the computer from the moment he wakes until bedtime. In comparison to me, he is neither fit nor healthy, a consequence of countless hours spent on the computer. In fact, he is so immersed in MySpace that he has amassed over @NUM2 friends, despite not even knowing half of them. He recklessly shares his phone number and home address with them. Do you observe that numerous children nowadays prefer to squander time on the computer rather than venturing outdoors and engaging in self - improvement? I have always harbored a passion for football, yet I struggle to find time to play with my brother. Their focus seems to be solely on girls and, of course, the computer. I am not advocating for the removal of computers from people's homes, but rather for curbing the daily hours spent on them, as time is a precious commodity that money cannot @CAPS2 acquire. Some children will later reflect on these days, lamenting the wasted time. In essence, life is too valuable to be squandered on unproductive pursuits.
1537	1541	1	1	Dear Newspaper, individuals are allocating an excessive amount of time to computers. Instead, they could be outdoors, relishing nature, participating in sports, or embarking on travels. Some assert that one can acquire knowledge about animals and plants through a computer, yet there is no substitute for direct interaction with them in the natural environment. Those who engage in hiking and genuinely appreciate the outdoors are @PERCENT1 more intellectually astute than those who do not. I prefer the outdoors to the indoors and maintain a straight - A academic record. Sports also present an excellent avenue to venture outside. My favored sport is baseball, and I am proficient in it. Some claim that computers can enhance hand - eye coordination, but how can a computer achieve this? It is sports that effectively develop hand - eye coordination. Participating in sports can also contribute to physical strength. Thanks to baseball, I can bench - press @NUM1 pounds. @PERCENT2 of children who partake in sports are not overweight, whereas @PERCENT3 of non - sports - participating children are. Traveling is another wonderful way to be outside. I have a profound love for traveling. I am fluent in English, French, and Spanish. My preferred destination is northern @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1. While computers can display pictures of a place, the actual experience of being there is truly captivating. A computer - generated image cannot compare to the real - life experience. One cannot walk on a computer, drink water from a stream, or climb a cliff. There is indeed no comparison. Computers are far inferior and detrimental to the experience of real nature. In comparison to real life and nature, the disparity is evident. Computers do not match the richness of real life. One can enjoy nature, engage in sports, and explore the world simply by stepping outside. Thank you for your time.
1538	1542	1	1	Do you recall the tedium of school projects, sitting idly while watching your @CAPS1 stations, or the interminable wait in the doctor's office? Those days are over! Since the invention of the computer, there have been numerous advancements, eradicating such monotony. There was a time when the sole method of researching a country for a project was to rummage through newspapers until relevant information was found. Now, with technological progress, one can simply input a country's name into Google, a renowned search engine, and obtain @NUM1 pieces of information about that country. In fact, @PERSON1, an authority on computers and the inventor of one of the world's most advanced computers, asserts that searching for information has become @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 easier, depending on the topic. Additionally, one no longer has to contend with a cumbersome typewriter that frequently makes errors, necessitating re - typing. Instead, one can utilize @ORGANIZATION1 to compose an essay. Any misspelled words are underlined in red, minimizing spelling mistakes. Consequently, from an educational perspective, the enhanced access to knowledge facilitated by computers is extremely beneficial for humanity. My second contention regarding the advantages of computers is their entertainment value. On a new laptop, one can visit Miniclip or Addicting Games, both popular gaming websites, and engage in games. These games, while enjoyable, also improve hand - eye coordination, which is beneficial for sports, driving, writing, and numerous other activities. More advanced gaming devices known as consoles, such as the @CAPS2 - box @NUM2 by @ORGANIZATION1, the @NUM3, and the @CAPS3 by the @CAPS4, offer an immersive gaming experience. One of the latest games for these consoles is @CAPS5 of @CAPS6! Modern @CAPS7 @NUM4. This game features an online system that enables users to communicate with and compete against players worldwide. Moreover, advanced games like @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 enhance eyesight. Research indicates that playing a high - action game for @NUM4 hours a day can improve eyesight more effectively than consuming @NUM6 servings of carrots daily. My final reason for advocating the benefits of computers is their ability to alleviate boredom during waiting periods. If you have ever visited @CAPS10, you are aware that the queue can be as long as @NUM4 hours. Previously, people had to endure the wait passively. Now, individuals can retrieve their @CAPS11 or @NUM8 player to listen to music. The @CAPS11 can also capture videos and photos, as well as play music, videos, and games. If fortunate enough to own an iTouch, one can check emails, stocks, weather, and news directly on the device, and purchase songs at a cost @NUM9 lower than @CAPS14. In conclusion, these technological advancements offer significant benefits. We can now acquire knowledge about new and exciting subjects, have fun while enhancing our eyesight, and avoid the drudgery of waiting.
1539	1543	1	1	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that some individuals do not overly rely on computers. Some may use them to communicate with family members, ascertaining their well - being. Consider a situation where someone in their family passes away, and they are completely unaware. It could be a parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or even a close friend. Some people also utilize computers to access their bank accounts, checking if they can withdraw money or transferring funds to family members. They may also pay bills online. However, I also contend that many people are excessively dependent on computers. For instance, children often use computers solely for gaming. This is detrimental to young children because if they become accustomed to spending excessive time on computers, they may be reluctant to disengage. Parents then face the arduous task of coaxing their children to eat or go to sleep. Therefore, I advocate that some individuals should venture outside, engage in exercise, and appreciate nature. I firmly believe that people will eventually choose to spend more time outdoors, exercising, enjoying nature, and bonding with their families. Thank you, local newspaper. Some individuals are also becoming more informed about various aspects of life through computers.
1540	1544	1	1	People are expending an inordinate amount of time on computers. A significant number of individuals are engrossed in computers for nearly the entire day. Instead, they should allocate more time to their family and friends. People often find themselves lacking sufficient time for engaging in activities. Moreover, computers should primarily be employed for communicating with family and friends, completing homework, conducting research, playing games when bored, and fulfilling work - related tasks. Firstly, individuals ought to prioritize spending quality time with their family and friends over computer usage. For example, if your mother or father invites you to go out for dinner, and you decline, stating that you are on the computer, it indicates an excessive obsession with the device. Many families are being fragmented due to the excessive time spent on computers. If a friend visits and expresses boredom while you are solely focused on playing computer games, it is a discourteous act. Thus, one should disengage from the computer and spend time with loved ones. As previously mentioned, apart from spending time with loved ones, people also need to engage in more physical activities. A large number of individuals sit in front of the computer while eating, gradually leading to weight gain over time. If you are gaining weight as a result of excessive computer use, you should engage in activities to shed the excess fat. If you are a teenager and decline an opportunity to play a sport because you consider the computer more important, it reflects a severe addiction to the device. Consequently, computers should be used judiciously. They should be utilized for communicating with family and friends, completing homework, conducting research, fulfilling work obligations, and playing light games when bored. These are the most crucial functions for which computers should be employed. Many of the activities I have listed are essential because if you use the computer merely to passively observe others' conversations, it is a waste of time. For example, if you have vocabulary homework and need definitions, you can visit www.dictionary.com, or if you simply need to define a basic word. In conclusion, people are spending too much time on computers. They should increase the time spent with family and friends and engage in more activities. Lastly, computers should be used for practical purposes such as homework or important research. Evidently, humans are devoting excessive time to computers instead of focusing on more significant aspects of life.
1541	1545	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am cognizant that numerous individuals assert that people allocate excessive time to computers and do not engage in sufficient exercise. Well, I acknowledge that a substantial number of people utilize computers and obtain adequate utility from them. I shall elucidate the reasons within the subsequent paragraphs. First, I would commence by stating that it is advantageous that people are interested in computers and work with them, as it stimulates their learning endeavors and enables them to acquire novel knowledge, which will contribute to their success in life. People partake in games, crossword puzzles, riddles, and numerous other activities. Some also employ the internet for research, sourcing car parts, etc. Next, the utilization of computers is highly beneficial to humanity as it impacts students' academic pursuits, as well as parents, guardians, and teenagers. It has a significant influence, and many schools are now integrating computers, particularly for students to complete their tasks. It affects parents as it facilitates their success in life and aids them in securing employment. Finally, individuals are getting sufficient exercise as they engage in daily activities such as sleeping, eating, attending school, going to work, or participating in activities that involve walking. Nowadays, no one simply stays at home and remains idle. There is always something to do or a place to visit. Well, I hope you contemplate what I have conveyed and take it into account. Thank you for your time, and remember that your work is also accomplished using a computer.
1542	1546	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, Computers are utilized globally for various purposes and are indispensable in our contemporary world. This is why computers exert a positive influence on individuals today. They facilitate our communication with distant family members. Children depend on them for studying and completing homework. Adults require them for their professional responsibilities, such as sending emails or drafting proposals. This is the rationale behind the positive impact of computers on us. Similar to me, numerous children have family members residing across the ocean or in different parts of the country. In either scenario, establishing contact with them is challenging. Making phone calls can be costly in most instances, and sending letters undoubtedly takes an excessive amount of time to reach the recipients. With email, messages can be dispatched swiftly and at no cost. Additionally, engaging in conversations via email is seamless. Another highly effective method of communicating with family is through Skype or a webcam. This enables you to visually connect with your family members from a considerable distance, all from the comfort of your own home. Computers also offer assistance to children. Children like me frequently have computer-based homework. This may involve typing up a final draft of a paper or taking notes on a historical figure. In both cases, a computer is requisite. Although books can be used to gather information about individuals, can they generate typed papers? Children and teenagers can also utilize computers for study purposes. I regularly employ the computer to practice Spanish by utilizing websites with worksheets and flashcards. Computers not only benefit children but also adults. Many adults in @LOCATION1 and other countries are engaged in business. They are constantly sending emails, drafting proposals, and performing similar tasks. Without a computer, these activities would be extremely arduous. Business professionals are not the only ones who rely on computers. My father, an electrician, is required to send out emails and documents regarding his latest projects several times a week. Apart from work, we incorporate computers into our daily lives. For example, we use them to order clothing and toys, and the most popular application is filing taxes online. It is faster and more convenient, which is why @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 complete their tax filings online. Computers have a positive impact on individuals of this era. This is not merely my opinion but rather a well-established fact. They enable us to maintain connections with distant relatives, assist our children in excelling academically, and support our parents and other adults in their professional and daily lives. Not only are they useful, but they are also essential, and I hope you concur with me.
1543	1547	1	1	Dear local Newspaper, I am penning this letter to you using a computer. I contend that individuals who do not possess computers are in a position to claim that people spend excessive time online rather than engaging in physical activity. My three key points are that computers enhance hand - eye coordination, foster learning capabilities, and facilitate communication. Firstly, computers are not merely for entertainment. They contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. If one were to assume that computers are solely for amusement, they would fail to recognize that they teach typing skills and the ability to type without looking at the keyboard. Secondly, computers empower individuals to explore diverse cultures and acquire knowledge. @PERCENT1 of the American population is online for learning purposes, and @PERCENT2 is online for job - related activities. What about young children? Undoubtedly, they are provided with educational online games. Finally, computers enable individuals to communicate with others. In the event of a school closure or delay, one can stay informed. People can use computers to stay updated on global events or check the weather. These are the reasons why I firmly believe that people should be online at least twice a week.
1544	1548	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do not have a negative impact on people as computers offer the opportunity to play games, engage in web - chats, and watch comical videos. Moreover, computers can be utilized for research projects or to gather facts about @CAPS3 individuals such as @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1. Additionally, who would willingly leave their @CAPS2 to engage in exercise, as physical activity is often perceived as tedious and unappealing. Secondly, who would particularly relish the experience of immersing in nature? Walking through the woods can be uninteresting, as one may encounter mud, be infested with ticks, and be bitten by mosquitoes when sweating. As children mature, they generally prefer to spend time with their friends rather than interacting with their family. They also tend to rely on technology. When not in the mood to make phone calls, kids will spend time texting on their cellphones. Thirdly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination by teaching individuals to type without looking at the keyboard. They also instruct on proper finger placement on the home row of the keyboard. Finally, @CAPS2 genuinely contribute to society as this technology is applicable in middle school, high school, and throughout college. As one grows older, they will gain more in - depth knowledge of such technology. Additionally, children can educate their parents on how to use computers if their parents are unfamiliar with them. Teaching one's parents to use @CAPS2 is a significant responsibility.
1545	1549	1	1	To whom it may concern, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are almost ubiquitous. They simplify the process of finding specific locations through the use of search engines like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 and serve as a means of communication. I am of the opinion that the use of computers benefits society as scientists rely on them daily to formulate plans for space missions or to monitor the progress of experiments. Computers assist individuals in maintaining organization. Many teenagers and children use computers for shopping and staying connected with friends. Some individuals believe that people spend an excessive amount of time on computers. While this may be true, it is important to recognize the positive contributions they make to society. The decision to spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends is a personal choice. It is not as if people are being coerced by @ORGANIZATION1.
1546	1550	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: As the local newspaper, you possess the authority to express your stance on the impacts computers have on individuals. I am of the conviction that computers yield remarkable effects on people as they impart hand - eye coordination, endow individuals with the capacity to learn about distant locales, and enable communication with others. Overall, @PERCENT1 of individuals concur with my perspective regarding computers.  Primarily, the utilization of computers instructs people in hand - eye coordination. For instance, my grandmother informed me that she has mastered the skill of coordinating her hands and eyes proficiently due to her daily engagement with the computer, typing and researching information. In essence, computers are engineered to enhance the focus of one's eyes and hands.  Secondly, computers harbor a wealth of captivating information about far - flung places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 remarks, ""I consistently employ computers for my work as they facilitate my learning about numerous novel aspects. Moreover, they enable my wife and me to explore details about a trip we intend to embark on."" Additionally, the public endorses @PERSON1's assertion. Nevertheless, some individuals in @MONTH1 claim that computers often disseminate inaccurate information; however, if one discovers a reliable website, it will never deceive.  Thirdly, leveraging computers allows one to engage in online conversations or video chats with friends and family across the globe. This proves beneficial as, if you haven't seen your relatives for an extended period and are unable to purchase a ticket to visit them, video chatting is an ideal alternative. It has brought people significantly closer and offers a novel perspective of the world. Instead of squandering your cell phone minutes, consider acquiring a laptop or computer equipped with a camera for video chatting.  Lastly, interacting with others and being actively involved in their lives is of great significance. In conclusion, you will develop excellent eye coordination, be capable of researching distant places, and always have the opportunity to video chat or communicate with family online. I earnestly urge you to inform the world that computers are highly useful and that people utilize them daily without any issues. Moreover, you will experience an unparalleled sense of fulfillment if you bring smiles to everyone's faces by advocating that spending time on the computer can impart valuable knowledge."
1547	1551	1	1	Have you ever contemplated how a computer is constructed or how each minute component is installed? Regrettably, I lack the answers to these queries, yet I pose another question for you to ponder: Are computers detrimental to you? I firmly believe they are not, for several reasons. Firstly, they cultivate hand - eye coordination; secondly, they afford individuals the opportunity to learn about places and people they've neither seen nor heard of; and lastly, they enable communication with distant relatives or friends without the need for physical travel.  As previously mentioned, computers enhance hand - eye coordination. For example, initially, people may struggle to catch a ball, but with consistent practice, they improve. Similarly, when starting to use a computer, one may not be proficient or swift at typing, but with perseverance, speed gradually increases. This positive habit proves advantageous in both academic and professional settings.  Secondly, computers empower people to learn about unfamiliar places and individuals. Some may be unaware of the waterfalls, trails, or cuisine of @ORGANIZATION1. Others might not know that belly - dancing originated from @LOCATION1 or that the concept of the big dragon hails from @LOCATION2. The computer serves as an outstanding resource to acquire such knowledge rapidly, especially beneficial for elderly individuals in wheelchairs who have limited mobility.  Lastly, computers facilitate online communication with far - away relatives or family members. This is advantageous, as in the case of a father on a business trip abroad, where phone calls may not be as fulfilling, and letter - writing is time - consuming. It's heartening to greet a parent or distant cousin online and witness their growth.  I sincerely hope you will side with me on this matter, as it holds great importance for me. Please bear in mind these three reasons, for they pertain to you as well.
1548	1552	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am aware that computers are becoming an indispensable part of people's daily lives. I firmly believe this is a positive development. When using a computer, typing enhances people's hand - eye coordination. Moreover, it enables individuals to gain in - depth knowledge about people, places, and cultures. Additionally, it provides a platform for online communication with existing friends and the opportunity to meet new ones.  To commence, I advocate for the use of computers as they contribute to the improvement of hand - eye coordination. My cousin @PERSON3, a prominent baseball player, once faced difficulties in catching the ball during his youth. He persevered through repeated attempts. For his birthday, his parents gifted him a computer. Although he was initially not adept at typing papers, he practiced both baseball and typing. His family soon realized that this was one of the best decisions, as it not only advanced his baseball career through better throwing and catching but also boosted his school grades.  @PERSON3 is not the sole beneficiary of hand - eye coordination from computers. A recent study from Yale College reveals that @PERCENT1 of individuals who use the computer for at least a month develop some level of hand - eye coordination. @PERSON1, a computer teacher at high school, states, ""@CAPS1 freshmen in my class often tell me that computers have streamlined their sports careers by enhancing their hand - eye coordination."" Computers offer a dual benefit: typing skills and improved hand - eye coordination. Would you want your @CAPS3 to miss out on this positive aspect of life?  In addition, computers facilitate learning about people, places, and cultures. I recently learned about an earthquake at @ORGANIZATION2 and a power - plant explosion in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 from the front page of @CAPS2.com. I am not alone in acquiring such knowledge from the internet. @ORGANIZATION1 conducted a poll, and @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 reported using the computer for research. Should society deprive @CAPS3 of the opportunity to stay informed about current events and history?  In conclusion, computers enable communication with friends and relatives. This is particularly valuable for maintaining contact with those you haven't seen in a while. For example, my cousin @PERSON4 found me on Facebook after eight years, and now we communicate regularly, discussing visits and family updates. Studies indicate that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS3 aged between eleven and eighteen converse with their friends on Facebook daily. Dr. @PERSON2, a teen psychiatrist, opines, ""I believe it is excellent for @CAPS3 to interact with one another through the computer, as it offers a unique mode of socialization."" Given the positive impact on @CAPS3, would you want to hinder this beneficial ability? In summary, computers offer multiple advantages, including improved hand - eye coordination, enhanced learning, and seamless communication. They are an essential tool for both personal and professional growth."
1549	1553	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I acknowledge that a segment of the population utilizes computers; however, not everyone concurs that computers confer benefits upon society. In my view, computers are indeed advantageous to society. There exist numerous websites that can assist in information retrieval. Moreover, computers enable individuals to perform work with greater ease. Additionally, companies can leverage computers to expand their business operations.  When undertaking a project or seeking information, the internet stands as one of the most convenient resources. Google.com houses an extensive repository of information on virtually any topic imaginable. For teenagers without a driver's license and lacking transportation to the library, computers ensure the timely submission of reports or projects. There are also websites that provide directions to desired destinations; MapQuest.com, for instance, is a swift and straightforward means of determining the optimal route.  Computers also facilitate communication. In cases where family members reside at a distance and phone bills are a concern, computers help maintain connections. There are platforms that enable individuals to stay in touch with old friends. For soldiers engaged in warfare, computers are often the only means of communicating with their relatives, as they may not have access to phones, and letter - writing is time - consuming.  Companies rely on computers for easy access to the public. New companies can place advertisements on the side of the Yahoo.com screen, reaching millions of potential customers. Computers also streamline the process of flyer creation; while manually producing a hundred flyers can be a time - consuming task, on a computer, one can create a single template and print multiple copies.  In conclusion, the use of computers benefits society in multiple ways. It simplifies information - seeking, enables seamless communication, and aids companies in attracting business. These are just a few of the compelling reasons why computers are a valuable asset to society.
1550	1554	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I understand that computers are evolving into an essential part of people's daily lives, and I firmly believe this is a positive development.

They are an indispensable tool for personal and social development."
1551	1555	1	1	Computers can serve a multitude of purposes; however, on occasion, individuals exploit them for illicit activities. For instance, certain music websites operate illegally, and sometimes, people obtain unauthorized content from the internet. Engaging with strangers met online can pose risks, as some individuals may misrepresent their age or use fabricated profile pictures.
1552	1556	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, computers hold a significant position in society. A substantial number of adults and children allocate a considerable amount of time daily to computer usage, which, in my opinion, is detrimental. Instead of being engrossed in computers, it would be more advisable to spend quality time with family. Engaging in physical exercise and enjoying the outdoors are also worthwhile time - consuming activities. Moreover, studying, completing schoolwork, and fulfilling job responsibilities are crucial tasks that people should prioritize over excessive computer use. Family bonds are of utmost importance in life, yet some individuals fail to cherish them. Rather than spending the entire day on the computer, spending time at home with family and participating in activities together can be far more enjoyable. For example, many teenagers return home from school and immediately turn to their computers to chat with friends or play games, rather than conversing with their parents about their day. By spending time with family, one can not only gain a deeper understanding of them but also strengthen the relationship and communicate more openly. Nature is a magnificent entity. Although one can view pictures of nature on the internet, it pales in comparison to the real - life experience. By venturing outdoors, taking walks, runs, or hikes, one can engage in beneficial exercise. Physical fitness is essential for a healthy life, which cannot be achieved by sitting in front of a computer all day. Both adults and some teenagers have occupations. While some jobs involve computer use, the majority do not. No one can secure a job by spending the whole day playing games on the computer. There are numerous important activities, such as spending time with family, appreciating nature, and attending to schoolwork and jobs. Computers are not an absolute necessity in our lives, so I believe we should use them more sparingly.
1553	1557	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am dismayed by the sight of lethargic individuals squandering their lives in front of a computer. The question at hand is whether people are devoting an excessive amount of time to computer use, and I firmly believe they are. Here are several reasons: people are engaging in less physical activity, failing to appreciate nature, and spending less time interacting with family and friends. Undoubtedly, exercise is beneficial for one's well - being. However, if people remain sedentary at home, glued to their computers without any exercise, they are likely to gain excessive weight. The more they idle around and do nothing but use the computer, the more sluggish and unmotivated they will become, ultimately leading to a wasted life. In some cases, it can even trigger depression. Just ask a local resident who said, ""@CAPS2's mom used to be constantly on the computer, achieving nothing with her life, and subsequently became depressed and took her own life."" If this trend continues, more and more people will follow suit. I understand that many individuals enjoy being outdoors on sunny days. However, it is disheartening to see someone confined to a room, fixated on a computer screen, simply because they cannot think of anything better to do with their lives. If it were someone you cared about, I am certain you would attempt to intervene. Another local resident, @PERSON1, recalled, ""I would come home every day, and there was @CAPS2's mom in a pitch - black room, like a dark cave. She would sit there for hours, wasting her life on the computer. When I asked her how long it had been since she last went outside, she said it had been almost two months."" I have a family member who was a ""computer junkie."" At a family gathering, @CAPS2's aunt was the only one who could never attend because she was too preoccupied with her computer."
1554	1558	1	1	@PERCENT1 of the population in the @LOCATION3 own computers, indicating the widespread appreciation for this technological advancement. Computers facilitate seamless communication, rapid access to information, and provide entertainment. They have a profoundly positive impact on our lives. Since the invention of computers, an increasing number of people can communicate more efficiently and conveniently. For example, if you wish to converse with a friend in @LOCATION1, all you need to do is log on to a social networking site. Similarly, if you have relatives living across the country, you can use a webcam to have a face - to - face conversation. By interacting with people from around the world, you can gain in - depth knowledge of different countries' cultures and lifestyles. Moreover, when a relative is away, you can still maintain regular contact, strengthening the relationship. The internet and computers are a vast repository of information. With various search engines, you can find answers to diverse queries, such as the height of a maple tree or methods to lose weight. Some may argue that learning while sitting still is unfavorable, but you can search for family activities, nature walks, and exciting exercises. When students need information for a school project, they can conduct online searches instead of visiting the library. Thanks to the internet, people are becoming more informed. Additionally, the internet has effectively eliminated boredom. Both children and adults no longer experience boredom, which is beneficial as boredom can lead children to engage in unwise behavior. Since the advent of computers, people can play games, watch TV shows and movies, and conduct business. If you miss your favorite TV show, you can watch it online. If you need to send a message to @LOCATION2, email offers a fast and reliable alternative. Finally, playing online games can enhance hand - eye coordination. With all these remarkable advantages, we can live in a happier and better world, where information is more accessible, communication is more effective, and entertainment is more diverse.
1555	1559	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1, I'm @PERSON1, and I'm going to discuss the pros and cons of computers. First, let me highlight the positive aspects. The internet is a vast virtual resource readily available at your fingertips, catering to the most inquisitive minds. Navigating the internet is relatively straightforward; all one needs is a keyboard and a mouse. Over the years, computers have undergone significant evolution. There are popular chatting platforms such as @CAPS3, Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr, which seem appealing. However, the internet also has a dark side. Recently, there have been news reports of teenage suicides. Some girls take their own lives due to a sense of inadequacy, and boys may do the same for various reasons. In our society, people are often judged based on their appearance and social standing. In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative aspects, and we must exercise caution when using them.
1556	1560	1	1	"Dear newspaper, do you desire people to be so entranced by a computer that they neglect the world around them? Do you wish for the children in @LOCATION1 to squander hours daily on computers playing games when they could be outdoors breathing fresh air? The question then is whether computers exert positive or negative effects on people. The evident answer is negative. People's constant use of computers instills bad habits and enables them to search for inappropriate content. If people are perpetually engrossed in computer games, then when will they go out for a jog? The answer is never. Individuals who are constantly on the computer do not engage in sufficient exercise. One reason why numerous people in @LOCATION1 are obese is that they do not get enough physical activity. Computers are not alleviating this situation in the least. Some people claim, ""I'll merely spend an hour on the computer and then I'll go work out."" However, the one hour on the computer extends to two hours, and then two hours becomes three. Before you know it, you've wasted the entire day on the computer and not exercised at all. Additionally, there are now so many captivating games on the computer that it's difficult to stop playing them. Yes, some games can be highly entertaining, but you don't have to devote an entire day to playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go outside for some fresh air. As you can see, computers can mesmerize a great many people, causing them to not get enough exercise. Second, people develop bad habits. For example, kids are always on the website where you can chat with your friends. The issue with using the computer in this way is that people overuse abbreviated language and become overly accustomed to writing like that. Then, kids in @MONTH1 start writing that way in school assignments, and most don't even realize it. Also, there are new websites where you can post personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to access your details. Lastly, it is extremely easy for people, even children, to search for inappropriate content. Everything is available on the internet, and young kids will be very curious about it. They can search for inappropriate words and pictures, and no one will ever know. People can post inappropriate information on their own profiles for others to see, and it can be impossible to remove. And, if parents are unaware that their children are searching for inappropriate content, then the kids will continue doing it because they know they won't get caught. So, as you can see, computers have a very detrimental effect on people. It makes it all too easy for individuals to access inappropriate things. So, go and limit the time you spend on the computer."
1557	1561	1	1	Dear Local @CAPS1, what are your sentiments regarding computers? Are they beneficial or are they detrimental? I firmly believe that computers are detrimental and that people allocate an excessive amount of time to them. I would much rather spend time outdoors where I can engage in physical activity; wouldn't you? Computers are a waste of time and impede family and friends from spending quality time together. Finally, computers can pose significant risks. People may be deceptive, and you would be unaware. To commence, computers detract from physical exercise and time spent outdoors. I am certain that if I had to choose between staring at a monotonous computer screen all day and going for a run, I would opt for the run without hesitation. Computers do not contribute to people's physical fitness and well - being, so they should seek alternative activities. I have noticed that the average teenager spends @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. That is @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours that could be dedicated to exercising or playing outside. For instance, walking the dog or playing soccer. You see, there are numerous activities you can pursue other than using the computer. Moreover, computers encroach upon quality time with friends and family. I understand that you can engage in video chats and instant messaging, but wouldn't you prefer to spend time with them in person? Too many children spend excessive time on the computer and are oblivious to the happenings in their parents' lives. There are numerous activities that children can undertake with their friends and families instead of using the computer. They could play a board game, watch a movie, and much more. I guarantee that they will derive greater enjoyment from these activities than from staring at a computer screen for @NUM5 hours. Finally, computers are extremely perilous. People have lost their lives because they are unaware of the true identities of those they are communicating with. Children use platforms like MySpace and post pictures and messages without realizing that everyone can view their content. Once something is posted, it cannot be retracted. It is also hazardous because when someone applies to a school, the school can access their online posts and may reject their application. I hope you concur with me when I assert that computers are detrimental. They prevent people from exercising, spending time with friends and family, and are highly dangerous. In my opinion, we should eliminate computers from every household.
1558	1562	1	1	The Significance of Computers in the Contemporary World. Computers have emerged as a prevalent technology in modern times. In essence, computers are advanced calculators. The invention of computers originated from a rudimentary calculating device. It is akin to having a versatile assistant within your home. A multitude of individuals own various types of computers, which have undergone continuous improvement, becoming faster and of higher quality. Currently, computers are constantly evolving in terms of technology. Every day, billions of people across the globe purchase computers. However, this does not necessarily imply that they are of the highest quality. People are vying for more advanced and modern innovations.
1559	1563	1	1	Computers are among the essential tools we utilize and interact with on a daily basis. Some experts express concerns that people are devoting an inordinate amount of time to the allure of computers! I am fond of computers, yet as a teenager, I am cognizant of the importance of managing one's time on the computer. One cannot simply sit idle and squander time on the computer. The time wasted on the computer could be spent outdoors enjoying oneself. There are numerous activities one can engage in outside! For example: play ball, run around, visit the park, go on an exploration, etc. Friends and family are a source of great entertainment. I have a multitude of friends, and I cherish them all! If you have some free time, you should socialize with them and have a good time. You could go to the mall! I always opt to go to the mall with my friends instead of spending hours playing on the computer. So, disengage from the computer and go outside! Have some fun in the sun today.
1560	1564	1	1	I dissent from what people claim about computers. Certainly, they do enhance hand - eye coordination. However, they are not entirely beneficial for people. Let us explore my perspective on those who believe that computers have a positive impact on people. People are becoming increasingly overweight! Wonder why? It is because they spend an excessive amount of time on computers and insufficient time exercising. In fact, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. It is a well - known fact that some people succumb to obesity - related issues each year. Consider this: baseball players and similar athletes can earn approximately @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year. Don't you aspire to be millionaires? Isn't nature magnificent when one experiences it? I believe so, yet people often act without considering the consequences of deforestation. Think about the animals; don't you think they endure enough suffering each year? Computers are a pernicious influence on people once again because people need to experience life rather than remaining sedentary behind a desk or at home. Social media platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, and other similar websites are not advisable. There are sexual predators worldwide who target children and teenagers like us at Batchelder. For this reason, you should refrain from interacting with friends on the internet. You should engage in physical activity at the park with your friends and family. Additionally, it is preferable to meet new friends in person as you can develop a better understanding of them as you mature. There are numerous reasons why computers are harmful and, at times, even more so. Do not use computers for trivial reasons. Otherwise, you may endanger your life. It can render you so lethargic that you will be unable to walk. Keep this in mind, everyone.
1561	1565	1	1	Esteemed local newspaper representatives, @CAPS1's numerous computers have significantly contributed to our planet. For instance, they facilitate alternatives to driving our cars for various tasks. Learning has become more accessible for everyone with the aid of computers. Moreover, computers enable seamless communication among individuals. Instead of regarding a device containing information with disdain, we should be grateful for having such a tool in our homes. There are times when we don't need to use our cars if we have a computer at our disposal. Some individuals have decided to establish their own @CAPS1 businesses, leveraging computers to do so. Additionally, if one doesn't wish to spend time driving to purchase a T - shirt, they can simply use the computer to make the purchase. Furthermore, the more we drive, the more pollution accumulates in our atmosphere. Without computers, our planet would become @PERCENT1 more polluted each year. Do we really want this to happen to our world? Lastly, we save fuel on our cars by using computers. If computers were removed, people might still opt for the easier way and just drive. Learning is more straightforward for everyone with computers as we no longer have to search through books for information. There are also @CAPS1 different learning programs available to teach us various languages. Many people can access educational resources as if they were in college, even if they don't have a traditional college experience. Additionally, computers can assist us with our homework. I truly consider it my second brain. Thirdly, communication is greatly enhanced with computers. Suppose you need to send a large amount of information and don't have other means. The computer can help; it allows you to communicate with others, such as the Japanese who speak English, enabling you to understand how @CAPS1 life compares to yours. You can ask people questions or play mental games for fun. I've been able to chat extensively with my old friends through this, and I miss them. It's the only way I can talk to them without my parents scolding me due to high phone bills. The remarkable capabilities of a computer make us realize we don't have to engage in as many activities that harm the environment. We can learn more quickly without relying on books. Finally, it allows us to stay in touch with old friends. I hope everyone can believe that the computer is not as bad as it may seem.
1562	1566	1	1	"Greetings. I am @PERSON1 @CAPS1, and I aim to convince you that computers offer substantial benefits to our society. Firstly, @CAPS3 empowers students to achieve excellent grades on projects and reports with ease. Secondly, it enables individuals to submit online job applications. Lastly, computers facilitate social interaction among people. Specifically, the computer enables students, including your children, to perform better on their projects and reports. For example, when students are working on a report about ""@CAPS2 Lincoln,"" they can access the necessary information about the person right from home. When using a computer for reports, there's no need to exhaust project resources. They can also search for information and print pictures to make their projects more vivid and appealing to younger audiences. Moreover, @CAPS3 allows users to type information in an organized and neat manner. Consequently, if you're seeking job applications without wasting time, simply search on the internet. This approach prevents you from visiting places without knowing if jobs are available and finding none. Additionally, @CAPS3 saves you the trouble of making unnecessary trips. You can research the salary and regulations of a job and receive quicker notifications about job acceptance. Lastly, @CAPS3 promotes socializing. Platforms like Facebook and/or MySpace allow you to communicate with school friends or those you've met online. Adults without MySpace or Facebook accounts can use email, MSN, AOL, AIM/AOL Instant Messenger, or engage in chat. In this way, adults can keep up with work - related communication, and children can maintain contact with friends and family. This is why I believe that computers with internet access benefit our society in terms of projects, reports, job applications, and socializing with family and friends."
1563	1567	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, technology is ubiquitously employed and proves beneficial to numerous aspects of our lives. Many engineers endeavor to enhance the popularity of technological devices, while others utilize them for communication or relaxation. According to a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION2 University, the computer is the most widely used machine. The computer makes a positive contribution to our education, economy, and entertainment. As previously mentioned, the computer is advantageous for our education. Take the middle school I attend as an example. During the school day, over @NUM1 computers are in use. These computers assist students in completing research papers, typed assignments, and other teacher - required documents. By using computers for research papers, students save hours of searching through library books and money on purchasing reading materials. Additionally, computers aid teachers in organizing files and entering grades online, allowing students to check their progress. This is particularly useful considering the large number of assignments graded each week. Moreover, a system called the ""parent portal"" enables students to stay informed about school events that might otherwise go unnoticed. In summary, computers are an effective educational tool. Besides education, computers also impact our economy. Currently, due to the wide range of computer options available, computers are affordable, with prices starting as low as sixty dollars! This is a positive aspect as the economy has been struggling since the depression. As a result, families have started to cut back on many technological devices. However, the decrease in computer prices has stimulated purchases. Also, the computer has mainly improved entertainment methods. Instead of using a CD player, you can download and listen to music while chatting online with friends. This is very helpful for last - minute plan changes, as for those without a telephone, communication can be difficult, which would negatively affect entertainment time. Additionally, children can use the internet to play games to relieve stress after a tough school day, and adults can unwind after a rough workday. Computers are also involved in producing the movies you watch at home on the couch and the video games you order from eBay. From Facebook and MySpace to classic movies like ""Gone with the Wind,"" computers provide a relaxing entertainment experience."
1564	1568	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have detrimental effects on people's lives. Instead of utilizing time productively and engaging in outdoor activities, individuals are often confined to their homes, playing games or chatting with friends on the computer. If you are someone who is prone to weight gain or currently on diabetic medication, I strongly recommend that you engage in physical exercise or invite a friend for a walk in the park. In this way, you can enjoy the beauty of nature, have face - to - face conversations with your friend rather than online interactions, and also get some exercise. You may not have realized that you are also doing your friend a favor. Both you and your partner can reap the benefits of outdoor activities. Increased physical activity can even strengthen your friendship or family bond. You might also enhance your self - esteem as you'll look in the mirror and feel good about your new, healthy - looking physique. Moreover, if you are someone who often feels depressed, lonely, or in a bad mood, this advice could be the solution to your problems. Physical workouts and activities can boost your energy levels, which you may not have thought possible before. If I were you, I'd stop being lethargic and start enjoying life instead of wasting time on idle pursuits.
1565	1569	1	1	The impact of computers on people is unreasonable for children and others. In today's era, computers are not beneficial for people as they spend excessive time on them without realizing that it damages their eyesight, and some individuals become addicted. People use computers as if they were of no consequence. Some people wrongly assume that computers do not harm their eyes. The time people spend on computers could be better spent with their family and friends. People's judgment regarding the computer issue is misguided. People should not use computers so excessively because spending all day on the computer can damage eyesight, which is something many people fail to understand today. I believe there should be a limit on the time people spend on computers.
1566	1570	1	1	Undoubtedly, I am convinced that computers confer substantial benefits upon society. They facilitate communication with others, aid in learning, and are an integral part of contemporary technology. Firstly, computers have undergone remarkable advancements from the archaic typewriters of the past. They have enhanced modern life for several reasons. With computers, we can acquire knowledge and discover information previously unknown to us. For instance, if one has a project on the @LOCATION1, it is likely that they possess limited knowledge about it. By accessing the internet, a wealth of information can be obtained, such as who and what rely on the @ORGANIZATION1 for water, the length of the @LOCATION1, its geographical location, and other relevant details. Additionally, computers contribute to learning in another way. Suppose one is going to a new job interview but has no idea about its location or how to reach there. By inputting the address, the internet can provide directions. Even when one is unsure about the airing time of their favorite show, a simple search on the computer will yield the answer. Secondly, computers benefit society by enabling communication with others across the state, country, or even the world, or just down the street. Social media platforms like Facebook and @CAPS1 are highly useful. For example, one of my close friends moved away in second grade. Just before Christmas, I found her on Facebook, and now we regularly catch up, despite not having seen each other for years. Moreover, if someone's parent is away at war or overseas, they can communicate through email, Skype, Yahoo Instant Messenger, using the webcam or telephone. Computers can also be utilized for business purposes, allowing colleagues to communicate via webcam to discuss profit, store operations, and other matters. Lastly, technology has made significant progress, and computers play a crucial role. In the past, typing required the use of a typewriter, which was cumbersome. Today, one can simply use @CAPS3 @CAPS4, which offers features such as spell - check, the ability to email documents, and options to modify font, color, and size. Furthermore, with devices like iPhones or iTouches, one can access the internet anywhere, whether to find an app, check the length of the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, or even order a pizza. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers benefit our society as they enable communication, facilitate learning, and are an essential part of our technological landscape.
1567	1571	1	1	In my considered view, individuals should allocate less time to computers and more time to physical exercise, appreciating nature, and engaging with family and friends. Spending excessive time on computers often leads people to become engrossed and neglect activities such as visiting the park or the mall. However, there are also valid reasons for not completely disconnecting from computers. Firstly, they serve as a crucial means of communication. If someone travels to a distant location, computers can ensure continuous contact. For example, one can acquire a laptop and use it during various travels, such as on an airplane to North Carolina, Virginia, or Washington @ORGANIZATION1, at a party, on a road - trip, or on a ferry to the Long Island Sound. Secondly, computers are indispensable for planning. Whether it is planning a trip to a far - off destination, a new house, an anniversary celebration, or a honeymoon in a picturesque place like a peak hill or a heart - shaped bed hotel, computers provide the necessary resources. Thirdly, computers can help in identifying locations. They can determine a particular spot where a person might be, rather than just relying on a person's home address. Fourthly, computers are useful for social and personal events. For instance, when planning a birthday party for a child, visiting someone in Tennessee, or going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to watch a basketball game between the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Lakers and the Cavaliers, computers can assist in arrangements. In conclusion, it is evident that people should not be completely detached from computers due to their multifaceted utility in communication, planning, location identification, and social activities.
1568	1572	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, regarding this matter, computers have become extremely versatile in modern times. They offer the ability to play games, complete homework, and socialize. However, one must question whether there are more fulfilling pursuits. Activities such as physical exercise, appreciating the splendor of nature, and, most importantly, interacting with family and friends are often overshadowed by computer use. Once a person starts using a computer, it is difficult to disengage. Using a computer requires minimal physical exertion and energy. Consequently, if one spends the entire day eating and using the computer, they burn few calories, which can lead to weight gain. Moreover, computers can induce a sense of lethargy, causing people to exercise less, which is detrimental to their health. Exercise, on the other hand, provides energy and is beneficial for well - being. Have you ever gazed out of the window and marveled at the beauty of nature? When one is engrossed in chatting with online friends and playing games on the computer, they often fail to realize what they are missing. Every time I use the computer, I yearn to be outside, enjoying the natural world. Trees, flowers, plants, grass, and numerous other elements constitute our planet, yet some people fail to appreciate these wonders. Therefore, the next time you are on the computer, pause and reflect on this. While you are idly spending time on the computer, there may be a homeless child wandering, perhaps searching for their family. Would you want to be in their position, without a family or friends? Many people take their family for granted, but such a situation can occur unexpectedly. I firmly believe that instead of squandering time on the computer, we should engage with our family and friends. Even a simple conversation can demonstrate our concern. In conclusion, I consider computers to be a waste of time. Although they are touted as a means of communication, people managed to communicate effectively in the past without computers, and we can do the same. Computers reduce our time for exercise, prevent us from enjoying nature, and limit our interaction with family and friends. Listening to someone who uses a computer daily, I can attest that avoiding excessive computer use is a wise choice.
1569	1573	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, how are you? I am doing well and am writing this letter to expound on why you should recognize the positive impact of computers on people. There are three primary reasons for this view: the ability to connect with distant friends and family, the facilitation of learning about different parts of the world, and the assistance in understanding and learning more about life. Firstly, computers enable people to maintain contact with friends and family residing in far - flung places. In today's world, many individuals have family members scattered across different locations, making regular and meaningful communication challenging. However, through the internet, people can easily reach out to their loved ones and engage in conversations. For example, if you live in the @LOCATION2 and have a friend in @LOCATION1, the computer allows you to stay in touch. I have family members in @LOCATION1, and it was difficult to communicate with them before. But now, with the computer, I can chat with them and have a great time, which clearly shows the importance of computers in maintaining relationships. Secondly, computers are invaluable for learning about different parts of the world. If one is unfamiliar with a particular country or place, they can conduct research on the internet and gain in - depth knowledge. For instance, when I have a project or an essay on an unfamiliar topic, I turn to the computer for information. This not only helps me complete my academic tasks but also broadens my knowledge. Thirdly, computers assist in understanding and learning more about life. When one is unsure about the right or wrong of a situation, they can search for answers on the computer. Additionally, if one is trying a new recipe and is unsure about the process, the computer can provide the necessary ingredients and instructions. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people as they facilitate communication with friends and family, enhance learning about the world, and offer guidance in various aspects of life. I earnestly hope that you will carefully consider this letter and recognize the numerous benefits that computers bring.
1570	1574	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2, I have recently learned that your paper intends to explore how computers benefit society in @LOCATION1. I am writing to express my full agreement with this view. There are several reasons why computers are beneficial to society. Firstly, computers play a vital role in education. They offer multiple ways to enhance learning. In the academic realm, computers are an excellent resource for students. For example, they can be used to study for tests with the help of information - rich websites like @ORGANIZATION1. Moreover, when it comes to homework, computers are extremely efficient. Consider a situation where a major essay is due the next day. Using a computer to type the essay is not only faster but also more productive. I recall a time when I had to write a final draft for an important essay on its due date. Instead of writing it by hand, which would have taken an hour, I went to the library and typed it, completing the task in just half an hour. Secondly, computers contribute to the development of hand - eye coordination. Although most people possess this skill, for those who need improvement, computers offer various solutions. One such way is through learning yoga. Computers provide online videos that can help individuals practice yoga, which is effective in relieving stress, even if they do not have the time to attend a physical class. Additionally, computers offer sports - related videos that teach how to play different sports, allowing people to enjoy sports as much as they would in real - life situations. Finally, computers enable online communication with friends. Social media platforms like @CAPS2 - @CAPS3 (Myspace) have become extremely popular for chatting with friends. Moreover, online dating has emerged as a new way to start a romantic relationship, allowing individuals to initiate a new chapter in their lives without leaving their homes. In conclusion, having computers in our lives is highly advantageous. They facilitate communication, promote the development of hand - eye coordination, and provide a quality education. Although there may be many other reasons for the usefulness of computers, this is my perspective on how they positively impact society.
1571	1575	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am penning this correspondence to discuss the impact computers exert on individuals. As I possess two computers and one laptop, I concur that every individual inclined to conduct research ought to own a computer. Everyone should have access to computers because they facilitate the exploration of diverse subjects, enable engagement in games such as checkers either against the computer or other players, and, last but not least, allow for communication with individuals from different states and even countries, as I am aware that everyone enjoys interacting with one another. Everyone should have computers as they can search for a wide range of things, including places and people. Essentially, one can search for anything on the internet provided they are on the appropriate website. Once, I wished to access the web to determine if there was an establishment in @LOCATION1. I visited ask.com and typed in ""@CAPS1 there a in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1?"" It indicated yes and subsequently presented me with a wealth of information about it, including the address, phone number, and the name of the manager. Searching for places can sometimes be challenging. Everyone should have a computer as they can play various types of games. One could play internet games like checkers, solitaire, and even freecall. If one does not have any specific games in mind, they can always visit gaming websites to discover games. Since I utilize the computer daily, I have had numerous experiences. When I was six years old, we encountered a driving game. As I was unfamiliar with the website, all I could play on the computers was checkers. However, one day I logged on and played my first driving computer game. Everyone should have a computer as they can chat with people. Instead of constantly using one's phone to call and text people, thereby increasing the phone bill, why not use the computer and chat to one's heart's content without squandering minutes on the cell phone. I know that everyone enjoys talking and texting on their cell phones. Instead of doing that, one can simply access the internet, find a chat site, and commence chatting or blogging with friends. Once, I exhausted my phone minutes and did not have internet access. I asked my dad if I could use the computer. He assented, so I visited a local chatroom on the internet. My friend had an account there, so it was convenient for us to converse as much as we desired. I joined in, and we chatted until @TIME1. In conclusion, I believe that everyone who enjoys researching places, playing games, and chatting should possess a computer."
1572	1576	1	1	"Computers are fascinating pieces of technology that can be utilized both at home and in the workplace. Some individuals may perceive computers as a waste of time and consider them to be of little use or lacking the ability to offer assistance. Conversely, others recognize the computer as an extremely helpful tool. People should be appreciative of the invention of the computer. What is your stance on this matter? ""You're wasting your time on the computers!"" This is a common refrain heard from parents. However, children do not necessarily squander their time when using the computer, as they could be composing a paper for a class or engaging in an educational game. Even if they are not engaged in these activities, the computer is still facilitating their learning. Some may claim that computers are useless, but this assertion is unfounded. When writing a paper for an @CAPS1 class, one would benefit from the assistance of a computer. It is equipped with a keyboard, which enables faster typing compared to writing by hand. Additionally, it features a grammar check function to ensure accurate spelling. This is why a computer is a valuable tool. Computers not only expedite tasks but also assist in retrieving information on a multitude of topics from the internet. Moreover, if one were required to research a person for a school project, it is likely that more comprehensive information could be obtained from the computer than from books. In essence, computers do indeed contribute to the efficiency of tasks. They are not a waste of time but rather a useful asset for everyone, aiding in the acceleration of various processes."
1573	1577	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, A significant number of individuals have employed computers to acquire knowledge about diverse cultures. Computers have a profoundly positive influence on people, transforming the way they think and perceive the world. Experts have even noted that computers have an impact on people's behavior both at home and in public settings. @CAPS6 also serves as a valuable tool for individuals with special needs, facilitating their learning of reading and spelling. Many people have utilized computers to explore different cultures, which has had a beneficial impact on society by educating the youth and preventing them from making mistakes related to racial prejudice. Computers have not only enabled people to learn about other cultures but also about their own. This has been substantiated by @ORGANIZATION1 news. Some may argue that computers cause people to neglect their daily exercise. However, people not only use computers for study but also to discover various diets and stretching techniques to maintain their physical well - being. Studies have shown that @PERCENT1 of the population has benefited from the information available on computers regarding fitness. As The @CAPS5 times has stated, ""The computer not only enhances our fitness but also keeps us informed. With just a single click, @CAPS6 can provide us with a wealth of information in less than a minute."" Thus, it is evident that computers have brought about significant changes not only in society but also in the world at large. This underscores the substantial impact that @CAPS6 has had."
1574	1578	1	1	Dear, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that while computers are highly beneficial to society, they also pose certain problems. For instance, there are individuals who are addicted to computers and will spend hours in a dimly lit area solely focused on the computer. This issue is compounded by the prevalence of obesity in @LOCATION2. Although I may not have elaborated on this in detail, it is evident that the very thing that is supposed to educate our youth could potentially harm them. What exactly is a computer junkie? A computer junkie is someone who wakes up at @TIME1 in the morning and remains on the computer for well over @NUM1 hours. This is a problem that affects @PERCENT1 of our @CAPS1 youth. Although this topic may not seem significant to some, it is indeed a matter of concern. My brother is addicted to his laptop. He spends hours in his bedroom watching Japanese cartoons (anime) without consuming any food throughout the day. He never leaves his room, and my mother has grown weary of attempting to coax him out, eventually giving up. It becomes quite irritating after a while. A moderate amount of computer use is not detrimental, but excessive use can be problematic. Obesity is a growing concern in our nation, and computers are not helping the situation. In fact, they are exacerbating the problem as people can have items delivered to their doorsteps without having to exert themselves physically. This reduces the opportunity for individuals to engage in physical activity and potentially lose weight. Online @CAPS3 ordering from @CAPS2 @CAPS3 markets such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5 domino @CAPS4 and @LOCATION3 jade has contributed to this issue. It is necessary to curtail online @CAPS3 ordering. While the computer is an excellent means of learning, it can also lead to addiction and weight gain.
1575	1579	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals. They endow individuals with the capacity to communicate with others online, not only with friends but also with family members residing in distant locations. Moreover, computers enable individuals to undertake various types of work that cannot be accomplished manually and even facilitate the acquisition of knowledge about remote places and people. Firstly, computers have a positive effect on people as they provide the ability to communicate with others online. This includes not only friends but also family members who live far away. For example, half of my family resides in @LOCATION1, and my mother utilizes the internet to stay in touch with them. Secondly, computers have a positive influence as they allow individuals to complete homework that cannot be done by hand, such as essays that require typing and school projects. Lastly, computers have a positive impact as they enable people to learn about far - off places and people. For instance, when I first arrived in this country, I had limited knowledge about it. However, through online research, I was able to learn a great deal. In conclusion, computers have a significant impact on people. They empower individuals to communicate with others online, whether they are friends or family members in distant locations. They also enable the completion of work that cannot be done manually and facilitate the exploration of faraway places and people.
1576	1580	1	1	Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am a student from @ORGANIZATION2. I have learned that there are differing opinions regarding the use of computers; some individuals consider it advantageous, while others perceive it as a waste of time. I possess @NUM1 compelling justifications for why computers are valuable technology. Firstly, one can make reservations for desired destinations or attractions. This is an effective utilization of the computer as it enables route tracking, and one can even print a map for a hiking expedition. (What a great form of exercise!) Another benefit of using computers is online chatting. Suppose you have a family member residing in @LOCATION1, and both you and they own computers. If direct communication incurs costs, you can opt for email. This is a practical way to stay informed about your family members' lives. Additionally, computers serve as a valuable learning tool. You can explore diverse cultures, learn about different people, and understand their ways of life and cultural practices. My final point pertains to @CAPS1. It is an excellent means of using the computer as it allows you to stay updated on the latest events, such as the earthquake in Haiti, a hurricane, or a breaking news story. You can also be aware if a storm is approaching. In conclusion, computers offer numerous beneficial applications. Although there are some inappropriate websites, when used correctly, computers are a valuable technological resource.
1577	1581	1	1	"Some experts express concerns that individuals are allocating excessive time to computers, and I concur with their viewpoint. Most children would prefer to be on the computer, chatting with friends online or spending hours on Facebook. However, what is the purpose of this when there is an entire world to discover? They do not appreciate nature as they should and spend less time with family and friends. If one is constantly on the computer, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, how can they obtain sufficient exercise? This is precisely the problem: they do not exercise at all. Some may disagree with me, but the fact remains that moving one's hand over the mouse does not constitute exercise. A recent survey has been conducted, and @CAPS2 reported that out of the @PERCENT1 of children who own a computer, @PERCENT2 are overweight or at risk of becoming overweight. @CAPS2 is disheartened to think that technology has become so dominant that it is ruining people's lives. I also use the computer for @CAPS1, but I always ensure to ride my bike afterward or go on a hike with my family. @CAPS1 of the time, I have softball practice, so I am unable to use the computer anyway. Now, what about the beautiful aspects of nature that @CAPS1 of us are missing? The outdoors is something that most of us take for granted. Some of us have @CAPS3 witnessed a day - lily bloom at night, and new ones emerge the very next day. This is a fascinating sight that @CAPS3 may miss because they are fixated on their computer screens. Children should learn to balance technology with more important aspects of life, such as nature conservation and physical activity. Yes, I understand that some may disagree, saying, ""But I am supporting the rainforest or @LOCATION1 by being a member of this website."" While it is true that you are contributing, taking direct action yourself would be far more rewarding. For example, you could organize a group to clean up the streets in your neighborhood or assist in planting trees in the park. The most important things in life are family and friends, and technology should @CAPS3 not interfere with these relationships. If you were to lose everything, what would be the one thing you would always have? Of course, it is loving family and friends. If family is so important, then why would kids prefer to be on the computer rather than attending a family picnic? Is it because technology is taking over their lives and obscuring their perception of the more significant things life has to offer? Don't you sometimes wish you could be a child again, running barefoot in a field with your parents? This could be somewhat achievable if you got up from the chair you've been sitting in for three hours straight and went on a hike with your family. I may not be entirely coherent, but being physically present with family is superior to instant - messaging someone who lives halfway across the world! I know that many people will disagree with me when they read this, but I believe that technology is ruining some people's lives. If you think about it, a computer is like a @CAPS4 - @CAPS5 @CAPS6. It has a sweet allure, but once you are fully immersed, it entraps you and does not let go. A computer is indeed ruining lives, and experts are justified in their concerns about people's health! All of us should engage in more exercise, spend more time in nature, and be with family and friends more often instead of being glued to a computer screen."
1578	1582	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, do you not concur that computers are beneficial to society? I certainly do. I find that my computer benefits society because it enables interaction with others online. It is effortless to find entertainment, and @CAPS4 is extremely useful and profitable. Now, you may not believe that computers are ""society - friendly,"" but I am here to refute that claim. One aspect I appreciate about computers is the ease of interacting with people, whether they are miles away or in the neighborhood. With just a click of a button, communication can be initiated. For instance, my friends all have the well - known Facebook accounts. All I need to do is log in, open the chat box, click on their names, and voila! We are engaged in conversation. Moreover, you do not have to disclose any personal details (such as @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone numbers, etc.) to chat on Facebook. How simple is that? Have you ever turned on your @CAPS8, flipped through channels, and thought, ""@CAPS9 nothing good on @CAPS8?"" Well, with a computer, there is always something to watch. Whether it is old or new, real or fictional, live or pre - recorded, the computer offers a plethora of viewing options. You can open your @CAPS12 browser and visit @CAPS13 (a video - sharing site) to watch a wonderful variety of content. There are at least @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13, and @NUM2 are watched or uploaded daily. In fact, the ""@CAPS14"" views over @NUM3 videos a day without even realizing it. If you are interested in stand - up comedy, you can type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16."" If you prefer action, you can search for relevant content. Essentially, the computer and the vast web offer countless activities. Now, after highlighting these two aspects, it has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Suppose you have a major test or report due the next day; you can study for it online. You can go on Google, type in your project's subject, and obtain over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second, depending on your bandwidth. Additionally, the computer is profitable. Did you know that the creators of Google are extremely wealthy? They have amassed more wealth than @ORGANIZATION1, a company that produces the most widely used computer system. Once again, the computer is highly useful and profitable. This is precisely why I believe that computers benefit society. They allow for interaction with others, provide entertainment, and are both helpful and profitable. Therefore, you should recognize that computers are beneficial to society. Thank you for your time."
1579	1583	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I contend that it is advantageous for people to spend a significant amount of time on computers. There are several reasons to support this view. Firstly, typing on a computer enhances hand - eye coordination. Secondly, computer usage can result in cost savings. Lastly, computers can perform tasks in seconds that would otherwise take hours. Hand - eye coordination is a crucial skill. For example, when walking down the street and a baseball comes flying towards you, your ability to catch it may be attributed to the hand - eye coordination developed through computer use. There are various ways to acquire this skill, such as playing sports, writing, or using one's thumbs. However, learning to type is the most effective method as it is useful throughout childhood and adulthood. Are you having trouble paying your phone bill? Well, you don't need a phone. You can use your computer to make calls for free. Moreover, you don't really need a cell phone as a computer can perform all the functions more efficiently. Additionally, it is less likely for a computer to be stolen or lost compared to a cell phone. Have you ever been frustrated when searching for information in a book? By using a computer, you can save hours of searching and then go outside to play games. Usually, it takes me hours to complete my homework, but with a computer, it would probably only take minutes. In conclusion, considering the development of hand - eye coordination, the potential for cost savings, and the efficiency of information retrieval, I believe it is beneficial for people to spend time on computers, and I hope you share this view.
1580	1584	1	1	A significant number of individuals hold diverse opinions regarding whether computers benefit society. I firmly believe that computers are useful in numerous aspects. Firstly, many schools require computers for students to complete projects. Secondly, there are computer games designed to aid children in learning. Thirdly, computers provide an excellent means of relaxation. The primary reason I believe computers are beneficial is that they are essential for many school - aged children. In school, students often have projects that involve typing or obtaining pictures. Without computers, it would be extremely challenging to accomplish these tasks. Additionally, when writing persuasive essays, a computer can be used to type the content, resulting in a neater and more professional appearance. Some may argue that hand - writing is an alternative, but typing is often faster and tidier for many individuals. The second reason is that computers offer a wide range of educational games. These games can assist people in learning. Although the text about the specific games is not clear, it is evident that computers can be a valuable educational tool. Finally, computers are a great way to unwind. Many people return home from work exhausted. Instead of spending the entire evening on the couch, they can engage in a fun game on the computer for a short period. Some may claim that watching TV and using the computer are equivalent, but playing an educational game occasionally can be beneficial. One can also enjoy other forms of entertainment on the computer from time to time. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial. They are necessary for students in school, offer educational games, and provide a means of relaxation.
1581	1585	1	1	Do the members of this renowned and alluring newspaper opine that the impacts of individuals owning a computer are positive or negative? Well, should you hold a pessimistic view regarding computers and their influence on people, I would courteously dissent. I am confident that I could persuade you to concur with me. Computers are advantageous for numerous reasons. The internet and other resources can be utilized for academic pursuits, professional work, and addressing various queries. The computer provides individuals with an activity when they would otherwise be idle, and it enables people to interact with others online. There are numerous remarkable effects that computers have on and for people. Everyone has questions, would you not concur? And more often than not, individuals do not know the answer immediately. Research is the key to answering questions. However, who has the time to visit the library and spend hours searching for an answer that would take mere seconds to find on the computer? Not every student, employee, or other individual can afford to spend that time seeking an answer. There are far too many other matters to attend to! The internet on the computer allows people to find an answer promptly. This can actually enhance people's knowledge and their performance at work or school. Here, you can observe the positive effects of a computer. Have any of you ever experienced boredom? I am certain that you have. Everyone gets bored. Instead of sitting around doing nothing, people can engage with the computer and partake in numerous activities. Contrary to some people's beliefs, this can be an excellent way to spend, rather than waste, time. There are all sorts of educational games and mind - boggling puzzles available on the computer. I am certain you can recognize how much more beneficial these activities are than sitting in front of... The effects are positive because your brain is challenged, and your boredom dissipates. Additionally, hand - eye coordination can be significantly improved through engaging in activities. There are so many positive aspects of the computer's effect on people's boredom! People have friends, and it is only natural to desire to maintain close contact with them. But what if a close friend relocates? You do not wish to lose that friendship, do you? People can correspond with each other via letters, but that can be time - consuming and slow in terms of delivery and response. And the positive effect of a computer is that it allows you to stay in touch online with friends and family through instant messaging and email, both of which are excellent resources for communicating with others. Computers can keep friends connected and prevent families from growing apart. It is also beneficial for couples or parents to stay in touch with their partners or children when they are away. These are all positive effects, do you not agree? As you can see, I firmly believe that the computer has positive effects on people. It is useful for research, it offers something to do when someone is truly bored, and it enables friends and family to remain close through online communication. I earnestly urge you to shift your opinion from negative to positive regarding the effects of computers. Everyone can form their own opinions, but I know you will prove wise and agree with me!
1582	1586	1	1	"Dear, esteemed members of the newspaper, individuals ought to curtail their computer usage as it adversely affects their lifestyle. Instead of spending excessive time on the computer, they should engage in physical exercise, socialize with friends and family, and relish the beauty of nature. Firstly, computers can contribute to a surge in obesity within the community as they foster lethargy and discourage people from exercising. If people commence regular exercise, approximately @PERCENT1 of the lethargy will diminish. They should at least take a stroll outdoors instead of expending excessive electricity. Moreover, around @PERCENT2 of the electricity bill will decrease if they opt for exercise over computer use. Secondly, people need to start appreciating nature rather than being glued to the computer. They should embrace eco - friendly practices such as recycling and refrain from fretting about what is said on ""myspace"" or ""facebook"". Additionally, if we initiate recycling and focus on environmental conservation, @PERCENT3 of the earth will become greener. Lastly, there should be more quality family time instead of computer time. Computers cause individuals to drift apart from their family and friends as they are preoccupied with what is happening on the internet. @PERCENT4 of people should simply disconnect from the computer and relax with their family and friends. In conclusion, these are the reasons why people should reduce their computer usage, unwind with friends and family, exercise, and enjoy nature."
1583	1587	1	1	Dear editor, I contend that people are allocating an excessive amount of time to computer usage. Consequently, individuals are engaging in less physical exercise, spending insufficient time outdoors, and devoting less quality time to their family and friends. Exercise is an integral part of one's daily routine. I have a friend who exercises daily. She is the healthiest person I know and rarely spends any time on the computer. However, she knows someone who is her complete opposite. He scarcely exercises and spends @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. He has also been diagnosed with diabetes and is obese. These are the types of health issues that arise due to a lack of exercise and excessive computer time. Experts assert that people should engage in at least @NUM2 minutes of exercise every day. Nevertheless, as more and more people are engrossed in computer activities, achieving this is nearly impossible. Studies conducted at @ORGANIZATION1 indicate that @PERCENT1 of children under the age of @NUM3 are obese or at risk of becoming obese because they do not receive adequate exercise. You do not want that figure to increase, do you? There are other problems that people encounter as a result of excessive computer time. People are spending less time outdoors and more time seated at a desk indoors. My friend @PERSON1 spends an inordinate amount of time on her computer and insufficient time outside. She failed a science project because she was on her computer instead of being outside comparing leaves from different trees. Doctor @PERSON2, a child psychologist, asked children whether they would prefer to play outside or use a computer, and @PERCENT2 of them chose the computer. This demonstrates that computer users are not only young but also have a greater inclination towards computer use than outdoor activities. In my opinion, this proportion is too high. Lastly, there is the issue of people not spending enough face - to - face time with their family and friends. By this, I mean actual in - person interaction, not just video chatting on Facebook. This has led to tension in relationships. My friend @PERSON3 skipped her family reunion to stay at home on the computer, and at the subsequent family gathering, she was ostracized for not attending the reunion. The high @ORGANIZATION1 guidance counselor @PERSON4 states that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are undermined because children do not spend enough face - to - face time with their friends and are overly focused on the computer. These are all valid reasons why reducing computer time and increasing time spent on exercise, outdoor activities, and with family and friends will enhance one's quality of life.
1584	1588	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of The Local Newspaper: As @CAPS2 students are advanced to higher grade levels, more teachers will demand research papers. In my view, @CAPS10 advancements in technology assist me in completing my research paper to the best of its potential. What could bring greater joy to students and parents than seeing @CAPS3's on their child's paper? Technological advancements are the answer. There should be progress in technology as it enhances hand - eye coordination, enables people to learn about distant places and individuals, and facilitates online communication. To begin with, there should be technological advancements because it hones hand - eye coordination. In a recent poll featured in TIME magazine, it was revealed that @PERCENT1 of computer users experienced a significant improvement in their coordination; they were no longer @CAPS2 clumsy and uncoordinated. @PERSON1, a professional tennis player, remarked that, ""Before I started using a computer, I pursued a career in tennis, but it was a poor choice as I was poorly coordinated. I constantly missed the tennis ball during matches. So I decided to quit. Then, as I started using the computer more, my coordination improved. Now, I rarely miss any tennis balls."" Evidently, @CAPS10 technological advancements will enhance and teach hand - eye coordination. Another reason for technological progress is that it empowers people to learn about far - flung places and their inhabitants. @PERSON2, a writer from @ORGANIZATION1, stated that, ""People often conduct research on a destination before embarking on a vacation or a business trip as they wish to gain more knowledge about it."" It is patently unreasonable not to know anything about your vacation destination, just as it is to be unaware of what's for dinner. Recent studies suggest that the more one knows about their vacation destination, the more enjoyable the trip is. Consequently, this leads to more vacations, which is profitable for airline companies. Additionally, understanding the diverse cultures of people in distant locations provides individuals with a broader perspective of the world. Thus, @CAPS10 technological advancements will offer the ability to learn about far - away places and people. Furthermore, @CAPS10 technological advancements will enable people to communicate online with others. @PERSON3, the creator of @CAPS9, declared that, ""@CAPS10 online chat programs will facilitate communication between people. @CAPS9 has been beneficial to everyone. For instance, it helps people reconnect with former friends. It is also highly advantageous for students as they can log onto @CAPS9 to inquire about a forgotten homework assignment from a classmate."" A recent article on @ORGANIZATION2 indicated that online chat programs have improved people's communication. Clearly, @CAPS10 technological advancements will allow people to converse online with others. In conclusion, @CAPS10 technological advancements will improve hand - eye coordination, educate people about far - away places and individuals, and enable online communication. When voting on this matter, I urge you to support technological advancements as they will be beneficial to all. Thank you for your time."
1585	1589	1	1	Dear editors of the @ORGANIZATION1, every morning, my sister rouses me to go to school using her cell phone's alarm function. A few years ago, my mother would enter my room to wake me up. Now, we possess a single, portable device that accompanies us and serves multiple purposes. Nowadays, most people own cell phones, which offer far more than just the ability to communicate from different locations. We can now play games and access the internet. These technological advancements are fostering selfishness, and I, for one, do not endorse this trend. Firstly, all these newly improved gadgets are time - consuming. Given the plethora of activities in the world, we could all engage in something useful, enjoyable, or productive. Do you not concur? Consider the fact that if we were to hit the gym or study for school tests and quizzes, most teenagers would be in better physical and mental condition. @PERSON1, my aunt and a former physicist, remarked that the escalating rate of obesity among students and children, @CAPS3 attributable to these new phone and iPod - related concepts, is truly appalling. The more time we devote to using these devices, the more we resist the idea of being active. It is evident that we are becoming less energetic and more negligent of our time. Moreover, the advancements in contemporary society are encroaching on the boundaries of internet safety. Although people may claim to be able to block others, sometimes when someone posts content on the web, they do not conceal it adequately. There is a risk that someone could blackmail one of your friends into committing a crime. This happened to one of my cousins @CAPS3 last year. The police took a long time to locate her after she was kidnapped because the kidnapper concealed the evidence through a series of blackmails. Can you see how crucial it is to reduce our time spent on these devices? They draw us into a virtual world that can sometimes be 'bloody' or 'war - like'. My brother learned swear words from the new and advanced game of @CAPS5, a fighting game (@CAPS6!). I implore your organization to make the right decision and advocate for measures that will motivate us to become more active. I hope you will heed my advice, and I thank you for your extremely valuable time and effort.
1586	1590	1	1	Dear Local @CAPS1: I am seated on the couch, contemplating what I ought to do during my vacation. I am certain that I desire to embark on a journey somewhere to engage in some creative writing; however, my notebooks are all dispersed, I am unsure how to promptly contact someone who could offer assistance, and I have no inkling about the country I plan to visit. I cast a final glance at my notebooks strewn about the closet, which resembles a scene where a tornado has swept through, and I discover a solution on the highest shelf – my laptop. First and foremost, I wholeheartedly concur with those who opine that computers are invaluable. The three impacts they have on regular users are remarkable. Compare an individual with a laptop to one without. The person with a laptop @MONTH1 might be a busy professional and need to communicate with numerous individuals from afar, so they utilize e - mail and @ORGANIZATION1. They can interact with people from various locations at their convenience. Conversely, a person without a laptop could be occupied with traveling from one place to another merely to meet these individuals. Their schedule could be in disarray. Conversations via a chat system are expeditious and efficacious. Take my experience as an example. My mother abhors wastefulness, so instead of my driving to visit a friend, we @CAPS2. This saves both money and time! Additionally, I happen to be a writer who composes frequently on a daily basis in numerous notebooks. Over the years, I have written so extensively that my notebooks are amassing all over my room. What organizational tool could aid me in this situation? Why, a laptop, of course! One laptop or computer can store a multitude of documents and makes editing a cinch. Any person dealing with data and writing would be foolish not to possess a computer! Would you prefer a room filled with notebooks that you purchase at a cost, or a single computer with ample space and backup capabilities? You tell me. Computers prompt users to be more organized! Moreover, computers are a repository for millions of pages of information. They are akin to libraries. But envision a library and then picture a computer. In one, you have to traverse around to locate your information, while with the other, knowledge is merely a click away. Some @MONTH1 contend that computer websites are not entirely trustworthy; I beg to differ. There are specific websites on computers with suffixes such as ‘.org’, ‘.gov’, and even ‘.edu’. These websites contain verified factual information and numerous excellent resources for research. By utilizing computers, I have acquired greater knowledge and have found them advantageous. They have effectively enhanced my intelligence as an individual. In conclusion, it is my firm belief that those who use computers reap nothing but positive effects, and these encompass money/gas - saving conversations through @CAPS2 and email organization, as well as increased intelligence from reading. I have decided to undertake my creative writing on my laptop and, in doing so, have weathered the storm.
1587	1591	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I have become aware that @CAPS1 has requested people to share their perspectives on the effects computers have on individuals. In my view, computers do not exert a favorable influence. The rationale behind my stance is that children are engrossed in using the computer instead of completing their homework. People do not engage in as much physical exercise because they are constantly on the computer, and they do not allocate sufficient time to spend with their family and friends. There are numerous children who spend the entire night on the computer and never manage to start their homework. I perused an article that stated, “Computers are the primary culprit for children neglecting their homework.” People become so thoroughly distracted by the computer that they never end up accomplishing anything else. Eight out of ten children assert that they sometimes fail to do their homework because they are distracted by the computer. I interviewed a student in the @NUM1 grade, and she said, “@CAPS3 class generally completes all homework, but occasionally we forget when we are on the computer. That is truly the sole reason we do not do @CAPS1.” Evidently, computers are not a very beneficial electronic device if children are unable to finish their homework due to them. However, this is not the only drawback. Since people are perpetually on computers, they do not venture outside and exercise as frequently. Instead, they sit and play games on the computer. I found this quote in an article I was reading: “@CAPS5 since I began spending a substantial amount of time on the computer, I have gained weight because I am not engaging in outdoor exercise.” Exercising and going outside are extremely crucial activities, but people cannot partake in them if they are constantly glued to the computer. Nine out of ten people claim that @CAPS5 since they started using the computer extensively, they have not gone outside or exercised for some time. I interviewed a woman, and she said, “I had to refrain from using the computer for a while because I realized that @CAPS1 was detrimental to me and I needed to exercise.” People become so distracted by computers that they no longer go outside to exercise. There are still other reasons why computers are not very advantageous. Spending time with one’s family and friends is a highly significant endeavor, but with the prevalence of computers, people do not engage in it as much anymore. In a magazine, I read that @CAPS1 stated, “People are not spending time with their friends and family because they are engaged in instant messaging on the computer.” Computers are preventing people from spending quality time together. Nine out of ten families acknowledge that they have realized they do not spend as much time together because of computers. I interviewed some children, and they said, “I do not spend much time with my family or friends. I am mostly on the computer instant messaging.” Undoubtedly, computers are not a positive influence on families. These are the reasons why I believe computers do not have a beneficial effect on people. Children are on the computer and neglect their homework, people do not exercise as much, and they do not spend sufficient time with their family and friends.
1588	1592	1	1	Computers are truly remarkable. Are you aware that the website is @NUM1.com? We need to allocate time to optimize its performance. I am quite fond of computers. We need to @NUM2 develop environmentally - friendly computers.
1589	1593	1	1	As the global population increasingly embraces computer usage, I firmly believe that it has an extremely positive impact on individuals. Computers are not merely for entertainment; they also contribute to other aspects. For example, some of the remarkable functions of computers are: they cultivate hand - eye coordination, they offer people worldwide an opportunity to learn about distant places, people, and cultures, and last but not least, they provide an additional means for people to communicate online with their friends. Now, allow me to elaborate further on the positive influence computers have on the millions of users. The modern computer is an invaluable asset to have at home. It is not solely for idling and playing video games; it is also highly beneficial in the education of young children, teenagers, parents, and even grandparents. When one uses a computer, there is an abundance of knowledge to be acquired. For instance, suppose you have a query in your social studies or history class regarding a particular country, and you know nothing about it. What should you do? You should log on to your computer, find a reliable website, and suddenly, you are learning facts about @LOCATION1 that you would never have known without accessing the computer. The computer is also an excellent tool for practicing and improving hand - eye coordination. First, you need to familiarize yourself with the layout of the keys and their positions on the keyboard. After acquiring that skill, you should attempt to look at the computer screen rather than constantly staring at your fingers on the keys. Not only does this fail to enhance your hand - eye coordination, but it also causes you to type significantly slower than if you were looking at the screen. The computer is truly astonishing. Are you one of those individuals whose parents do not allow you to have a phone due to the high cost, even without considering the cost of texting? Well, if so, the computer can assist you in resolving that issue! There are numerous ways to communicate with your friends and family on the computer. For example, you can use @CAPS1 to instant - message your friends or Facebook to learn more about someone. The computer is incredibly useful! So, let's summarize what we have learned! The computer aids people in learning about different places around the world, improves hand - eye coordination, and enables you to communicate with your friends. I believe that a computer is a necessity in every household.
1590	1594	1	1	Dear @CAPS1: Many individuals assert that computers can have a negative impact on people. However, I firmly disagree, as computers render our lives significantly more convenient. We can communicate with those we have not seen for a while, we can explore and learn about places we previously thought were beyond our reach, and instead of painstakingly handwriting a book, we can type it. I believe these are compelling reasons indicating that computers do not have a negative influence. Imagine you are on Facebook and you type in the name of your best friend from high school. Suddenly, they appear, and you are reconnected. The next day, they are delighted that you are back in touch. This kind of reconnection happens every day, not only on Facebook but across the entire internet. Reconnecting with friends and family, communicating with your boss next door, or even sending a picture of your newborn baby to your mother living in @CAPS2 are all made possible by computers. Computers truly enable us to re - establish connections with those we have lost touch with. Another crucial aspect is the ability to learn about other cultures. Without computers, if we knew nothing about other cultures, life would be rather limited. With computers, we can instantly acquire knowledge about other places. All we have to do is type in the name of the place and select the information we wish to explore. In the past, people had to write everything out, word by word and letter by letter. This is no longer the case with computers. So, do not fret about that @NUM1 - page paper; you can simply type it, and with the help of some software, you can even have your paper edited on the spot. This is beneficial not only for schoolchildren but also for adults. That business proposal can be completed swiftly and effortlessly with the aid of computers. Many people claim that computers can have a negative impact on people. However, with the advancement of technology, tasks become easier, and this allows us to allocate more time to other important matters. There is no negative impact of computers; their influence is purely beneficial.
1591	1595	1	1	Dear local newspaper, my perspective on the impacts computers have on individuals is that they facilitate a more convenient daily existence. Initially, one can engage in conversations with individuals from remote locations. Moreover, they simplify the completion of homework and the acquisition of information. Lastly, when one has no other tasks at hand, they can indulge in online games and videos. One of the most advantageous aspects of computers is the ability to connect with friends online. Even if they are situated across the country, communication can occur at no cost! Additionally, if direct contact is unfeasible, one can send an email, and the recipient will receive the message upon logging in. Most importantly, when one forgets to record their homework, they can access the internet and inquire with a friend. Apart from social interaction, computers also serve as a platform for homework completion. All that is required is the creation of a word document and typing using the keyboard. Undoubtedly, this is a preferable alternative to writing with a pencil. Additionally, typing a paper results in a neater presentation. Furthermore, when conducting research for a report, a simple internet search will yield an abundance of information. Finally, computers offer a diverse range of games. Whenever one experiences boredom, they can simply power on the computer and play their preferred game. Not only is this a source of entertainment, but it also enhances hand - eye coordination. Some individuals claim that they lack the financial means to purchase games; however, they are unaware of the multitude of free online games suitable for all ages. This is particularly beneficial on uneventful days. In summary, computers contribute to a more convenient daily life. They enable long - distance communication and simplify homework. Moreover, they provide entertainment during leisure time. I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people due to their numerous offerings and assistance. Thank you.
1592	1596	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I concur that computers have exerted a positive influence on individuals. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, offer the opportunity to explore distant locales and individuals, and enable online communication. It is imperative that more individuals recognize the positive impact of computers. Engaging with a computer is an effective method for enhancing hand - eye coordination and typing proficiency. Typing is an essential skill required for the majority of occupations. Educational institutions throughout the academic journey emphasize typing instruction. Hand - eye coordination is also integral to computer usage. One must maintain visual focus on the screen while coordinating arm and hand movements to operate the keyboard. Computers are invaluable in numerous respects. Have you ever contemplated the appearance of a particular place or the elements it harbors? With a computer, such inquiries can be readily addressed. Computers empower individuals to gain insights into remote locations and their inhabitants. One can access images of significant cities and acquire knowledge about the local populace. While similar information can be obtained through social studies textbooks, online research is notably more efficient. Computers conserve time and streamline daily life. With continuous technological advancements, computers provide the opportunity to communicate with individuals globally or locally. This requires a webcam, which is available at computer stores or pre - installed on certain devices. Online communication is a remarkable innovation. It offers a rapid means of learning about others, particularly those from different countries. It is akin to having a pen - pal, with the added convenience of digital interaction. Some individuals assert that computers have a detrimental impact on people, citing excessive usage and reduced physical activity, as well as diminished social interaction with family and friends. However, these concerns can be mitigated through effective time management. By limiting computer usage, one can ensure that computers are recognized as a positive influence and a remarkable invention. I express my gratitude to all readers for their time and sincerely hope for your support of my viewpoints.
1593	1597	1	1	North @CAPS1 courier, I wish to share my views on computer usage. As an advocate for technological progress, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals. They offer several benefits, including the enhancement of hand - eye coordination, the provision of an alternative source of knowledge, and the facilitation of communication. Hand - eye coordination is a highly valuable skill in our society, especially in a country like the @LOCATION2, where sports play a significant role. Utilizing computers can effectively train and develop this skill, which is beneficial for sports such as baseball and basketball. By improving hand - eye coordination through computer use, the @LOCATION2 has the potential to produce world - class athletes. Additionally, in a country with a high volume of drivers and vehicles, enhancing hand - eye coordination can contribute to a reduction in traffic accidents and fatalities. So, how do computers aid in this regard? Through engaging gaming platforms like luniosity.com, which features games designed to train the brain. These games enhance hand - eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem - solving abilities. The cute and enjoyable nature of these games makes learning both fun and effective. Evidently, the @LOCATION2 stands to benefit significantly from improved hand - eye coordination, which can be achieved through computer usage. Computers also serve as an invaluable resource for acquiring knowledge about diverse cultures, places, and people. In addition to traditional books, the internet provides access to a vast amount of information. By using search engines like Google or Yahoo, individuals can explore topics of interest and discover new knowledge. This is particularly beneficial for students who can use the internet to gather information for reports. The internet offers a wealth of learning opportunities, from understanding scientific concepts to exploring historical events. Communication is another crucial aspect of daily life. While most individuals have access to phones, computers provide an alternative means of communication. Through instant messaging, email, social media platforms like Twitter and MySpace, individuals can connect with others regardless of their location. This not only facilitates social interaction but also enables the exchange of ideas and information. In conclusion, I reiterate my support for technology and the positive impact of computers. They enhance hand - eye coordination, provide a rich source of knowledge, and facilitate communication. Computers are indeed a valuable asset to society.
1594	1598	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I contend that the influence of computers on people is predominantly negative and should be curbed. While it is acknowledged that computers offer certain advantages, the excessive usage by many individuals, the susceptibility to viruses, and the neglect of alternative activities are cause for concern. I aim to convince you of the adverse effects of computer use. According to @ORGANIZATION1, over @NUM1 billion individuals worldwide utilize computers. A significant issue is the over - reliance on computers, particularly among teenagers. @PERSON1 reports that approximately @PERCENT1 of teens spend the majority of their time on computers. Platforms such as Facebook, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 are popular among this demographic. I can attest to this, as I joined Facebook at the suggestion of a friend. Subsequently, I discovered that more than half of my classmates were also users. In my opinion, computers, especially global platforms like Facebook, can be addictive. The widespread use of computers must be addressed. Moreover, computers are prone to viruses. @CAPS3.com indicates that the average adult encounters approximately @NUM2 to @NUM3 viruses annually. My friend @PERSON2 experienced a virus while working on a report, resulting in the loss of all his data. Approximately @PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down, and rebooting can be challenging. Although antivirus software such as McAfee and @CAPS5 are available, they may not always detect viruses. @PERCENT3 of users report that even when a virus is detected, the computer may freeze, making virus removal impossible. Viruses must be eliminated to ensure proper computer functionality. This is another compelling reason to recognize the negative impact of computers. Additionally, many individuals perceive the computer as an all - encompassing solution. However, there are numerous alternative activities available. @CAPS6 reports that individuals aged between @NUM5 and @NUM6 spend over @NUM7 hours on computers. Instead of excessive computer use, individuals can engage in activities such as socializing with friends, participating in sports, reading, or spending time with family. Approximately @PERCENT4 of teens who spend excessive time on computers are at a disadvantage when applying to colleges. In conclusion, computers can have a detrimental influence due to virus susceptibility, excessive usage, and the neglect of other activities. I sincerely hope that you will consider my perspective and respond at your earliest convenience.
1595	1599	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers are not indispensable. Some assert that computers aid in learning, yet books serve the same purpose. Others claim that computers enhance hand - eye coordination, but activities such as playing catch are equally effective. When it comes to learning about distant places, visiting them in person is far more enriching than relying on online information. If presented with a choice between computers and books, I wholeheartedly support the latter. Reading a physical book is a fulfilling experience. In contrast, reading on a computer lacks the tactile pleasure of turning the pages of a well - crafted paperback or hardcover. The knowledge gained from a real book is immeasurable. Typing on a computer, with its repetitive clicking sounds, is not a natural form of learning. True hand - eye coordination can be developed through outdoor activities such as playing catch. It is a fun and engaging way to enhance this skill. When planning a vacation, instead of researching online, one should simply visit the destination. For instance, by flipping a coin to choose between @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1, and if @LOCATION3 is selected, one should forgo online research and embark on a real - life adventure. In summary, while computers may have their merits, they do not align with my preferences. I encourage you to step away from the computer and engage in activities such as reading a book or playing catch. Consider taking a trip to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, or @LOCATION3. Undoubtedly, these experiences will be far more rewarding than spending time on a computer.
1596	1600	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, regularly perusing your paper and staying abreast of local events, I managed to obtain information regarding a controversy concerning the effects of computers. In my view, the computer has emerged as one of the most remarkable inventions in history. It has significantly transformed our society, and in my estimation, in an extremely positive manner. My initial rationale pertains to the vast knowledge the computer encompasses. You can virtually uncover anything instantaneously, in contrast to using a book or visiting a library, which is highly time - consuming. Not only does a computer require far less time to acquire information, but it also stores a substantially larger volume of data than a library can hold. Computers possess knowledge on nearly everything imaginable, and most importantly, it is readily accessible at your fingertips. Another outstanding attribute of the computer is its capacity to enable individuals separated by @NUM1 miles to converse freely. This might well be the most remarkable aspect of the computer. Online chatting completely eliminates the inconvenience of @CAPS4 phone bills and the need to carry around cell phones. You can communicate with friends halfway across the globe at no cost to you, which is truly astonishing! The only drawback of the computer is its overuse by children. Although this is a significant issue, it is not the computer's fault. Children should be aware of their limits. There should be @ORGANIZATION1 regulations for both computer usage and for engaging in exercise and having fun with friends. This problem has likely influenced many to develop a dislike for the computer, but you must recognize that the amount of time children spend on the computer is entirely up to them or their parents. In conclusion, I hope I have sufficiently persuaded you to concur with my perspective and to give the computer a chance. I am certain you will be satisfied.
1597	1601	1	1	Dear editor, computers exert a beneficial influence on humans. This is because one can interact with known friends and family, computers can be portable, allowing one to venture outdoors, and people can conduct research on vacation destinations. These factors illustrate how computers have a positive impact on humans. To commence with, face - to - face interaction is not the sole means of communication; there are numerous alternatives on the computer. Chat rooms facilitate text - based communication. Consider my friend @PERSON5; he formerly resided in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until business obligations arose. His job transferred him all the way to @LOCATION1. Fortunately, he had a computer; otherwise, he would not have been able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only individual who has been relocated far from home. In fact, @PERSON4 indicated that @PERCENT1 of computer owners tend to communicate with friends and family more frequently as they can do so whenever necessary. Gene, a psychiatrist, posits that when a family member has to travel for business, the family will start relying on a computer for communication. Do you wish to lose a friend or family member? Moreover, computers can be portable. If a computer is portable, one can enjoy nature while still using it to complete tasks. Take my cousin @PERSON2, a teacher who always has to grade his students' papers on weekends. He was disheartened as he could never go outside. For his birthday, he received a portable computer, which enabled him to go outdoors, breathe fresh air, and enjoy nature while performing his work. @PERSON2 is one of many fortunate individuals to experience this. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers purchase portable computers to enjoy nature and fresh air while working. @PERSON1 has proven that if teachers do not get fresh air while working, they may make significant mistakes or even fall ill. As a teacher, would you prefer to get sick without fresh air or be healthy while working outdoors? Lastly, there is more to computers than work and communication. One can research vacation spots. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamt of going on vacation but could not find information on fun, outdoor locations. Until she obtained a computer, she was unable to do so. With the computer, she found an exciting place and traveled abroad for a week. @PERSON3 is not the only person to have had this experience. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 reveals that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vacation because they lack knowledge about the destination.
1598	1602	1	1	To the local newspaper, I contend that the use of computers does not have a negative impact on people. I believe it offers distinct advantages. Given the technological advancements, it would be unwise not to utilize them. Computers provide individuals with the opportunity to chat and make friends. Nowadays, people even watch shows on computer - based websites such as @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 allows users to search for and watch any content on @CAPS1. People create emails, download music, and engage in various other activities. Children as young as @NUM1, @NUM2, and even @NUM3 frequently use computers to play games. I have a cousin who is @NUM3 and plays games on the computer constantly. He even knows how to search for information on it. Some individuals may think that computers have a negative effect, but in reality, they do not. Those people need to face the facts. We must progress with the times. Suppose a girl's parents believe that computers and technology corrupt children, so she does not own one. When she goes to school and her friends ask for her email, she constantly makes excuses to avoid the topic. However, she cannot keep making excuses indefinitely. Imagine one day her friends discover she has no computer and embarrass her in front of everyone. This is why we need to embrace the surrounding technology. Computers also save time. You can type instead of writing longhand. You can format your writing in cursive or any other style you prefer. After reading my letter, I hope you understand my point. The next time you encounter someone who thinks computers have a negative impact, inform them of the advantages and how computers benefit society.
1599	1603	1	1	Although numerous individuals relish spending time on computers, playing video games and engaging in cyber - chats, most are unaware of the potential harm. Despite my own enjoyable experiences on the computer, I am cognizant of its drawbacks. Here is a brief illustration. Prolonged computer use can lead to overheating, which may cause the computer to malfunction. Another issue is the side - effects. Staring at the screen for an extended period can result in headaches, which may worsen over time. You may even develop poor vision due to computer use. Computers can also be addictive. Owing to computer addiction, you may become more distant from your family and friends, leading to a severely limited social life. Additionally, addiction can infiltrate your daily routines, compelling you to use the computer daily and more frequently than the average person. Your personality may also change along with your social life and routine. Lastly, computers can be extremely perilous. If your child accesses a computer, they may accidentally link to inappropriate or malicious websites. They will then be exposed to the negative aspects of the computer. On a computer, your child is likely to encounter offensive content, from vulgar language to pornographic material. These are all elements that should not be accessible on a computer. In my opinion, the addictive, problem - causing, and dangerous nature of computers should be addressed. Now, you must consider what actions we should take regarding computers.
1600	1604	1	1	Although many people love to be on computer palying video games and have cyber chats, most of them don't know how bad a computer can be even though I experience a great time on the computer, I know how bad it is. Here is a short example. You can experience problems with your computer, if you stay on the computer for to long it can over heat and that can cause it to stop working. Another problem is side effects. you can get headaches from just staring at the screen for to long. Those headaches over time can become even worst. You @MONTH1 even get poor vision from a computer. Computers can also be addicting. Because of your addictition with computers you @MONTH1 become less close with family or friends, causing your social life to be very minimal. Also, because of the addiction, it @MONTH1 work its way to your daily routines causing you to have to play it daily and more thatn the average person does. Your personality @MONTH1 also change with your social life and routine. Lastly, computers can be very dangerous. if your child gets on to one he @MONTH1 accidentlly link heimself to a dirty or bad websites. He then to the negatives of a computer. On a computere your child will probally be shown things like words to pornographic features. These are all things that should not be allowed to access on a computer. Computers are addicting, they cause problems and are dangerous wrong in my opinion should be stopped. Now you think we should do about computers.
1601	1605	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I contend that the impacts of computers are beneficial. Several reasons underlie this view. Firstly, computers serve as a vast reservoir of knowledge. For instance, if one wishes to prepare a @CAPS1 meal, an ordinary @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 may not suffice; instead, one would need to search for the recipe on the internet. Moreover, when planning a car journey to @LOCATION1 without a map, the computer can provide detailed directions that can be printed out. Without a map or a computer, traveling to @LOCATION1 would be arduous. Secondly, computers facilitate communication with friends and family whom one has not seen in a while. For example, if your sister graduates from college and you are @NUM1 feet in the air on an airplane, with only a laptop and luggage at hand, you can easily send her an email to offer congratulations. These are but a few reasons why I believe computers have a positive impact, and I hope the local newspaper concurs.
1602	1606	1	1	"Do you aspire for your child to achieve success in life? This is precisely why computers hold great value in daily life. Computers empower children to acquire a more comprehensive education. They can become self - reliant, learning to use a computer without depending on others' guidance. Once they reach college, they can take notes expeditiously, ensuring they do not fall behind. Computers are crucial as they enable children to receive the appropriate education they require. @PERCENT1 of children who utilize the internet for study purposes are likely to be a grade ahead of their classmates. Dr. @PERSON1, a computer expert, states, ""@CAPS1 When I employed the computer for research on a topic, I accessed information on @DATE1, and from there, I advanced by @NUM1 @DATE1 due to my computer usage."" As evident, computers are valuable assets in daily life. They also help children become more independent and learn to navigate different parts of the internet. @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 of children who use the internet are more likely to succeed in college as they know which websites to visit and how to access them. There is an @PERCENT1 chance that children who succeed in college will secure higher - paying jobs. Dr. @PERSON1 remarks, ""@CAPS2 son was at @ORGANIZATION1; @CAPS3 was intelligent because @CAPS3 was constantly on the computer, exploring new facts and ideas."" @CAPS3 is a high - achieving student, which is not easily attained. Additionally, computers are useful as they allow users to find websites that promote healthy eating. @PERCENT3 of adults who consume healthy foods are likely to live an additional @NUM2 years as they maintain their bodies in good health by eating more fruits and drinking adequately to strengthen their bones as they age. Evidently, using the internet appropriately can be highly beneficial. This is why leveraging the internet can help one become the successful individual they desire to be in life."
1603	1607	1	1	"Dear [whomever this concerns], I firmly believe that people allocate an excessive amount of time to computers. Consequently, they engage in insufficient physical exercise. Instead of venturing outdoors to appreciate nature, individuals remain indoors throughout the day. Families and friends are spending less quality time together as they rely on computers for communication. Computers have emerged as a negative influence on contemporary society. Physical exercise is essential for human well - being as it maintains our health. Given the prevalence of fast - food establishments, people need exercise more than ever. When presented with the option of using a computer, individuals often forgo exercise. A statistic reveals that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS2's @CAPS3 each possess their own computer at home. A @NUM3 grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, stated, ""I would much rather be on the computer than outside."" Even students are reluctant to exercise when they could be using the computer. Human life is finite, and there is a beautiful natural world outside. However, we fail to appreciate our surroundings as we prefer the virtual world of the computer. For example, @PERSON1 would rather spend her day on the computer than enjoy the magnificent nature around us. Only @NUM4 out of @NUM2 students engage with nature weekly. A young girl of about @NUM6 did not appreciate nature until her parents made her stay outdoors for a month. Now, she adores nature because the computer became monotonous over time. Family and friends are integral parts of our lives, and we want them to be present at our significant events. Although the computer enables us to communicate with them at any time or share videos of our important moments, it would be far more rewarding for them to be physically present. When I was around @NUM1 [age], my grandparents used to attend my soccer games, but now they do not because my mom records the games for them. I much preferred it when they were at the games, cheering me on. ""[My] family and friends are the ones I want at [my] events, not just to watch them after they have occurred."" A common desire is for everyone to share their events with their families. Computers are not as advantageous as they seem. They prevent family and friends from being physically present, distance us from the beautiful natural world, limit our exercise, and can lead to weight gain, which is detrimental to our health. I earnestly urge you to reduce your computer usage, engage in exercise, visit your family, and enjoy nature."
1604	1608	1	1	"I opine that prolonged computer use can be detrimental as it may lead to arthritis in the fingers, vision impairment, and it is advisable to venture outdoors for fresh air. Sitting at the computer for extended periods is not advisable, primarily because it can cause arthritis in the fingers. There is also a condition known as carpal tunnel syndrome, which can render one unable to grasp objects effectively. My grandmother suffers from arthritis in her fingers, although it is due to frequent dish - washing rather than computer use. However, she often complains of finger pain when performing tasks. I believe that if she were to use a keyboard, it would exacerbate the damage and have long - term effects. My mom has always cautioned me that excessive time in front of a @CAPS1 could lead to blindness. A magazine article stated that ""@CAPS2 sitting in front of a @CAPS1 - computer for too long can cause partial blindness."" Whether one is using the computer for Facebook or other activities, excessive use can have the same blinding effect. It is beneficial to go outside occasionally to breathe fresh air or take a walk, as these activities help maintain physical fitness. If one becomes obese by merely sitting in front of the computer all day, it can be life - threatening. Regular exercise is essential for staying fit and healthy, rather than indulging in junk food and soda. Of course, it is acceptable to use the computer to research health - related activities. The point I am making is that while using the computer occasionally is fine, excessive sitting in front of it can be extremely unhealthy. One must maintain good health to survive, and spending all day in front of the computer will yield unfavorable results. These are the reasons why I believe sitting in front of the computer all day is harmful."
1605	1609	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, over the years, computers have become faster, smaller, and more intelligent. These technological advancements have propelled human progress. However, the consequences associated with this trend may not be entirely beneficial for the younger generation in the digital age. Some common impacts of computers on people, especially children, include discouraging outdoor play, reducing physical activity, stifling imagination, and wasting time. Every day, children across America use the same excuse, ""No mom, I'm not on Facebook; I'm working on my @CAPS4 report,"" when in fact, they may not have even started it or have been procrastinating online. Consider this: did this occur thirty years ago? No, our parents, who grew up in that era, were eager to go outside once their assignments were completed. They couldn't wait to hop on their bikes and play ball with friends. Nowadays, children are becoming less active and less inclined to play outdoors. Some attribute childhood obesity to genetics, but it is likely that computers are the real culprit, luring children away from physical activity. Since children are reluctant to leave their computers to go outside, they are using their imagination less and less. Parents recall how, in the past, after watching a single episode of their favorite show, neighborhood kids would spend the entire week taking on roles and acting out the story. However, this is rarely seen in today's generation. Instead of engaging in imaginative play with friends, children quickly move on to the Wii to play games like ""Smashing Balloons."" Computers consume a significant amount of time. The average child spends up to four hours on the computer aimlessly, squandering time that could be used for homework or other productive activities. This time is not being put to good use; it is often unproductive. While some claim that computers represent the current generation, does this mean that the current generation must be lazy, unimaginative, and indifferent to how they spend their time? Most people would say no. However, if you offer a nine - year - old the choice between playing on the computer and going outside, it would be naive to think they would choose the latter. People strive for progress, but can't we find a middle ground?"
1606	1610	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers hold significant importance for certain individuals. Virtually everyone has utilized or is currently using them. Owning a computer is not detrimental as one can still engage in exercise and carry out daily activities. For instance, when in need of information, the computer is often the go - to resource. People in educational institutions, industries, and households rely on it constantly. Teenagers typically turn to the computer to communicate with friends or play games, as I myself do. This is to prevent spending the day in boredom. While exercise and an active lifestyle are indeed crucial for teenagers to pursue, they do not abandon the computer. It remains readily available when they have completed their homework or finished playing with friends in the neighborhood. I cannot fathom my life after soccer practice and homework if the computer or @CAPS1 were not among the first places I rushed to for relaxation. Computers should be regarded as our allies. They pose no harm; instead, they provide us with what we require and desire. Research serves as a prime example, as everyone uses the computer to find whatever they are seeking. After research, they can have fun through games and interacting with friends. However, I believe the primary function of computers is to provide information. Whenever I return home from school, I complete my homework, stretch for cheerleading, then watch @CAPS1 or use the computer to avoid boredom. It is not that I am inactive due to lack of exercise; rather, I have nothing else to do, so I choose to occupy my time. Since everyone does this, I am not alone. Yes, computers are simply a square device with a keyboard, but if we do not exclude them from people's daily lives, we will realize that they are not as negative as some claim and will not corrupt people's minds. They are placed in offices, living rooms, or bedrooms because people appreciate them and use them to meet their needs.
1607	1611	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, When @CAPS5 need to compose a report or communicate with a business associate, friend, or family member, what alternative exists apart from @CAPS1? Computers, these technological marvels, facilitate all these functions, enhancing our daily lives. Regrettably, some individuals remain reluctant to acknowledge that computers have become an integral part of modern existence. Computers enable seamless communication, in - depth research on diverse topics, and offer a plethora of entertainment options. Communication is significantly streamlined by computers. Platforms such as ""@CAPS2"" and ""Facebook"" allow us to interact with one another effortlessly. Consider a scenario where @CAPS1 is away on a journey or resides thousands of miles apart; computers bridge the gap. In terms of research, @CAPS5 can access a vast amount of detailed information from numerous websites. Sceptics may question the necessity of using a computer instead of visiting a library. However, factors such as inclement weather or library closures may render the latter option unfeasible. Regardless of the reason, computers expedite and simplify the research process. Moreover, computers fulfill our need for entertainment. Gaming sites on platforms like ""Facebook"" have gained immense popularity, providing an emotional escape from the daily grind. Some may ask, ""Why not go outside?"" Yet, adverse weather conditions or illness may restrict outdoor activities. Computers are not only a source of amusement but also a valuable educational and communication tool. We should recognize their positive attributes and appreciate their role in our lives."
1608	1612	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers exert a positive influence on society due to their ability to offer extensive information, host a wide array of engaging games and music, and keep us informed about global and community - related issues. Firstly, computers are an invaluable source of information. When undertaking projects or conducting research, there is no better tool than a computer. One can search for information on various individuals, including the presidents of the @LOCATION1, celebrities, and those who have made significant contributions to the world. Additionally, it is possible to explore and study different plant and animal species and discover fascinating experiments. Secondly, computers are a hub of entertainment with numerous games and a vast music library. One can visit the @CAPS1 channel website and play a variety of games inspired by favorite TV shows. There are also educational games on test - prep platforms like ""Test Prep Fun,"" such as ""Comprehension Clinic,"" which aid in academic performance, particularly in @ORGANIZATION2 - related assessments. The computer also offers a rich selection of music. For example, one can listen to @ORGANIZATION1's album. One can sample music by @PERSON1 before purchasing it or preview tracks by @PERSON2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 before buying the @NUM1 songs. Finally, computers keep us informed about global issues. We can search for information on natural disasters such as the @CAPS8 earthquake, @CAPS9 earthquake, or the tsunami that struck @LOCATION2 in @MONTH1. We can also find information on @CAPS10 @PERSON3, our favorite artists, and community - specific issues. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on society as they provide information, entertainment, and awareness of important matters."
1609	1613	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers offer substantial benefits to our society. For example, they are extremely useful to everyone, enabling rapid dissemination of news and imparting new knowledge. While it is acknowledged that computers have their drawbacks, their advantages far outweigh them. Computers prove to be highly beneficial in multiple aspects. They assist individuals in locating missing family members and aid law enforcement officers in apprehending criminals. Have you ever lost touch with a family member or desired to reconnect after years of separation? Computers can facilitate such reunions. Similarly, have you been concerned about the presence of criminals on the streets and wished to see them behind bars but lacked an effective means? Computers provide the necessary assistance. Notice how computers support the police in safeguarding women in contemporary society. Moreover, computers expedite the flow of information. For instance, if you learn about a hurricane or tornado and need to gather details, all you need to do is access the computer. In the event of an earthquake in @LOCATION1 where official sources fail to provide sufficient information, the computer can be your source of comprehensive data. Computers offer a multitude of benefits. They enhance hand - eye coordination. Although you may not initially notice, while using the computer, you will gradually type more quickly and become familiar with the keyboard layout compared to when you first encountered a computer. Additionally, computers expose us to a world of wonder, such as @CAPS2 falls and rainforests. It is important to note that I am not disregarding the negative aspects of computers or denying that some individuals may misuse them. Nevertheless, their contributions to society are undeniable. They accelerate the spread of news and educate people. I encourage you to consider my perspective and reflect on the profound impact computers have had on your life.
1610	1614	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 I think that computers are beneficial to our society for example, computers are very helpful to everybody. Computers alsi travel nows faster. And they can teach us new things. I am not saying computers donít have their downs, but, computers also have their ups. Computers are very helpful in many ways. They help people find lost fmaily members, and they help police officers find many criminals. Haven't you lost soemone in your family, or haven't spoken to them in years and always wanted to find them and get back in with them? Well that's what computer are for. Aslo haven't you been concern about the many criminals on the street, and wanted to get them of the streets and in jail where they belong but didnt have a way to do that? Computers  help. Haven't you notice that computers are  help police many women in the present time? Computers  people in the , but they help travel fastre for example say you heard there was hurricane or tornado and you needed to find out how . All you have to do is on the computer and look it up. Also, there an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and the didn't information to help you. You would just go on the computer and find all the information you need. COmputers are of many things for they you. Computers teach you alot, like hand-eye cordiantion. Think about it, you might on hte computer that, but it helps. If you yourself while you are on the comp[puter you would start to see that you are typing fastre and learning where all the letters are on the keyboard now, then when you saw your first computer. Computers though, not only teaches you hand-eye cordination but it also teaches you of many wonder places. Such as @CAPS2 falls, rain forests etc. Now, dont get me wrong, @CAPS3 not saying that computer dont their downs and that people dont take advantage of computers. but, I am saying that they help society alot. They travel news fatser. Also they taught alot to people. So take my opinion into consideration. And think about how much computers have done for you.
1611	1615	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a member of @ORGANIZATION1 who posits that computers exert a positive influence on individuals, as they facilitate the enhancement of hand - eye coordination. Moreover, computers enable people to acquire knowledge about distant locales and individuals without leaving their residences. Additionally, computers empower people to communicate with one another via the @CAPS3. How would we cope without computers! My primary rationale for believing that computers are beneficial is their contribution to hand - eye coordination. According to @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION3 of the eye @CAPS4, when typing, one must monitor the keys being used, which allows the brain to establish a connection with the hand, thereby improving eye - hand coordination. It is a well - known fact that millions of individuals in @LOCATION1 are involved in car accidents annually, @PERCENT1 of which are attributable to the fact that vehicle drivers have to look down at the way to ensure that they keep their cars on the road, indicating a lack of eye - hand coordination. I contend that if every person in the world had access to a computer, there would be a reduction in the number of accidents each year. Secondly, computers can transport one's mind to a distant place or person. A study at @ORGANIZATION2 revealed that @PERCENT2 of the surveyed individuals can retrieve information on the @CAPS3 more rapidly than in a @CAPS7. It is also evident that children of any age can utilize a computer to obtain specific information within seconds. I have noticed that children are proficient in using the @CAPS3 but not a dictionary or encyclopedia. Furthermore, people can contact and converse with others through the @CAPS3, which enables one to reconnect with long - lost friends. One can communicate with them at any time. It is remarkable that one can contact someone halfway across the globe simply through the @CAPS3. How fascinating is that! Thank you for reading this letter and sharing it with your company. I firmly believe that you should support my cause, as computers enhance hand - eye coordination, connect people to other places and individuals, and allow for communication via the @CAPS3.
1612	1616	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have propelled our world so far into the future that virtually everything is merely a click away. Experts are astounded that over the years, computers have assisted billions of people in accomplishing tasks more efficiently and smoothly than ever before. Technology has enabled doctors to discover novel cures for patients and diagnose their ailments in a more sophisticated manner. Thousands of professions necessitate the boundless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to evolve and redefine our lifestyle. Moreover, children of all ages reap the benefits of modern computers. As technology becomes increasingly user - friendly, children have adapted to computers, which provide answers to all their queries. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are indispensable in daily assignments. Essays are now typed rather than handwritten, and projects are presented on flash drives instead of poster boards. These advancements have transformed our lives and made everything significantly easier. Additionally, computers bridge the gap between foreign lands and home by allowing one to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is more interconnected and unified. In addition to students, doctors also derive substantial benefits from computers. Technology has revolutionized the medical field dramatically through x - rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries, and medicines. Astonishingly, computers enable doctors and nurses to perceive patients from an entirely new perspective. Hospitals organize all records digitally to ensure that patients receive appropriate treatments. @PERSON1, the chief surgeon at @ORGANIZATION2, states, ""Without @CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be rendered useless. We would be unable to perform any tasks."" Although @PERSON1 is articulate, he makes a crucial point. Computers are the cornerstone of our medical world. Scientific studies have demonstrated that the internet has brought people closer together than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles can now email, chat, or even engage in video chats with distant relatives and friends. Email, in particular, has played a pivotal role in our society, facilitating communication for millions of people when necessary. In fact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to convey important business information. Without the aid of technology, our economy would deteriorate rapidly as communication between countries would cease to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I earnestly urge you to consider my perspective on the advantages of modern technology and reflect on the numerous individuals computers have assisted. Thanks to contemporary technology, our culture has become more extensive, superior, faster, and stronger. Knowing this, I vehemently recommend that you educate others about the benefits of technology and contribute to advancing our way of life."
1613	1617	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am of the opinion that the utilization of computers by people is beneficial to our society. This is because computers endow people with the ability to learn about remote places and individuals. They offer access to educational websites and even enable people to communicate online with others. Firstly, computers empower people to acquire knowledge about far - flung places and individuals. When I was in sixth grade, I had to undertake a project on @ORGANIZATION1, about whom I knew nothing. Fortunately, with the availability of computers, I was able to conduct research on @ORGANIZATION2 using a computer and gathered a wealth of information, which enabled me to achieve an A+ on the project. Similarly, when I was in fourth grade, I had to work on a project about @LOCATION1. I accessed a computer and visited @CAPS1.com, where I obtained a substantial amount of information and also received an A+. The second reason why computers are advantageous to society is that they host educational websites. Computer technologist @PERSON1 asserts, ""@CAPS2 percent of computer websites are educational."" I also recall that when I was in seventh grade, the entire class visited @CAPS3.com and was able to learn mathematics while having fun. Last but not least, computers allow people to interact with others from around the world. There is a website called myspace.com, which enables me and other individuals to communicate online globally. I surveyed my class, and ninety percent of them visit myspace.com. On the other hand, computers do have drawbacks. Some children access unauthorized websites that are not intended for minors. There is a website called @NUM1.com, which features shooting and killing games that are inappropriate for children. Additionally, some individuals are computer addicts who spend almost twenty - four hours a day on computers. Now that you are aware of my reasons for believing that computers are beneficial to society, namely, they enable people to learn about distant places and individuals, provide access to educational websites, and facilitate online communication with others, what is your stance on this matter?"
1614	1618	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I recently encountered a letter regarding the technology of computers and its impact on people's lives. In my view, the computer is an excellent medium for learning. It represents a novel approach to studying and engaging in other educational activities in an enjoyable manner. In my opinion, preparing for a test, quiz, or any academic assessment can often be tedious. I prefer to study in a way that is both engaging and memorable. The computer serves as an ideal tool for this purpose, as I have learned a great deal from it while at home. My parents believe that I spend an excessive amount of time on the computer, which is sometimes true. However, for half of the time, I am using it to study for tests. Now, I would like to discuss the mental aspect of learning. When one embarks on the learning process, it can be mentally taxing. Physically, there may be pressure or other distractions. Nevertheless, the computer offers diverse learning opportunities. One can simply log on to the internet and choose from a vast array of resources. Finally, I would like to mention the role of computers in facilitating communication with family and friends. Family and friends are of utmost importance, and websites such as @CAPS2, Facebook, and AIM allow us to stay connected. Isn't that remarkable? This is the beauty of computers and technology, as they enable us to accomplish numerous tasks using a single device. Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to express my opinion. I hope you will take my letter into consideration.
1615	1619	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 newspaper, I have overheard a debate regarding whether computers have a positive influence on people. I am writing to convey my perspective on this matter, and in my opinion, computers have highly beneficial effects on individuals. Not only do they impact people positively, but they also affect companies, places, and governments. There are numerous reasons why computers have a positive impact on people. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, they are an extraordinary learning tool. When people are online, they can acquire knowledge about almost anything on the vast repository of information known as the internet. Moreover, people can learn practical skills through simulators, ranging from flying a plane to driving a car. The learning potential on the internet is even more extensive, as many individuals are homeschooled via the internet. This can be a crucial component of their education, as they may be unable to attend traditional schools due to frequent travel or other reasons. Computers play a vital role in the advancement of people's education. In addition to education, computers are utilized as tools in various ways. For instance, when creating a movie and requiring special effects, one can use Photoshop. When collecting and storing dynamic information, such as financial data, a computer can be employed. Even construction workers can use computers to create blueprints with pinpoint accuracy. Another significant aspect of computers is that they provide entertainment for many people. When one returns home feeling bored and has nothing to do, they can play a video game or browse the internet. Computers are also an important means of accessing music and videos. This has a significant impact on many businesses, as if businesses fail due to a lack of customer activity, numerous jobs will be lost, which is the last thing we need. Governments also rely heavily on the internet. They use it to formulate plans, save soldiers, and communicate with other countries. Last but not least, the fitness and well - being of computer users are a matter of personal choice. If they wish to limit their computer usage, they can do so. In conclusion, computers have far - reaching positive effects on people, companies, and governments, and their importance in our lives cannot be overstated.
1616	1620	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, the query that everyone is posing is whether computers confer benefits upon society. I contend that they do not, as engaging in physical exercise becomes unattainable if one is constantly ensconced in computer usage, and it also becomes arduous to relish the beauty of nature. Another rationale for computers not benefiting society is the lack of interaction with friends and family. Hopefully, I have inspired you to curtail computer usage and partake in enjoyable activities with your family. If you are perpetually glued to the computer, how will you manage to exercise? It has been substantiated that over half of the United States is overweight. Exercising holds greater significance than using the computer, and knowing that you could engage in a more beneficial activity, wouldn't you opt for it? Interacting with individuals is crucial as it enables you to meet new people. If you refrain from doing so, you might develop shyness and fail to make as many friends as you desire. It is true that you can forge new friendships online, but it is not equivalent to meeting them in person. Moreover, if you make an ""acquaintance"" online, you cannot ascertain whether they are a stalker or a murderer. I earnestly urge you to venture out and meet new people in the real world. Given that you are better off eschewing computer use and being in the company of those you cherish, wouldn't you choose to do so? Indeed, you can play games on the computer, but it would be more rewarding if you played them with your family. To address the question that everyone is asking, I firmly believe that computers do not confer any benefits upon society, and hopefully, I have persuaded you to share this view."
1617	1621	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, if you believe that the advancements in our technology are detrimental to our society, you must be misconstruing the situation. Computers exert a positive influence on the members of our community by endowing us with excellent hand - eye coordination and equipping us with the ability to seek and acquire information for learning. They also facilitate online communication among people. Hand - eye coordination is a vital skill that serves us daily. Since new technology, such as computers, can assist us in honing this skill, we ought to utilize it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 states, ""Computers significantly aid us; nearly @PERCENT1 of active computer users enhance their hand - eye coordination merely by using computers for a brief period each day."" Knowledge and education are indispensable, especially in the present era; the more you learn, the higher your salary is likely to be. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and acquire knowledge within a short span. My aunt obtained her @CAPS4 online approximately six months ago, and as a result, she received a promotion at her workplace. Gaining valuable knowledge online is not exclusive to adults but also applicable to children. When they have a report on @CAPS5 or require assistance with their homework, these new technologies are among the most efficient and rapid means of learning and obtaining information. @PERSON2, a doctor specializing in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings, mentioned in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""In this new millennium, preteens and teenagers are particularly fond of the new technological advancements, and if we wish for them to learn, we can leverage this tool and encourage its use."" Computers are also an excellent medium for communication; it is swift and effortless. I have an uncle residing in @LOCATION1, and due to the distance, we rarely get to meet. Hence, we keep in touch by messaging each other via social networks or emails. It is even cost - free, unlike the expensive long - distance calls. This form of communication is also advantageous for businesses. A company can reach out to its customers to reschedule appointments, issue receipts, advertise, and perform numerous other functions. Computers are indispensable and effective technology utilized by people across the country and the world. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to acquire knowledge and education, and provide opportunities for communication. This represents another remarkable and useful step for our global communities."
1618	1622	1	1	There are numerous reasons why computers are a boon to the world. They enable us to explore distant places without having to leave the comfort of our homes. Another significant reason for the importance of computers is the ability to communicate with family members without the need for travel, regardless of whether they reside in another country, state, or even next door. Additionally, they impart hand - eye coordination, a highly essential skill that can facilitate one's journey through life. The remarkable aspect of computers is that they allow us to gain knowledge about far - off locations without stepping out of our homes. People from various countries may be inquisitive about their origins. They may also wonder about the governance or economic status (such as stocks) of other countries. All of this information can be accessed more rapidly than by watching the news or the weather channel. Computers empower us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge. One of the most remarkable features of computers is their speed. You might wait ten or even twenty minutes for a stock update on the news channel. However, using the internet on your computer simplifies your life, and the quicker you can look up information, the more time you have to cook dinner or enjoy a refreshing walk outdoors, breathing in the crisp, cold air. Moreover, radios and television stations may lack accuracy. There could be a suicide bombing a minute later that you would like to know about, or the stock might fluctuate by a hundred points. This is all valuable information that people expect to be 100% accurate. Secondly, you can maintain contact with your family even if they live in a different country or state. With webcams, either attachable to some computers or built - in, you can communicate with them. Once, my grandma was in the hospital, and I was too young to visit. Thanks to webcam technology, I was able to see her on the screen, which, although not the same as in - person interaction, allowed me to check on her well - being. Webcams are also useful in discussions. For instance, if your friend says something that seems rude, and you can't tell if she is being sarcastic, you might get into an argument. With a webcam, you can communicate on the computer and discern her true intent. Technology may be one of the greatest inventions to have emerged and could potentially be the best one ever created. The last crucial aspect of computers is that they teach hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is an important skill that can be acquired. This skill is essential as it is necessary for success in life, such as writing. It is also vital for jobs involving computers, as you need to type and move your fingers quickly to succeed in well - paying positions. This skill also opens up a wide range of successful career opportunities. In the long run, computers are magnificent machines that make life easier and more enjoyable while facilitating knowledge acquisition. If you lack good hand - eye coordination, you should get a computer as it will be of great help. However, if you own a computer, you must update it regularly to prevent it from slowing down and crashing. In conclusion, computers are the best invention introduced to mankind so far. They enable you to stay informed about global news and the economy, keep in touch with family regardless of distance, and teach you the important skill of hand - eye coordination. Everyone in the world should have access to a computer to acquire the knowledge necessary for success in life.
1619	1623	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, many individuals these days are overly reliant on technology. Wherever you go, you typically encounter someone engrossed in their phone, texting, using a computer, or plugged into an iPod. These people are not necessarily bad, but they are under the sway of technology. Computers, for example, are perceived by most as fast, easy, and enjoyable, yet they also present problems. Although it may seem that everyone owns a computer, this is not the case. Moreover, people become excessively dependent on such machines and can develop an addiction to them. Computers may appear to function @PERCENT1 of the time, but they can also be highly unreliable. Off the top of your head, how many people do you know who use @CAPS4 or @CAPS5? I'm certain the number is substantial. Now, multiply that number by the number of people they know, and then multiply it again, and so on. That figure indicates that, in fact, over @NUM1 million people use these platforms. Now, what are the odds that if you send a message to a friend via one of these programs (with over @NUM1 million people using it), the server will be @PERCENT1 reliable and your friend will receive the information they need? My point is, what if an important situation arises that requires your friend's assistance, and you are unable to reach them due to a system fault? What would happen? You could be stuck at the hospital waiting for a ride home for an hour longer than necessary. Another issue is what if you urgently need to contact someone who specifically owns a computer? If they do have one, you could complete the task in @NUM3 minutes, but how else could you reach them? You could try calling, but what if they are outside playing with their dog? Nowadays, when you want to express gratitude, you often turn to Google and search for virtual thank - you cards. While the recipient may be happy to receive it, they would probably be even more delighted to receive a handmade, real thank - you card in the mail. My final reason for believing that computers harm us more than they help is addiction. As I mentioned in the first paragraph, wherever you go, you see people attached to electronic devices. People no longer venture outside to play games like cowboys and @CAPS7 because all they have to do is press ""play."" I admit that I also use my computer quite frequently, but at least I manage my time so that I can also go outside and have some fun. Obesity is also a consequence of excessive electronic device use, along with many other problems."
1620	1624	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION2, you may be aware that computers have been in existence since the @DATE1. Since then, they have significantly enhanced the lives of many. Computers are of great assistance to the elderly. When they need to pay a bill, they can simply log in, complete the payment, and move on. Additionally, if they need to write a letter but their handwriting has deteriorated, they can type it, print it, and be done, ensuring that the recipient can read it clearly. Computers are not a passing fad; they are here to stay. Doctor @PERSON2 of the @ORGANIZATION1 in @PERSON1 stated, ""The children I work with use computers daily to improve their hand - eye skills, and since then, their proficiency in this area has increased by @PERCENT1."" The corporate representative from @ORGANIZATION3 mentioned that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people agree that everyone should own a computer. I concur, as computers can assist with various tasks. Have you ever found yourself at home with nothing to do? Why not go out and purchase a computer? Computers can perform a multitude of functions. If you enjoy playing video games, you will adore these machines. There are numerous game systems available exclusively for computers, and there are also websites dedicated to gaming. I'm sure most of you enjoy games, so why not give it a try? A basic computer is not prohibitively expensive, so cost should not be a concern. Many college students currently own computers. They make research more efficient and accessible. Would you rather get dressed, drive to the library, search for a book, wait in line, and check it out, or simply log on to the computer and find what you need? The choice is yours. When college students experience stress, which is a common occurrence, they can play music from the computer to relax. Computers have positively transformed the world, and their influence continues to grow. You should purchase a computer today."
1621	1625	1	1	I believe that computer technology exerts a positive influence on individuals. I hold this view because it can instruct you in typing more rapidly, acquaint you with distant locales, and enable you to communicate with people online. Here are several reasons to support this. Firstly, the computer can teach you to type faster. For instance, proficient typing skills can enhance your prospects of securing a favorable job or career and pave the way for a promising future. Additionally, you can compose emails more expeditiously, eliminating the need for slow typing. Moreover, you can refine your typing abilities and become a more proficient typist. Secondly, you can acquire knowledge about far - off places. For example, you can learn about other countries, discerning their differences from and similarities to our own. You can also utilize the computer for projects, gathering all the necessary information to prepare for an outstanding endeavor. Furthermore, you can glean new knowledge daily from your computer, such as news and weather updates. Thirdly, the computer facilitates communication with others. You can converse with your friends and family to check on their well - being. When you are bored, you can engage in conversations with someone on the computer for amusement. You can also coordinate with your friends to hang out and enjoy the outdoors, ensuring you don't remain cooped up at home all day. That's why I assert that computer technology is a valuable asset as it can improve typing speed, expand knowledge of distant places, and enable online communication. I hope you concur with me and recognize the merits of computer technology in daily life.
1622	1626	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has made remarkable progress in technology. Computers and other devices have propelled us forward. However, the computer is a device that fails to confer benefits upon society. My rationale for this stance is that when one uses a computer, they are susceptible to cyberbullying. Another reason is that excessive computer use causes individuals to miss out on experiences such as spending time with family. Lastly, when typing on a computer, the spell - check function on @CAPS3 corrects spelling, punctuation, and grammar, preventing users from learning from their errors. These reasons substantiate my claim that computers have not truly benefited society. Firstly, the prevalence of cyberbullying is a significant drawback. For example, someone returns home and checks their email, only to receive threatening messages, leaving them frightened and unsure of what to do. Cyberbullying, enabled by computers, is the most effortless means of harassing someone. One can distress another person simply by typing a message, and all it takes is obtaining someone's email address. Moreover, cyberbullies can be either known or unknown individuals. Computers have contributed to an increase in criminal activities in society. Secondly, excessive computer use leads to a detachment from real life. The average person spends @PERCENT1 of their day checking email accounts and updating @CAPS4. People who devote such a substantial amount of time to the computer miss out on important events. My sister often interrupts conversations to ask questions because she is engrossed in following and updating @CAPS4 while @CAPS2 are conversing. Lastly, when writing an essay or any text, the spell - check feature prevents users from learning grammar and spelling. Most teenagers in @LOCATION1 do not use proper grammar or spelling when texting. They can write an essay in text language and rely on spell - check to select the intended words. This is unacceptable as students must master proper grammar and spelling. It reduces students' thinking abilities to a level barely above reading and clicking an answer. If computers did everything for us, @CAPS2 would quickly become passive and unthinking. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have not benefited society. They promote cyberbullying, hinder learning through spell - check, and cause people to miss out on real - life experiences. For these and other reasons, computer usage should be curbed.
1623	1627	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I contend that the use of computers has exerted a detrimental influence on modern society. When people communicate via text messages or emails, there is a lack of emotional resonance. One is effectively isolated as they cannot see the person on the other side of the screen; all they know is the username. It is virtually akin to wearing a disguise. Moreover, computers are not only harmful to one's health but also pose a threat to users. Would one truly wish to utilize something that is so detrimental to their health and privacy? Statistics indicate that @PERCENT1 of teenagers have access to and use the internet more than three times a week. Additionally, more than half of teenagers in the @CAPS2.S.A spend over @NUM1 hours on computers, with some spending as much as @NUM2 hours! This has evolved into a global addiction. My friend, who rarely used a computer and frequently played outdoors, changed after his sister introduced him to @CAPS3, @CAPS4, MySpace, @CAPS5, etc. He would spend hours on the computer, and over time, his outdoor activities diminished. I began to resent him for this change. Statistics also show that excessive computer use often leads to a decline in academic performance. People become overly engrossed in these machines, becoming anti - social, neglecting homework, potentially failing courses, and repeating grades. Computers are similar to television in that they may improve hand - eye coordination, but simultaneously, they erode cognitive abilities. I believe that computers are as ill - advised as pouring gasoline on pancakes.
1624	1628	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial to our society. They have a positive impact on individuals, imparting hand - eye coordination skills and knowledge about various places around the world. Additionally, they are excellent tools for online communication with family and friends. Computers enhance hand - eye coordination by familiarizing users with looking at a screen and typing to form words. For students like me who play the piano, computers are extremely useful. They help in developing the ability to read music while having fingers instinctively know where to play. The similarity between looking at a computer screen and sheet music enables computers to assist in piano playing. Thus, I believe that computers contribute to better hand - eye coordination in children and teenagers. Computers are also invaluable for researching information. For example, if a teacher assigns a two - page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, one cannot rely on memory alone. Instead of going to the library, which may not be feasible, a computer provides a convenient way to conduct research from home, even in one's pajamas. It offers the necessary information promptly. Similarly, when planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, the internet can provide numerous accommodation options. Another significant advantage of computers is communication. Through platforms like A.I.M., one can engage in conversations with friends and family. This year, my brother and cousin went to college, and I now see them only about twice a year. Thanks to computers, I can communicate with my brother as if he were at home. He shares pictures of his college life and the places he visits. Without computers, I would rarely have the opportunity to see or talk to him. I kindly request that the local newspaper consider my perspective. I am convinced that computers benefit society by leaving a positive impact on people both locally and globally. They teach excellent hand - eye coordination, assist in musical pursuits, facilitate academic research, and strengthen interpersonal relationships. Please take my opinion into account. Thank you.
1625	1629	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I am penning this letter to elucidate how society would derive substantial benefits from increased computer usage. Computers enable individuals to complete tasks more expeditiously than manual methods. They also facilitate social interaction and the formation of new friendships through chatting and web conferencing. Moreover, computers offer a wealth of entertainment options. These are the primary functions for which computers were designed: to assist with tasks and for personal use. How do computers aid in work? Suppose you are preparing for a business meeting and need to create a five - page report with pictures and graphs. Using a computer, you can type your work neatly and professionally. You can easily source images from the internet and insert them into your report. Graph - making software allows you to input collected data, and the computer will generate the graphs automatically. In contrast, if you were to do this manually, you would have to write extremely neatly, source pictures from newspapers or draw them yourself, and painstakingly create the graphs without errors. This makes a simple task significantly more challenging. What about communication? With a computer, you can effortlessly communicate with a friend. Instead of writing a letter or making a phone call, you can engage in text - based chats or even have video conversations. You can communicate with friends regardless of your or their location if you have a laptop. The ability to see and talk to someone at your convenience without leaving home is a significant advantage, and it comes at no cost. If you have a friend or relative living far away, you can easily conduct a video conference. Regarding entertainment, computers are an invaluable resource. You can have fun by playing games or watching videos. Games can be downloaded at a low cost and played either alone or with friends online. Videos can be watched without interruptions from ads, and you can pause them at will. This is highly efficient and convenient for the average person. In conclusion, I firmly believe that people would reap numerous benefits from using computers. They streamline work processes, enhance social interaction, and provide entertainment. Technology was developed to simplify our lives, and we should take full advantage of it.
1626	1630	1	1	"I firmly believe that computers represent an extraordinary invention. They enable individuals to engage with others from distant locations. They offer a plethora of entertaining games for one to partake in. Moreover, they serve as an excellent medium for acquiring knowledge about various topics and far - flung places. The ability to communicate with relatives residing in remote areas is of utmost significance. @PERCENT1 of experts assert that a closely - knit family enhances a child's likelihood of attending college. I comprehend why some individuals might think, ""Well, why not..."". I grew up in a large family where the phone was in constant use throughout the day. Computers possess numerous engaging games. I understand the perception that computers contribute to childhood obesity, yet it is not the time spent on the computer but rather eating habits that are the culprit. Studies indicate that computers are utilized twice as much during winter. Surfing the internet to gain new knowledge is an outstanding way to utilize this resource. Imagine a straight - A student coming home for the weekend to work on a major project but forgetting to bring the most crucial book. She would be in a state of panic, searching everywhere and hyperventilating. However, if she had a computer, she could complete the project and attend her dream college. Since you didn't purchase a computer, she might fail the class, not get accepted into Harvard, and settle for a local community college, where she may one day be able to transfer. Thus, I have provided reasons for you to go out and buy a computer; you just need to take action. Do you want your children to interact with Aunt Sally, who lives @NUM1 miles away? It is also an excellent avenue for playing games. Lastly, do you want your daughter to attend Yale or fail? I have presented the facts; the decision is yours."
1627	1631	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am convinced that computers can have a positive impact. When one considers it, computers can actually facilitate learning through the multitude of programs they offer. Suppose you require tutoring or advice; essentially, you can find all of that on a computer. Even if you have a young child, I am absolutely certain that there are websites and programs tailored for them, and trust me, they are both enjoyable and educational! You are aware of the complaints that computers are encroaching on time for exercise and interaction with family and friends. However, what if your family lives elsewhere? You can engage in chat sessions with them! Additionally, you can exercise while using the computer. I am confident that as you continue reading, you will understand why I believe they are positive. Are you facing difficulties in school? Are people blaming it on computers? Well, we can change that! If we can demonstrate to people that computers can aid in learning and are educational, then perhaps people will realize that, with all the technology emerging these days, computers are not so bad. I am quite certain that there are some form of tutoring programs available, and there are even online colleges! That is definitely worth exploring. Do you have a child, a younger friend, or younger siblings? Are they constantly seeking games to play? Well, I am @PERCENT1 certain that there are fun, educational games and websites on a computer! So, while they are having a great time, you can contemplate how much they are learning! It is a truly enjoyable method of learning! You can envision what they are learning and how well they are performing in school. Do you have family members who live far away and whom you rarely see? Well, if you all own computers, you can potentially stay in touch! You can chat with each other, check on one another, and see how everyone is faring. It is a perfect way to maintain contact. Do you want to know another excellent way to connect? A webcam! You are not obligated to have one; it is merely a suggestion. In this way, not only can you talk to them, but you can also see them. Isn't that remarkable? I don't know about you, but I think it is. Now that you have heard my perspective on why I believe computers are positive, I hope you share the same view. If you truly reflect on it, they are not bad at all; they are actually very helpful. Thank you.
1628	1632	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on our country. Three reasons for this belief are communication, @CAPS2, entertainment, and @CAPS3. One of my favorite activities is conversing. When one of my best friends relocated and I lost his phone number, I thought our communication was severed. One day, he sent me a friend request on Facebook, and since then, we have been communicating via websites such as Facebook, MySpace, and Skype. My second reason for believing that computers benefit our society is @CAPS2. At my father's residence, I do not have access to a television, so I rely on the internet to keep myself informed about global events. A website named @CAPS4.com was the first to announce @PERSON1's death before anyone even suspected it. Stories of this nature often break on the internet. The third reason for the positive impact of computers on our society is entertainment. You can watch videos, play games, listen to music, and communicate with friends. The final reason is @CAPS3. Many @CAPS3 in our community demand computer skills, such as those of an accountant, a manager, a software designer, and a computer programmer. Computers make @CAPS3 more efficient by rectifying errors, providing visual aids, and facilitating typing. These are the reasons why computers have a positive effect on our community.
1629	1633	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, there is a great deal of concern regarding computers and whether people spend an excessive amount of time sitting in front of the screen. I believe that individuals should be more cognizant of the time they spend on computers. Instead of damaging your eyesight, you should engage in exercise, enjoy life, and spend time with family and friends. Exercise is a vital component of everyone's life, and if you do not get enough of it, you may become obese. Obesity in @MONTH1 may cause people to dislike you or perceive you as a slovenly person. Although you may claim that you do not care about others' opinions, in the long run, it could be a mistake to hold this view. Exercise is likely to eliminate almost any form of discrimination because you will appear no different or even better than the average person. If you have the opportunity, obtain a telescope and set it up in a location where you can observe the stars at night. Instead of fixating your eyes on the computer on a pleasant, sunny day, take a stroll in the woods. As you can see, nature is far more beautiful than a collection of tiny colored pixels forming an image of nature. If you come across an image of a beautiful plant, why not go and experience the plant in person? Many programs on computers now allow you to see people, but wouldn't you prefer to talk to them in real life? I certainly would, and I believe most others would as well. @PERCENT1 of the population of @LOCATION1 stated that they would much rather communicate with friends or relatives in person than via a computer screen. I feel that, whenever possible, you should always interact with people face - to - face rather than through cameras and wires. I hope I have made it clear that exercise, nature, and real - life interactions are all far superior alternatives to spending your entire life in front of a computer.
1630	1634	1	1	Has a computer ever assisted you in answering challenging questions or typing up an essay for school or work? I am aware that a computer has been of great help to me for years; thus, why would I terminate its use or wish it away? Here lies the controversy: many experts contend that computers do not benefit society, yet individuals like myself hold the exact opposite view. There are numerous advantages to owning a computer. For instance, they are always a source of information, enable you to engage in online conversations with others, and can assist people with their school and job - related tasks. Regardless of the problem, do you not believe that a computer is always a valuable source of information that could offer assistance? A computer contains an endless amount of information on any topic, unlike books. This is because everyone, from the most to the least intelligent individuals, has their opinions, ideas, and hard facts stored in a computer on the web. I once watched a movie about a man who detested computers and new technology. Consequently, for most of his life, he wandered the world without a clue as to where to @CAPS4 in search of a rare artifact called the @CAPS1 diamond. He never found the diamond, but his son, who searched for it on the internet, discovered that the root geo from @CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @CAPS2 culture. Thanks to a computer, he found the diamond underground, beneath the ancient @CAPS2 temples. Therefore, I believe that if people were to embrace technology such as computers, they would discover many things they had never previously considered. Additionally, computers provide the ability to chat online with family and friends. Many people utilize computers to stay in touch when they do not have access to phones. With a computer, you can chat with a friend down the street or a family member on vacation in another country. No matter where you are, a computer can always serve as an available means of communication. For example, the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by communicating with them online using a computer. One thing I know is that, regardless of your age, probably up to @NUM1, if you have a job or attend school, you have used a computer to help with @CAPS4. Whether it was obtaining an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project, we all use computers. Computers even have the capability to help you create brochures or pamphlets. This can significantly aid in advertising if that is part of your work. Also, many people do not have the neatest handwriting, so they type their essays or letters to their bosses. You can even select the type of font. In any case, a computer is always helpful at work. Yes, I firmly believe that computers benefit society. Although some experts disagree with me and believe that they can become addictive, still take my suggestions seriously and continue using your computer. Remember, it is always a source of information, you can chat online, and it helps with work.
1631	1635	1	1	It has come to my awareness that there is a debate regarding whether computers exert a positive influence on individuals. I am of the opinion that computers indeed have a positive impact on people. With computers, individuals can access essential information that may be utilized to assist them. Moreover, computers enable people to communicate with friends and family across the globe and also educate individuals on novel concepts. Hence, computers have a positive effect on people.  Students, whether at the college or elementary school level, almost invariably turn to a computer when tasked with projects for their classes. Without computers, students would be unable to obtain the necessary information, which could lead to them receiving a poor grade on the project. This, in turn, could result in a continuous decline in their grades.  Adults frequently employ computers for work and planning. Therefore, if computers did not exist, thousands of individuals would lose their jobs and might forget scheduled plans that could be crucial. This could lead to families losing money, having insufficient funds to pay bills, and potentially losing their homes, forcing them to live on the streets.  Every person has at least two or more friends or relatives residing in different parts of the world, making it challenging to maintain contact. This may necessitate the use of long - distance calling, which can be costly. However, with computers, people can communicate with friends and relatives worldwide without incurring additional expenses on phone calls. Additionally, if something happens to a family member or in the vicinity of a relative's residence, we can use the internet to check on their well - being.  Many parents utilize computers to educate their children at an early age, preparing them for their first school experience. Furthermore, computers are primarily used in schools to teach students about knowledge essential for their future. As a result, computers become highly valuable to people when they are attempting to learn new skills, whether for school, college, or a job. Computers are frequently used daily for important learning tasks, ensuring that we do not require additional assistance in acquiring new skills. Moreover, we would be capable of helping others when they need it if we already possess the necessary knowledge.  As can be observed, computers do have a positive impact on people. People can use computers to acquire the information needed for school or work, stay in touch with friends and family globally, and learn important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and can prevent individuals from losing things that are significant to themselves or others.
1632	1636	1	1	To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, computers confer numerous benefits upon our society. They serve as a valuable asset in enhancing our learning and expanding our knowledge base. By leveraging computers, students can complete their academic tasks more promptly and with greater efficiency. When typing a report on a computer, in the event of a spelling error, every computer is equipped with a spell - checking feature. Additionally, if @ORGANIZATION1 needs to look up the definition of an unfamiliar word, all that is required is to visit @LOCATION1, enter the word, and the definition will be instantly available.  If @ORGANIZATION1 has been assigned a book report, although @CAPS2 does not permit direct copying and pasting from online sources, it is still more convenient than writing on paper. With a computer, a student's academic life has been significantly simplified.  For individuals who are physically impaired and unable to stand, walk, or talk, computers offer employment opportunities. They have facilitated the creation and replacement of numerous jobs. Without computers, teachers would have to rely on traditional mail, which would result in excessive paper waste. While computers consume electricity, paper production leads to deforestation. In any case, investing in computers is a prudent decision.  For college - bound individuals who lack the time to commute to campus, online education via computers provides a viable alternative. Even if one cannot afford a backpack, it is no longer necessary as digital materials can be stored on the computer.  In conclusion, computers are a remarkable invention. They have streamlined our lives, are environmentally friendly, and have even contributed to the conservation of trees. Moreover, they have generated numerous employment opportunities. Last - minute tasks can also be efficiently completed online. Each computer purchase represents an additional source of income for someone.
1633	1637	1	1	"I am convinced that computers are both beneficial and invaluable to us. They offer a plethora of entertainment options, facilitate communication among individuals, and even aid in our learning endeavors. On a rainy or extremely cold day when outdoor activities are not feasible, one can engage with the computer to watch movies, play games, or engage in web - chatting. The computer is an outstanding device, and health expert @PERSON1 asserts that ""computer usage is acceptable as long as it is restricted to approximately an hour or an hour and a half per day.""  Some individuals contend that people are not getting sufficient exercise due to computer usage. However, the lack of exercise is not solely attributable to computers. In today's modern era, computers enable us to not only call, text, or page others but also offer additional capabilities. With a webcam, we can engage in video chats and exchange videos. We can also connect with friends on social media platforms such as Facebook or MySpace. Sociologist @PERSON2 notes that an increasing number of people are accessing @CAPS1 websites to communicate with their friends. ""@CAPS1 websites are excellent,"" @CAPS2 also remarks. ""@CAPS1 allows you to interact with friends when they are far away or when you are unable to meet them in person. Nevertheless, nothing can replace genuine face - to - face interaction.""  Computers also play a crucial role in our learning. They can provide answers to almost any question and offer a vast amount of information. Although some individuals may still believe that computers are detrimental and cause a lack of exercise, I believe that people have the autonomy to make friends. The over - use of computers is a personal choice, and excessive indulgence in anything is undesirable. In today's world, computers are an indispensable part of our lives and are irreplaceable."
1634	1638	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, as you are aware, an increasing number of individuals are embracing computer usage. In my view, computers confer substantial benefits on society in multiple aspects.  One of the positive impacts of computers on people is the facilitation of communication. Through computers, individuals can exchange messages effortlessly. For those without a phone or a car, they can simply log on to the internet, compose a message, and click the send button. This provides an accessible means of communicating with someone residing halfway across the globe. If you have family members living far away, you can also share pictures of yourself, friends, family, and places you have visited. They can receive these pictures and reciprocate by sending their own.  Another significant advantage of computers is their ability to enable people to learn new things. The internet allows users to explore diverse topics and contains virtually every piece of information one can conceive. For instance, if you visit @ORGANIZATION1 and enter a word like 'dog,' you will be presented with a multitude of websites related to dogs. You can discover lists of dog breeds, the average lifespan of dogs, their common habitats, and proper care methods. The internet encourages exploration and helps generate new ideas.  Computers also prove useful during idle moments. If you are bored and unable to play outdoors due to inclement weather or an injury, you can engage in computer games, listen to music online, or write a story using a word - processing program. Playing computer games can enhance your gaming skills and keep you occupied. If you wish to listen to music for entertainment, you can visit @CAPS3 or other platforms to access any song of your choice. This is preferable to listening to the radio, as you may not always like the songs being played. If you are in the mood to write, you can open a word document to express your thoughts.  As you can see, I consider the computer to be a fascinating tool. It allows for communication, learning, and self - entertainment when physical activities are not possible. However, it is important to remember to go out and socialize with friends and family whenever feasible.
1635	1639	1	1	Computers have become ubiquitous in contemporary society, and while some may perceive them as detrimental to social fabric, in actuality, they stand as our most invaluable tool. They offer seamless access to information and equip future generations with essential skills. Moreover, they provide an escape from the rigors of daily life through gaming.  Prior to the advent of computers, individuals spent countless hours poring over books in search of information. The computer has revolutionized this process. All one needs to do is type in the query and press the enter key. This not only improves academic performance for children but also simplifies the lives of adults, enabling them to solve problems without leaving home and disseminate news as soon as it breaks.  Computers also create an interactive platform for people worldwide. Features such as question - and - answer forums allow us not only to solicit opinions and compare responses but also to gather statistics that aid in making life - altering decisions. They not only provide information but also prepare us for the modern world. They enhance children's social and decision - making skills and expose them to fields such as web design, as well as more practical skills like time management and complex business concepts.  Online video gaming has emerged as a significant industry. It allows people to engage in a variety of activities, from dancing and building to fighting and crafting. In fact, @NUM1 of games are suitable for ages @NUM2. Additionally, it improves hand - eye coordination. On days when one is feeling down, gaming can bring a sense of happiness.  In conclusion, computers are not just a luxury but a necessity. They challenge our minds and, with a bit of determination, can help us realize our dreams within reasonable limits.
1636	1640	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 individuals own either computers or laptops. Both devices serve identical functions. These electronic apparatuses are familiar. They can assist you in accomplishing numerous tasks that others @MONTH1 cannot. These @MONTH1 can aid you in locating long - lost siblings or whomever you @MONTH1 desire to find. Computers @MONTH1 can also cause harm or @CAPS4, so if you purchase one, exercise caution. “I went to find my brother; I left when I did it at my mother's house,” cried the woman. That is a task suitable for a computer. @CAPS3 websites accessible via a computer @MONTH1 can help you achieve this, such as Facebook, MySpace. This can impact yours and @CAPS3 mores. This can transform your life instantaneously. It can turn what seems like a difficult period into a positive one simply by finding your loved one. Computers carry @CAPS3 risks. You might attempt to pay your bills online and send your money to the wrong websites. That can result in your identity being stolen. You can also upload all your information online, and you @MONTH1 might not think much of it when they actually matter. You can disclose your phone number, address, and many more details, and people @MONTH1 might contact you, pretending to be someone else and @MONTH1 you or even harm you. @CAPS3 individuals believe it is very [description missing in original] but it isn't. @CAPS4, be vigilant about what you do. The computer is a significant factor contributing to why @CAPS4 @CAPS3 people no longer prefer to go out to purchase items; they would rather shop online. That is one reason why you have become overly [description missing in original]. You @MONTH1 might go @MONTH1 or just stay home and play games online. @CAPS4 @CAPS3 More Americans just become lazy by doing both. In the end, it's your choice. Computers are useful; weigh the pros and cons.
1637	1641	1	1	Some individuals perceive the computer as an excellent and remarkable device. What makes it remarkable? It is remarkable because the computer can assist you in every aspect. I have several reasons to support this. Firstly, when you are at school and have homework, assignments, projects, or similar tasks, the computer can offer substantial assistance. This is because you can access the internet on the computer and visit Google or other websites. Secondly, the computer can be helpful at home. For instance, if you encounter a major issue with your car, you can access @LOCATION1 on the computer and view the car's components. The third reason why the computer is so remarkable is that in the present era, it enables you to accomplish almost anything. We can access the web to simplify our lives. Currently, you can complete work, homework, projects, generate ideas, write books, chat, gather information, print pictures, and so on. Moreover, if you are an architect, you can create your own designs or visualize your house. Clearly, the computer is truly remarkable. However, some people misuse the computer for inappropriate purposes, such as accessing pornography or engaging in other unwholesome activities. This is neither appropriate nor commendable. The computer is an extraordinary and highly intelligent invention. In my opinion, the computer is extremely helpful and has become almost a necessity in our lives. Not for survival, but for enhancing the quality of our lives or something @CAPS1. You can even use the webcam to see your family. This is truly amazing, but avoid using the webcam for improper purposes. You can learn new things that you were previously unaware of. Therefore, I believe that you should utilize the computer for beneficial purposes. Appreciate the computer. Please.
1638	1642	1	1	Dear local newspaper, technology is an indispensable component of daily life and even shapes some people's lifestyles. Without technology, particularly computers, humanity would be adrift. We would be unable to explore distant places and their inhabitants, conduct research with a broader range of available information, or, for some, communicate with friends and family. Whether people realize it or not, technology is essential in everyone's life. The capabilities of a computer are virtually limitless, and in terms of technological advancements, this is merely the beginning. The internet empowers people to learn more than what they could obtain from a library book. You can gain insights into the culture of @LOCATION1, the cuisine of @LOCATION2, or even the dressing styles of people in @LOCATION3. You can discover pictures of far - off places and learn about a country's currency. One of the key functions that a computer enables is research. It can make presenting a presentation far more effortless! Additionally, the computer facilitates communication among people. For some, it is their primary means of interaction. If you have a pen - pal in a @CAPS1 state or even a @CAPS1 country, email is an ideal way to communicate; it is rapid, convenient, and enjoyable. Others, however, prefer instant messaging, where the message you type appears almost instantaneously on the other person's screen, and they can quickly respond. Both methods are excellent for communication. As you can see, without technology, we would be unable to acquire all the knowledge we desire, conduct research for, say, a language arts class. We might not even be able to communicate with certain individuals. And this is just a glimpse of what our lives would be like without the computer.
1639	1643	1	1	To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, in contemporary society, computer technology dominates the world. It is the source of our news, music, shopping, and entertainment. Sounds appealing, doesn't it? However, there are significant drawbacks to this information - laden device. For example, this gadget is encroaching on people's lives and preventing them from engaging in physical activity. Nowadays, people are even sacrificing human interaction due to these seemingly wonderful devices. Finally, computers are costly electronic devices that require substantial maintenance, which incurs expenses and ultimately leads to feelings of despondency. As evident, while computers offer numerous advantages, there are also considerable disadvantages that you may not have considered. As previously mentioned, computers are causing people to neglect physical exercise. We are all becoming increasingly lethargic. People prefer to remain in front of their computer screens, playing Grand Theft Auto or engaging in Facebook stalking, rather than going outside to play soccer with friends at the nearby empty field. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 population goes without physical activity for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those individuals prefer to stay at home using their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot allow this situation to persist. We must alter our lifestyle and eliminate this unhealthy device we call a computer. Among all the reasons why computers are detrimental, this is by far the most disconcerting. As computers gain popularity, people are having fewer and fewer face - to - face interactions. Now, you can perform every task from your computer. Soon, people might even marry them. Oh, wait, that has already occurred. Just yesterday, I read in the latest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present, and everything was formal. They just returned from their honeymoon. This is truly sad! Look at the state our world has reached. People would rather marry a computer character than communicate with real individuals. We must act promptly; I have no idea what will happen next. Finally, computers are expensive. You pay @MONEY1 upfront for the computer, but then there is a significant amount of maintenance required. Computers are very troublesome. You keep spending money on them, which is extremely demoralizing. It will likely break down again soon or freeze, causing you to lose a report you've worked on all night. For example, on @DATE1, my dad had to pay @MONEY2 to get my @DATE1 computer fixed. He was very reluctant to pay the amount, and he was annoyed for an entire week afterward. It got even worse when it froze again a week later. He was extremely frustrated. That's all you get from computers - more and more frustration. I simply don't think it's worth it.
1640	1644	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I firmly contend that computers can have a negative impact on society. My reasons are that people are spending excessive time on their computers, reducing their physical activity, and diminishing their interactions with family and friends. Firstly, I believe that computers are detrimental to society because people are devoting an inordinate amount of time to them. I am aware that when I return home from school, the only thing on my mind is getting on the computer until I do. It is akin to an addiction. People spend all their time on social networks instead of going out and meeting new people. Secondly, people are engaging in less physical exercise. I have visited a friend's house before, and all we did was play computer games instead of enjoying the outdoors. Many @CAPS1 individuals do not make healthy food choices, so why not engage in physical activity? The answer lies in the computer. I have witnessed my little brother spending an entire Saturday sitting in front of the computer, eating and playing games. This is extremely unhealthy. Lastly, computers take time away from family and friends. I have spent entire after - school days in my room using the computer. It's as if when you are on the computer, nothing else matters because you think, “Why not just chat with my friends on @CAPS2, MySpace, or Facebook?” You end up losing many friendships this way. You also distance yourself from your family because you hardly communicate with them while using the computer. Half the time, I am so engrossed in chatting with strangers that I neglect to help my little brother with his homework or assist my mom with housework. In conclusion, these are the three reasons why I believe the computer is harmful to civilization. I sincerely hope that you take these points into consideration and reflect on the impact of computers on @CAPS1. Once again, those three reasons are: one, people are spending too much time on their computers; two, they are spending less time exercising; three, they are losing interactions with family and friends.
1641	1645	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, on @DATE1, computers have become an integral part of our society. They represent a technological advancement and do bring about certain positive impacts. Nevertheless, the negative effects of computers on individuals outweigh the positive ones. They detract from and curtail @CAPS3 time, impede interaction with family, and limit exposure to the world. First, computers exert a negative influence on people as they reduce @CAPS3 time. Individuals become so engrossed in computers that their inclination for @CAPS3 begins to wane. According to a survey conducted by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE2, a @CAPS1 person spending @NUM1 hours on the computer per week (approximately @NUM2 hours daily) experienced an increase in cholesterol and a gradual deterioration of muscles. ""@CAPS1 person needs about one to two hours of physical activity each day, and only @NUM2 out of @NUM4 people achieve this amount,"" says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. ""Computers distract people from their necessities."" The primary cause of this low figure? ""Technology,"" she states, ""specifically @CAPS2 computers, which deprive people of the motivation and time required for @CAPS3."" @CAPS3 is crucial, yet computers are depriving society of this essential element. People should not suffer from poor @ORGANIZATION1 due to the negative impact of computers. Second, computers have a negative effect on people as they erode interaction with family. Family @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3 reports that @NUM5 out of @NUM4 people claim that computers encroach on their family time. This is far from ideal, especially considering that a @CAPS1 person needs at least @NUM7 hours of interaction with family to maintain a healthy mental state. Children are directly affected by computer use in family settings. When computer time starts to consume a significant portion of the day, it also disrupts communication, which is extremely important for nurturing children. As a result, family bonds and relationships are damaged. Computers have a negative impact on people by affecting family interaction and introducing discord into family bonds. Lastly, computers have a negative effect on people as they prevent them from engaging with the world. When one is on the computer, it may seem as though the entire world is contained within the computer screen. However, this is not the case. This phenomenon is having a detrimental effect on people. My physcology.net states that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers for an average of about @NUM2 hours per day have notably become withdrawn and oblivious to their surroundings. The solution? Traveling or even taking walks to appreciate nature can be beneficial. People should be aware of the world in which they live. They must make important decisions for themselves, their children, and even their country, and staring at a computer screen will not assist them in any way. This will particularly affect children, the next generation, who will have no knowledge or a clear perspective of the world if people continue their negative habits of excessive computer usage. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They reduce @CAPS3, leading to an increase in poor @ORGANIZATION1 and a heightened need for @CAPS3. They disrupt family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds, not to mention communication. Finally, they prevent people from experiencing the world, which is actually very important as it impacts people's decision - making and future generations. People need to recognize these adverse effects and significantly reduce their computer usage."
1642	1646	1	1	Computers wield a substantial influence on people's lives! They can be both beneficial and distracting simultaneously. I possess a computer, yet I am only permitted to use it after completing my homework. I engage in a multitude of activities on my computer, predominantly playing games and visiting social websites such as MySpace. Computers can be advantageous by aiding with homework or facilitating the acquisition of information. I frequently utilize my computer for homework, such as for projects or when I am unfamiliar with a subject. I also believe that computers are useful for communicating with friends and family. I communicate with my family, who reside in @LOCATION1, quite often. I visit MySpace approximately five times a week. However, computers can also serve as a distraction, causing people to become indolent and exposing them to inappropriate websites. For instance, MySpace can pose risks. If one divulges all their personal information to someone they do not know, the consequences can be dire. A significant number of individuals spend excessive time on the computer. I have numerous family members who only rise from their seats to use the computer or play video games, and they remain engrossed for extended periods, sometimes up to eight hours. My mother also uses the computer to access @CAPS1. She converses with many of her friends from @LOCATION1. She still keeps in touch with her high - school classmates, but she primarily communicates with her older sister. She does not spend @NUM1 on the computer; instead, she uses it for @NUM2 minutes to an hour. I believe that computers can be valuable in life, but one should not spend an inordinate amount of time, such as eight hours, on them. One will witness the negative consequences if they engage in such excessive usage regularly. My cousins are gradually gaining weight, not in terms of height. Therefore, one should limit their computer usage and not spend almost half of the day on it.
1643	1647	1	1	Dear newspaper, technology is an extremely useful asset; however, it also has its drawbacks, as it tends to render people indolent. A computer is a versatile tool. Moreover, individuals can access any website for various purposes, whether it be for research or personal reasons. First and foremost, it is important to note that computers are valuable multi - purpose instruments. Nevertheless, computers can also make people sluggish or lazy. I hold this view because an excessive number of individuals remain seated in front of their computers instead of engaging in physical activity. Physical activity is both beneficial and essential for people. Many individuals are inactive because they spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer. Students sometimes return home and immediately turn to the computer instead of completing their homework. On the other hand, computers can be helpful in numerous ways. They can assist with bill payment, research, or even offer entertainment through games. There is an extensive array of websites available to meet various needs. Uploading family pictures from a recent vacation is a straightforward task with most computer software. In conclusion, computers are somewhat like a blank canvas, waiting for a spark of inspiration. They have the potential to be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on how they are used.
1644	1648	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, computers have a predominantly positive impact on individuals. With a computer, one can engage in a plethora of activities! They offer an abundance of information, facilitate communication, and even provide entertainment. The only reason some people perceive computers as unhealthy or negative is that certain individuals abuse their ""computer - time."" Have you ever used the popular website www.google.com? Websites like this, and numerous others, are invaluable when seeking information. One simply types in a word, and instantaneously, hundreds or thousands of links containing information on that word become available for selection! How could such a vast repository of knowledge be considered unhealthy or have a negative impact on people? Computers house dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, and history pages that contain a wealth of information. So, go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most renowned and widely used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will discover a novel way to communicate with friends and family. Equipped with security tools and various settings, you can locate long - lost friends or out - of - touch family members and quickly catch up. Admittedly, many people misuse these websites by posting offensive language or inappropriate content. However, this issue can be easily resolved by reporting such behavior to the website manager or an adult. One merely needs to understand how to stay safe online; otherwise, the computer can become a highly negative entity. If used correctly, one can relish messages from family and instant messages from friends. There is a diverse range of entertainment options available on the computer. From video - sharing websites like www.youtube.com to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com, these platforms offer games, videos, and even educational resources. There are also websites where one can purchase music, movies, clothing, and furniture. Many stores have online platforms where items can be purchased and delivered directly to one's doorstep. How could this possibly be regarded as negative? Additionally, there are video games specifically designed for computers that can be purchased and installed for immediate entertainment. After all, who wouldn't prefer to play games or shop without the hassle of finding time to go out? I know my aunts do. In conclusion, computers are not inherently negative, unless one abuses their ""computer - time"" and squanders countless hours without purpose. One needs to set a limit. Spending an entire day on a computer is simply absurd. So, have fun, learn, communicate, and entertain yourself responsibly."
1645	1649	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, computers tend to exert more negative effects on individuals than positive ones. This is evident as people may not be getting sufficient exercise, may not be appreciating the beauty of nature, and are not spending an adequate amount of time with family and friends. While computers are useful to have at home, they also present several issues. Firstly, people are allocating an excessive amount of time to using computers. This has a negative impact because when one is on the computer, they are not engaging in physical activity. Consider a day spent consuming fast food while sitting in front of the computer. Obesity has become a significant concern for the @ORGANIZATION1 in recent times. Prolonged computer use does not alleviate this problem. Any concerned individual, regardless of their technological proficiency, would concur that the countless hours spent on the computer are detrimental to the health of our nation. Secondly, people are spending too much time on computers and not enough time appreciating the beauty of nature. Many people, including adults, have @DATE1 because they are oblivious to the world that awaits exploration. There are numerous wonders that people should be grateful for, yet they remain unappreciated. People should be eager to experience these things. Although communication is important for everyone, instead of relying solely on computer - mediated communication, people should make plans to spend time with their family and friends. This issue is also related to the lack of exercise and the naivety of individuals. If people were to venture out and enjoy the forest with their friends and family, they would not waste numerous hours each day on the computer. People should take action and get out of their comfort zones. Life is too short to be spent sitting idle all day. Any intelligent person would recognize that time spent with family and friends is far more fulfilling than time spent on the computer. In conclusion, computers have been over - used recently. Instead of dealing with the problems associated with excessive computer use, such as lack of sunlight and monotonous computer - based conversations, people should get up and actively engage with the world. We only have one life, and it should be lived to the fullest.
1646	1650	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 what could an individual do without a computer? In my view, the answer is nothing. @CAPS1 If you are like me, with family residing far away in another country, a computer enables you to see them via a camera and converse with them as if you were physically present. Computers do not merely consume your time; they assist you in comprehending the essence of family. There are numerous reasons why I believe computers should hold great significance. Firstly, they provide information about a place that you might be interested in visiting or learning about its culture. Many individuals enjoy exploring and discovering new places, yet they are unable to do so, perhaps due to lack of time or excessive work commitments. There is no valid reason for someone to forgo opportunities simply because they lack the time or a computer. Secondly, computers are essential for work. People like you, who work in an office, require information about a location where a disaster has occurred. You may need to ascertain how it happened and the conditions under which it transpired. Those working in important positions need a computer to save their work and avoid losing it and facing termination. Thirdly and finally, computers help with organization. Being organized is of utmost importance as it aids in retaining a job and having everything readily accessible. Computers are not just a means of passing time; they also simplify your life. Many people express a desire to reduce the amount of paperwork; with a computer, you can store all those documents on a single page, which is saved by you and accessible only to you. As you @MONTH1 observe, many computer users utilize them productively. It is not just a pastime as some people claim. It also helps you accomplish various tasks for your own future, not just for socializing with new friends. As you @MONTH1 can see, these are my three primary reasons for keeping a computer at home and using it in a beneficial and productive manner.
1647	1651	1	1	Dear, @ORGANIZATION2. A computer serves as an extremely valuable resource. It facilitates people in navigating through life, enabling them to seek employment and conduct academic research. The world would be unrecognizable without computers. However, on the contrary, some individuals do spend an excessive amount of time on the computer. Nevertheless, spending countless hours surfing the web is their personal choice. Computers empower students to conduct research from the comfort of their homes. Instead of making arduous trips to the local library in search of books, all they need to do is type in their research topic, and voila, a plethora of different websites are right at their fingertips. A computer offers the world within easy reach. Moreover, computers can assist unemployed individuals in finding a job. It is straightforward; simply type in the city where you wish to work, and you're good to go. You can even complete a job application instantaneously. Some people even have the opportunity to work from home. Stay - at - home moms can effortlessly earn money while performing daily chores such as washing dishes. Additionally, working from home can be significantly less stressful. It is less taxing because you don't have to deal with annoying and impatient colleagues. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of employment is from the workers' homes? @CAPS1 Now you do. Working from home transforms another day at the office into another day at home. Computers have propelled us a long way since the prehistoric era. Without computers, the world would be a desolate place. We would lack many basic amenities such as traffic lights, elevators, and even blenders. We would also be deprived of more sophisticated inventions like rockets, cars, and planes. Imagine an airport without computers; where would they store all their information? On paper? Where would a school store all its grades and tardiness records? On paper? Where would the government store its information? On paper? With just these three institutions, we would already be responsible for cutting down half of the @ORGANIZATION1. Computers also contribute to environmental conservation. They will also aid us in inventing more advanced technology so that one day we can inhabit @CAPS2 or other celestial bodies. I hope this essay has altered your perspective on computers. Let's recap: they assist students in research, help people find jobs, enable remote work, and benefit the environment. Without computers, we would be living in caves and wearing leaves as undergarments like cavemen. The bottom line is that computers are incredibly helpful.
1648	1652	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 the utilization of computers is a prudent idea as every developed nation incorporates them. Moreover, they contribute to learning, enhance communication, and hold commercial significance. Computers also simplify life for numerous individuals. Computers contribute to learning by making a vast amount of information readily available. Personally, I stay informed about numerous global events simply by accessing yahoo.com. Computers allow me to learn about new @NUM1 and explore cultures across the world. Another way computers contribute to learning is by providing information on everyday matters such as removing stains, pronouncing words, and preparing new dishes, among other things. Computers are also indispensable for communication. We employ computers to interact with our friends on Facebook. You can also meet new people using a personal computer. Since everyone uses computers, you can essentially connect with anyone. The final reason computers are important is from a commercial perspective. Computers assist many small businesses by increasing their visibility. Local sellers and large corporations can compete for the same customers. Furthermore, the internet generates substantial revenue for people as they can use it as a digital billboard. In conclusion, the computer is useful due to its role in learning, communication, and commerce. Therefore, the computer should be supported and not be disparaged.
1649	1653	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever spent more than an hour continuously on the computer? Computers exert a negative influence on individuals! You may be harming your eyesight, time could be better spent engaging in outdoor activities, and it can impede your ability to communicate effectively in person. Do your eyes tend to ache once you finally step away from the computer? Whether you are playing games or typing articles, your eyes @MONTH1 experience strain in keeping up with the small font on a website. I recall a time when I read an online novel, and while my body was eager to go out and play, my eyes were fatigued. Instead of playing sports games on the computer, you should venture outside and participate in real - life sports. When you are on a computer, you are most likely indoors. Did you know that a person should spend at least @NUM1 minutes outdoors to obtain vitamin @CAPS3? By remaining in front of a computer screen, you are not obtaining the necessary daily intake of vitamins. Do you find it easier to communicate with someone via a computer rather than in person? You are not alone in this perception. If you disconnect from the computer and engage in face - to - face conversations, you can enhance your social skills. Initially, it may be challenging, but it is worthwhile in the long run. By now, you are aware that computers do not have a positive impact. They damage your vision, limit your outdoor activity time, and make it more difficult to communicate with people in person. So, come on, put down the mouse and engage in hands - on activities.
1650	1654	1	1	Computers do not contribute positively to society today. They have rendered technology a necessity, causing many people to neglect other activities, and they are detrimental to health. Do you envision a world filled @ORGANIZATION1 with people whose eyes are constantly fixed on a computer screen? Although computers are highly useful to everyone, they are addictive. Computers were designed to expedite and simplify tasks. For instance, you can shop online and search for information on Google. We live in an era where computers have become a necessity rather @ORGANIZATION1 than a source of pleasure. According to @PERSON1, a psychologist at the @ORGANIZATION1, more than @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 of people nowadays spend their time indoors on their computers. Moreover, computers are making people more lethargic. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 of going to the store to purchase items or visiting a friend's house in person, people typically resort to using the computer. Consequently, people do not allocate sufficient time to other activities. For example, on a sunny and pleasant day, one would expect most children to be outdoors having fun, but this is no longer the case. For children old enough to use a computer, they @CAPS1 would rather stay indoors on such a nice day. There are many enjoyable activities on a computer, such as chatting with friends, checking emails, and using Facebook. Even though these activities are enjoyable, you should limit your computer usage. Most @ORGANIZATION1 of the time spent on the computer could be better spent outdoors or at the movies. Avoiding excessive computer use could also benefit small businesses. If you spend money on an activity, purchase something, or watch a movie, it would have a positive impact on the profits of small businesses. On the other hand, computers are not beneficial for your health. Mac magazine reports that there are health risks associated with excessive computer use. @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 of people become obese and develop vitamin @CAPS1 deficiency due to excessive computer usage. When using your computer, you could be engaging in physical exercise, which leads to obesity. Additionally, if you are indoors all the time, you will not receive the adequate amount @ORGANIZATION1 of sunlight, resulting in a vitamin @CAPS1 deficiency. Another health risk is impaired vision. Spending hours a day on a computer can cause permanent damage to your eyes. Do you want your child/children to be at risk of health problems due to excessive computer use? In conclusion, it is reasonable to assert that computers do not contribute positively to society today. Many people are addicted to technology, time could be used more effectively, and computers pose health risks. Although computers do make task - completion easier, abusing this privilege will have consequences for everyone.
1651	1655	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I contend that computers exert a detrimental influence on individuals. A significant number of adults and, predominantly, children are not engaging in sufficient physical activity or even allocating quality time with their families. Some parents are less actively involved with their children. Children are failing to complete their homework because they are perpetually engrossed in the computer upon arriving home. Both adults and children are becoming increasingly sedentary. Merely sitting and reading or engaging in other computer - related activities does not constitute exercise. They are prone to weight gain as they consume food, sit, and then feel hungry again, repeating the cycle of eating and sitting. Some individuals claim that using the mouse provides finger and arm exercise, yet this assertion lacks credibility. Prolonged exposure to the computer screen can cause severe hand issues. Moreover, people are neglecting their family time. They are seated in front of a computer, oblivious to everyone and everything around them. Children could be indulging in other activities beyond the digital realm. Parents could be outdoors, playing catch with their children or engaging in a board game. People are exhibiting a marked decrease in physical activity. They are not going out and having a jubilant time leaping around with their friends. Instead, they communicate with others via computers, send messages on Facebook, or even MySpace. Children are underperforming in school because they neglect their homework after school. They prefer to be on the computer. This is precisely why I believe computers have a negative impact on kids and adults.
1652	1656	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, in my estimation, the computer is an exceptional device as it enables one to engage in a plethora of activities, such as gaming. Three compelling reasons for owning a computer are the ability to communicate online with friends, complete homework or projects, and acquire information about @LOCATION1. Therefore, I opine that if one enjoys such activities, a computer is an indispensable asset. The first reason is online communication. Individuals engage in online conversations to interact with their friends, including @PERSON1. Through online communication, one can ascertain homework assignments, meeting schedules, or the commencement time of a party. One can also converse with friends or family members who have relocated or reside at a distance around @LOCATION2. The second reason is homework completion. On occasion, the computer is an essential tool for homework. It is required to print pictures for reports and type reports during vacations. The computer also facilitates the online retrieval of historical information or @CAPS2 books, thereby aiding in the completion of homework or projects. The third reason is information acquisition about @LOCATION1. One can discover the age of @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the height of @ORGANIZATION1, or learn how to spell complex words. One can also determine the number of hallways leading to @LOCATION1, @CAPS5 beach, or other destinations. Additionally, one can find out the location of the wall of @LOCATION3. In conclusion, if one has a penchant for learning about @LOCATION1, communicating online, and engaging in other activities, a computer is a worthy investment.
1653	1657	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am convinced that a substantial number of individuals utilize computers, and this trend is likely to intensify in the future. Computers have become an integral part of the business world and are heavily relied upon. People even require internet access on their cell phones to stay abreast of stock market fluctuations, shipment details, and important emails. Some computers are designed for domestic use, serving as a means to connect with family members and access information that is either urgently needed or difficult to obtain elsewhere. Computers are continuously evolving, becoming faster and more efficient with each passing day, and are unlikely to become obsolete. However, this does not imply that they will permanently impede individuals from engaging in other activities. It is true that some individuals spend an inordinate amount of time on computers, but this is not the case for everyone. Some people work from home using computers and have no alternative but to be online as it is an integral part of their job. I earnestly urge you to consider the reasons behind the widespread use of computers and recognize that they are intended to assist, rather than harm, people. Computers are highly effective in simplifying tasks and are invaluable sources of information. I firmly support the use of computers and vehemently refute the notion that they have a negative impact on human life. Computers enable individuals to perform tasks that would otherwise be arduous or time - consuming. For instance, one would not typically consult multiple books to find specific information, as it is more convenient to compare and contrast data on a computer. In essence, computers save us a significant amount of time. Once again, I assert that ""computers enhance our lives, rather than detract from them."
1654	1658	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a deleterious impact on contemporary society. This conviction stems from the fact that computers contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, as the majority of people prefer to stay at home and use their computers rather than engage in outdoor activities. Moreover, I believe that communicating through computers restricts individuals from expressing emotions effectively. People should interact face - to - face rather than relying on a machine for communication. Finally, if people were to reduce their computer usage, the obesity rate in the country could potentially decline. If everyone were to take a break from technology and spend more time outdoors, it would have a positive impact on public health. Every day, people spend hours on end using their computers, sometimes multiple times a day. There are numerous online platforms available, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and ooVoo. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people claim that they ""need"" to check these platforms daily, but this is not a genuine necessity. What they truly need to do is reduce their computer usage and venture outside. Furthermore, people around the world rely on computers for communication. ""@CAPS3 is the easiest way,"" says @PERSON1, who admits to chatting with friends online constantly. While it may be the most convenient method, it is also the most impersonal. Do we really want to communicate like robots, devoid of emotion? Computers do not provide an opportunity for emotional expression, which is why people should go out, socialize, and perhaps even make phone calls. At least making a phone call requires one to get up and move. Finally, @CAPS4 is one of the most obese regions globally. People spend their days sitting in front of computers, eating, and remaining completely immobile, leading to weight gain. Do we really want our country to be known as the ""fat country""? I think not. People should limit their computer usage to an hour or less, if possible. In summary, I am convinced that computers have a negative impact on people worldwide. They lead to a sedentary lifestyle, impersonal communication, and obesity. Therefore, I encourage you to join me in promoting outdoor activities and increasing physical activity levels. It seems like a noble cause, doesn't it?"
1655	1659	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am here to expound on my perspective regarding computers, including their benefits to individuals and the concerns raised about excessive usage by both children and adults. My initial observation on this topic is that computers are advancing at an unprecedented pace. Over the past few years, computer companies have made remarkable progress, enabling users to accomplish virtually everything. This development has both positive and negative implications. A computer is an invaluable tool that is a welcome addition to any household. It is particularly advantageous for small business owners, as they can effortlessly update their stores online. For example, they can design vibrant posters to adorn store windows, thereby enhancing business and attracting customers. Additionally, one can book flights weeks or even months in advance, which is extremely convenient for busy travelers. One can access a website called @ORGANIZATION2, which allows users to explore any location worldwide and zoom in on landmarks such as the great @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2 or the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in @LOCATION1. Computers can also enhance hand - eye coordination during typing. Typing is a crucial skill to master, as proficient typists can complete tasks more efficiently than those who rely on paper. Some individuals can even type without looking at the keyboard. Computers are also excellent for communication. If one has relatives living in another state or country, they can easily communicate with them through @CAPS4, an online service that enables face - to - face conversations. These are just a few of the many benefits of owning a computer. On the other hand, many people argue that individuals are spending too much time on computers, resulting in a lack of physical activity and reduced family time. I concur with this view to some extent. I know several friends who spend an average of six hours a day on computers, which I believe is excessive. Additionally, parents often become so engrossed in work on their computers that they neglect to spend quality time with their children. Some children become so addicted to computers that they may develop health problems, such as obesity, due to excessive sitting. This is a concerning issue that needs to be addressed. I hope this discussion has provided you with a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of computers. It is important to use computers in moderation, as they can be a valuable asset when used appropriately.
1656	1660	1	1	Hello everyone, I have ascertained that numerous individuals are essentially asserting that computers are detrimental. They claim that people are expending an excessive amount of time on computers and insufficient time outdoors or with their families. However, I am writing to you today to expound upon the true greatness of computers. Firstly, computers contribute significantly to technological advancement. People can now accomplish tasks that were previously unattainable. For instance, they can engage in conversations with individuals across the ocean without incurring charges for [@CAPS1] or even being physically present. They can also search for methods to rapidly burn fat and explore diet programs, as well as upload photos to share with family and friends. The capabilities of computers are truly extensive. Computers have empowered countless individuals to achieve a multitude of feats, mostly beneficial ones. Secondly, computers have enabled us to accomplish tasks that would otherwise have remained unfulfilled. Consider the achievements of reaching the moon, the invention of cellphones, and the assistance in curing certain diseases through the use of computers. While computers may pose a slight risk to those who are perhaps unfamiliar with their proper usage, this issue can be resolved in the coming years. We are making remarkable progress in various aspects, and it is truly astonishing. I could continue enumerating the numerous benefits that computers offer, but there are insufficient pages to do so. Lastly, conducting research is far more efficient and expeditious with the aid of computers. In my school, we utilize computers for educational purposes, and they have proven to be extremely helpful. Personally, I have acquired a wealth of knowledge from computers. I even employ them to enhance my mathematical skills for the [@ORGANIZATION1]. We are in dire need of computers. (I, at the very least, do.) I am even commencing to learn another language with their assistance. It is unfounded to assume that all computer users are overweight, lazy, and neglect spending time with their families and friends. Therefore, I implore you to cease this baseless nonsense. I firmly believe that excessive computer usage should not be your primary concern at present. That concludes my statement. Goodbye.
1657	1661	1	1	I recall a time when computers were not as prevalent. Back then, I had to pen my essays and listen to music on the radio. Presently, computers have gained widespread popularity. I am of the opinion that computers exert a positive influence on people as of [@DATE1]. This is because students require them for academic pursuits, they can be utilized for various other purposes, and they are easily accessible. You will come to recognize the benefits that computers bring to our society. The majority of students utilize computers to type college essays, projects, and the like. This is advantageous as it simplifies the process. For example, as a student with limited drawing skills, I printed some pictures from the computer to paste on my poster board. In other words, computers are invaluable tools for students. I am aware that [@NUM1] out of [@NUM2] colleges expect students to submit their assignments via computers; otherwise, they will receive a failing grade. In today's society, there is no room for failure because students are still paying for their courses, regardless of whether they are passing or failing. Essentially, it is a waste of money. Therefore, computers can prevent us from failing. Nowadays, people use computers for entertainment purposes. They often engage in messaging on social networks such as MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and others. It is quite fascinating that through these platforms, one can reconnect with friends whom they have not seen in years. As you can observe, the internet offers numerous advantages as it allows you to discover what your friends are up to. Another benefit of computers is that you can find products and services at a lower cost compared to traditional methods. For instance, if you plan to take a trip and call [@ORGANIZATION1] to purchase a ticket, the price may be relatively high. However, by visiting the [@ORGANIZATION1] website on your computer, you are likely to find the same ticket to Florida at a significantly reduced price, potentially saving you a couple of hundred dollars. Given the current economic recession, these savings can be crucial. Computers are ubiquitous. You can find them at school, home, cafes, or even on your cell phone. This is highly convenient as you can use them at your own leisure. At home, when my laptop is available, I can spend hours playing games on it. I also remember a time when my computer malfunctioned, and I desperately wanted to use one. I realized that I could visit the library and use their computers for free. I was overjoyed at this discovery. In summary, computers have a positive impact on people. I genuinely cannot fathom what I would do without a computer, considering the essential role they play in students' lives, the diverse activities they enable, and their easy accessibility. In this era, everyone is constantly on the move, and computers...
1658	1662	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, computers are exerting an increasingly significant influence on society, yet not necessarily in a beneficial manner. A young boy named [@PERSON1] began to experience numerous health problems after purchasing a computer. The computer that he believed would assist him turned out to be of no help whatsoever. His health issues gradually worsened. He soon started to become breathless more frequently, developed high blood pressure, and began to gain weight. Since acquiring the computer, he has significantly reduced his physical activity and the time he spends with his family and friends, instead immersing himself in the virtual world of the internet. In my opinion, computers are not as helpful as they are often perceived to be. They merely waste our time, impede our education, and can have a detrimental impact on our health. As you are already aware, computers can offer a multitude of benefits. However, there are certain aspects that are often overlooked. According to a health magazine, studies have shown that spending two to three hours on a computer can result in the loss of [@PERCENT1] of your brain cells. Once these cells are lost, there is no way to recover them. After conducting a survey on the streets to gauge public opinion regarding the impact of computers on people, [@PERSON2], a police officer at the local police department, shared his perspective. He stated, ""I enjoy using computers and browsing the internet, but more often than not, I start using the computer at [@TIME1] and find myself still engrossed in it until [@NUM1]. The internet can be a dangerous and unhealthy place. While computers can help us find the information we need and expose us to new experiences, much of the time spent online is ultimately a waste. Instead of spending hours on social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, or MySpace, we should venture outside and interact with our loved ones."" After interviewing [@PERSON3], one of the most prominent female rappers to date, she expressed her views on computers. She said, ""Computers are useful to a certain extent, but they can also be a significant waste of time. Instead of engaging in meaningless activities such as playing games online, we should focus on more productive tasks, such as studying for upcoming exams or completing our homework. This way, we can avoid the last-minute rush and ensure that we are making the most of our time."" In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly revolutionized our lives in many ways, it is essential to recognize their potential drawbacks and use them responsibly. We should strive to strike a balance between our online and offline lives, ensuring that we do not neglect our physical and mental well-being, as well as our relationships with others."
1659	1663	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, do you concur that individuals can spend excessive amounts of time on computers without taking a break? I, for one, do not share this view. Consider the numerous negative consequences that can arise from such behavior. These include spending less quality time with family members, developing an addiction, and compromising one's health. Those who immerse themselves in the virtual world of computers often forget about the presence of their loved ones. For instance, I vividly recall a childhood incident when I was so engrossed in playing on the computer that I completely forgot about the family members around me. As a result, I missed out on enjoyable activities such as visiting the mall or the park. Undoubtedly, computer games can be entertaining, but wouldn't it be more fulfilling to devote some attention to our families? Approximately [@PERCENT1] of individuals in other countries experience profound loneliness because their sole focus is on playing on computers, disregarding the company of others. Surely, you would not wish to be like these individuals, would you? I never anticipated that computer gaming could be so addictive. In many countries, a significant number of people find it impossible to go a single day without using a computer. Some reports suggest that a large proportion of those who spend the entire day, from dawn to dusk, on computers have suffered fatal consequences due to neglecting basic necessities such as eating, sleeping, and using the restroom. Imagine having your life cut short due to an addiction to computers. I remember when my friend warned me, ""Don't spend too much time on the computer; you might endanger your life."" At the time, I dismissed it as a joke. However, when you contemplate the idea of spending an entire day and night on the computer, it becomes evident that the risks are very real. Last but not least, some individuals fail to take proper care of their bodies while using computers. For example, they may become so absorbed in their online activities that they forget to eat, sleep, or engage in physical activity. This can lead to numbness in the legs and severe abdominal pain. Just imagine going without food, sleep, and exercise for a single day. You would not even consider subjecting yourself to such an experience. Now is the time to make a decision. Should people be allowed to spend the entire day and night on computers? We must also take into account the numerous negative consequences, such as spending less time with family, developing an addiction, and compromising one's health. Therefore, I urge you to rise up and make a choice."
1660	1664	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been utilizing my computer for an extended period. During my childhood, I did not own one, but I acquired a computer last year. There has been a prevalent view that computers are beneficial as they facilitate communication with friends and family, aid in learning about various subjects, and provide access to the latest news. I wholeheartedly concur with this perspective. However, some individuals harbor reservations about computers because they tend to spend more time using them than engaging in outdoor activities. Here are my thoughts on the matter. Firstly, computers serve as an excellent source for obtaining news. You can access a wider range of news and weather information more rapidly compared to traditional television broadcasts. If you wish to stay informed, simply visit a website that you trust for news updates. With just a click of the mouse, you can discover the current weather conditions, learn about significant events that may shock the world, and keep abreast of the latest celebrity gossip. Secondly, computers can function as virtual tutors. Whether you are struggling with your homework or seeking to expand your knowledge on a particular topic, the computer is your go-to resource. By conducting a simple search on a search engine, you can obtain the answers you need. Although this may not seem particularly significant, it can be invaluable when you are eager to learn. Lastly, computers have revolutionized global communication. Through social media platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, and AIM, you can connect with family and friends, regardless of their geographical location. You may wonder, ""Isn't that what a phone is for?"" Well, the advantage of these online platforms is that they are free of charge. Additionally, there is Skype, which allows you to have face-to-face conversations with the people you are communicating with. This is truly a remarkable feat of modern technology. Now that you are aware of the numerous benefits that computers offer, you may be thinking, ""People spend too much time on computers, don't they?"" This is where personal responsibility comes into play. It is entirely up to you to decide how much time you spend on the computer. You have the power to limit your usage to a reasonable amount, such as half an hour per day. Instead of being glued to the screen, why not step outside, enjoy the beauty of nature, and engage in some physical exercise? In conclusion, computers are powerful tools that can enhance our lives in many ways. However, it is essential to use them in moderation and maintain a healthy balance between our online and offline activities. By doing so, we can fully reap the benefits of technology while safeguarding our well-being."
1661	1665	1	1	Dear @LOCATION1 press, I have recently become aware of numerous arguments suggesting that computers are ruining society. I firmly dissent from this view. I contend that computers serve as an excellent means to reconnect with old friends. Moreover, conducting research on the internet is swifter than perusing a book, and the internet offers a plethora of games. I am convinced that the internet is an outstanding avenue for re - establishing contact with old friends. Some individuals have relocated, and I was previously unable to communicate with them. Now, thanks to the internet, I can converse with them once again. The same holds true for my mother. She had friends from high school and college with whom she had lost touch. Now, through Facebook, she has reunited with them. This is also advantageous as one can email someone instead of sending a letter via mail, which incurs costs, unlike email. Thus, the internet can also be a cost - saving tool. Additionally, sending an email is far more expeditious than posting a letter. The internet is an ideal way to maintain contact with friends and relatives. I also assert that using a computer for research is more efficient than visiting a library and searching through books. If one lacks the time to go to the library, research can be conducted at home. What if the library is closed when one visits? Then, time has been wasted. The internet is accessible 24/7. What if one goes to the library when it is open, but it does not have a book on the desired subject? This issue can be circumvented on the internet as it contains virtually everything one could possibly seek. If one has an overdue library book, it can be renewed on the internet. The internet is an excellent platform for researching any topic or engaging in any activity. Finally, the computer is suitable for playing almost any game one might wish to play. Instead of spending approximately @MONEY1 on an Xbox and a game, one only needs to spend about @MONEY2 on a game that can be used on a computer. There are also numerous websites that host games. Some websites are dedicated to specific games, while others offer a wide variety of games. Only a few of these games allow interaction with other players, enabling users to communicate and make new friends. Conversely, many games are single - player. Consequently, a computer is highly useful for gaming. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the computer is an indispensable asset to our society. In the long term, it will yield benefits, especially considering the economic challenges our country currently faces, by helping us save money. It will also facilitate connections with old friends, save time, and provide entertainment for all.
1662	1666	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, which article title is more captivating: ""Local @CAPS1 wins three - mile race"" or ""Local @CAPS1 wins three - mile race on computer game""? Regrettably, if people continue to rely heavily on computers, the less engaging title will become the norm for your news. Computers exert several adverse effects on people, including promoting cheating, reducing the time spent with family and friends, and, most significantly, failing to contribute to learning as users often merely play games. As is evident, I firmly believe that computers are a poor choice. I suspect that some individuals have never considered that computers can lead children, and perhaps even adults, to engage in cheating. There are websites on the internet where users simply input a question and receive an answer. Another form of cheating involves copying others' work, such as essays or articles, from a website. Some students assigned to write a biography of a person could simply copy an article, make minor word substitutions, and present it as their own without remorse. Moreover, computers cause people to spend less time with family and friends. I was once watching television and using the computer. The husband in the show was so engrossed in the computer that he rarely interacted with his wife. This realization made me aware that computers can contribute to anti - social behavior and an increase in divorce rates among parents. Do we truly consider looking up facts on the computer as learning? I know that when I have free time on the computer, I am not using it to acquire knowledge. Nowadays, most people are not overly concerned about learning about other countries or individuals outside their immediate circle. It is quite apparent that few people use computers for educational purposes; otherwise, game websites would not have such a large user base. In conclusion, computers have negative impacts that affect everyone. So, @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your news to focus on the latest divorces and computer game high scores? Or do you prefer to publish interesting news that will ensure the longevity of your newspaper? Thank you for taking the time to read this."
1663	1667	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; technology generally appears to have a beneficial impact on people. However, could it potentially be detrimental? The computer is one of the most frequently used devices by @CAPS2, yet I believe we spend an excessive amount of time on it. My reasons are as follows: both children and adults devote too much time to computers, which hinders their ability to interact with friends and family and prevents them from appreciating nature. Please do not misunderstand me; it is indeed pleasant to meet new people online and learn about different places. However, when will one get the necessary exercise if they spend @NUM1 hours on the computer? Sometimes, one becomes so fixated on the screen that they are unable to get up. Regarding food, people often sit and consume junk food while using the computer. It is impossible to maintain a healthy diet if one eats chips and candy for hours on end. Instead of being fixated on the computer screen, one can experience the blinding sunlight while riding a bike outdoors. Cycling is an excellent way to stay fit, rather than simply typing and clicking on a @CAPS3. Another effective way to get fit, instead of sitting idle, is to go for a run. Children require approximately @NUM2 minutes of cardiovascular exercise, so why not use their legs for running instead of for the latest computer download? Running engages both the arms and the legs. My second reason for the negative consequences of excessive computer use is that it leaves insufficient time for friends and family. Will children simply sit in front of the computer all day while their family is having fun? Moreover, what will happen to the chores? Dishes will remain dirty, and rooms will be in disarray. Most importantly, won't one miss their friends? At this stage of life, children and teenagers should be socializing with friends in person, not gossiping online. No one will invite someone to an event if they know that person will be glued to the computer. Lastly, my final and simplest reason is to enjoy nature. Instead of remaining indoors, one should explore the outdoors. It is beneficial to go outside occasionally and breathe in fresh air. If one has not visited the park in a while, it would be a wonderful experience. One can listen to the birds chirping and witness the blooming of trees and flowers. Then, take a leisurely walk or stroll in the park. This way, one can get exercise and explore nature simultaneously. While at it, one can plant some flowers in the garden. This demonstrates that instead of purchasing games online, one can invest in seeds to contribute to environmental conservation. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not inherently bad, but one should avoid spending excessive hours on it. Both children and adults should take these considerations into account. Therefore, try to get exercise, spend time with friends and family, and enjoy nature.
1664	1668	1	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, it has come to my attention that the topic of computers and their influence on people has been raised. I personally believe that computers are an extraordinary tool that can propel mankind forward. They offer boundless knowledge, entertainment, and, contrary to what the opposing view suggests, can foster social interactions for those who are reluctant to meet face - to - face. My first reason for advocating the benefits of computers is the wealth of knowledge they provide. Computers grant access to the internet, which stores an almost infinite amount of information. With a simple click of a button, one can access thousands of websites dedicated to answering queries. They can provide a vast amount of information that is often difficult to obtain otherwise. Consider two students, one with a computer and the other without. Both are assigned to write a report on a famous person. The student with the computer logs on, conducts a search, and within seconds, has amassed enough information to write multiple reports. This student excels in the reports, continues to utilize this efficient method, graduates at the top of the class, progresses through college, and secures a high - paying job immediately after graduation. In contrast, the student without a computer must visit the library. After spending an hour walking there, he discovers that all the books on the subject are checked out. He manages to find a book with only a brief mention of the person and writes a report based on that limited information. He fails the test, repeats the grade, drops out of school, and spends his entire life working at a @ORGANIZATION1. This example clearly illustrates the significant difference a computer can make. My second reason is that, although computers are often perceived as detrimental to social life, they can actually enhance it. Millions of people use the internet daily, and there are numerous online platforms designed for communication. Some people worry that this may lead to privacy issues, but anyone with basic common sense knows not to disclose sensitive information. The internet also offers various resources, and those who are still cautious can use specialized sites to communicate with people they know in real life. The internet also allows people to pose questions. If one is having difficulty finding specific information, they can simply post a question on a public site, and people with firsthand experience will provide detailed answers. For instance, if someone wishes to become a writer but needs to know about the writing industry, such as how the system works, how to secure a job, and what the pay is, they can search the internet. If they only find job applications and college advertisements, they can post their questions on a public site. Someone who has been a writer for their entire life may come across the question and provide a comprehensive answer. Thus, the internet can solve problems and assist individuals. My final reason is the entertainment that computers offer. One can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even chat with friends. Computers provide access to thousands of free services. When sitting in one's room feeling bored, one can play a game on the computer. If one is tired of watching @CAPS4.V movies, they can access an infinite video library on the computer. When feeling lonely, one can visit a social website and start a conversation. Computers offer endless entertainment options at one's fingertips. In conclusion, I firmly believe that there are no limits to what one can achieve with a computer, as long as they possess imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not to cause harm, and they are fulfilling this purpose admirably.
1665	1669	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, advancements in computer technology have had a profoundly positive impact on the society in which we live today. Computers cultivate hand - eye coordination, facilitate children's learning both within and outside the school environment, and foster global social connections. These remarkable devices have not caused any harm to the new generation; in fact, they have had the opposite effect. Computers are an outstanding medium for teaching hand - eye coordination. Some individuals who oppose the use of computers contend that they merely make children lazy and ignorant. This is a fallacy. The coordination skills acquired through playing mouse - based games can be effectively transferred to sports such as baseball and lacrosse. In these sports, players must visually track an incoming ball and precisely guide their stick or mitt to catch it. Evidently, coordination is indispensable in sports and is also essential for mundane daily tasks at home. These tasks can be as simple as taking out the trash or cooking a meal. We often overlook the fact that even these seemingly straightforward tasks demand a certain level of coordination. A misplaced pot could result in boiling water spilling on the floor, creating a significant mess. We are fortunate to live in a world where computers serve as excellent instructors of hand - eye coordination. Computers are the world's most erudite teachers. No matter how hard one tries, using a computer will inevitably lead to learning. The internet is an unparalleled repository of information. In the contemporary era, environmental concerns are on the rise. Paper is produced from trees, which need to be felled for its production. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, yet only seconds to cut it down. Schools everywhere should transition from using paper and pencils to utilizing computers and keyboards for academic work. Since most students are already familiar with computers, they are more likely to enjoy working with them than writing by hand. An average student can acquire more knowledge in an hour using a computer than in an entire day at school. This transition is imperative. Computers also function as a vast social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 have now become the primary means of communication. If it were not for computers, I would not be able to communicate with my friend who moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are beneficial. They enable people to maintain connections with old friends and colleagues. All major corporations rely on computers for investment, product sales, and information storage. Computers are the ultimate medium for communication. Clearly, computers are growing in popularity at an exponential rate. @LOCATION1 should capitalize on this trend. Imagine a more environmentally friendly country where we no longer need to deforest millions of acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest each year. The benefits of computers are truly endless. Three of these key benefits are the development of hand - eye coordination, the acquisition of knowledge, and enhanced communication.
1666	1670	1	1	Do you possess an affinity for exploring distant, exotic lands and their unique fauna? Are you proficient in sports but aspire to elevate your skills further? Do you ever experience a pang of longing for your relatives residing in other states? The computer can serve as a valuable aid in all these pursuits, yet one must also question whether it might have adverse effects. In my estimation, both children and adults should utilize the computer. When individuals engage with the computer, they can delve into the allure of far - flung regions. While on the computer, one can conduct in - depth research on natural disasters. For instance, people can search for information on earthquakes and gain comprehensive knowledge about those who have tragically lost their lives. Subsequently, they may choose to contribute financially to assist the underprivileged, including children living independently. Moreover, they can discover the plethora of enchanting lands awaiting exploration. Everyone I know appreciates the beauty of magnificent birds and animals. With the computer, they can fulfill this interest. There might be even more such captivating places. Owning a computer also enables communication with individuals who are not easily accessible. Through the computer, people can converse with their family members residing in other states. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1. I rarely get to see him because of the high cost of travel. However, on the computer, it is effortless to send him a message updating him on my well - being. With a computer, you can communicate with friends with whom phone conversations are not feasible. For example, if your friend cannot talk on the phone, the computer can bridge this gap. The final reason for computer usage is that if you use it for @MONTH1 intervals, it can enhance hand - eye coordination. This is particularly beneficial for children who play baseball. They will be more aware of the ball's position at all times and are more likely to catch it. Thus,适度 playing video games is not detrimental unless overdone. Using the computer is indeed a valuable option, as it facilitates interaction with people who are otherwise difficult to reach. So, if you are completely opposed to using the computer, reconsider and start using it right away.
1667	1671	1	1	"As an increasing amount of technology is being developed, people are relying on computers for work and learning. However, spending excessive time on the computer is not necessarily advantageous. People tend to engage in insufficient physical activity, subject their eyes to strain, and have limited interaction with real individuals. One of the reasons computers are having a negative impact on people is that they no longer engage in adequate exercise. Consider my acquaintance @CAPS1. He was an accomplished triathlete who trained daily to participate in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 - @CAPS4 event in @LOCATION1 next @DATE1. However, after acquiring a computer, @CAPS1 suddenly lost interest in exercise and spent his entire day checking emails instead of training. Nevertheless, he is not the only one who has become unhealthy due to computer usage. Experts assert that individuals with home computers engage in only @PERCENT1 of the physical activity of those without computers. In a study conducted at @ORGANIZATION1, it was found that individuals with computers were more likely to be overweight and preferred junk food like chips over healthy options such as apples. @PERSON1, who led this study, stated, ""Society teaches people that computers can perform remarkable feats and provide education. However, they are not informed about the potential harm to their health when computers are overused."" Evidently, computers pose a threat to our health. Another reason computers are problematic is that they cause eye strain. When disabled individuals visited my school to speak with us on @DATE1, there was a blind woman named @PERSON5 who lost her sight because she was a workaholic and spent excessive time on her laptop. However, she is not the sole person to have suffered vision loss due to computer usage. Scientists at the @CAPS7 lab in @LOCATION2 reported that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 regular computer users lost their vision within two years. One of these scientists, @PERSON3, remarked, ""As more people start using computers, a greater number of individuals are seriously damaging their eyes or even losing their vision. We estimate that @PERCENT2 of the next generation will be legally blind before the age of @NUM3."" Clearly, this new technology is harmful to our vision. A third reason people should limit computer usage is that it reduces interaction with real people. My uncle, @PERSON4, resides in @LOCATION3. We used to meet occasionally and talk on the phone about once a week. However, after he discovered chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet, I have neither seen nor spoken to him in almost a @DATE1 because he has created a virtual family on the computer and spends his entire day pretending to be a @CAPS10 and fighting dragons in the online game @CAPS10 @CAPS11. However, he is not the only person facing this issue. It has been proven that @PERCENT3 of individuals who engage in online games or chat rooms lose interest in their friends and family, and their social skills deteriorate. Professor @PERSON2, commenting on this phenomenon, said, ""Society has taught people that computers can offer wonderful opportunities and education. However, they are not taught about the negative impact on social interaction when computers are overused."" Given the detrimental effects of computers on health, vision, and social interaction, why would anyone continue to overuse them? Computers bring more harm than good to humanity. They lead to a sedentary lifestyle, cause vision problems, and deprive people of meaningful social interaction. Is this the future we desire for ourselves and the coming generations?"
1668	1672	1	1	In contemporary times, computers have gained widespread popularity. A multitude of individuals utilize computers for various purposes, including research, professional tasks, shopping, academic assignments, and more. Although some individuals contend that computers consume an excessive amount of our time and impede social interaction with friends and family, there are numerous benefits to computer usage. One of the remarkable aspects of computers is the ability to engage in online conversations or video chats with friends and family, effectively bridging geographical distances. Thus, using a computer does not necessarily mean avoiding personal connections. Another advantage of computers is their vast research capabilities. Whether for projects, work, schoolwork, or general knowledge acquisition, computers provide access to a wealth of information. The top - rated websites for research, such as @CAPS1.com, @LOCATION1, etc., offer a comprehensive range of resources. Additionally, computers are highly efficient for tasks such as typing reports and creating presentations for professional and academic projects. Virtually any information one can conceive of can be found on a computer. As is evident, computers are invaluable tools and excellent sources of information. Owning a computer at home is far more convenient than making frequent trips to the public library. It not only saves time and money but also provides a personalized library. With the rapid advancement of technology, one never knows what new and exciting features computers may offer in the future.
1669	1673	1	1	It is widely acknowledged that using computers is a prudent choice as it allows individuals to encounter unfamiliar people and expand their knowledge base. Moreover, it provides an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of technology. Most individuals would concur that meeting new people is beneficial, as it offers the chance to engage in enjoyable conversations and learn about diverse individuals. Additionally, people often express a desire to explore different cultures. Some individuals may seek to acquire personal or business - related information about others, and many are curious about people's origins. In essence, the allure of computer - facilitated social interaction lies in the potential for new discoveries and connections.
1670	1674	1	1	"Dear members of the @ORGANIZATION1, quoting @PERSON2, ""Computers have significantly advanced my research. I can access a vast amount of information to aid my patients and organize all relevant data efficiently."" Should one question the judgment of a leading doctor? I concur with @PERSON3 and firmly believe that computers are a valuable asset in today's society. People were already succumbing to a sedentary lifestyle due to television, so it is unjust to attribute this solely to computers. Through websites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, individuals can maintain regular contact. They can plan activities such as park walks or dance sessions, which contribute to a healthy and active lifestyle. Computers serve as a means to keep people connected. ""@CAPS6 patients can email me to schedule appointments and inform me if they suspect a serious health issue,"" says @PERSON1. With computers, one can quickly reach out to distant family and friends during times of crisis. Unlike phone calls, which may go unanswered during difficult periods, emails ensure that important information is conveyed. Moreover, there is no need to worry about escalating phone bills. Instead of consuming hours of phone time, one can simply engage in a @CAPS4 chat with a friend. The ability to access information rapidly is another advantage of computers. How would you feel if you learned about the death of a loved one through a newspaper rather than a timely notification? It would undoubtedly cause great distress. I know I would be deeply affected. With email, you and your family can stay connected with old, new, and emerging friends. In the event of an unfortunate incident, if someone is unable to convey the news in person, they can easily send an email. It is far less painful than breaking the news over the phone. So, do you now recognize the significant benefits of computers in today's society? Blaming computers for people's laziness is unfair, as television was already contributing to this issue. If an individual chooses to be idle, it is their personal decision. One should not unjustly attribute blame to others or external factors. Computers offer an excellent means of communication and a vast source of knowledge. They enable us to stay informed about not only our loved ones but also the world at large. Thank you for taking the time to read this essay, and I hope you can appreciate the positive impact of computers."
1671	1675	1	1	"One evening, upon my return from school, I was oblivious to my homework assignments. I resolved to call my friend on her cell phone; however, I was directed to her voicemail. After leaving a message, I dialed her landline, only to encounter the same outcome. Fortunately, I possessed the contact information of my other friends. The subsequent day, I inquired as to why she hadn't answered either phone. She apologized, stating, ""I suppose I was preoccupied with emailing others on the computer."" Whenever I contemplate individuals spending excessive time on the computer, I believe they neglect physical exercise, fail to appreciate nature, and reduce the time spent with family and friends. Firstly, when people devote an inordinate amount of time to the computer, they allocate less time to exercise. Approximately @PERCENT1 of individuals exhibit this behavior, which is detrimental to their health. If people engage in this habit too frequently, they will not receive adequate exercise, and without it, they will not maintain good health as they age. As @CAPS3 @PERSON1 remarked, ""@CAPS2 when adults spend excessive time on the computer, perhaps @NUM1 hours a day or more while consuming junk food such as chips and soda, they set a poor example for their children. If adults develop this不良习惯, their children are likely to follow suit, and it is far too early for children to be in poor health."" I concur with @CAPS3 @PERSON1; she is correct about the excessive time people spend on the computer. Secondly, when people are engrossed in their computers, it is as if their faces are affixed to the screen, and they show no concern for nature. When people behave in this manner, it is truly intolerable. It appears as though they care about nothing else. What I fail to comprehend is why they cannot venture outside and engage in an activity for at least half an hour before returning to the computer to squander their time. Spending time outdoors and appreciating nature is serene on a pleasant sunny day. One could have a picnic, embark on a hike, or simply socialize with friends instead of playing on the computer. I understand that on unfavorable days, such as when it is snowing or there is a thunderstorm and outdoor activities are not feasible, one may turn to the computer. I believe that at least @PERCENT2 of people would attempt this. Thirdly, if people are overly occupied with the computer, they will be unable to spend time with friends or family. If your friends wish to hang out and go to the mall, but you are unable to accompany them because you are on the computer, they will be extremely angry with you. You have chosen the computer over your friends to go to the mall. There is likely a @PERCENT1 chance that they will never speak to you again, and I do not blame them. People who spend excessive time on the computer often have difficulty understanding what is happening around them. When someone tells them something, it goes in one ear and out the other. When people behave in this way, it is truly disappointing because they do not spend as much time with their friends and family. As can be seen, people are spending too much time on the computer at the expense of exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. If you were to ask me, I do not spend as much time on the computer, which is a positive thing."
1672	1676	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I am delighted to learn that you are engaging in a debate regarding the impact of computers on human society. I would like to share my perspective on this matter if that is acceptable to you. In this letter, I intend to discuss the negative aspects of computers and why they are not beneficial to society. In my opinion, computers are not conducive to society because individuals engage in less physical activity than they used to. I can attest to this fact as I used to be an active person, but after the emergence of computer games, I spent @NUM1 hours a day playing them. Consequently, I had no time to spend with my family, and I became isolated from the outside world. It was as if the computer had taken over my life. Additionally, I know many people who share the same sentiment. The computer can be likened to an addiction. I say this because once you power it on, it becomes difficult to disengage. Social media platforms are designed to be addictive, with the inclusion of games to prevent users from logging off quickly. There are also numerous websites that feature entertaining videos. Once you discover one, you are likely to become engrossed and lose track of time. While I acknowledge that computers allow us to connect with family members who are far away, they also prevent us from enjoying outdoor activities and appreciating nature. I do not advocate for the complete elimination of computers, but I believe we should reduce our usage. I understand that some people may be offended by my views, but as a society, we have become overly reliant on computers. Computers are ubiquitous, and it is difficult to imagine life without them. I leave you with this question: would you choose computers or a fulfilling life?
1673	1677	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, the prevalence of advanced computers has significantly increased. As a result, children are rarely seen outdoors. On the news, we often hear about the rising rates of obesity and crime. These trends indicate that computers have a negative impact on society. Consider your neighborhood. Do you notice a lack of children playing outside? It is not because they are deceased; rather, they are spending excessive time indoors on their computers. I know a thirteen-year-old named @ORGANIZATION1 who admits that she prefers being on the computer to socializing with friends outdoors. Meeting people online, especially for minors, poses a significant risk. You cannot be certain of the true identity of the person you are interacting with. Eventually, excessive computer use may lead to social isolation, as you may find yourself excluded from real-life social interactions. For instance, @PERSON3's family no longer recognizes her due to her excessive computer usage. Do you want your child to experience the same fate? Spending excessive time on the computer is comparable to frequenting fast-food restaurants. Instead of engaging in physical activity, individuals are sedentary, consuming junk food while glued to the screen. I have encountered an obese child, @PERSON2, who weighs three hundred pounds at the age of fourteen. As an eighth grader, his weight is truly alarming. He confesses that he spends hours with his laptop on his lap, surrounded by junk food, without taking breaks for exercise. His academic performance has also suffered significantly. He was once an A @CAPS3 student, but now his grades have plummeted. @PERSON2 disregards his mother's advice and locks himself in his room, immediately turning to his laptop and indulging in junk food. It is no wonder that childhood obesity rates are on the rise. In the past, concerns centered around employment, but now, the focus has shifted to online socializing. Platforms such as Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter have contributed to the increase in crime rates. The individuals behind online profiles may not be who they claim to be, and minors are particularly vulnerable to deception. They may lie about their age, making them easy targets for predators. This is one way in which sex offenders operate, using false identities to lure young girls and boys into dangerous situations. These innocent victims may be kidnapped, raped, or even killed. Computers provide criminals with countless opportunities to commit crimes. Do you want your child to be the next victim? In conclusion, computers are being misused by the wrong people, leading to a sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and an increased risk of abduction among children. It is crucial to take action and limit your child's computer usage. Plan a family vacation to a fun destination and ensure that your children do not fall prey to the dangers of the online world. Act now to protect your children and promote a healthy lifestyle.
1674	1678	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2: The influence of computers on individuals is adverse, primarily due to excessive addiction, the inherent risks associated with online platforms, and the fact that the human brain surpasses the computer in certain aspects. Firstly, computers have become highly addictive. While they offer the advantage of internet access, users often become overly reliant on them. For example, YouTube is a popular website that attracts approximately @NUM1 users, many of whom struggle to disengage. These individuals neglect physical activity, choosing instead to sit in front of the screen for extended periods, which can have a detrimental impact on their eyesight. It is essential for people to develop the self-discipline to limit their computer usage. Secondly, the internet can be a hazardous environment. Some individuals in @LOCATION1 disclose their @CAPS3 to strangers online. Alarmingly, nearly @PERCENT2 of teenagers are at risk of abduction due to sharing personal information with unknown individuals, and @PERCENT3 of these cases remain unresolved. Additionally, the internet is a breeding ground for cyberbullying, which involves the harassment of children and teenagers online. When children under or over the age of @NUM2 experience cyberbullying, they may suffer from depression but often hesitate to confide in their parents. Six months ago, at my former @CAPS4, a volunteer shared his harrowing experience of cyberbullying, which led to severe depression and ultimately suicide. This tragic incident highlights the potential dangers of the online world. Finally, the human brain is more intelligent than the computer. People should rely more on their cognitive abilities rather than depending solely on computers. Approximately @PERCENT1 of individuals utilize their brains more frequently and have achieved success in life. The brain can be compared to a computer as it has the capacity to store information securely, without the risk of being hacked. In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on people due to addiction, the risks associated with the online environment, and the superiority of the human brain. It is crucial to strike a balance and use computers responsibly to avoid these detrimental effects.
1675	1679	1	1	Dear society, do you not all possess some form of computer, whether at home or at work? Have you ever considered the consequences if your computer were suddenly taken away? How would you carry out your daily tasks? These are all crucial questions that merit serious consideration. In today's era, computers have become indispensable tools that assist us in various aspects of our lives. Firstly, they enhance hand - eye coordination. Secondly, they enable us to acquire knowledge and communicate with individuals in distant locations. Lastly, they facilitate rapid communication through email and @CAPS2. If experts were to remove our computers, one must ponder the potential ramifications. Approximately @PERCENT1 of Americans own a computer or a cellphone with internet access. These individuals have developed good hand - eye coordination through frequent technology use and are capable of multitasking at work. Moreover, modern computers have become an absolute necessity. For students, writing papers and reports would be extremely challenging without the aid of computers. Imagine a world without the digital resources and tools that computers provide. Consider popular websites such as Facebook, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4, which offer chat functions for people to interact. If these platforms were eliminated, our means of communication would be severely limited. We would be left with only the telephone, but what if we don't know someone's cellphone number? And without a computer, accessing information and staying connected would become arduous. Although computers may reduce face - to - face communication to some extent, they are a common and necessary part of our lives. We often need to ask a quick question, and using a cellphone or making a call is not as efficient as communicating via @CAPS2. Do you really want to be the one to take away this valuable tool? Think carefully about your actions. Consider the implications of this letter. Computers play a vital role in our daily lives, from education to work and even for entertainment. They help develop hand - eye coordination, allow us to learn about different people and places, and enable seamless communication. So, go ahead and try to take them away, but be prepared to witness the significant changes that will occur.
1676	1680	1	1	I believe that we are all spending an excessive amount of time on computers because all of my friends are constantly on them. I opine that people should become more active and visit diverse locations in the world, such as the pool, the forest, the lakes, etc. I think that they should implement a program that encourages people to go to places and forget about computers. For me, computers are beneficial, but one cannot spend a great deal of time on them. Instead, try to spend more time outdoors and with your family or friends. Moreover, the issue is not solely related to computers but also to a significant amount of technology, like video games such as Xbox - @NUM1 - @NUM2 - Game Boy - Xbox @NUM3 and others. You should play them @NUM4 a week, approximately @NUM5 hour, because there are numerous activities that you and your family can engage in outdoors. I would take a stroll around the park or ride bicycles with your friends around town and have a picnic in the park when @CAPS1 is warm and pleasant outside. Considering that the @DATE1 is approaching, you can go and do a multitude of things. Even if you do not have money, you can go to the park or the beach and spend the entire day there. What my family does when the weather is nice outside is check the forecast and see if @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is favorable. If it is, we will wake up early, go to the store, and purchase hamburgers, soda, plates, and other items that we will use there. Then, we will go to a lake or a pool and spend the day playing and eating. In my opinion, people should spend more time outdoors with their friends and family. I want people to be aware that there is a world outside and not become overly addicted to the technological world. That is my stance. I do not know if you like @CAPS2, but I think you should give it a try. If you do not like @CAPS2, find an alternative that will assist you. I am writing this because I want people to know that there are numerous places yet to be discovered. So, go out there and enjoy life because it only comes once. Spend @CAPS2 with happy and good times, not crying and sad, as if this were your last day on this planet.
1677	1681	1	1	Dear, @CAPS1 town. As you are aware, computers have become an integral part of our lives, but the question remains: are their impacts positive or negative? Computers can be highly advantageous as they can expose you to different regions of the world and provide up - to - the - minute news. They can also influence your next vacation plans and facilitate communication with family and friends. One might wonder what our lives would be like without them. Well, life without computers could present challenges. However, computers do have their drawbacks. For instance, they often require a substantial financial investment and frequently need to be repaired. People may become overly reliant on computers and neglect physical exercise, which can lead to obesity. Additionally, excessive computer use can result in a significant waste of energy. Another concerning aspect of the internet is chat rooms. Engaging in conversations with the wrong individuals in these chat rooms can land you in trouble. Overall, computers are a crucial component of our lives. They can help us plan our next @DATE1 break trip, but at the same time, their overuse can contribute to weight gain.
1678	1682	1	1	"Numerous individuals contend that computers are detrimental or that they cause us to spend less time outdoors. However, are computers as harmful to individuals as commonly claimed? In this regard, moderation can be highly beneficial. When one contemplates computers, what typically springs to mind? Is it games or social @CAPS1? What if computers offer more than just these? Last year, a computer played a pivotal role in diagnosing my concussion and also revealed that I had @NUM1 previous concussions. Remarkably, the computer performed this task more rapidly and efficiently than a human doctor. An expert has stated, ""Computers can diagnose a wide range of conditions, not just concussions, @PERCENT1 more effectively than doctors."" Moreover, social networking has a positive dimension. It has enabled people who have been separated for an extended period to reconnect and rekindle their friendships. Nevertheless, alongside these positive aspects, there are negative consequences. Computers have contributed to the rising issue of childhood obesity, which is a significant problem in the country. If we become overly sedentary due to computer use, it could potentially undermine the nation's well - being. Additionally, if we become overly dependent on computers for diagnoses, what would happen if they malfunction? These are very real problems that are not being adequately addressed. If we fail to confront these issues, computers may ultimately prove to be a detriment. In conclusion, moderation can be extremely beneficial. For example, instead of using social @CAPS1 to interact with neighbors, one should go outside and engage in activities like playing wiffle ball with them. Social @CAPS1 was designed for reconnecting with distant friends, not those in close proximity. Similarly, rather than relying solely on computers for medical diagnoses, a combination of computer assistance and doctor expertise should be employed. This approach will yield optimal results and ensure that doctors remain prepared in case computers malfunction. These examples illustrate how moderation can be advantageous for everyone. In summary, completely eschewing computers is not a viable option given their significant contributions to society. However, excessive reliance on them is also ill - advised as it may not offer substantial long - term benefits."
1679	1683	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1... scroll... @CAPS1. ""@CAPS2 Are you aware that only the male coqui is the one that sings?"" Certain facts can be readily found on the internet. Computers have simplified the research process. One can only imagine the inconvenience of having to lug home large volumes of books and constantly search for information within them. Firstly, computers enhance hand - eye coordination. Secondly, they allow us to explore far - off places. Lastly, they enable us to forge friendships with people from across the globe. When a ball goes out of bounds, the electronic device with a screen (computers) helps develop hand - eye coordination. It does so by requiring our eyes to focus on the screen while our hands operate the hard, smooth keyboard. Hand - eye coordination is essential for children participating in ball - playing sports such as baseball, basketball, soccer, and others. In high school, excelling in sports can lead to scholarships for college. College is of great significance as it plays a crucial role in shaping our future and can lead to well - paying jobs. Learning about distant locations like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, etc., is highly fascinating. However, learning through static images can be dull and uninteresting. The internet has rapidly and comprehensively integrated into our lives. It is far more time - efficient than visiting the library and retrieving materials. Additionally, skimming through paragraphs on a computer is a much simpler task."
1680	1684	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, in my personal view, computer technology is extremely detrimental, and we must take precautions regarding eye protection, virtual harassment, and the presence of dangerous individuals on the @CAPS2. Eye protection is of utmost importance. Computers can harm our eyes due to overly bright screens, which can cause discomfort and fatigue. Prolonged use can lead to tired eyes. From personal experience, I can attest that wearing glasses is often considered unappealing, and some people are ridiculed for it. This could happen if your eyes are damaged, and your vision deteriorates. The choice may be between wearing glasses or facing the risk of blindness. Virtual harassment is another issue that demands our attention. On the @CAPS2, you may be cyber - bullied by individuals you may or may not know. For example, while chatting on @CAPS3, you might encounter kids making sexual, homophobic, or offensive remarks. This brings us to the issue of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is extremely distressing and can severely damage a person's self - esteem. Some kids take pleasure in using derogatory terms related to race, gender, or sexual orientation. Therefore, extra caution should be exercised when dealing with sexual harassment. Sexual predators are a major concern for parents. They can be found everywhere, whether on @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS3, or even among your neighbors. When children are out and about, they are extremely vulnerable. This is why you should never disclose any personal information on the @CAPS2, including your address, birthday, cell or home numbers, and even the name of your town. Sometimes, even revealing your last name can pose a risk. So, be extremely vigilant when using the internet. If you witness sexual harassment or someone being followed by a sexual predator, report it immediately and prioritize your safety.
1681	1685	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly contend that computers do not confer benefits upon society. I hold this view because when using a computer, one expends less time engaging in physical exercise. Secondly, computers curtail the time available for appreciating nature. Finally, interacting with family and friends is of great significance, yet when on the computer, one does not engage in much of such interaction. Please continue reading to discover my insights regarding computers. Utilizing a computer entails numerous drawbacks, chief among which is the dearth of exercise while using it. As you are well - aware, many countries are witnessing an increase in obesity due to the lack of physical activity. Computers offer no assistance in resolving this issue. The only form of activity computers contribute to involves the hands and fingers, but even this is detrimental, as typing on a computer for an extended period can result in carpal tunnel syndrome in the fingers and hands. @PERSON1, an authority on health, stated, ""One in three people spend more than one hour on the computer each day, which could lead to obesity."" This leads to my subsequent point. When using a computer, there is no opportunity to relish the outdoors. Appreciating nature is integral to every individual's routine. On a computer, it is impossible to savor nature, as the computer is merely a time - consuming and mind - numbing activity. Nature aids in rejuvenating the mind. Without it, one will perpetually feel exhausted. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of kids venture outside daily, indicating that @PERCENT2 of kids remain indoors using the computer? This leads to my final topic. Although the computer provides platforms where one can communicate with friends, it is far inferior to meeting them in person. Family is of utmost importance, so one must allocate time to be with them. My family frequently engages in activities together, such as playing board games. With computers, there would be no time for family bonding, as everyone would be engrossed in playing games on the computer instead of spending time with loved ones. In conclusion, computers exert an extremely adverse impact on society, as they consume time that could be spent on exercise, limit the time for enjoying nature, and cause people to spend excessive time on computers and insufficient time interacting with family and friends. Thank you for reading my article on the numerous effects of computers."
1682	1686	1	1	Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3Ö. My name is @PERSON1, and I am deeply concerned that people worldwide are excessively using computers during the day. Some computers are defective because they contain glitches. Moreover, many individuals have MySpace accounts, and MySpace is prone to viruses, which can infect your computer, causing it to shut down or operate sluggishly. Additionally, malicious individuals can hack into your computer without your knowledge, and all the information on your computer can be disseminated globally. People can gain access to your most confidential secrets. Finally, you may face legal consequences if you are caught creating unauthorized content on your computer, and it can also have a negative impact on your business.
1683	1687	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have truly had a profound impact on society. While some individuals believe that this impact is positive, others hold the opposite view. I firmly believe that computers are a valuable asset in our lives, having brought about a significant and beneficial transformation. There are several reasons to support this opinion: computers facilitate communication with others, simplify the process of obtaining necessary information, and streamline our school - related tasks. Firstly, computers have become the primary means for people to maintain contact. There are multiple ways to communicate via computers, including video - chatting, email, and chat websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. Many people greatly appreciate the ability to stay connected in this manner, which represents an advancement over traditional phone conversations. When engaging in web - chatting on a computer, one can not only converse but also see the person on the other end. Regarding chat websites like @CAPS2, millions of users are part of this remarkable platform and are highly satisfied with it. Both children and adults enjoy having access to such services. For me, after moving to @STATE1 and leaving my friends behind, computers have helped me preserve some relationships that I feared losing. I can email my friends and even observe their physical changes on @CAPS2. Computers are an incredibly useful technological tool that has assisted me and countless others in maintaining connections. Another crucial reason why computers are an outstanding technological innovation is their ability to simplify the process of finding required information. Whether it's the definition of a word or the directions to @LOCATION1, the computer can provide assistance. I spoke with my mother, and she said, ""Computers have made it incredibly easy to access all the information I need about your brother's diabetes."" Searching for information in books can be extremely time - consuming. One has to visit a library or a bookstore, locate the appropriate book, and then read through the entire volume to find the necessary details. On a computer, one can simply use a search engine like Google to find the required information and access relevant articles or maps. Computers have made information retrieval effortless, and everyone appreciates its simplicity. The final reason supporting my view is that computers enhance the efficiency and simplicity of our school lives. In school, there are instances when we need to write a long composition, which can be extremely time - consuming. With a computer, typing the composition would likely take approximately half the time it would take to write it by hand. I conducted a survey among three students who typed a composition and three who wrote it by hand. I inquired about the time taken by each student. The students who wrote the composition reported that it took around two hours, while those who typed it took about an hour. Additionally, typed compositions are generally easier to read, which simplifies the grading process for teachers. Computers have made schoolwork more manageable for both students and teachers. The notion that computers do not benefit society is unfounded. Although there may be some drawbacks, the advantages far outweigh them. Without computers, people would experience significant stress and find it difficult to simplify their lives. Computers are an extraordinary boon to society. Everyone should concur, as computers enable people to stay connected, simplify information retrieval, and make school life easier and more efficient for students and teachers alike. Computers have had an extremely significant impact and have improved our way of life."
1684	1688	1	1	"Dear Local newspaper, I am deeply troubled by the fact that recently, a large number of people have been excessively using computers. My concern stems from the fact that this overuse leads to a lack of physical exercise, a reduced ability to enjoy nature, and less time spent with family. This is not a positive lifestyle. In my opinion, physical exercise is of paramount importance. Maintaining a healthy diet and engaging in regular exercise are essential for good health. I know some individuals who do not exercise and are either overweight or in poor health. People claim to be ""busy"" using computers to complete their work, as they prefer this modern approach over the traditional method of going to work. The advent of computers has made people lazier than ever before. Would people be so lazy if computers did not exist? Certainly not. They would lead a happy and healthy life. Nowadays, people rarely venture out to explore the world. Instead, they simply search for places online using Google. However, they do not experience the real thing; they only see pictures. Everyone is aware that experiencing the real thing is far superior to looking at pictures, yet it seems that people have forgotten this. With everything available online, it is no wonder that people are reluctant to leave their homes. Even when they do go out, they carry laptops with them. Computers are portable, allowing people to access the internet wherever they go. People also spend less time with their families because they can communicate with them in online chat rooms. This is not a good practice, as one might be chatting with someone claiming to be their mother, but in reality, it could be a stranger. If one shares private information during such a conversation, it could lead to problems. For example, if one discusses their credit card details and the other person requests the card number, there is a risk of financial fraud. Online communication is not a safe option, which is why face - to - face interaction is preferable to chatting in a room. I sincerely hope that you will publish my letter in the newspaper to encourage people to engage in physical exercise, appreciate nature, and spend time with their families, as they did before the widespread use of computers."
1685	1689	1	1	Dear, The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people utilize the internet. Excessive use of the internet leads to a lack of physical exercise. Some individuals engage in online gaming, while others harbor fears regarding online chat rooms. These chat rooms are not secure, and some people have suffered serious injuries or even met with fatalities. Exercise is crucial, yet @CAPS2 people neglect this aspect. This is extremely perilous, as it can cause an increase in cholesterol levels, weight gain, and a decline in self - esteem. Some individuals even resort to suicide due to body image issues, and this is a tragedy for everyone involved and is not worth it. Online video games are highly entertaining, but some people are so obsessed that they may even resort to extreme measures. Online chat rooms are fraught with danger, as one never knows with whom they are communicating. Millions of people have faced dire consequences for saying the wrong things. Some have been raped or molested by strangers, and thousands of children have disclosed their addresses and have been robbed. There are strange, unhinged, or suicidal individuals in the world, so one should not make themselves a target. Personally, I am entirely opposed to excessive computer use. @CAPS2 adverse events can occur if one engages in inappropriate online behavior. I sincerely hope that you understand and concur with my reasoning.
1686	1690	1	1	My perspective on the impacts of computers is that the majority of individuals across the globe spend the preponderance of their time seated at the computer incessantly. Were someone I knew to spend the entire day engrossed in the computer, I would forthrightly advise him or her to venture outdoors, inhale some fresh air, and engage in physical activity. Occasionally, the sole means of contacting them is via computer communication. Although the computer can prove highly advantageous for researching significant artifacts, obtaining crucial information regarding medical plans, accessing tutorials on repair, creation, or construction, and meeting new acquaintances, it can also be a perilous realm. One might encounter someone who fabricates their age, and that individual could potentially commit rape or murder. If one spends excessive time on the computer, they may become paralyzed due to lack of exercise or develop lymphoedema, a condition where the body deteriorates, rendering exercise impossible and necessitating specialized treatments such as massage. Conversely, computers can be beneficial as they enhance hand - eye coordination through activities like using videos, video games, and websites. One can upgrade their computer for better quality. Some systems incorporate computers or can be connected to them, like the @CAPS1 @NUM1 @CAPS2. There are PC games that communicate with children to instruct them in writing, reading, spelling, and pronunciation. There are also specialized computers and websites where one can search for tutorials on speaking different languages or playing musical instruments. Some individuals utilize the computer to fill an inner void instead of eating. Some abuse the computer like an addiction; one can envision an addicted person carrying their laptop everywhere. Regrettably, many have perished due to computer overuse. Daily, people purchase computers, and this invention is highly useful. As time progresses, scientists are devising new life - saving technologies.
1687	1691	1	1	Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1, your employees rouse themselves at @TIME1. They stretch their right - hand muscles and don cozy slippers. They meander down the hallway and open their @CAPS2 book to check today's weather. They access @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1, and other platforms to review emails from work colleagues, friends, and family. They glance at the time at the bottom of the laptop screen and log on to prepare for the day. Contemporary society is highly reliant on computers and the network that keeps us all interconnected. Amidst the rapid technological advancements of today, people are increasingly leveraging computers for work. However, some @MONTH1 argue that the excessive time spent on computers deters social interaction with friends. Nevertheless, computers do enhance typing skills, facilitate swift and effortless communication, and help maintain connections with friends and @NUM2 through @NUM2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people and are a remarkable addition to society. Firstly, computers assist in teaching @CAPS6, children, and adults typing skills. Statistics indicate that an increasing number of jobs are computer - based and prefer candidates with a higher words - per - minute typing speed. Nearly @PERCENT1 of companies are adopting new computer systems and using them to store company information. Thus, computers are a necessity, as is proficiency in understanding and operating them. Moreover, @CAPS6 nowadays depend on computers for research to complete projects and gather information. As a student at @LOCATION1 school, I can personally attest to this, as I am often assigned projects that require typed content. It would be extremely arduous if I had to hand - write all my work and search for information manually. If multiple @CAPS6 are assigned the same project, without a computer, it would be impossible to efficiently obtain the necessary information. Clearly, computers are invaluable for @CAPS6. Additionally, @CAPS6 and adults alike cherish social time. When friends or family live far away or in - person visits are not feasible, computers come in handy. They enable us to stay connected with loved ones through @CAPS3, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 / @NUM1, I.M / @PERSON1, and webcam video chats. All these computer - related communication methods would be non - existent without computers. Why would anyone want to be disconnected from their family? Social interaction is a vital aspect of life, so why not embrace computers, considering all their positive attributes? In conclusion, computers are truly wonderful. They help develop typing skills, simplify tasks, and keep friends and family connected. Their impact on people is entirely positive, making them an essential part of daily life.
1688	1692	1	1	Dear The @CAPS1, there are those who claim that computers are not advantageous, yet they are mistaken. In my view, computers offer numerous benefits. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, empower individuals to explore diverse people and places, and serve as a means of communication with friends and family. Computers are indispensable worldwide. Regarding hand - eye coordination, some computer programs teach typing without the need to look at the keyboard. Even without such programs, many can learn to type quickly without looking down. I know several people who have self - taught themselves computer usage and typing. This attests to the universal need for computers. Computers also provide access to knowledge about people and places. With a few clicks on the internet, one can search for any person or location, and the computer will retrieve relevant information. Both children and adults rely on computers. For instance, if a child receives a school project about a famous person or a topic like smoking, they will likely turn to the internet. The same applies to adults in office jobs, schools, or other workplaces. Computers are essential for people globally. Moreover, computers facilitate communication. People use them to connect with friends and family in distant locations via email, @CAPS2, video calls, and various websites. Platforms such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 allow for video or text - based communication. People appreciate the utility of computers, especially when they need to stay in touch. When asked, most will affirm that owning a computer is crucial. Why would anyone want to eliminate such a valuable tool? Computers enhance hand - eye coordination, improve finger dexterity, offer insights into the world, and provide multiple communication channels. In my opinion, computers are among the most significant assets to an individual.
1689	1693	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, have you observed that an increasing number of people are becoming overweight these days? It is indeed a fact. While some attribute this to excessive fast - food consumption, I believe that the excessive time spent on computers and the lack of exercise also contribute to this trend. Additionally, as technology advances, it discourages people from venturing outdoors to appreciate nature. Prolonged computer use is not conducive to environmental protection. Moreover, children are less likely to leave their homes to interact with friends and family due to the convenience of online communication. I am not advocating for a regression in technology, but we must find a way to regulate its use. Firstly, technology plays a role in the rising obesity rate. Some @MONTH1 suggest that people choose not to exercise, but by limiting computer usage, we can remove this choice. As a child, I am fond of using the computer. My parents often encourage me to step away from it and take the dogs for a walk, but I usually decline, claiming to be busy. In truth, I prefer staying on the computer to play games or chat with friends, and I rarely exercise. I suspect that many others share this sentiment, which is why we need to limit computer time. Secondly, global warming is a pressing issue, yet people often choose to stay indoors on the computer rather than enjoy nature. Although one can search for ways to combat global warming online, it does not guarantee that they will take action. Some may simply remain on the computer, ""researching"" solutions. Additionally, computer use consumes electricity, which exacerbates global warming. By reducing computer usage, people can enjoy nature without causing further harm. Lastly, social media platforms like MySpace, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc., have enabled us to communicate with friends and family, but they cannot replace in - person interaction. When we interact with friends and family face - to - face, we develop essential skills such as communication, teamwork, and respect. These experiences also expose us to new places that we cannot visit virtually. In conclusion, excessive computer use prevents us from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with loved ones. Therefore, we must act now to limit computer usage."
1690	1694	1	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am deeply concerned that people are spending an inordinate amount of time on computers. This excessive usage leads to a lack of exercise, a missed opportunity to appreciate nature, and a breakdown in social interaction with family and friends. If people curtail their computer time and increase physical activity, many of these issues could be resolved. Computers, as used globally, primarily engage only the hands, discouraging users from getting up and being active. It is common for people to become irritable while using a computer or when forced to disengage. Some individuals are so addicted that they may have emotional outbursts when separated from their devices. No one wants to witness such behavior. A lack of exercise when not on the computer is clearly evident. Jimmy @CAPS2 remarks, ""@CAPS3 @NUM1 kids are overly reliant on computers. They rarely leave their rooms, and when they do, they are often ill - tempered. They are gaining weight because their diet consists mainly of junk food. This situation needs to change."" He struggles to spend quality time with his children. A family trip could bring them closer together. Another issue is the neglect of nature. Why would one prefer to view pictures of nature on a computer when it is right outside? Contemporary kids are often too lethargic to venture outdoors. Nature offers solace and a sense of peace, whether one needs solitude or simply a change of scenery. It is also a wonderful place to visit with friends and family. I am certain that they would appreciate the effort to disconnect from computers and spend quality time together. Finally, computer - obsessed teenagers and adults need to prioritize time with family and friends. Instead of chatting online, why not meet up and engage in enjoyable activities? Spending time with family strengthens bonds and brings people closer. No one wants to be estranged from their loved ones. Therefore, people should power off their computers, engage in exercise, embrace nature, and cherish quality time with friends and family. Thank you."
1691	1695	1	1	"Dear local newspaper, as you are well - aware, an increasing number of individuals are purchasing and owning computers. Some experts contend that this is an unfavorable development and advocate for more time spent outdoors. I take issue with this stance. Firstly, computers facilitate our daily lives. We access news on computers; some individuals even utilize their computers as a television and watch significant shows. Secondly, a computer serves as an excellent medium for communication. Whether it is with friends, family, or in a business context, a computer is a superb means of interaction. Finally, computers prove beneficial in academic and professional settings. For instance, one can write a paper on a computer. Read on to discover how I substantiate my claim that computers are advantageous in people's lives. Have you ever encountered a news item that piqued your curiosity? Well, if you had a computer, you could visit the news website online and delve deeper. This is merely one way in which computers are useful in daily life; there are numerous others. Another example is that if you do not own a television, you can watch your favorite shows on the computer. My English teacher, @PERSON1, remarks, ""I have never owned a television; I solely watch TV on my computer, and I prefer it."" In fact, @PERCENT1 of those who watch videos on the computer prefer it to television. This is how computers are valuable in daily life. I appreciate the diverse communication methods that computers offer. I find it beneficial because I have several relatives residing far away, and I use my computer to communicate with them periodically. Skype is my preferred option as I can see the person I'm conversing with simultaneously. Additionally, computers are advantageous for large companies that need to communicate internationally. I'm certain that as a remarkable newspaper company, you could benefit from an effortless communication method. Finally, for communicating with friends, there are several programs available, such as @CAPS9, @CAPS1, Facebook, and MySpace. This is why a computer is an excellent tool for communication. Lastly, computers are useful for schools and work. You can type a paper or a news article on the computer, which is significantly faster than writing. Moreover, if you need more information on a particular subject, you can conduct an online search. For example, if you are writing an article about dolphins, you can learn more about them. In conclusion, I believe that computers are beneficial. They assist with daily life, are excellent for communication, and are helpful in academic and professional environments."
1692	1696	1	1	Would it not be reasonable to concur that computers are indispensable in our lives? I firmly believe so. We rely on computers for a multitude of purposes, including communication, self - education, and educating others. Furthermore, they are advantageous for both buyers and sellers. My first rationale for asserting that computers benefit society pertains to communication. In today's era of advanced technology, a large number of individuals employ computers to interact with friends and family. For example, if you have a loved one in the military, you can use a computer with a webcam to communicate with them. Computers also offer a practical way to discuss homework assignments with friends in case you have been absent. Additionally, you can use computers to communicate with sellers when you are interested in a product, and you can obtain more detailed information about it via email. My second reason is education. Nowadays, many college students with work commitments may not have the time to attend traditional schools. With the aid of a computer, they can enroll in online classes. For some students, learning from computers can be more engaging than spending the entire day in a classroom, potentially leading to a better understanding of topics. For example, in science, when conducting a lab, students can conduct research and perform experiments on a computer. With computers, students can expand their knowledge as they can access information on topics that interest them, even without textbooks. My third reason is related to buying and selling products. A vast number of people across the globe use the internet to engage in buying and selling activities. eBay is a well - known website where people sell items to earn money, and others can purchase them. Thus, computers present a viable solution for generating income and saving on fuel as people can order products online and have them delivered to their homes instead of driving to stores. Having presented my points regarding communication, education, and buying and selling products, I hope you will agree with me that computers indeed benefit society.
1693	1697	1	1	"Dear local newspaper editor, I am certain you cherish having the internet at your disposal. Recently, it has come to my attention that some experts are worried that people are spending an excessive amount of time on their computers. I wholeheartedly concur with this concern. My three arguments are that it is detrimental to health, the friends one makes online are ""cyber - friends"" with potential risks, and various negative incidents may occur. Firstly, excessive computer use is not conducive to health. This brings to mind my friend, @CAPS2. @CAPS2 was once a jovial, outgoing individual who actively participated in sports. One fateful day, her mother bought her a laptop, which was blue and white, her two favorite colors. She became glued to it, using it day and night and taking it everywhere. Eventually, she stopped playing sports, gained weight, and fell into a state of depression. She visited the doctor, who advised her to limit her computer use to only two days a week, five hours each day. She followed the doctor's advice, and it took her approximately three months to regain her former lively self. Excessive computer use can harm not only you but also those around you. Secondly, the friends one meets on the internet are known as cyber - friends. You have no way of knowing their true identities, locations, or ages. They can fabricate any information because they view the internet as a fantasy world. This is mentally unhealthy. It is crucial for humans to be socially active. Excessive computer use can also have a negative impact on the brain. Thirdly, various negative incidents may arise. If you are someone like Becky, who uses the computer at every opportunity, it is not beneficial for you or the device. Prolonged computer use can even damage the computer itself. Having presented my arguments and ideas, I kindly request that you take them into consideration."
1694	1698	1	1	Computers! That's often the first thing teenagers do upon returning home from school. They can hardly wait to chat with friends on Facebook or send instant messages. There are numerous positive and negative aspects associated with computers. In the following paragraphs, I will share my perspective, discuss how people can better manage their time, and explore the effects of computer use. My personal experience with computers is that they offer an abundance of information, yet sometimes it can be overwhelming. Currently, a significant number of children and teenagers are victims of bullying. People can send malicious messages to others, often preferring the anonymity of the computer over face - to - face confrontation. This is one aspect of computers that I find objectionable: the potential for harassment. Apart from this, I believe that computers are an excellent resource for learning and reconnecting with people from the past. Many parents do not want to see their children coming home from school and immediately turning to the computer. Parents need to be strict with their children regarding computer use. They must manage their children's time so that they can also complete their homework and participate in after - school activities. Studies have indicated that children who use the computer for more than two hours every day are more likely to experience a decline in their grades. This is why proper time management is crucial. You want your child to have a balanced life, where computer use is regulated and not all - consuming. There are both positive and negative aspects of computers. Computers are an ideal tool for researching people studied in school and reconnecting with old acquaintances. For example, Facebook is a great platform for staying in touch with former friends, and Google is a powerful search engine that provides numerous websites for any query. However, a negative consequence is that people are more likely to say things online that they would not dare to say in person. It also distracts people from other important tasks as they become overly engrossed in the computer and neglect their priorities. In these paragraphs, I have shared my opinion on computers, highlighting their positive and negative features. I have also explained how computer use can consume time and the importance of managing it effectively. Computers are a valuable tool, but one should not over - rely on them as they are not the most important aspect of life.
1695	1699	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people's lives. The internet enables us to engage in numerous activities that would be prohibitively expensive without it. We can study diverse foods and cultures from around the world. Playing online games can enhance hand - eye coordination skills. There are also products available for video - chatting with family and friends. Computers are extremely convenient and useful. If you are interested in a particular place in the world, you can simply type its name and obtain information about its culture, cuisine, and more. Instead of purchasing an airline ticket to visit @LOCATION1, you can learn its language online. You can also study the local cuisine and traditional clothing. Additionally, you can learn about various sports and games. Playing computer games can improve hand - eye coordination. Most games are free and can be downloaded. There are puzzle games that challenge your intellect, action games that require quick reflexes, and adventure games that allow you to explore new virtual worlds. In many of these games, you can interact with other players and make new friends. There are also alternative communication methods apart from games. Email, chat rooms, Facebook, Twitter, and video - chat are all available. You can use these platforms to communicate with friends and family, whether they are in your local area or abroad. You can either download these applications, access them online, or purchase them. You can reconnect with old friends or talk to family members you haven't seen in a long time. With video - chat, you can see each other; on Facebook, you can share pictures; and in chat rooms, you can converse with multiple people simultaneously. In conclusion, computers are highly convenient for modern society. Whether it's exploring the world, having fun, or communicating with others, computers offer a plethora of wonderful opportunities for people.
1696	1700	1	1	"What constitutes technology? Technology is defined as any innovation that enhances our quality of life. Technology pervades our surroundings. Our beds, residences, televisions, and even chairs are all manifestations of technology. However, in my view, one form of technology has revolutionized contemporary living as we know it. This technological innovation is the computer. My perspective on the impact of the computer on our society is decidedly positive. Consider all the tasks we rely on this device to perform. One aspect, in particular, stands out in my mind: @CAPS1. The computer is perhaps the most remarkable form of @CAPS1 the world has ever witnessed. E - mail essentially involves sending a correspondence to a friend without the inconvenience of traditional mailing, where the letter might be lost or stolen. Sending an e - mail consists of two straightforward steps: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Not only does it reduce the risk of the letter not reaching its destination, but it is also significantly faster. You press the ""send"" button, and before you realize it, a new message appears in your friend's inbox. Another computerized method of @CAPS1, which is my personal preference, is instant messaging. Instant messaging enables you to engage in a conversation with someone who could be miles away. Moreover, it is acceptable if you decide to fetch a soda while instant messaging, as, unlike a face - to - face conversation, it is not considered impolite. These are merely two methods of @CAPS1 facilitated by the computer. There is a plethora of other means that, similar to these two, enhance our way of life. I believe that the primary reason the computer has so greatly improved our lives is the internet. The internet makes all the activities we perform on the computer feasible. If I wish to use the computer to conduct research on a topic, the internet guides me to the relevant sources. With millions of diverse websites, the internet offers boundless possibilities. If I am interested in arcade games, I can access the internet and play them. If I need to write a science report, I can use the internet to gather research. If I want to listen to music, I can access the computer, search for a song, and listen to it. And here's the best part: if I am seeking a humorous video for a good laugh, the internet can find one for me! The internet is perhaps one of the greatest inventions of all time. It is yet another reason to appreciate the computer."
1697	1701	1	1	The computer is capable of performing numerous functions. I believe that computers exert positive influences on individuals. However, some experts contend otherwise, which is the impetus for this paper, allowing me to expound on both viewpoints. Did you know that in most households, the likelihood of owning a computer is as high as that of having a telephone? Computers, remarkably, assist us in various aspects of life, whether it is @CAPS1 to store information, communicate online, discover a delectable recipe, or fulfill any other @CAPS1 need. This is why computers are so advantageous. If we did not possess computers, we would not have achieved the technological advancements we enjoy @DATE1, with computers being one of the most crucial devices. Allow me to share my experience. I had a job interview, yet I was unable to locate the street. I turned to my computer, which provided me with the directions, enabling me to reach my interview. This is why I firmly believe that computers have positive effects. Conversely, the opposing view posits that people are devoting excessive time to their computers and less time to physical exercise, appreciating nature, and interacting with friends and family. Well, I assert that spending too much time on the computer is entirely a matter of personal choice. These individuals typically lack self - control. Regarding exercise, who stipulates that everyone must exercise? If a person is already slender, why do they need to exercise? As for interacting with friends and family, it is entirely possible. After all, how long can one stare at a computer screen? In conclusion, it is evident that computers are beneficial, but with self - control, they can be utilized without any adverse effects. Therefore, the next time you use the computer, enjoy it, but remember that your friends, family, and health take precedence.
1698	1702	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, as an avid computer user, I firmly believe that computers are invaluable in numerous respects. They facilitate the acquisition of new @CAPS3. They enable the operation of machinery. They empower individuals to acquire new knowledge. Computers assist in the discovery and procurement of new @CAPS3. They offer the public an alternative avenue to secure a new or different job. Take my brother, for example. He attended a university, where he @CAPS4 learned to become a mechanic. @CAPS4 was struggling to find employment. Then, someone advised him to visit @CAPS1.com and navigate to ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"". @CAPS4 followed the advice and, through the computer, found a suitable job and remains employed there. The computer is indeed an excellent tool for job - hunting. Computers also play a pivotal role in operating machines. Many machines that were once manually operated are now computer - controlled. This has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it enables the production of more goods in less time. Nowadays, more cars are manufactured in a shorter period. If you have witnessed an assembly line, you have seen mechanical robotic arms assembling cars, which is made possible by computers. However, a significant drawback is that many people are losing their @CAPS3. Computers also serve as educational tools."
1699	1703	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, the influence of computers on people can either be detrimental to our society or beneficial. As a middle - school student growing up in this technological era, I believe that while using computers can be advantageous at certain junctures, it is also causing harm to our society. Firstly, the internet is rife with inappropriate content. Illegal activities are prevalent and can ensnare anyone with a single click of the mouse. Any individual worldwide can exploit the technology available today to ""hack"" into or trespass on someone else's computer. People can illegally download songs or documents for free instead of purchasing them. In fact, not only can one download inappropriate content directly onto their screen, but they may also be exposed to graphic language or visit websites featuring videos of drug use, criminal acts, and vulgar language. A recent study on internet usage by the @ORGANIZATION1 reveals that ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" has been linked to suicides or depression among teenagers. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a form of @CAPS5 where individuals can engage in chat or instant messaging and cause emotional distress. Moreover, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is not the only concern; people can now interact with strangers on the internet. Imagine the horror if your child were to disclose their private information online, and a person who lied about their age, sex, and appearance received it. That individual could then track down your child and potentially kidnap or harm them. Secondly, the internet can be extremely unhealthy and lead to social isolation. According to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of children or teenagers who rely heavily on the internet may develop strained relationships with friends and family if they overuse the computer. Prolonged computer use is not only unhealthy for teenagers but for anyone. People may become lethargic, exert less mental effort, and lose touch with the outside world. Finally, my primary reason for considering computers negative is their addictive nature. From personal experience, I used to stay up late for hours on websites like @CAPS9 because everyone else was using them. While it can be entertaining, excessive internet use jeopardizes academic performance and social interaction. Addiction can overpower one's willpower. My own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game continuously for @NUM1 hours. One can become so engrossed in a particular activity that they neglect other aspects of their life. The internet can be wonderful in moderation, but it can also be inappropriate, unhealthy, and addictive. If technology becomes overly dominant in our society, how will we learn to interact with one another? More and more people are becoming consumed by technology, and in my opinion, it is quite alarming."
1700	1704	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I wholeheartedly support technological advancements and firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals. I hold this view for three primary reasons. Firstly, using computers allows individuals to acquire valuable computer skills, which can be beneficial in various situations. Secondly, computers provide people with the opportunity to learn about distant cultures and locations. Lastly, computers enable users to communicate and interact with others. When I think of a computer, I envision typing on a keyboard. With repeated use, one becomes increasingly proficient. You develop typing skills, hand - eye coordination, and proficiency in using the mouse. After only a few sessions, your computer skills improve significantly. As you become more adept, your progress accelerates, and the benefits become more pronounced. When using a computer, the internet grants access to a vast amount of information. Whether you are researching a different culture or seeking assistance with schoolwork, a computer is an invaluable resource. When I encounter difficulties with my homework, I turn to the internet for help. The computer enables me to obtain the necessary support for any academic task, which is truly remarkable. I can even explore different cultures and compare them to our own. The computer empowers me to accomplish all my requirements. Have you ever felt lonely with no one to talk to? This problem can be easily resolved by using a computer. You can engage in conversations with people even when you are alone. You can communicate with someone on the other side of the world. It is astonishing that you can be anywhere and talk to anyone you desire. Computers allow you to reconnect with old friends and make new ones. Computers are truly remarkable. When using a computer, there are countless activities to engage in and numerous benefits to reap. They are both useful and enjoyable, offering endless possibilities. In my opinion, there is a wealth of knowledge and experiences to gain from using a computer.
1701	1705	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, upon entering a room and observing individuals engaging with their computer screens, I find it both novel and exhilarating to witness the daily acquisition of new information. The query at hand is: what impacts do computers exert on people? I firmly contend that computers wield a positive influence on individuals. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow people with the capacity to explore distant locales and cultures, and even facilitate online communication with others. Undoubtedly, computers can have a beneficial impact on society. Computers have imparted an invaluable skill to every user: hand - eye coordination! Whether it involves clicking a link to a website discovered on @ORGANIZATION2 or playing the matching game of Bejeweled, one is honing hand - eye coordination. According to recent research, over @PERCENT1 of the interviewees reported having excellent hand - eye coordination, and @PERCENT2 attributed it to their computer usage. While it is true that we all need outdoor exercise, the computer can be advantageous as long as we do not allow it to overwhelm us. Intelligent individuals would concur that coordination is an extremely useful skill. These remarkable inventions also enable us to learn about diverse places and people. Imagine this scenario: A student at @ORGANIZATION1 is tasked with a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He visits the library to consult the encyclopedias, only to find them outdated. He then proceeds to the computer lab and locates the information on @ORGANIZATION2 with ease! This scenario demonstrates that the computer is one of the most rapid means of obtaining information on any subject or topic. Although traditional text sources can offer equally accurate information, the computer is swift and convenient, especially when immediate information is required. Why stop there? Not only can one acquire information about specific individuals and locations on these devices, but also learn about the latest trends, current events in @LOCATION2, and the most recent @CAPS6 gossip. The computer is undoubtedly a convenient source of information about various areas and people. This extraordinary device also allows for online communication! There are numerous ways to achieve this. One can utilize the conventional @CAPS7 - mail or a device within the @CAPS8. Naturally, a @CAPS9 is necessary for such communication. I recall a time when I was bored and decided to do my homework. The problem was that I had forgotten what it was! I promptly grabbed the phone and called my classmate, but he did not answer. I then rushed to my computer to check if he was online. Sure enough, he was! I obtained the homework details and received an A, all thanks to the computer's ability to facilitate interaction with others.
1702	1706	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I opine that computers exert a beneficial influence on people rather than a detrimental one. I hold this view for three principal reasons. Firstly, computers serve as stress - relievers. In my estimation, without computers, life would be considerably more stressful. With a computer, one can effortlessly access information without expending excessive time or succumbing to the stress of a laborious search. Secondly, the role of technology is a significant factor. In the absence of technological advancements, life would be far more arduous. Without computers, it would be more challenging to type assignments neatly, print pictures, and gather information. I believe that without computer - based technology, numerous aspects of life would encounter difficulties. Thirdly, the functionality of factories is reliant on computers. I assert this because, upon reflection, most operations in a factory are governed by some form of computer system. Without the computer instructing the machines, the entire production process would come to a halt. The absence of computers would render factory work so time - consuming that workers would be disinclined to complete their tasks. These are the three compelling reasons why I believe computers have a positive impact on people.
1703	1707	1	1	Dear Whom It May @CAPS1, Have you ever contemplated the prospect of spending all your time in front of a computer? If so, I firmly believe that one should not remain glued to the computer throughout the day. As my mother often remarks, limiting computer usage to an hour a day is advisable. One crucial reason for this is the need to embrace the offerings of life. One can engage in activities such as playing catch with dogs, taking the dog for a walk, or visiting a friend's house. While computer games can be entertaining, physical exercise is equally essential. Another reason is that excessive computer use may lead one astray. By venturing outdoors, one can forge new friendships. This is how I became acquainted with trees, animals, and the beautiful scenery. One can experience a sense of fulfillment and joy. The final reason is that outdoor activities offer numerous opportunities. In winter, one can build snowmen, and during rainy days, one can watch a movie. There are countless possibilities. In conclusion, activities such as building, playing, and jumping are just a few examples of the joys of the outdoors. One should remember these three compelling reasons and make the most of the wonderful and enchanting outdoors. Take the dog for a walk, invite friends over, or simply spend quality time with family and friends.
1704	1708	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers: in contemporary society, computers have emerged as a ubiquitous and indispensable tool. They offer a plethora of functions, including information retrieval, knowledge acquisition, and entertainment. In essence, they present a comprehensive package. Through computers, we can access a vast repository of information, including facts, historical data about the @CAPS1, which enhances our understanding of the world around us and how various elements have evolved. A computer is akin to a virtual library, housing a wealth of information. It can be utilized for academic projects and a multitude of other purposes. Moreover, it allows for rapid data storage in folders. Every day, we learn new things, and there are numerous websites such as @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4 that provide diverse content. Some individuals are so reliant on computers that they cannot envision life without them. However, certain computer applications, such as music players, require the download of music and other apps. While these features keep us engaged and occupied, computers undeniably have a profound impact on individuals. As is evident, they serve as a source of information, knowledge, and entertainment, whether in the form of a desktop or a laptop.
1705	1709	1	1	Everyone has a penchant for spending time on the computer. It would be astonishing to find someone who does not. I contend that the fundamental issue lies in the fact that the computer diverts one's attention from other equally enjoyable aspects of life. People tend to immerse themselves excessively in computer - related activities, which can significantly alter their lives. The computer can be likened to a disease or a virus that exerts control over an individual, yet regaining one's freedom from its grasp is entirely feasible. I am aware that some individuals, particularly those in @MONTH1, may disagree with my perspective. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that my stance is the most reasonable. The computer's influence is pernicious. It distracts people from fully experiencing life and renders them oblivious to the beauty of nature. Excessive computer use is indeed a deplorable affliction. The challenging part of regaining one's freedom is recognizing that the computer has taken control. Once this realization dawns, the path to freedom becomes accessible. Technology, while a remarkable innovation, can also act as a barrier to enjoyment, impede schoolwork, and disrupt social interactions with friends. I can attest to the fact that breaking free from its hold is possible because I have personally experienced it. Technology is undoubtedly a remarkable phenomenon, housing an abundance of information that one could scarcely imagine. However, it also has its dark side. I once encountered a truly disturbing scene on the computer, which made me wish I could shut it off immediately. Machines seem to possess a will of their own, capable of exerting an influence over us. Changing a person's life is no easy feat. One can undergo a complete transformation, and these changes can be either positive or negative. A machine has the power to effect rapid change. If one sees something appealing on the computer and desires it intensely, and is unable to obtain it through legitimate means, there is a risk of resorting to unethical behavior such as stealing. This is a truly lamentable lesson. The key lies in self - control. Machines can have a pernicious influence on individuals. There are alternative sources of information, such as books. Computers can make people lazy as they eliminate the need for active reading. They can take over one's life, teaching bad habits and causing significant changes. The choice of which path to take ultimately lies with the individual.
1706	1710	1	1	My experience with computers is quite favorable as I can engage in gaming or complete my homework. I am able to install my personal music collection on my computer while simultaneously working on my assignments. Moreover, I can access the internet using computers. With computers, I can perform tasks more rapidly and with greater ease. I can also accomplish more in less time by connecting to the internet, as I can conduct research and copy - paste information from online sources. Currently, I own a laptop, which is essentially a portable computer. On my laptop, I can create data tables and graphs, write papers, and utilize a dial - up connection. A dial - up connection allows me to obtain free internet access. By entering a person's phone number in the designated field, the laptop will connect to the modem if the phone line is linked to it. My laptop also features a slot for a floppy disc and another for a @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 device. Additionally, it has a built - in calculator. Some laptops, like mine, are equipped with a trackpad that resembles a small pad. As is evident, computers and laptops are highly beneficial to possess.
1707	1711	1	1	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @MONTH1 posits that individuals are devoting an excessive amount of time concentrating on the computer rather than on their homework or enjoying fresh air outdoors. I contend that those individuals are @CAPS1! Computers represent a significant leap into new technology. For instance, one can utilize the computer to conduct school research, communicate with friends online, and provide children with leisure time during which they can learn about distant places and people. Suppose you are writing a research paper for school and have borrowed all the relevant books on the topic. Suddenly, you realize you've forgotten one of the most crucial books! You rush back to the library only to find it closed. This is where computers prove invaluable. You can search for the book on Google and find an online copy, enabling you to achieve a good grade on your paper. Additionally, perhaps you're struggling with math homework and are home alone. What should you do? This is precisely what computers are for! You can effortlessly visit your teacher's website, where you'll find an explanation of how to complete that specific lesson. Children need to communicate with their friends to a certain extent, such as to discuss homework or simply have a chat for fun. Without friends, children would be at a disadvantage. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT1 of all children permitted to communicate with friends outside of school stay away from drugs and have a stronger educational performance and better grades. The internet was not created casually. It was invented so that people can communicate, children can conduct research, and for entertainment and exploration. For example, one can learn about distant places, people, and cultures, explore animals, and even engage in online shopping. These are essential resources for everyone to access. Without computers, @CAPS3 would be unaware of important news when needed or lack information for specific moments. Computers are the future (yes, I may be repetitive). @CAPS3 need to have computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning, teaching, researching places, animals, people, and cultures, as well as for email and disseminating important news to all relevant parties. This is why @CAPS3 need to progress with computers and technology for the future. So, all the people of @LOCATION1, keep your computers; they are an important stepping - stone for growth and advancement in technology. Plus, who wouldn't enjoy a good computer game occasionally?
1708	1712	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, do you believe people should cease using the computer? Well, the answer is yes because they are not getting enough exercise. People's bodies start to become lethargic, and they are reluctant to get up. Instead of spending time with their families, they prefer to spend their free time on the @CAPS3. This is why people should stop being indolent and breathe in some fresh air. Do you think people who spend time on the computer interact with their families? Well, no, because they believe they will be entertained by technology rather than by their families. The reason I don't have a high regard for computers is that one can become addicted to them very quickly and find it difficult to stop. When you interact with your family, you get to know them better, and that is invaluable. This behavior should stop because it impairs people's minds. Another reason I'd like you to consider is the lack of exercise. When people don't exercise, they can cause harm to their bodies. They start to overeat and later become extremely lazy. When you exercise, you have an abundance of energy to undertake any activity, such as bungee - jumping. When you exercise, you look healthy, and people will notice. This is why exercise is the best way to stay healthy and fit. Additionally, my third reason is the enjoyment of nature. By enjoying nature, you can have a great time and relax. You can swim at the beach, feel the wonderful breeze, and have a pleasant experience. When you're on the computer, you're sitting down instead of going outside, and this can become a habit. It also harms our environment because people don't want to get up and enjoy nature. This behavior should not be tolerated because people are being lazy. In conclusion, people should not spend their lives on the computer because they think they'll be entertained by technology instead of interacting with their families. People will start overeating and become lazy. They'll never leave the house and will instead be glued to their computers. This behavior should stop as it is harming our environment and making people lazy.
1709	1713	1	1	I concur that we should own computers, considering that an increasing number of people are using them. In the past, we didn't even have computers, but now we do. Since we have computers, we ought to make use of them. If we don't use computers, then why do we even have them? Computers can assist us in learning about far - off places such as @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and other distant locales. If we are unaware of what's happening in these far - away places, we won't know what kind of flags they have, what they eat, what they possess, what they do, or what languages they speak. You can even engage in online conversations with your friends on a computer! You don't have to call your friend; you can simply chat with them online. If you need help with your homework or have left your math textbook at school, your friend can tell you the questions via an online chat. If your friend is in @LOCATION2 or other distant places, they can bring their computer with them and talk to you online. You don't have to call your friend in @LOCATION2 or other locations. You can also learn how to type. Once you know how to type, you can type faster and faster. You can type stories, poems, and notes, or anything you need to do for school. So, you don't have to write on a piece of paper; you can just type on the computer. This is why we should own computers and use them more extensively. I hope you share my view.
1710	1714	1	1	Would you not concur that computers exert a profound influence on people? The three reasons why they have a positive impact on people are as follows: they enhance typing skills, they are educational, and they assist with numerous tasks. Firstly, computers contribute to the improvement of typing skills. If one owns a computer, they will gradually discover that their typing proficiency significantly improves. Each time one uses the computer, their hands adapt to the keyboard. Suppose there is someone who aspires to work with computers in the future. By practicing typing on their home computer, they will be qualified for computer - related jobs. Moreover, computers can be beneficial for the hearing - impaired. If the hearing - impaired use computers, they can obtain a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 device and engage in online chats with others. This is valuable to them as they can read what others are saying on the internet since they cannot hear spoken words. Secondly, computers are highly educational. In my view, computers are educational because there are numerous websites that offer facts about different places. For example, they can teach you about the local cuisine in different countries or the geographical location of those countries. A website that is excellent for obtaining accurate information is www.Ask.com. Ask.com is the top - rated website as it can provide any information you desire within seconds. Computers are also useful for school projects due to these remarkable websites. Finally, computers help with a multitude of tasks. If you want to know the distance between @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1, you can access your PC to find out. Or, if you lose the directions to your friend's house while on the way, and you have your laptop with you, you can use it to locate your friend's house. I understand you might be thinking about GPS. However, GPS devices can be confusing, whereas your computer can provide clear instructions. You might also wonder why you don't just text or call @CAPS3/@CAPS4. But what if your friend doesn't speak clearly? In conclusion, would you not agree that computers have positive effects on people? My three arguments are that they enhance typing skills, are educational, and assist with various tasks. Please consider my viewpoints.
1711	1715	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The query is whether excessive computer usage causes individuals to engage less with their surroundings. In my view, computers certainly do not render people indolent and less sociable with those around them. Firstly, I opine that computers can, at times, enhance one's intellect. That is to say, one can peruse historical accounts, global news, and conduct research on a plethora of diverse topics. I recall that during my youth, I was enthusiastic about learning regarding the @CAPS1. I would frequently search for information about it and even created a poster project for amusement. Thanks to the computer, I obtained accurate data. A survey carried out by the @CAPS2 school's social studies instructor reveals that @PERCENT1 of their students utilized computers to gather facts for school projects. @PERCENT2 out of that @PERCENT1 ultimately achieved better grades. Renowned psychologist @PERSON2 asserts that ""children and students acquire more knowledge when they are on the computer researching or discovering new things."" I am aware that you might be contemplating that excessive internet usage is detrimental to people, particularly students. However, at @ORGANIZATION1, it serves as an excellent source of discovery for them. Therefore, computers assist everyone in learning facts and staying informed about global events. Secondly, individuals can interact with their family and friends online. That is, there exists @CAPS3, where people can socialize with their relatives residing in other states. I remember that when I was in @NUM1 grade, I befriended a new classmate, and she relocated to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 after @NUM2 grade. I have maintained contact with her via @CAPS3. A survey conducted by the student council indicates that @PERCENT3 of students had someone they cared about move out of state, and @PERCENT4 out of that @PERCENT3 keep in touch through email or @CAPS3. Distinguished scientist @ORGANIZATION2 states, ""Individuals who maintain contact with their family and friends tend to remain content and avoid depression."" I understand that you might think people do not need to stay in touch with their families constantly, but it brings them greater happiness. Therefore, people require computers to maintain communication with their families. Thirdly, one can learn novel exercises, movements, or tricks. That is, one can engage in new workouts, train for dance competitions, or learn new magic tricks for a magic show. I remember that when I desired to learn how to twirl a balloon between my fingers, I searched for and found a video demonstrating the step - by - step process. It has become much easier now. A survey conducted by @CAPS5 muscles @CAPS6 shows that @PERCENT5 of their @CAPS6 members become stronger and fitter by discovering new exercises. Well - known athlete @PERSON1 says, ""Discovering new exercises online aids me in staying in shape for my games."" I know you might be thinking that they could simply seek someone to teach them, but no one wants to pay for something that can be obtained for free online. Therefore, discovering new exercises, movements, or tricks online can be of great assistance. To conclude, does excessive computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? No, it facilitates learning, socializing with family and friends, and getting in shape through the new exercises learned from instructional videos."
1712	1716	1	1	Many individuals believe that utilizing computers is advantageous, and I concur because there are numerous people in this nation who speak different languages, and computers can serve as educators instead of a monolingual person. For some, this is an integral part of their lives; indeed, a large number of people rely on computers for their work. Children also access the internet, not merely for platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, Gmail, and numerous other websites. I too use the internet, albeit less frequently than before. In the past, I would visit gaming websites like @NUM1.com or even /cup/coffee, but I no longer frequent those sites as often since I have Xbox Live, which also provides internet access and enables me to communicate with my friends. Some of my friends spend excessive time on the computer without engaging in any physical activity, while many of my other friends use the computer but also participate in a variety of sports, thus avoiding excessive weight gain. Essentially, most people in the world own a computer, although not everyone in @LOCATION2 of @LOCATION1 has one. I believe that our country should offer substantial financial support to those underprivileged nations so that they can acquire computers. This way, if individuals from those countries come here, they can learn our language. Alternatively, we could ship computers to their countries to ensure that they do not purchase inferior devices. Moreover, when using a computer, one can either purchase a webcam or utilize the pre - installed one to communicate with friends and even showcase their creations. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers represent one of the most remarkable inventions in human history.
1713	1717	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, My name is @PERSON1, and I wish to deliberate on the matter of computer usage in @LOCATION1. Firstly, I will expound on the advantages of owning a computer. Subsequently, I will discuss the entire computer network. Finally, I will address the technological advancements attributed to the computer. I am of the opinion that the use of computers in our town is highly beneficial to society. There are several significant advantages to using a computer. One such advantage is the ability to utilize Microsoft software to compose papers. Sixth - grader @PERSON6 remarks, ""I prefer typing to writing a paper. Another reason to use a computer is for research."" As @PERSON4 states, ""There are numerous articles and facts available online on any topic you require."" The final benefit of a computer is the instant access to world news. @PERSON5 says, ""I would never have learned about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 if I hadn't seen the article on @CAPS2's homepage."" These are merely some of the major benefits that children enjoy when using their computers. Now, let us discuss a matter that is often misconstrued as negative but is, in fact, not: social networking. Platforms like @CAPS5 employ a texting feature on computers, which allows us to connect without incurring exorbitant phone bills. @PERSON2 says, ""With instant messenger, I can communicate with my girlfriends."" Additionally, Facebook enables us to connect on a global scale. @CAPS6 states, ""I can converse with my cousin in @LOCATION2."" These are the primary social networking tools we use to interact with people worldwide. One crucial aspect of the computer is the technological advancements it has spurred. For instance, we have laptops, which are portable computers that can be taken anywhere. @PERSON7 remarks, ""I can use my computer wherever I like."" Furthermore, memory cards allow us to store data on a computer and transfer it to school or work. Eighth - grader @CAPS7 says, ""I can bring unfinished schoolwork home using the memory stick."" The final major advancement is the use of printers. @PERSON3 says, ""I use my printer to print papers for school."" These are some of the significant technological advancements brought about by the computer. That is why I believe computer usage is beneficial to us. There are numerous advantages to owning a computer. We can communicate with people globally at any time. The computer has even been the driving force behind many other groundbreaking technological improvements. Therefore, please support us children in this matter of computer usage."
1714	1718	1	1	In contemporary society, succumbing to the allure of @CAPS1 from @ORGANIZATION1 has become an integral part of daily life. While this is advantageous for businesses and educational institutions, for individuals seeking to pass the time, computers can be a perilous choice. Undoubtedly, computers serve as a means of communication and prove useful when students forget their homework or assignments. However, when it comes to alleviating boredom, computers can have adverse effects. Social networking, in reality, is a cause for concern, as an excessive number of young people are exposing themselves by creating @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 pages. Additionally, physical exercise has emerged as a significant issue, and one cannot engage in it while sitting in front of a computer. Nevertheless, computers open up new realms for individuals. One can input any query or location into a search engine and obtain immediate results. Similar to most things, computers are beneficial when used in moderation, but excessive indulgence is detrimental to one's well - being. Websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS6 pose risks to privacy. There is minimal privacy protection, and one's page can easily be made public. Moreover, these websites are addictive. One might simply intend to log on to check notifications but end up spending @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the computer without realizing it. Other pastimes, such as running on a treadmill or jogging, offer numerous benefits that are absent when using a computer. The only consequence of spending an hour on the computer may be blurred vision. It would be reasonable to use the computer for 1/@NUM1 hour a day, but not solely for internet browsing. Websites can be a productive use of computer time. Edline can be used for homework or assignments, and Google is useful for research or vocabulary work. When these types of websites are the focus of computer usage, it becomes far more productive. Overall, I am convinced that computers have a negative impact on individuals. However, if more people who use computers balance their screen time with physical exercise, they would be in a better state of health and well - being.
1715	1719	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Contemplate the scenario of a world bereft of computers. A terrifying thought, is it not? I had the same reaction. A world without computers would be a world where people struggle to communicate and where independent information gathering is virtually impossible. The advantages of having computers are manifold. Firstly, they serve as a medium for communicating with friends and family who do not reside in close proximity or with whom one has lost touch. Secondly, they enhance hand - eye coordination, which is beneficial in a wide range of activities. Lastly, they empower individuals to explore and learn about the world. In conclusion, computers have a profound and positive impact on people. From my perspective, owning a computer enables me to maintain communication with individuals I met during previous vacations. I can send them emails and interact with them on social networking platforms such as Facebook. This is invaluable for anyone who has lost contact with friends or family members. The ability to reconnect with long - lost friends provides an opportunity for both myself and others to catch up and rekindle relationships. In essence, the capacity to communicate with others via a computer is just one of the numerous benefits it offers. Secondly, computers not only facilitate communication but also enhance hand - eye coordination. Dereck, a Channel @NUM1 news reporter, states, ""I can hit some remarkable shots during our games. I genuinely believe it is because my mother taught me how to use a computer."" Children, in particular, stand to benefit from computers as they develop hand - eye coordination, which can be advantageous in sports such as baseball or football. Thirdly, computers enable students and many others to acquire knowledge and seek information on topics they are unfamiliar with. @PERCENT1 of schools across the country benefit from having school computers for research purposes. On the other hand, businesspeople, parents, and teachers utilize the internet to stay informed about global events and gather educational resources for their classes. Overall, computers offer numerous benefits, including facilitating communication, enhancing hand - eye coordination, and enabling individuals to learn about the world. In summary, the computer is an ingenious invention that serves as an exceptional source of information and a catalyst for positive change."
1716	1720	1	1	"Dear @PERSON1, in your esteemed newspaper, I perused an article that piqued my interest. The article delved into the adverse effects computers exert on the community. However, I found myself in vehement disagreement with its stance, @PERSON1, as, in my view, computers represent a significant stride forward in modern technology. I firmly believe that computers confer substantial benefits upon society, as they promote hand - eye coordination, facilitate learning about virtually any subject, and enable online communication with others. You may wonder how computers aid in hand - eye coordination. When typing on a computer, one's eyes are fixed on the screen while the hands are typing, strengthening at an astonishing rate! A study conducted by students at @ORGANIZATION1 indicates that the likelihood of developing arthritis by the age of @NUM1 decreases by nearly @PERCENT1 among frequent computer users. Moreover, the hand - eye coordination acquired through typing proves invaluable in sports such as tennis and baseball. Thus, if someone aims to enhance their hand - eye coordination, I recommend enrolling in a computer class, similar to those offered in numerous schools nationwide. Secondly, utilizing the internet on computers significantly simplifies the process of obtaining information on a diverse range of topics. Suppose you plan to embark on a family vacation. Instead of making phone calls, you can conveniently plan your entire trip from your computer. Countless websites streamline this process, making it swift and effortless. Additionally, there are websites that offer tutorials on various skills. For instance, if you wish to learn how to knit, simply enter ""how to knit"" into your preferred search engine, and you will discover over @NUM2 sites to assist you, enabling you to easily learn new skills like knitting or bike repair. In addition to learning new things, the internet allows you to reconnect with friends. After camp, I often vowed to ""keep in touch,"" yet I seldom fulfilled those promises. Once I discovered instant messaging and webcam applications on the internet, communicating with friends became a breeze. Occasionally, I converse with my friend who now resides in @LOCATION1! Furthermore, my father used to be highly stressed about international meetings, but now, with the ability to use webcams to communicate with his overseas colleagues, he eagerly anticipates these meetings. He frequently remarks that modern computers are incredibly user - friendly for communication. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers are a boon to the world as they enhance hand - eye coordination, facilitate information acquisition, and foster communication."
1717	1721	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I am of the opinion that computers are highly beneficial to society. One reason is that children often struggle to write a @NUM1 - page essay by hand and thus opt to use a computer, as it offers greater ease. People utilize computers daily, whether for socializing with friends, playing games, or conducting business. Personally, I do not use a computer frequently, mainly for checking emails and schoolwork. However, this does not imply that others do not rely on them. People engage in physical activity even unconsciously, such as walking, so concerns about lack of exercise are unfounded. I firmly believe that computers are not detrimental; instead, they can be extremely helpful, especially for research projects. When one is reluctant to search through books for information, a computer can provide instant access to the desired data. Why are people so preoccupied with our @CAPS4 habits? We exercise regularly, whether at school, while walking home, walking the dog, or taking out the trash. Another remarkable aspect of computers is the ability to engage in video chat, which allows for real - time interaction with others. This is particularly useful when a parent is away on business, as it enables family members to see and communicate with each other. I have also used this feature to connect with friends. Computers are also advantageous due to the software they come with, such as Word, Excel, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, etc. These programs assist in writing essays, @CAPS4 grades, creating charts, and more. Without computers, we would have to perform these tasks manually, resulting in messy and less organized work. Computers also stimulate cognitive function. The final reason computers are so remarkable is the internet, which serves as a vast repository of information. Whether you want to shop, play games, watch videos, chat with friends, post pictures or videos, the internet has it all. I hope the @CAPS1 understands my point: computers are not harmful, and this is a fact. Both children and adults love them. Imagine taking computers away from children and adults. How would children @CAPS4? How would adults conduct business? Consider the impact on the world without the aid of computers. How would you produce your newspaper without a computer? Reflect on what kind of world it would be. We rely on computers, and they have become an integral part of our lives.
1718	1722	1	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, there has been much discussion regarding the impact of computers on us. Some individuals hold the view that using computers is a waste of time. However, I firmly believe that computers are far from being a negative influence. They offer us the opportunity to explore different parts of the world and gain insights into the lives of people from the past. Moreover, they enable us to stay connected with our friends online. If you are curious about the usefulness of computers, please continue reading. Some claim that computers squander our time. Nevertheless, the internet is an excellent resource for learning about diverse regions across the globe. We can study the climate, the local fauna, and the culinary traditions of different places. @CAPS1 locations possess unique cultures. For example, in @LOCATION3, seafood is a staple in everyone's diet, while in @LOCATION2, spicy food is favored. The internet can present us with images of breathtaking places we have never witnessed before. It is an outstanding way to experience and understand different cultures compared to our own. Do you have a long - lost friend? Would you like to reestablish contact with that person? The internet provides an ideal solution. You can create accounts on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, @NUM1, etc. By simply searching for your friend's name, you can reconnect with them. You will undoubtedly be overjoyed to resume communication. @CAPS1 children utilize computers for their history projects. The internet is an invaluable tool in this regard. You can search for famous historical figures or contemporary personalities. It allows you to delve into their pasts. For instance, @LOCATION1, the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1. You can learn extensive details about him, including his birthplace and the number of his family relatives. As you can see, the internet is highly beneficial for children. These are the reasons why I am convinced that computers are not harmful. We still have ample time for our families, friends, and outdoor activities. We can learn about different parts of the world, communicate with friends online, and study the lives of people from the past.
1719	1723	1	1	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, do you believe that computers have a negative impact on people today? I certainly do not share this view. Over @PERCENT1 of the population currently owns a computer. With a computer, one can uncover a wealth of information about places and people. If your handwriting is less than ideal, you can type instead, and the computer can assist you in researching various topics. Suppose you want to find information about your favorite hockey player. Instead of visiting the library in the hope of finding a relevant book, you can simply @ORGANIZATION1 his name, and numerous websites will appear. This not only saves you a significant amount of time but also money. If you take an annual family trip to the same destination and seek a change, you can search online for another place that @MONTH1 offers similar features but is much closer than @LOCATION1. Therefore, if you own a computer, you can explore potential travel destinations or discover interesting facts about your favorite sports players. If your handwriting is messy and difficult for your teacher to read, you can learn to type on a computer. At least @PERCENT2 of students in schools today receive zeroes on their homework or tests because their teachers cannot decipher their handwriting. Typing on a computer also helps with spelling and grammar. You can format your work, add pictures, and enhance its overall quality, which can significantly improve your grades. So, to those who believe that computers are of no help, here are the reasons why they can be beneficial. Computers can assist children in finding information or watching videos about their favorite players. You can also find warnings about your favorite hockey players' playoff situations. You can discover a plethora of useful content online. You can download your favorite songs for your cellphone. Over @PERCENT3 of people obtain their songs from the computer. Additionally, the computer can play your favorite songs. For example, if your favorite band is Dropkick Murphys, you can @ORGANIZATION1 the band's name, and you will find all their songs. Many people think that computers are not good for us, but I firmly believe they are mistaken. You can find information about future prospects, type up your work if your handwriting is messy, and access songs, videos, and much more when browsing the web. For instance, @LOCATION2 @MONTH1 may have its own dedicated website. Computers can help children access information more effectively. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset that can assist in various aspects of our lives.
1720	1724	1	1	Dear NewsPaper @CAPS1, have you ever contemplated the profound impact technology has on our society? For many individuals, computers have become an integral part of their lives. They enable adults to maintain contact with friends and provide users with a wealth of useful information on virtually any topic. Computers are exceptional tools that enhance our lives and equip us with skills for the future. Contrary to the belief that computer users spend excessive time on these devices, computers are essential for a fulfilling life. For example, the internet hosts numerous platforms that facilitate social interaction, such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, and many others. As adults, we often find that childhood friendships fade over time. However, computers offer a convenient means of staying in touch. Through online chat, we can communicate with friends throughout the night. Moreover, if friends live in different parts of @LOCATION1, computers provide a convenient way to connect. Additionally, computers are a goldmine of information. When planning a family vacation, one can use a computer to research destinations and book flights. Similarly, students can rely on computers to gather information for reports when they are unable to visit the library. Furthermore, if someone is unsure about the severity of an ailment, they can search for relevant information on the internet, with dedicated sites like @ORGANIZATION2 offering valuable insights. In addition to providing information, computers help users develop valuable skills. Simply knowing how to operate a computer is a crucial skill, and the various features it offers, such as creating PowerPoint presentations for work or slideshows of personal events, are highly beneficial. Typing is another valuable skill that most modern jobs require, and using a computer helps refine hand - eye coordination. Although some @MONTH1 argue that prolonged screen time is unhealthy, @CAPS5 of @CAPS6.S.A citizens believe that using computers is beneficial for their social lives, as long as it is done in moderation. Computers are truly remarkable tools when used appropriately. It is time to inform the public of the numerous benefits computers bring to society. They enhance social lives, teach valuable skills, and provide information on countless subjects. People need computers to enjoy a rich and fulfilling life. Therefore, I urge you to write an article highlighting the necessity of computer use @DATE1 and reassure the public that they are making the right decision by incorporating computers into their lives.
1721	1725	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, are you aware that @NUM1 in every @NUM2 @CAPS2 families possess a computer? While computers can be beneficial when one needs to compose an essay for school, when it comes to a choice between family and computer, the typical child will generally opt for the computer. Computers are depriving individuals of family time, exercise opportunities, and the time dedicated to schoolwork. ""@PERSON3, disengage from the computer and join us in playing '@CAPS3'!"" Frequently, mothers will utter this to their children at least once a week. The most common response is ""@CAPS5!"" Children ranging from the ages of @NUM3 to @NUM4 would rather allocate their time to the computer, whether it involves playing games or conversing with friends. This is an issue that demands attention. Families ought to commence spending more time together instead of lingering in front of a screen. My acquaintance @PERSON1 has a younger brother who is perpetually engrossed in computer games. Whenever @PERSON1 wishes to play hide - and - seek with him, he always contrives a way to avoid playing with @PERSON1 and instead continues playing on the computer. Apart from reducing family time, computers also deprive children of exercise opportunities. For instance, last week when it snowed, I invited my neighbor @PERSON2 to engage in a snowball fight outside. However, she claimed that she had to complete a level in a computer game as it was extremely crucial. This substantiates that computers take away time for outdoor activities and exercise. A stroll in the park with friends seems relaxing to most people, yet a significant number of teenagers would rather communicate with their friends via a computer than actually spend time with them. Lastly, if time is being squandered staring at a screen, when will homework be completed? I recently conducted a survey among eighth - graders, and the results indicated that @PERCENT1 of those who fail to complete their homework do so because they spend excessive time on the computer. In my science class, a boy named @CAPS7 never does his homework. When I inquired about the reason one day, he stated that it was because he was chatting with his girlfriend, who also never does her homework as she always has computer - related tasks. Sacrificing time with family, exercise, outdoor play, and homework assignments is a substantial price to pay for ""@CAPS8 one more level."" If you desire to assist me in curbing children's computer usage, please pen an article on this crucial issue in one of your newspapers and kindly consider my suggestions."
1722	1726	1	1	"Do you desire for people to be overweight? Do you wish for our beautiful outdoors to be despoiled? And do you want families to become estranged because they are overly preoccupied? Statistics reveal that @PERCENT2 of families do not engage in conversation as they are excessively engrossed in computer games. The matter at hand is whether computers have an impact on people. Indeed, I contend that computers have a negative impact on people for the following reasons. People allocate an excessive amount of time to computers and do not engage in sufficient exercise, they fail to appreciate the natural world we inhabit, and they do not interact with their family and friends. People spend an inordinate amount of time on computers and do not obtain adequate exercise. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT3 of overweight individuals spend more time on computers than on the athletic track. I recall a time when I was overweight because I spent an excessive amount of time on the computer. One day, my mother confiscated the computer and discarded it out of the window, leaving me with no alternative but to venture outside and engage in physical activity. Do you want children to be overweight like I once was? Many individuals do not have the opportunity to relish the great outdoors as they are overly preoccupied with computers. Lisa, a volunteer worker in @LOCATION1, remarks, ""This field was once a rich ecosystem teeming with diverse plant and animal life, but now it has become a wasteland due to computers. No one had the time to concern themselves with the natural wonders because they were too engrossed in their computer - animated tasks and did not care about the consequences."" Do you want this to transpire in our country? @PERCENT4 of highly technological areas are polluted with minimal plant life as the workers are required to attend to the computers rather than the greenery. Some families encounter difficulties discussing their daily lives as they spend an excessive amount of time on computers and do not allocate sufficient time to communicate and get to know one another. Statistics demonstrate that @PERCENT1 of divorces are related to the inability to engage in meaningful conversation, and with the advancement of technology, this figure will likely increase. I remember that my parents divorced because my father spent more time on the computer than conversing with me or my mother. Most individuals believe that computers are beneficial for research. While this is true, one is still confined indoors instead of being in a large library with access to all the necessary information. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people."
1723	1727	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am cognizant of the escalating controversy regarding computers and whether they confer benefits upon society. In my perspective, computers are an invaluable resource that will soon become a ubiquitous household item. I am penning this to persuade you that computers exert a positive influence on people. I hold the view that computers are advantageous as they grant people access to a wealth of knowledge, enable them to maintain contact with individuals they seldom encounter, and assist them in staying abreast of contemporary life. One reason computers are useful is that they facilitate people in maintaining communication with those they rarely see. Nowadays, parents are more amenable to sending their children to college as they can visually interact with them via video - chat platforms such as @ORGANIZATION1. This feature of computers has a profound impact on people's lives. Individuals in @LOCATION1 can engage in dialogue with those in @LOCATION2. Such communication often fosters the sharing of novel and innovative discoveries. Another reason computers are useful is that they aid people in keeping pace with modern life. Numerous companies are now phasing out newspaper advertisements and migrating them to computer websites. Some companies are solely selling their products on their websites and delivering them to customers. With computers, students can complete their homework and submit it to their teachers via email if they are unable to attend school. There are even online colleges where students can take courses remotely. I believe that in the coming years, an increasing number of people will conduct business using computers, and more stores will operate exclusively online. Finally, the last reason I consider computers to be a prudent choice is that they provide people with access to a vast reservoir of knowledge through the internet. There are websites dedicated solely to history and information on a plethora of subjects. Additionally, there are blogging platforms where people can engage in debates about information or have their questions answered by experts who possess in - depth knowledge of the topic. Another useful resource on computers is websites like Wikipedia, where people can search for a topic, explore its history, and follow links to other websites for more in - depth exploration. Overall, I firmly believe that computers are an exceptional resource for humanity and will be employed for an expanding range of purposes in the future. I assert that computers are beneficial as they offer access to knowledge, the ability to maintain relationships, and the means to stay connected with modern life. I anticipate that in a few years, there will be fewer brick - and - mortar stores, and most commerce will occur online as it is more cost - effective for companies. Hence, in the near future, most people will own computers and utilize them efficiently.
1724	1728	1	1	Over time, computers have undergone significant advancements. They have also become increasingly compact. However, people still fail to recognize the perils that computers pose to society and their personal lives, such as stress, addiction, and cyberbullying. I am writing to expound on how computers have become a nuisance in our lives. Firstly, computers are among the leading causes of stress in daily existence. Approximately four out of every ten stressed individuals attribute their stress to their computers. For example, if you were in the process of writing a crucial document or sending an important email to your boss regarding work, and your computer suddenly malfunctions, would you be perturbed? Would you feel an overwhelming urge to tear your hair out and hurl the computer out of the window? I am quite certain you would, as your data is lost, you will have to restart the computer, and in the worst - case scenario, take it to an electronics store for repair. Another source of stress is computer hacking, which has evolved into a global phenomenon. There are books and instructions available on how to hack a computer, and the government has limited means of addressing this issue due to the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and the press. Consider the incident in @LOCATION1, where a computer hacker infiltrated a system and cut off power to an entire city for approximately @NUM1 days. Moreover, if someone uploads a virus to your computer, they can steal all your personal information, such as your social security number. These factors can cause severe stress in your daily life. Secondly, people spend an excessive amount of time on computers at home. A recent survey indicates that six out of every ten teenagers spend more than two hours on the computer each day. This leads to social isolation, as they are less likely to spend time with friends, family, or participate in sports. Consequently, they do not meet the recommended one - hour daily exercise requirement.
1725	1729	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I perceive that there is a burgeoning controversy regarding whether computers are beneficial to society. In my estimation, computers are a remarkable resource that will soon be a staple in every household. I am writing to convince you that computers have a positive impact on individuals. I am of the opinion that computers are advantageous because they afford people access to a greater expanse of knowledge, allow them to maintain communication with those they rarely meet, and help them stay attuned to modern life. One rationale for the usefulness of computers is their ability to enable people to stay in touch with those they seldom see. Presently, parents are less reluctant to send their children to college as they can use video - chat services like @ORGANIZATION1 to interact with them. This feature of computers has a far - reaching impact on people's lives. People in @LOCATION1 can communicate with those in @LOCATION2, which often leads to the exchange of novel and creative ideas. Another reason computers are useful is that they assist people in remaining connected to modern life. Many companies are now discontinuing newspaper advertisements and migrating them to computer - based websites. Some companies are only selling products on their websites and shipping them to customers. With computers, students can complete their homework and send it to their teachers via email if they cannot attend school. There are even online colleges where students can take courses remotely. I believe that in the coming years, more people will conduct business using computers, and more stores will operate solely online. Finally, the last reason I believe computers are a good investment is that they provide people with access to a wealth of knowledge through the internet. There are websites dedicated entirely to history and information on various topics. There are also blogging platforms where people can debate information or have their questions answered by experts who are well - versed in the subject. Another useful tool on computers is websites like Wikipedia, where people can search for a topic, learn about its history, and follow links to other websites for further exploration. Overall, I firmly believe that computers are an excellent resource for humanity and will be used for a wider range of purposes in the future. I assert that computers are beneficial as they offer access to knowledge, the ability to maintain relationships, and the means to stay connected with modern life. I anticipate that in a few years, there will be fewer physical stores, and most commerce will occur online as it is more cost - effective for companies. Therefore, in the near future, most people will own computers and use them effectively.
1726	1730	1	1	A multitude of individuals engage in debates regarding whether, on the whole, computers exert negative effects on them. Some believe they do, while others contend that computers are an asset to society as one can access nearly anything. However, this very accessibility poses a problem. The content on computers is imposed upon all who encounter it. Moreover, computers do not contribute to people's well - being, and when conducting research, books are more valuable than the internet. Firstly, the content available on computers and the internet is overwhelming for both individuals and society. What I'm suggesting is that an excessive amount of information can be accessed online. Derogatory and pornographic websites are harmful, especially to [ORGANIZATION1] and teenagers. Chinese government officials have restricted access to such dangerous websites. Chinese readers have started to claim that the easily accessible content on computers is corrupting the minds of the youth. The internet and computers are on the verge of causing widespread influence and infiltrating everyone's minds. Secondly, computers not only have a negative impact on mental health but also on physical stability. Computers offer numerous games for [ORGANIZATION1] to play. These games initially seem enjoyable but can turn into habits. Although games can be fun, when a child plays them for hours daily, it becomes an issue. The problem is that kids are not getting sufficient exercise. Studies conducted by [ORGANIZATION1] indicate that [PERCENT1] of children who play computer - generated games are overweight. Therefore, I believe that games are a harmful habit for young [ORGANIZATION1]. Lastly, many people conduct research on the internet, yet some facts are inaccurate. What I'm getting at is that no one needs a computer to look up information or conduct research for projects. Instead, one should visit a library. Many find books uninteresting, but they are beneficial in the long run. I recall a time when I had a project due for [PERSON1] in [NUM1] grade on [LOCATION1]. I searched for information on the internet instead of using a book, only to discover that the facts were highly inaccurate. Hence, one should never rely on the internet as a research source. From derogatory content to the health problems of the youth and inaccurate research, computers are not assets to society but rather issues. In my opinion, computers are causing more harm than good to all who use them.
1727	1731	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, ""Do some people have a 'virus' in their minds?"" It seems they need a miracle to break away from the computer. The reason I say this is that it is detrimental to many people's health. It is an inefficient use of time. More importantly, it can land one in trouble. Stay tuned if you seek the antidote to this ""computer virus"" so that people can be cured. Oh my goodness! My stepfather needs to step away from the computer! The amount of time he spends online is unhealthy. He should get up and be active. Instead, he just sits there, eating while online every day. Another reason it is unhealthy is that as one ages, bones become weaker, and in old age, mobility is restricted. Just imagine, if there were no computers, the time and money people spend on them could be allocated to more useful things. For example, [NUM1] out of [NUM2] people adore computers more than life itself. [PERCENT1] of the world's population spends time on physical activities rather than being glued to the computer. While a computer is a useful tool, one must ensure not to be controlled by it. Alert! Alert! The sirens are approaching my house. I'm frightened as I'm online, wondering if I've done something wrong. However, the police were not coming for me; it was my next - door neighbor. I assume he was engaged in illegal online activities. You see, computers can lead people into trouble. For instance, I remember when I got in trouble with my parents, and they took the computer away from me. Now, you understand why computers have an adverse effect on people. They are unhealthy for many, consume a significant amount of people's time, and cause them to face various troubles."
1728	1732	1	1	Dear [ORGANIZATION1], computers are an integral part of daily life and are utilized by almost everyone. There are numerous benefits if one knows how to use them properly. They assist in various aspects of daily life, whether one is trying to find a song stuck in their head or file taxes. Computers are a necessity in every household. They are also an excellent means of learning. One can look up a nagging question or learn to play a new song on their favorite instrument. In either case, learning occurs. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers have a more positive impact on society than a negative one. Computers are also a great way to interact with family and friends. Some computers are equipped with built - in cameras that enable face - to - face conversations with peers. This is particularly useful for those with family living far away or in long - distance relationships. Another advantage of computers is their organizational capabilities. Whether it is organizing [CAPS1] or [CAPS2], one can rely on their computer to keep everything in order. Some computers even have a built - in calendar to help plan one's day. Suppose one is unsure of what to do on a particular day. This brings me to my next point. Computers are also ideal for researching places. For example, if one travels to [LOCATION1] for a business meeting for the first time and arrives a few days early, they might decide to go sightseeing. With a computer, they can search for some of [LOCATION1]'s most elegant spots and have an enjoyable day. Overall, I believe that computers are the driving force behind modern life. They will never become obsolete, which is why everyone should learn how to use them. If one doesn't know how, they should do so as soon as possible.
1729	1733	1	1	I am of the opinion that computers offer significant benefits to people. Those who advocate for technological advancements believe that computers have a positive influence on individuals. For example, they enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and individuals, and allow for communication with others. Firstly, prominent figures around the world utilize computers to secure a better future. People in important professions, such as judges, engineers, lawyers, architects, scientists, and archaeologists, rely on computers. This demonstrates the helpfulness of computers to people. Secondly, computers are beneficial for children. They can contribute to children achieving better grades at school and developing a more intelligent mind in multiple ways. One way is through extensive reading on the computer, which helps in understanding the meaning of new words and improving language skills. This is why I believe computers aid in the development of a smarter brain. Thirdly, computers facilitate adults in connecting with different parts of the world. This can be a fulfilling hobby for adults with free time. In conclusion, computers can enhance one's quality of life and contribute to a better future.
1730	1734	1	1	Dear Connecticut [CAPS1], do you enjoy catching up on your favorite television shows, shopping for the latest trends, or perhaps planning a reunion with old friends? Well, with today's advanced technology, you can do all these on the computer! I understand that experts are deliberating whether computers are the most beneficial for our society, but in my view, they are excellent! As you may not know, I am [NUM1] years old and have a [NUM2] - year - old brother. We spend a considerable amount of time on the computer, not just for homework. I prefer to shop online for discounts and sales, where I know items are cheaper than in physical stores. I know my brother likes to attend concerts and purchase the latest video games. My grandparents, who are elderly and do not watch much TV or read newspapers, find the computer ideal for catching up on favorite TV shows and the news. With these remarkable machines, you can have lively conversations with old friends on Facebook, [CAPS2], and [ORGANIZATION3]. [PERCENT1] of teens [CAPS5] prefer to shop by brand names, such as [CAPS3], [ORGANIZATION1], [ORGANIZATION2], [CAPS4]. All these designer clothes and items are highly desirable, yet half of us lack the financial means. By using the computer, you can acquire these brand - named items for less than [MONEY1], compared to [NUM3]%. Computers reduce the cost of the things we desire and need. Nowadays, grandparents often struggle to have a meaningful conversation with their children or grandchildren. As a grandchild, I remember that my [PERSON1] used to talk only about her experiences during the Great Depression. However, with the computer, she can keep up with the news, and I can sit down with her and have an engaging conversation. You can also catch up on the shows that everyone is discussing at school, so kids won't miss out. When I was in [NUM4] grade, I got my first Facebook account. I thought it was so cool! On [DATE1], I went to camp and met many new kids, all of whom had Facebook accounts. Thanks to the computer, I can stay in touch with them and maintain our friendships. I know that scientists and experts are likely more knowledgeable than a [NUM1] - year - old girl, but I am aware that most teenagers and parents have Facebook and consider it great as it allows us to connect with people worldwide. I hope these experts will make the best decision regarding whether computers benefit our society and will take my thoughts into account.
1731	1735	1	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The predicament before us is that some individuals are addicted to computers. However, I contend that not everyone falls into this category. Moreover, certain people can multitask and engage in various activities such as spending quality time with their families and friends, and most importantly, relishing life. In a sense, the privileges offered by computers can be equivalent to enjoying life. For instance, if you and your friend own the same computer equipped with a webcam, video - messaging capabilities, and more. That is a form of life experience. What I am trying to convey is that you can converse, see each other, and have private discussions. Computers do not always distract you from the significant people or things in life. Some computers can be beneficial; you can pursue online courses, learn essay - writing skills, improve your reading abilities, and much more. Computers can be a boon to some individuals. The only factor that can prevent you from having fun with your family and friends is yourself; you cannot attribute it to a computer. Envision a life without a computer. What would you do? How could you survive? For example, if you were assigned homework that had to be completed on a computer and there was no way to finish that project at school, how would you proceed? Some people indeed need computers. I believe that if those who developed new technologies foresaw how enthusiastic we would be about our computers, they might have been more cautious about introducing so many new technologies into our lives. Now, you can likely understand why I think we need computers and how they can, at times, benefit our society.
1732	1736	1	1	@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, can you fathom the children in the schools you administer being unable to conduct research on computers? Would you be amenable to students not having the option of typing their homework via @ORGANIZATION3? Do you think the adolescents in @ORGANIZATION3 @LOCATION2 would be willing to squander paper due to @ORGANIZATION3 their untidy handwriting and errors? I would abhor living in such a manner, and I am certain my peers would concur. This is merely one of numerous reasons why computers exert a positive influence on people. Other reasons include that citizens across the globe require an easier means of communication, and some individuals have to work from home. I know that as a @ORGANIZATION3, you would not wish to upset as many people as removing computers would. First and foremost, contemplate the schools run by @ORGANIZATION1. Now, visualize this: students submitting eight - page handwritten essays to their teachers when typing would have reduced it to three pages. Imagine those students the night before, scribbling frantically with cramped hands, striving to write as rapidly as possible. These children lack computers, and thus their teachers will have to invest time in deciphering the illegible students' handwriting. I can almost envision the students screaming, their eyes darting about as they struggle to complete their high - priority papers. If there were no computers, this is what would befall children. Additionally, students utilize computers for research, learning about different regions of @ORGANIZATION3 the world. As a @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you @CAPS1 would claim that research has a negative impact on schoolchildren. I mean, unless you did not desire them to learn. Secondly, I urge you to close your eyes. Picture yourself attempting to call your best friend residing in @LOCATION1. When he does not answer, you approach your sleek, shiny black computer. You hear the rhythmic clicking of the keys as you compose a message to him, and the gentle whooshing sound emitted by your monitor when you press send. It is truly remarkable how advanced our technology has become, that you can send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 within seconds. You surely cannot assert that all the arduous work invested in developing computers has not had a positive effect, can you? I know that I frequently communicate with my friends in @LOCATION3, not via the telephone. You see, my family does not have long - distance calling, so if I did not have a computer, I would never be able to interact with her. I know that many of my friends face the same issue, and if not, the time difference between locations makes it challenging to make calls. Have you ever encountered such a problem? Would you want the consequence to be that you could no longer communicate with some of your friends? Most importantly, I would like to share a story. When @CAPS2 was five, my father used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part of each day. However, when I was six, my father obtained a job that necessitated him working late every night. He stopped coming home to tuck me in, and being so young, I did not understand why. I wept every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my father's boss informed him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His workplace provided him with a computer, and he resumed tucking me in every night, which he still does. If that is not a positive outcome, I do not know what is. Many individuals are able to work from home with the aid of computers, which is yet another reason why computers are advantageous to all citizens of @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I assume that you, as a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION3, require a computer for work. Although I @CAPS1 can understand why some people in @MONTH1 oppose computers, I completely and wholeheartedly disagree. Computers assist people with work, learning, and even communication! People in @MONTH1 might think that computers are too costly, but you @CAPS1 can find them in almost any price range. I do concur that citizens should not spend excessive time on the computer, but it still has an entirely positive impact on people in @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I believe that a @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 of the @ORGANIZATION1 should concur.
1733	1737	1	1	I concur with the notion that computers are beneficial to people. Initially, computers have a positive influence on us. They endow us with the capacity to learn. Moreover, they enable individuals to communicate online from distant locations. Hence, indeed, computers are advantageous to people. Firstly, computers undoubtedly have a positive impact. A computer can instill motivation in someone. It can also aid in locating a lost pet. Additionally, it can facilitate job - hunting. Moreover, one can find a secure residence with its help. Thus, computers do have a positive effect. One can also acquire the ability to learn. This is achieved by assisting deaf individuals through sign - language websites. One can also gather information about places one intends to visit. This helps in learning about different countries. Most importantly, it aids both children and adults with schoolwork or professional tasks. This demonstrates that one can learn various things from computers. Computers also enable communication with people at a distance. This proves useful for families. It is also beneficial for those with hospitalized relatives. Furthermore, parents in the military can interact with their children. Above all, adopted children can communicate with their birth parents online. Here lies another reason why computers are beneficial. This is why I support the use of computers. They have a positive influence on people. They grant us the ability to learn! Lastly, they allow us to communicate with our loved ones who are far away. Therefore, in conclusion, it is beneficial for people to utilize computers.
1734	1738	1	1	Dear readers, Globally, people are increasingly using computers. However, there are also individuals who do not believe that it benefits society. @CAPS1 is not one of those individuals. I concur that this trend benefits society. One reason for my agreement is that at times, there are teenagers and even adults who can engage in online chats with their friends if they are unable to contact them through other means. Another reason is that in all schools, teachers assign projects to their students during vacations or weekends. For these projects, students can search for information on the computer. The final reason is that computers endow people with the ability to learn about things they were previously unaware of. In my opinion, I support the idea that computers benefit society. Teenagers, children, and even adults who wish to communicate with their friends can access the computer and chat with them if there is no other way to reach them. @CAPS2, it is straightforward. You merely need to: 1) access the computer; 2) visit a website where you know your friend might be present; 3) log in or register if you have never visited that site before; 4) last but not least, search for your friend to initiate a chat. Teachers consistently assign work to their students, such as projects. Children also undertake projects on weekends or during vacations. Instead of going to the library to borrow a book, you can always use the computer to find the information you need. Computers provide the ability to learn information previously unknown. For example, when you are bored and have nothing to do, you can access the computer and look up information about topics like nature, books you are interested in, etc. I agree that computers benefit society, although not everyone does. The reasons I agree are that children can chat online with their friends, search for project - related information, and discover new knowledge. What do you think, @CAPS1? Am I right or wrong?
1735	1739	1	1	Dear State legislator, @CAPS1, imagine living in a bygone era when computers did not exist. The only difference now is that the technology is available, yet you are prohibited from using it. Do you think your job would become more arduous? I firmly believe that computers are simplifying your job and everyone else's lives. Computers enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places, and facilitate communication among individuals. I am convinced that the advanced technology of computers is significantly contributing to society. To begin with, computers are assisting numerous individuals in improving their hand - eye coordination. As you are aware, hand - eye coordination is essential for a proficient driver. According to the statistics from “@CAPS2 drivers.com,” the accident rate has declined over the past ten years. In fact, it has decreased by @PERCENT1. The computer games designed for young children are enhancing their hand - eye coordination from an early age. With games like “@CAPS3,” a majority of children are cycling, skiing, or snowboarding by the age of five. All these activities demand excellent hand - eye coordination. Moreover, the resources for improving hand - eye coordination are being employed to help special - education students perform simple tasks more rapidly. Secondly, the World Wide Web is educating people of all ages about places located thousands of miles from their homes. Personally, I use my computer to research a location and learn about its history before embarking on a vacation there. The computers in our school have enhanced our social - studies classes. My teacher, @PERSON1, stated that he has been grading more strictly, yet the grades on computer and internet research projects have still increased by @PERCENT2. I should also mention that through the use of computers, our school is in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week, we exchange emails with our pen - pals. Computers have undoubtedly improved my school's curriculum. Finally, computers are enabling people of all ages to communicate with business partners, friends, etc. According to “@CAPS4 - tech” magazine, social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in contact. I should also note that they have reconnected @PERCENT4 of high - school friends, all thanks to computers. Another form of online communication is video - chatting, which many people now use for business meetings instead of incurring the expense of traveling to the meeting location. Now, for one day, track the number of hours you spend on the computer for work. I can wager that it will account for approximately @PERCENT5 of your time in the office. Computers enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about far - off places, and facilitate online communication. So, do me a favor, State legislator. Recognize and accept how indispensable computers are to society.
1736	1740	1	1	I opine that computers exert a beneficial influence on individuals. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, endow people with the capacity to explore distant locales, and enable them to engage in online conversations with others. Computers foster hand - eye coordination, a skill that will be utilized throughout people's lives. In the absence of hand - eye coordination, individuals would be clumsy. Hand - eye coordination is employed on a daily basis. When using a computer, one must simultaneously look at the screen and type. For those lacking proficient hand - eye coordination, this can be of great assistance. They will be capable of accomplishing more tasks without errors, such as hitting a baseball. For children aspiring to participate in sports, this can genuinely be helpful. They will learn to leverage their eyes, arms, and hands to their advantage. Computers grant people the ability to learn about far - off places. Were it not for this ability, we would be unable to keep abreast of global events. Additionally, if one has family in a distant location, they can search online to discover what is transpiring there. In the event of something untoward happening, they will be informed and can offer assistance. Moreover, the ability to learn about far - off places is beneficial in school. When tasked with a report on a distant place, instead of rummaging through resources, one can search the internet for information. Computers also facilitate online communication among people. This enhances interaction. One will be able to forge more and better friendships. The opportunity to converse with others online is remarkable. One can get to know someone, become friends, and spend a great deal of time together. Furthermore, one will become more socially engaged. If one is shy, this can be a boon. They will grow accustomed to interacting with people, and once comfortable, will engage with them in person. This will lead to the acquisition of more friends. It will help one emerge from their shell and become more socially active. These are the three reasons why I believe computers are advantageous. They aid in hand - eye coordination, enable learning about far - off places, and allow for online communication.
1737	1741	1	1	Esteemed local newspaper, Do you appreciate computers? I firmly believe that computers assist you in learning about a plethora of things. Moreover, computers enable you to converse with individuals on their computers even when you cannot place a call to them. Another reason I adore computers is that when I have to compose a project, I can simply type it! Computers simplify everything. Therefore, kindly consider developing an affinity for computers. Initially, envision having a project due in two days. Your mother is unable to drive you to the library, and you possess no information on the subject. However, do you not own a computer? You can utilize the computer to research your subject, and numerous diverse websites will promptly appear on your screen. Most of them will aid you in learning about the subject, allowing you time to complete it and socialize with your friends. Secondly, Oh no! You forgot which page of the book you were supposed to read. Additionally, you lost all your friends' contacts. Fear not, for the remarkable computer is here. You can email or chat with your friends online to ascertain the pages to read and retrieve their phone numbers. Did you know that a certain percentage out of a specific number of people stated that the chat and email programs are excellent because they can contact friends, family, and colleagues? Finally, you can type your essay on the computer. Writing a multi - paragraph essay is time - consuming, so employ your computer to assist you. Access Microsoft Office and type your essay. Computers render essay writing extremely effortless. A particular percentage out of a specific number of people said they prefer typing on the computer rather than writing it on paper. In conclusion, computers are outstanding technology when you need to communicate with someone. They are also invaluable when you are learning about something. Another reason computers are excellent is that you can type essays and papers. Please alter your perception that computers are detrimental to the understanding that computers make our lives easier!
1738	1742	1	1	To Whom It May Concern; I am penning this correspondence to convey my sentiments regarding the impact of computers on individuals. My stance on this matter is that both viewpoints hold validity. Indeed, computers endow people with the ability to learn about distant places and individuals, and they also facilitate online communication with others. Had it not been for computers, I would not have completed numerous school assignments and tasks. However, there are experts who spend an excessive amount of time on their computers and less time engaging in physical activity, appreciating nature, and interacting with family and friends. I am aware of this because I know some individuals who have become addicted to online video games and remain glued to the computer for hours. I myself have discovered new websites and desire to learn everything about them, often choosing to be on the computer instead of exercising. Nevertheless, despite both statements being true, I do not believe that computers have a negative impact on people. Without computers, a significantly larger number of students would be failing classes and receiving zeroes on projects, class assignments, and homework because they lack a rapid means of accessing information. Additionally, most families and friends would lose touch as they would lose an enjoyable mode of communication. I believe that computers have a positive influence. Do you not concur?
1739	1743	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I am convinced that utilizing computers is a prudent decision and will benefit people. A vast number of individuals across the globe own computers. Computers are advantageous as they aid children in learning, facilitate communication with others, and instill a sense of responsibility. Kindly lend an ear to my perspective. First and foremost, I am of the opinion that computers assist children in learning. If you purchase computer games such as a cooking game, you can acquire cooking skills. Even if you obtain a virtual pet, you are still learning through the process of caring for it. There are numerous excellent websites you can visit, such as a well - known educational site. People learn by engaging in novel activities, and what better way than to play with your favorite characters? Moreover, you can access Google and type in any query, and it will provide you with the answer. Since you use a keyboard for these activities, you also learn how to type. If your teacher assigns a homework task, why not type it to develop this skill? This is why computers are beneficial for facilitating children's learning. Secondly, you can communicate with individuals from around the world or simply your friends. There are platforms like Skype or other video - conferencing services. You can use a webcam to converse with anyone you wish. There are also websites designed for global communication. It is truly remarkable as you do not need to travel to talk to others. All of these experiences teach you about the diversity of people, highlighting that no two individuals are alike. People may have different languages or personalities. The abundance of communication options makes computers even more appealing. Lastly, using computers helps inculcate a sense of responsibility. Children who use the internet understand the importance of privacy, which is associated with responsibility. If someone does not wish to be disturbed, you should respect their wishes, which pertains to privacy. Additionally, you learn to be courteous while using computers. When engaging in video chats, you should definitely be polite and refrain from being rude, as this can lead to being banned from these platforms. Another aspect is that people learn to take care of valuable items. A computer is a costly asset, and not everyone has one. Therefore, you should be grateful for what you have. Instead of boasting, recognize that you are fortunate to own a computer. These are the reasons why computers are advantageous. So, if you are contemplating getting a computer, the answer is yes, as computers aid children in learning, enable communication with others, and teach responsibility. Now you understand that computers are truly beneficial for children and not detrimental.
1740	1744	1	1	"Dear Local newspaper, Do you possess a computer at home that you relish using? Computers have become an integral part of modern life, as they assist with numerous aspects. These include maintaining organization, facilitating studies, and providing entertainment. These are the three areas I will focus on, as I wholeheartedly believe that computers are highly useful, and people rely on them to simplify their lives. Allow me to begin by stating: ""I am an individual who takes pleasure in using computers for various purposes, such as communicating with friends, searching for and listening to music, watching videos on YouTube, completing schoolwork, and much more! One of the primary benefits is that it helps me stay organized. I can create multiple folders to store my work, eliminating the risk of losing or damaging paper documents. I can save my music, homework, projects, work materials, videos, pictures, and more in an organized manner, ensuring I can locate them easily whenever needed. There will no longer be the excuse of 'My dog ate my homework.' Moving on to the next point. As previously mentioned, you can save your work on the computer, and you can also make additions without erasing, resulting in neat and flawless work every time. Thus, when your teacher grades based on neatness, there is no cause for concern. You can also research any topic you are studying in class, which allows you to gather more information, potentially leading to better grades. Spelling is no longer an issue, as your computer alerts you when a word is misspelled and even provides suggestions by underlining it with a red squiggly line. This is extremely helpful, as many people struggle with spelling. You can even use text - to - speech software to listen to a book you are reading, which helps you learn new words that you might not have known how to pronounce. Teachers can post homework notes and project deadlines on school websites. There will be no more claims of 'I didn't know/remember what the homework/project was due.' Lastly, entertainment is perhaps the most significant aspect of computers. People use them daily to upload videos, pictures, blogs, and just about anything they desire. Younger children play educational games on computers, while older children enjoy a variety of games, such as maze, driving, shooting, and adventure games. Almost everyone who uses a computer is familiar with chat websites for communication. Social media platforms like Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, and many others are used by people to converse, express their emotions, show affection, send birthday greetings, and much more. The entertainment possibilities on a computer are endless. Without a doubt, there will be no more complaints of 'I'm bored.' Do you use your computer for activities like these? If so, you must find it enjoyable. People utilize computers for a wide range of tasks, from work to self - expression. So, where do you stand on the matter?"
1741	1745	1	1	Dear local newspaper, decades ago, computers were non - existent. Presently, a multitude of individuals have internet access in their residences. However, for some, the impact it exerts on people is adverse. Nevertheless, I am convinced that computers exert a positive influence on individuals in numerous aspects. For instance, the internet enables people to maintain contact, equips them with technological proficiencies to prepare for more high - tech occupations, and allows them to discover and learn about novel matters. Do you not concur that computers benefit society? People are scattered across the globe, and those fortunate enough get to encounter numerous individuals from diverse locales within the country. Yet, long - distance phone calls are impractical; hence, with a computer, people need not lose touch. It is quite effortless for people to communicate with others from any location without the need for face - to - face interaction. Computers also offer an uncomplicated means to stay in touch with family. Thus, people can converse with their far - flung relatives worldwide without having to visit them. Owning a computer aids people in keeping distant friends and family closely connected. Let's acknowledge that the world is increasingly reliant on technology and computers. If young people commence using computers earlier in life, it will facilitate their pursuit of better employment. Many jobs demand technological skills for recruitment; thus, having access to a computer at a younger age automatically prepares young adults for life. Moreover, there is a computer in virtually every up - to - date workplace, including restaurants, hotels, retail stores, and even in the construction industry. In fact, computer skills are not merely desirable; they are essential. Finally, computers provide a swifter and more convenient way to discover new things and gain in - depth knowledge about different subjects. Instead of sifting through various books and encyclopedias for research, why not conduct an online search? Although the computer and internet should not entirely supplant books, they are invaluable research tools. Someone who has never visited the pyramids can easily research them, view remarkable pictures, learn about their ancient history, and acquire a wealth of knowledge. Computers can help you explore the world without leaving your home. Now is the time to decide whether you believe computers have a positive impact on people. For the reasons of maintaining contact, etc.
1742	1746	1	1	"Although computers can consume a significant amount of an individual's time, there are also substantial advantages to possessing one. One can amass a wealth of knowledge and facilitate interaction with others with a mere click of the cursor. The computer is an incredibly intelligent device. It encompasses all the facts of life and the world. Consider the vast amount of knowledge one can acquire by perusing articles found on Google.com and other search engines. When pondering the optimal route to a destination, one can access maps of the entire world and zoom in to a bird's - eye view. With a single click of the cursor, a detailed map is at your disposal. If your child has a school - related question that you are unable to answer, there are educational websites that can illustrate and elucidate how to complete homework. Alternatively, if your child is unsure about their homework and their friends are unavailable to assist, most schools maintain websites containing comprehensive information about school activities. With a click of the cursor, you can access your child's grades. If you are running late for a party and do not have a cell phone, but your family has a computer and you know your friend will be online, you can log in to your Facebook, Twitter, or MySpace account and inform them of your delay. In this era, letter - writing has become obsolete; email and instant messaging have taken its place. Letters are time - consuming to write, and any error necessitates starting over. When typing, one simply presses the ""backspace"" key to correct mistakes. Letters also take an extended period to be received, whereas instant messages arrive instantaneously. If you haven't seen your cousin or simply wish to connect, computers are often equipped with webcams, or you can easily purchase a separate one. With a click of the cursor, you can engage in a face - to - face conversation with your friend on your computer screen. If you explore the capabilities of a computer, you will discover that it can offer far more than just learning and interaction."
1743	1747	1	1	Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computer technology is beneficial. I am of the opinion that computers have numerous positive impacts. Firstly, computers teach us to work independently without relying on others. Another advantage is that we can communicate with friends online. Additionally, it endows us with the ability to learn about it and navigate the web. Moreover, it enhances our hand - eye coordination. These are the reasons why I believe computers have positive effects. Regarding my first point, the ability to work independently is a significant benefit. After becoming accustomed to searching for relevant links on the computer, completing homework becomes easier. It also aids in gathering more information for homework, which can lead to better grades. Furthermore, working online allows us to complete tasks more efficiently. My second point is about the opportunity to communicate with friends online. If one does not possess a cell phone but wishes to talk to friends, the internet provides a viable alternative. It is also useful when one is in a difficult situation and can inform others of their inability to participate. Additionally, it enables us to communicate with relatives we have not seen for a long time. The final two aspects are the improvement of hand - eye coordination and the ability to surf the web. Using a computer enhances our dexterity as we learn to use our hands and fingers more rapidly. It also reduces our reliance on traditional typing methods. With time, one can become proficient in web navigation and easily locate any information. In conclusion, computers have numerous positive impacts. They teach us how to type, search the web, and acquire knowledge about it. As demonstrated, these are the reasons why I believe computers have a positive influence.
1744	1748	1	1	Dear local newspaper: I firmly contend that computer technology has a negative impact on the members of our society. Members of our society are allocating an excessive amount of time to computers, while devoting insufficient time to exercise and interaction with family and friends. By taking action now, we can effect a change in the lives of thousands. First and foremost, it is imperative that we engage in daily exercise. Failing to incorporate exercise into our daily schedules potentially jeopardizes our health. Activities such as walking a dog, cycling, or taking a brisk jog in the park are just a few ways to enhance physical fitness. Participating in extracurricular activities also plays a crucial role in exercise. This not only benefits our physical well - being but also our mental health. Finally, contributing to local community service projects is another form of exercise. Regular exercise is one effective way to keep us active and away from the computer. Additionally, interacting with family and friends can help us reduce our computer usage. Playing games is an excellent way to strengthen family bonds. It can bring us closer to our loved ones and enable them to understand us better. Moreover, playing with friends helps develop social skills, which may prove beneficial in the future. By interacting with family and friends, we can learn to relax and let life unfold naturally. This is another valuable technique that can enhance the quality of our lives and shield us from the allure of the computer. In conclusion, techniques such as exercise and interaction with family and friends can help us stay away from the computer. By collaborating and implementing these methods, we can eliminate the computer from our daily routines.
1745	1749	1	1	Dear newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are excellent tools for researching various things, such as cars, or for finding information about people, places, and objects. Social media platforms are highly advantageous as they allow us to maintain contact with family and friends. For example, we can send emails, engage in webcam chats, and send instant messages. I believe that a large number of people should embrace social media because they offer a wide range of functionalities. One can save pictures, download music, and play games. Some people claim that others spend too much time on social media. However, I think they should, as it provides an opportunity to learn new and diverse things about different countries, cities, or even states. I do not perceive any harm in spending time on social media platforms.
1746	1750	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, In the contemporary era, individuals across the globe are extensively utilizing computers. While some individuals contend that this trend is unfavorable, I firmly oppose this view. I am of the conviction that computers exert a positive influence on an individual's lifestyle. Computers facilitate interpersonal communication, are continuously evolving, and offer numerous benefits to children.  Computers undeniably assist people in maintaining contact. There are platforms such as @CAPS1, MySpace, Twitter, Facebook, email, and even video chat. For instance, my cousin resides in @LOCATION1, and occasionally, we engage in video chats via the computer. Without this technology, our communication with him would be severely limited. A significant number of people worldwide employ computers for communication purposes, which is how computers enable individuals to stay connected.  Moreover, computers are currently remarkable and are only destined to improve. Given their current state of advancement, one can only imagine their capabilities in @NUM1 or @NUM2 years. Additionally, as more people purchase and utilize computers, companies will be more motivated to develop innovative models. Evidently, the future of computers is promising.  The final reason I wish to share is that computers greatly benefit children. On average, approximately @PERCENT1 of children in the @CAPS2.S use a computer daily. Children utilize computers to interact with friends, play games, complete homework, and engage in various other activities. Furthermore, both children and adults rely on computers when they need to acquire knowledge or locate places in their vicinity. This is how computers contribute to the development and well - being of children.  As is evident, computers are employed globally for a multitude of reasons. They facilitate communication, are constantly improving, and benefit children. Since everyone is embracing computer technology, shouldn't you?
1747	1751	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly assert that computers do not confer as many benefits upon society as commonly perceived. I opine that nature can offer all the qualities that any computer can provide. A computer is incapable of offering physical fitness, genuine interactions with family and friends, or real - world experiences.  Did you know that, according to @CAPS1 @PERSON1, an expert from @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of children in @LOCATION2 are overweight due to a lack of exercise, with computer systems being the primary cause? Thus, how can a system that leads to obesity be regarded as beneficial to society?  Furthermore, overweight children who spend @NUM1 hours on computers often neglect healthy activities such as basketball or tennis. This not only leaves them socially disadvantaged but also deprives them of valuable life experiences, leading me to my next point.  People tend to believe that computers possess all knowledge, yet in reality, there are very few experiences that can be truly gained from a computer. For example, you may read about World War @CAPS2 in @MONTH1, but can you truly understand what people were thinking or what combat felt like? A computer cannot teach you emotions; only real - life experiences can achieve this. If you were deployed to an army in @LOCATION1, you would understand the true nature of war, whereas playing a game or reading an article cannot provide such an experience.  My third explanation for the limited positive impact of computers on society pertains to real - life interactions with family and friends. There is only one authentic way to connect with family or friends, and that is in person. People claim to communicate with their loved ones via the @CAPS3 frequently, but true satisfaction can only be attained through face - to - face encounters. For example, a romantic relationship would likely fail if the only mode of communication were through the @CAPS3, unlike successful relationships where in - person interactions are present.  I hope this letter to your newspaper will capture people's attention. I would appreciate it if you joined my cause and helped safeguard society from the potentially harmful effects of computer technology, which can lead to obesity, poor relationships, and a lack of real - world experience.
1748	1752	1	1	"Computers represent remarkable technology; however, they exert a detrimental impact on people's lives. Computers contribute to children's academic underperformance and a lack of physical exercise. Moreover, children expose themselves to danger by joining certain websites. Do not squander your time fixated on a dull computer screen!  I am nearly @PERCENT1 certain that students who perform poorly in school are those who return home, discard their backpacks in the hallway, and immediately engage in trivial online games. My mother used to complain incessantly about my father spending excessive time on @CAPS1, even though he only spent @NUM1 minutes a day communicating with family members. Now, my mother has created a @CAPS1 account, which she initially claimed would only be used for family communication. However, she now spends her time playing pointless applications like ""Cafe World"" whenever she is at home, instead of spending quality time with the family or socializing with friends.  I, too, was once one of those students who would come home, toss my belongings in the hallway, and turn on the computer. Unlike others, I did not play games online but rather chatted with friends I had just seen. It was only after receiving my report card that I realized my grades were abysmally poor. My father then disconnected my @CAPS4, and I believe this has led to an improvement in my academic performance. Initially, I resented my father for this action, but now I am grateful for him breaking my disappointing habit of being online constantly. He also pointed out to my sister that she was losing out on physical exercise because of her online gaming.  In many respects, computers are futile. Are you aware of the potential dangers of some websites? I once watched a television show at my aunt's house, which featured an unsettling story of an old man who created a website where teenagers were required to videotape themselves choking, with the one who lasted the longest winning. Approximately a hundred students lost their lives due to this deadly game.  There is also ""BlogTV.com,"" a website where teenagers go live on webcam, allowing anyone to watch. I recall a week when my cousin Denise and her best friend competed to see who could attract more viewers. The two girls engaged in inappropriate behavior such as flashing, dirty dancing, and exposing body parts. They were subsequently banned from the website, but not before people had taken screenshots and posted pictures of them. This kind of behavior should not be tolerated; it is disturbing.  Stop wasting your life, people! Go out and enjoy yourself. Do not let the @CAPS4 confine you to your home. The @CAPS4 is both unsafe and pointless."
1749	1753	1	1	To Whom It May Concern, @MONTH1, I pose the question: How many hours a day do you spend on the computer? I suspect the answer is an excessive amount. Computers are distorting the minds of people worldwide, and in my view, we should revert to the way things were in the past.  Some individuals may disagree, arguing that computers are beneficial for school - going children. While this may hold some truth, it is important to note that just a couple of decades ago, the average student did not even own a computer, yet schools were effectively teaching the same curriculum. Moreover, some children use computers to cheat on homework assignments and essays, which clearly does not contribute to the educational process.  Another reason why computers may not benefit society is the inherent dangers they pose. Sexual predators lurk on the internet, and many people engage in conversations with strangers online without realizing the potential harm.  A third reason is that computers cannot replace real - world experiences. For example, you may read about World War @CAPS2 in @MONTH1, but can you truly understand the thoughts and feelings of those involved? Only real - life experiences can provide such insights.  As you can see, I am deeply concerned about the negative effects of computers on society for multiple reasons. I hope you can share my perspective and join me in addressing these issues.
1750	1754	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, As the purveyors of daily written content, I would like to prompt you to pen a reaction regarding computers. Computers enable @LOCATION3 to learn about distant places, enhance hand - eye coordination, and facilitate online communication. Given that computers are an integral part of daily life, their benefits deserve to be highlighted.  Firstly, computers allow @LOCATION3 to explore faraway places without leaving their rooms. One of my mother's friends decided to relocate to @LOCATION2. Since she was not fond of computers, she did not research @LOCATION2's laws, stating that she would learn them upon arrival. Unfortunately, she was arrested multiple times in her first few years due to insufficient knowledge of the laws. A few months after her last arrest, she returned to @LOCATION3, where she was more familiar with the legal framework. @LOCATION2 is a beautiful country, and all her arrests were accidental because of her lack of legal knowledge. A mere ten - minute search on a computer for @LOCATION2's laws could have prevented these unfortunate incidents.  Secondly, computers improve hand - eye coordination. According to a survey, @PERCENT1 of children who spend more time on computers perform better in tennis and baseball than their peers. @PERSON3, a gym teacher at @ORGANIZATION2, remarks, ""Some of these children who spend time on computers may seem weak and need more exercise."" However, the overall data suggests a positive correlation between computer use and hand - eye coordination.  As the local newspaper, you have the power to express your views on the impact of computers on people. I firmly believe that computers have a profound positive impact as they enhance hand - eye coordination, provide knowledge about faraway places, and enable communication. In fact, @PERCENT2 of people concur with my stance on computers.  Using computers enhances hand - eye coordination. For example, my grandmother attributes her well - developed hand - eye skills to her daily computer use, which involves typing and researching. Computers are designed to improve the focus of both hands and eyes.  Computers are a treasure trove of information about faraway places. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 states, ""I rely on computers for my work as they help me discover new things. Moreover, my wife and I use them to research details for our planned trips."" Many people agree with @PERSON2's view. Although some may claim that computers sometimes provide inaccurate information, if you find a reliable website, it will offer trustworthy data.  When you use computers, you can engage in online conversations or video chats with friends and family worldwide. This is particularly beneficial when you have not seen your relatives for a long time and cannot afford to visit them. Video chat has brought people closer together and offers a new perspective on the world. Instead of exhausting your cell phone minutes, consider purchasing a laptop or computer with a camera for video chatting.  In conclusion, computers offer excellent hand - eye coordination training, access to information about faraway places, and seamless communication. I encourage you to spread the word that computers are useful and are used daily without significant issues. When you share the view that spending time on computers can be educational, you will bring smiles to many faces."
1751	1755	1	1	"I am of the opinion that the reason individuals utilize the computer so extensively is that a majority might be required to engage in work or perhaps complete a project on it. Nevertheless, I comprehend the point made in the article stating that ""Some experts are concerned that people are allocating an excessive amount of time to their computers and less to exercising."" Predominantly, young adolescents begin using the computer at an early age and become addicted, as there are numerous activities available on it, such as downloading games for free and interacting with others. People across the globe use it, yet one might wonder if anyone truly has free time when playing video - games on the computer. In fact, most adults do not play games on the computer; instead, they conduct work or research articles. After that, they resume their daily routines. However, a significant number of teenagers are on the computer daily and rarely engage in physical exercise.  The internet has introduced a plethora of advanced technologies. Over the past few years, one can search for old friends from former schools on the web or chat with strangers from all over the world. One can have an @NUM1 @CAPS1 and purchase new songs or albums instead of visiting a local store, or even shop online and have the clothes delivered. In the past, such conveniences were unthinkable, and one could also rent or buy movies to store on their @CAPS2."
1752	1756	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, on a splendid sunny day, individuals remain indoors using their computers rather than relishing the weather. This is the consequence of excessive computer usage. I am convinced that computers have an adverse impact on people, as their communication skills will deteriorate, they will not engage in sufficient physical activity, and their health may be impaired.  As previously mentioned, those who use a computer on a regular basis will experience a decline in their communication skills. People enter chat rooms without knowing the identities of those they are conversing with. For instance, if I logged into a chat room, someone might request personal information such as my residence, phone number, and name. This could lead to serious consequences such as kidnapping and even rape. Additionally, interactions with family members and friends are likely to decrease. One could be engrossed in playing a computer game online or watching random videos on YouTube. YouTube is regarded as a perilous platform for younger children. Kids might access the browsing history and accidentally click on an inappropriate website.  Furthermore, teenagers and adults frequent Facebook and Twitter. Some may claim that these platforms transform social interactions, but in reality, they do not. Children and adults are constantly becoming addicted to them. Moreover, constantly sharing every detail of one's daily life is somewhat unrealistic. People do not need to be informed about every activity in our day; if we do not maintain our communication skills, they are certain to decline.  Secondly, physical exercise is a significant issue. Doctors state that @PERCENT1 of parents are obese or overweight according to @ORGANIZATION1. Children simply sit at home, play computer games like The Sims @NUM1, and video - chat with friends instead of socializing in person. People rarely go for walks anymore, nor do they venture out to enjoy nature. @PERSON1, from a state @LOCATION1 away from @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2, remarked, ""Each year, the number of people visiting parks is decreasing. Soon, all parks may have to be closed."" @CAPS2 do not want this to occur, do you? I certainly do not. Our generations are becoming increasingly technology - dependent.  Finally, more and more people are becoming unhealthy. A person's eyesight is likely to deteriorate if they use the computer daily. My aunt is obliged to use her computer at work every day. She visited her eye doctor because her vision was weakening. One of the first questions the doctor asked was whether she used a computer regularly. She answered affirmatively, and the doctor informed her that she would require cataract eye surgery. This was a direct result of computer usage. Additionally, one can develop arthritis in their hands and fingers from continuous typing and mouse - use. Many people in their forties may need hand surgeries due to excessive computer work.  As is evident, technology is harming our communication skills, physical activity, and health. I am certain that we do not want this for future generations. Therefore, take action and contact your local newspaper today."
1753	1757	1	1	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers exert a negative influence on people's lives. Computers consume a substantial amount of people's time, which could be dedicated to more significant matters. The internet also harbors a large quantity of inappropriate content that children should not be exposed to. Above all, there are numerous pedophiles online targeting young children. These are all manifestations of the negative impact of computers on people's lives.  Computers occupy an excessive amount of valuable time that could be utilized for other, more crucial undertakings. The childhood obesity rate in America is on the rise. Undoubtedly, electronics play a major role in this phenomenon. For example, my brother spends every day on the computer and rarely goes outside. He has allowed the computer and the internet to dominate his life, leaving no space for other activities.  Moreover, there is a vast amount of content on the internet, ranging from songs to websites containing pornography. Most sites do not even alert users that they need to be @NUM1 or older to view the content, and very few actually request proof of age. There are millions of such sites, and it is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention.  Above all else, there are millions of predators on the internet, preying on young teens. It is truly abhorrent. There are countless chat sites where people can meet. Pedophiles use aliases on these websites, pretending to be teens and children. Their objective is to lure young teens into meeting them in a secluded location and commit sexual assault. Some victims are brave enough to speak up, but unfortunately, most are too afraid or ashamed to do so. This is all made possible through the internet.  For these reasons, I assert that computers have a negative impact on people's lives. Although there are some positive aspects, the negative aspects, such as the occupation of time and inappropriate internet content, outweigh the positives. I genuinely believe that the world would be better off without computers.
1754	1758	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, the utilization of computers by millions of individuals on a daily basis is a prevalent phenomenon. In my view, computer technology exerts a positive influence on people. I hold this belief because people employ computers for research purposes. They also use computers to communicate with those at a distance, and computers even serve as a news source.  In my opinion, computers simplify various tasks. They are highly beneficial, enabling users to conduct research on diverse topics. If one has a computer, they can acquire knowledge about places they were previously unaware of. For instance, when faced with a homework assignment, there is no need to rely solely on books; one can simply use their computer to obtain information.  Computers are constantly being used for multiple purposes. However, I believe that people primarily use computers for communication. Through computers, one can interact with friends and family members residing in other states. Instead of sending letters via mail, people now use emails and instant messaging, which allows for faster and more convenient communication.  Computers have a positive impact on people, making certain aspects of life significantly easier. I fail to comprehend why some might consider them to have a negative influence. In the year @DATE1, computers are utilized for virtually everything. Recall the time when we had to read newspapers to stay informed about breaking news and important events. Nowadays, with the advent of computers, many people no longer read newspapers. On a computer, one can access the entire newspaper and even gain more in - depth knowledge about global events. So, what is the point of reading a newspaper when one has a computer?  I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people's lives as they offer a wide range of capabilities, including information research, communication, and news access. Does this not make life considerably easier? Then, why do some people think that computers have a negative effect on people?
1755	1759	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, excessive daily use of a computer can be a waste of one's life. Computer usage can detract from time spent on exercise and enjoying nature, distract from genuine human interaction, and also consume a significant amount of energy.  Imagine sitting at your desk, chatting with friends online. Remove the computer, and all you're doing is sitting there, expending no calories and exercising no muscles (except for your fingers). Don't you think you should engage in more meaningful activities, such as taking a walk and appreciating nature? Obesity is a prevalent issue in @LOCATION1, with @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 being considered ""overweight"". Why would you even contemplate spending your day merely sitting in a chair? Visit the gym and shed some of that excess body weight!  Communication through @CAPS5's is highly overrated, as people struggle to express their true emotions. All they can do is send a smiley or happy face. Communicating solely with friends can cause one to miss out on important information. For example, suppose there is a work - place cancellation announced on the news, but you fail to see it because you were engrossed in chatting with a friend. Moreover, @PERCENT2 of people do not even genuinely ""laugh out loud"" when they send that expression to their friends. Instead of going to a friend's house and having a real - life laugh, one might simply type @CAPS6. Instead of gasping in surprise, one might say ""@CAPS9!"" People should get out and engage in real - world communication.  Furthermore, even if you've purchased energy - efficient lights, running your computer daily negates any energy savings. Running that @CAPS11 consumes approximately the same amount of energy as @NUM1 regular light bulbs in @NUM2 hours. Is that light really saving you that much money? With the current poor state of the economy, we cannot afford to waste energy and money on online gaming. Someone will have to work overtime this week, and it won't be me.  I do not believe that hairspray is the cause of the ozone layer depletion. Computers are detrimental and lack sufficient justification for their extensive use. They prevent us from enjoying nature, reduce our communication capabilities, and waste a significant amount of energy. Therefore, my point stands."
1756	1760	1	1	We can all concur that computer usage is a highly controversial issue. In my view, I am of the opinion that computers exert a detrimental effect on individuals. For example, it is unsafe, and children can access a plethora of content on the internet. Additionally, people currently spend an inordinate amount of time in front of the computer. Undoubtedly, it is a significant distraction and has a negative impact on children's schoolwork. It's now or never! Shall we determine that computers have a negative effect? You be the judge! Isn't every parent's greatest concern the safety of their children? When online, kids can access anything and everything. Sometimes, kids don't even seek out inappropriate content; it simply appears. Would you desire your child to view content over which you have no control? Moreover, websites like @CAPS2.com are among the greatest concerns regarding internet safety. Although one is supposed to be at least @NUM1 to have a @CAPS2, most kids deceive about their age. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS2 users lie about their age? And it's not always a @NUM4 - year - old claiming to be @NUM1; it could be a @NUM6 - year - old stating they're @NUM7! Not only do people lie about their age, but they also fabricate their identities. Is this the kind of internet exposure you wish for your children? Put an end to this immediately! More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are overweight and unhealthy. This is another adverse effect that computers have on people. It's a splendid @DATE1 day. The skies are a brilliant blue, the clouds resemble cotton candy, the sun is shining, and there's a pleasant warm breeze. A perfect day to go out and be active, right? Wrong! Most people would rather be inside on the computer. Instead of going for a walk, people would rather spend hours on Facebook. This is a serious concern for our health. People don't exercise enough as it is, and when computers are added to the equation, people will never become active! Instead of playing online video games, people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun neighborhood game of baseball is equally enjoyable and far more beneficial. This is just one step @CAPS3 need to take to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Wouldn't you agree? Did you know that kids who spend more time on the computer are more likely to perform poorly in school? Surely, if nothing else can convince you of the negative effects of a computer, this will. Rather than coming home and doing homework, more time is spent in front of the computer. As a student, I will admit that the computer is an extremely tempting distraction and can easily divert a student from their studies. You can't expect a child to make the right decision and say they have to go because they need to study. So, you should! Take action now, or your child will definitely suffer. The time has come to decide. Do you believe computers have a negative effect on people? It's evident that the computer is not safe. Not to mention, too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active. Most importantly, computers will negatively affect children's grades. Don't wait another minute! Let's reach an agreement and take action about this.
1757	1761	1	1	"Dear @PERSON1, Computers are highly beneficial in daily activities; however, they also possess a detrimental aspect. Some users are addicted to their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, distancing themselves from friends and family, and they neglect exercise. While it is enjoyable to use the @CAPS4, one should not overindulge. Some individuals are nearly addicted to their @CAPS4. I can't fault them, as they can charge their iPod, tweet, listen to music, play games, and engage in numerous other activities simultaneously! Computers are excellent, but excessive use can cause one to miss out on numerous activities. People almost feel (some actually do) that they must log on to Facebook to harvest their crops in Farmtown or manage their @LOCATION1 on @CAPS3. They become so engrossed that they overlook their important daily activities. It shouldn't be this way, yet it has become an epidemic; everyone is being drawn into their computers! People who are constantly on their @CAPS4 are estranged from their friends and family. They might say, ""Oh, I haven't talked to him since his surgery. I wonder how he is! Let's see!"" They then log on. You can communicate with someone with just a click! However, chatting with someone on Facebook or Twitter is not the same as interacting with them in person! It's as if people believe that the @CAPS4 isolates them from their friends and family, causing them to communicate solely on Facebook. When people are glued to the @CAPS4, they become lethargic. A person addicted to the @CAPS4 might say, ""@CAPS5 supposed to go to the gym, but let me check my Twitter first!"" Two hours later, they finally head to the gym! People don't exercise as frequently as they should. When people plan to spend @NUM2 minutes on the @CAPS4, it often turns into @NUM3 hours! They have to sign in, chat with friends, check their mail, look at their tweets, check out their restaurant, watch videos on YouTube, and engage in various other activities! Computers are useful but have side - effects such as addiction, social isolation, and a lack of exercise. @CAPS4 addicts should reduce their time spent on the @CAPS4."
1758	1762	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 are concerned that people spend an excessive amount of time on the computer and insufficient time outdoors enjoying nature or exercising. I am writing this letter to inform you that there are several advantages to using the computer. Firstly, both kids and adults can communicate with their friends online. You might be thinking that kids already see their friends at school, but what if @CAPS2 have moved? They could have relocated to a different city, state, or even country, and the only means to stay connected with them is through the computer. They can't call each other because they are so far apart; that would result in a hefty phone bill. Seventy - five percent of people communicate with their friends via the computer. Approximately half of these individuals are chatting with friends who reside in another state or country. Do you truly want people to lose touch with their friends? Secondly, people can actually make new friends on the computer, similar to pen - pals. Pen - pals are individuals you correspond with but who do not live in the same state as you, or sometimes not even in the same country. This can be an assignment at school, but you can also do it on your @CAPS2. If your pen - pal doesn't live in the same country as you and doesn't speak fluent @CAPS3, you can teach them @CAPS3, and they can teach you their language. Finally, there is a way to regulate kids' computer usage. You could impose a limit on their computer time. If @CAPS2 wants to play a game on the ""@CAPS5"" and plays on the computer one day, and the next day another @CAPS2 wants to use the computer and throws a tantrum, the parent should confiscate the computer for the next day, and so on. Once your child finally cooperates, they will regain access to the computer. As you can see, there are numerous things to do on the computer, from chatting with distant friends to making new ones and implementing a computer schedule. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter."
1759	1763	1	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1, are you aware that over half of our nation owns home computers? Recently, however, some experts have been deliberating whether computers are beneficial to society. I have been requested to express my opinion, and I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact because they are indispensable for work, facilitate online socialization, and enhance travel opportunities. After reading this, I am confident you will concur. Firstly, computers are essential for work and @ORGANIZATION1. Students store their essays, study guides, and homework updates in files on the @CAPS5. Offices would be unable to function without computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interview with a student from @ORGANIZATION1 revealed, ""I use my @CAPS5 for everything; I would be unable to manage the workload without @CAPS3."" When @CAPS2 inquired why, the student replied, ""@CAPS3 keeps everything organized and is a more efficient way to research topics."" A lawyer stated, ""You cannot represent a client effectively without the appropriate tools, and a @CAPS5 is one of those tools."" Without computers, offices would collapse, and students' grades would decline. Can you envision writing a newspaper without a @CAPS5? Secondly, internet access enables people to meet new individuals. Many websites, such as '@CAPS6' and '@CAPS7', allow people to reconnect with old friends and forge new relationships. @PERCENT1 of the nation has accounts on socializing websites, and @PERCENT2 of the nation claims that their friend groups have expanded (according to a poll). A psychologist explains, ""Some people are too timid to meet new friends in person; they blossom online."" Without the internet, citizens in @LOCATION1 would have limited knowledge of people from other countries. My next reason is even more compelling. Lastly, without the internet, people would engage in far less travel. The internet allows citizens to research destinations they wish to visit and purchase transportation to their desired location. @CAPS3 is also an efficient and convenient way to book accommodation for tourists. A poll conducted by @ORGANIZATION2 airports indicates that @PERCENT3 of travelers book their flights online. Without online ticketing, 'the wait to book flights would be unbearably long, or it would deter travelers altogether' (quote from a worker). My colleagues and I visited various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed @NUM1 people at each location. We asked how they booked their tickets, and @PERCENT4 of them said they did so online. ""How do you think we do it? Of course, on the internet! No one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!"" said one interviewee. Airports contribute to the @LOCATION2 government's revenue, and without online ticketing, fewer people would travel. Therefore, computers are indispensable. Computers have a positive impact on users as they enable easy organization and research, online socialization, and efficient travel booking. Without computers and internet access, our businesses would falter, and the economy would follow suit. I am certain you agree with me."
1760	1764	1	1	Dear @PERSON1, The advancing technology is having a profoundly negative impact on people. Due to computers, people are spending an excessive amount of time on them and insufficient time engaging in activities that are more beneficial. Firstly, spending too much time on the computer can be detrimental to your health in multiple ways. For instance, staring at a bright computer screen for more than @NUM1 minutes at a time is extremely harmful to your eyes. The brightness can damage your eyes and lead to severe vision loss. Additionally, if you spend all your time indoors on the computer, you will not get the exercise you need. @PERSON1, are you aware that for every @NUM2 minutes you spend on the computer, you should spend @NUM2 minutes outdoors? It is crucial to get fresh air, sunlight, and exercise. Moreover, another issue with computers is that they impede genuine human interaction. When chatting online, you cannot discern what the other person is feeling, @PERSON1, or even if you are actually talking to the person you think you are. It is far better to interact with people face - to - face. To maintain good social health, you need to socialize with friends, laugh, and have a great time, rather than sitting in a dark room chatting with online friends. @PERSON1, people need to interact with real individuals. Furthermore, computers can be highly distracting to many. For example, @PERSON1, suppose you need to type an article for the paper on the computer, but you decide to play a game for a moment, look something up, or chat with a friend. You tell yourself it will only take a minute, and then you'll write the article. However, suddenly, you've played for @NUM4 hours. Then you have to stay up late to finish. Computers are extremely distracting. People of all ages struggle with being distracted by computers and failing to complete their work. In conclusion, although computers represent an advancement in technology, they have significant negative side effects. @PERSON1, I believe it is our responsibility to inform people about the negative side effects of computers. It is our duty to assist people in overcoming these side effects. Please, @PERSON1, we need to write an article in the paper to warn people of the terrible effects of computers.
1761	1765	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I contend that computers are advantageous as they afford the opportunity to learn about individuals, such as renowned figures who passed away long ago. Additionally, computers enable the exploration of diverse locations, including @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, and Texas. The pursuit of knowledge about other places is indeed enjoyable. Owning a computer is beneficial as it allows for web browsing, during which one can engage in games, view various content, and partake in numerous other activities that are likely to be appealing. Moreover, it facilitates communication with friends from afar through platforms like MySpace, Yahoo, and other websites, where one can interact with different individuals encountered via the web.
1762	1766	1	1	"Mankind has consistently harbored an interest in technology, with computers being but one facet. I opine that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. They cultivate hand - eye coordination, conserve trees, and empower people to acquire knowledge about virtually everything. Hand - eye coordination is an indispensable element in our daily lives. Activities such as driving a car or writing all necessitate this skill. I recall that a few years ago, my hand - eye coordination was subpar, and I struggled to catch a ball. Nowadays, I spend up to an hour and a half on the computer. I have observed that my handwriting has become neater, and I can now catch balls with ease. Would you want to be the one to cause a car accident due to poor hand - eye coordination? Computers not only enhance hand - eye coordination but also contribute to tree conservation. Utilizing a computer obviates the need for paper. One can read and write without using a single sheet. As a result of computers, @PERCENT1 of tree - cutting has ceased. Saving trees is crucial for our survival as they release the oxygen we breathe. Some assert that computers are causing people to spend less time appreciating nature. However, I believe that without computers, there would be little nature left to enjoy. Lastly, computers assist people worldwide in learning about almost anything. A science kid, the head scientist, states that ""with the computer, we are able to inform the world of our discoveries more effectively."" @CAPS1. @PERSON1 remarks, ""@CAPS2 many people are indebted to the computer as they learn @CAPS2 many nutrition facts from health sites."" Thanks to the computer, we found a doctor to treat my dad. The average person can learn about extraordinary things at any time. There are even dictionaries on the internet with numerous different translations that would typically require about @NUM1 books. The computer is one of the most remarkable technological advancements to date. It has benefited our world in @CAPS2 many different ways. Hand - eye coordination is @CAPS2 important, and it also helps preserve our environment. Without knowledge, one cannot progress in life. Our entire world depends on it."
1763	1767	1	1	It is certain that @NUM1 years from now, we will still be utilizing computers, likely for communicating with friends, conducting research, or typing up materials for @ORGANIZATION1. Computers are truly remarkable, enabling us to perform numerous tasks that are beyond our individual capabilities. Without computers, life as we know it would undoubtedly be vastly different. Firstly, computers facilitate communication with friends and family, allowing us to interact without leaving the safety of our homes. Consider the recent incident where a girl in @CAPS1 went to a friend's house to do homework. After finishing, when she attempted to walk home, she vanished. With computers, we can collaborate on homework with friends without venturing outside. Evidently, computers have significantly altered the way we live. Secondly, computers empower us to conduct research on unfamiliar subjects. They enable us to complete projects without relying on outdated books that may lack the required information. For instance, searching for @ORGANIZATION1 would provide a map indicating its location and access to the school's website, where we can obtain our homework for the night. Clearly, computers streamline tasks that would otherwise be time - consuming. Without a doubt, life would be radically different without them. @CAPS2, computers also allow us to complete homework, whether it involves research or simple typing. Most of our daily homework is computer - based. On @DATE1, we had to type a prompt about vending machines in our @ORGANIZATION1. In @NUM2 grade, almost every night, our homework is accessible on the @CAPS3. If we forget to write down our homework, the computer provides an alternative means of obtaining the information. Undoubtedly, computers have become an integral part of our academic lives. Furthermore, computers represent a significant technological advancement that we rely on constantly. They enable us to access valuable information about the world, communicate with friends and family globally, and assist us in achieving academic success in @ORGANIZATION1, whether it's homework or classwork. Without them, tasks would take two to three times longer to complete. Finally, I believe that those who oppose computers simply have not utilized them effectively.
1764	1768	1	1	I am of the opinion that the effects of computers are detrimental, and here are three reasons to support this view. @CAPS1, excessive use of computers can lead to blindness. The computer screen emits intense light, and when people spend an inordinate amount of time staring at it, they may lose their sight. It is crucial to limit screen time to avoid this risk. @CAPS2, individuals need to relax their eyes and engage in activities other than using computers. When people are overly engrossed in computers, they miss out on opportunities to interact with family and friends, enjoy the beauty of nature, or engage in hobbies such as reading, drawing, or watching @CAPS4. @CAPS3, people should reduce their computer usage. Using computers less not only allows for more quality time with loved ones but also helps save energy and reduces electricity bills. It also gives the eyes a much - needed rest. In conclusion, these three reasons - @CAPS1, the potential for blindness due to excessive use; @CAPS2, the need to relax the eyes and engage in other activities; and @CAPS3, the importance of reducing computer usage - clearly demonstrate that the effects of computers are quite negative.
1765	1769	1	1	Dear Editor, I believe that people are overusing computers, and the drawbacks outweigh the benefits. They are getting less exercise, missing out on the beauty of nature, and spending insufficient quality time with family and friends. Let's delve deeper. Firstly, people, especially children, are not getting enough physical activity. Excessive computer use has contributed to the growing problem of childhood obesity in America. Many adults also gain weight as they sit at computers for work and play games throughout the day. I conclude that computers are detrimental to our health. Secondly, people are neglecting to explore the wonders of nature. The Earth offers countless opportunities for discovery, such as finding new species of animals, fish, and plants. This is a clear indication (@NUM1) that computers are not serving us well. Thirdly, family and friends are not spending enough quality time together. Instead of interacting in person, they communicate via computers. More children are on the computer than sharing a family meal and having meaningful conversations. This is another reason (@NUM2) why computers are not beneficial. In conclusion, computers are consuming our attention, leading to a lack of exercise, a failure to appreciate nature, and a decrease in family - bonding time.
1766	1770	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, certain experts have expressed apprehensions that individuals are allocating an excessive amount of time to their computers, which poses a detriment to their well - being. However, they are in error. Computers facilitate human communication, learning, and even offer entertainment. For these very reasons, computers are advantageous.  Computers enable people to interact with their family and friends. Some individuals @MONTH1 contend that phones are superior to computers for communication purposes. Nevertheless, computers are more suitable for long - distance communication, and one will never encounter a busy signal. Some phone services are exorbitantly priced, and long - distance calling incurs even greater costs. Conversely, with a computer, one can send emails across the globe at no additional expense. Moreover, with a computer, one never gets placed on hold or hears a busy signal. One simply sends the message and can then engage in other activities while awaiting a reply.  Computers also play a role in educating people. Numerous individuals enroll in classes, particularly college - level courses, online. In fact, approximately half of the individuals currently taking college classes are not even physically present in a school. This is beneficial for many individuals who are occupied with work throughout the day, as they can obtain their degrees at their convenience. Additionally, computers can assist people with minor queries, such as ""where is the nearest @ORGANIZATION1"" or ""how much does something cost."" Computers can even aid people in planning a vacation or learning about a country on the other side of the world.  Computers can also serve as a source of entertainment for people. Those in need of a mood - lift can watch a humorous video with a simple click of a button. Someone experiencing boredom can play one of the countless games that have been developed, ranging from trivial to addictive, and from small - scale to large - scale. For all the @CAPS4 enthusiasts out there, the computer presents an alternative. An alternative where songs and music videos are free of charge. Of course, computers are not portable like a device that fits in one's pocket, but there is always the option of a laptop. Based on the foregoing, it is evident that computers enhance people's lives as they offer education, communication, and entertainment."
1767	1771	1	1	"Computers represent a highly controversial topic, in my opinion. Although they may not be entirely beneficial, it does not imply that when used appropriately, they cannot be an indispensable part of life. Computers are beneficial in numerous aspects; they can function as an information hub. Social networks can enhance children's interaction with the world. During the school period, children are assigned projects, and without computers, the situation would be challenging. Read on as I elaborate in detail.  Computers, as is well - known, are among the world's most significant information sources. @NUM1 out of ten surveyed individuals stated that computers are an essential part of daily life. The earthquake in Haiti is currently being reported, but half of the world would remain unaware of this event without computers. Therefore, have compassion and do not deprive the world of its most valuable information.  Secondly, what would your reaction be if I informed you that children are more socially isolated than ever before? Well, it is indeed true. Over @NUM2 of the world's population relies on interactive websites to communicate with one another. As a matter of fact, children have more online friends than ever. Do you wish to be the one who stands in the way of this? Do you want to be known as the person who prevents children from fully experiencing life? I think not.  Lastly, all students in school utilize computers for projects. For instance, @PERSON2 had extremely poor handwriting, and this was the most crucial project of the year. So, he turned to his computer to type it. But what if there were no computers? @PERSON2 would have received a @CAPS2 - for the project. In fact, teachers @CAPS3 often instruct students to type their homework or projects. @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS3 year, students pass my class by typing. If they didn't, they would all fail!"" @CAPS4 has grasped the point, but more importantly, have you?  To summarize for those who are too indolent to read the entire essay, computers are essential for daily requirements such as gathering information, making friends, or completing projects. So, will you be the one who remains passive and allows this situation to persist, or will you take action to put an end to this madness once and for all? The choice is yours, but consider the socially isolated, uneducated children who fail their grades @CAPS3 year."
1768	1772	1	1	Dear Newspaper Readers, @CAPS1, how many hours per day do you spend on the computer? In this contemporary world, it appears increasingly difficult for you to disengage from that reliable computer screen and confront real life. Nearly everyone in @LOCATION1 owns a computer, approximately @PERCENT1, and this phenomenon is having a detrimental impact on our country.  With so many hours squandered in the virtual realm, people are lacking physical exercise, which gives rise to numerous problems. They are also shunning the natural world outside and losing touch with family and friends. I believe that computers are causing an excessive number of issues, and perhaps, after considering my evidence, you may come to the same conclusion.  Statistically, @ORGANIZATION1 is the most overweight country. One of the contributing factors? Hours spent sitting at the computer supplant healthy exercise. We are all devoting our lives to the computer, and sitting and clicking do not constitute exercise. The severe lack of exercise is resulting in health problems. Lack of physical activity can lead to obesity, which severely damages joints. Subsequently, diabetes develops, diminishing the quality of your life. Finally, there is heart disease, a leading cause of death in our country. Can all this be attributed to spending time on the computer? You @MONTH1 may wonder if the amount of time we spend on computers is even more harmful than this.  Every day possesses its own unique beauty, and sometimes, what is beautiful to us (in the context of the outdoors) is a clear sky and a mild temperature. Such days occur quite frequently, but what do we do? We glance out the window and then return to texting on our @ORGANIZATION2 laptop. Our bodies require this @CAPS5, @CAPS5 @CAPS6. We obtain @CAPS2 from the sun, and without going outside, we do not receive it. Not venturing outdoors deprives our bodies of an important @CAPS5.  This issue affects more than just our health. Staying indoors on the computer prevents us from having genuine experiences. We learn things on the computer, but only in a virtual sense. What will happen when we are forced into the real world and are unable to perform effectively? Everyone cherishes having friends and family, so it is illogical why we would prefer to email them about trivial matters instead of engaging in face - to - face conversations. Instant messaging does not truly strengthen relationships, as conversations are pre - planned, and the other person does not get to know the real you. This weakens the bonds between people, and if we cannot interact effectively with our family, society as a whole will suffer.  Computers consume an excessive amount of our time and have a negative impact. Clearly, they are detrimental to people. Not only do they contribute to obesity, but they also deceive us into believing that we can achieve things that are only possible in the virtual world, and they cause a rift between close relationships. This situation is ruining @LOCATION1. A country cannot thrive when its population is sick, unproductive, and isolated. It is time to step away from the computer and embrace real life before the negative effects of computers destroy @LOCATION1.
1769	1773	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have recently learned that there are individuals who oppose the use of computers. They believe that people use computers excessively. However, I disagree with their view.  One reason for my disagreement is that computers enable individuals to communicate with others. This is an excellent feature! Suppose your friend has moved to another state. Wouldn't you still want to keep in touch? Given the high long - distance call rates, many people cannot afford frequent phone calls. How else would you be able to see your friend? Well, with a computer, you can send pictures or engage in video chats. Moreover, if you just want to send a short message like ""see you at @NUM1"", using a computer is free, while a phone call would incur costs.  Computers also enhance hand - eye coordination, which is crucial in our daily lives. You can play games, take quizzes and tests, attend online classes, and even listen to music, which is an important means of self - expression. There are also websites that teach you how to use a keyboard and operate electronic devices like a computer.  Furthermore, computers allow you to explore far - off places without physically being there. This is useful for completing a project on a place you have never visited, planning a family reunion or vacation, or finding a sunny spot for fun.  Many people argue that too many individuals are spending time in front of the computer instead of exercising and being outdoors. To address this issue, people should limit their computer and electronic device usage and then engage in physical activities or visit distant places.  In conclusion, computers improve hand - eye coordination, facilitate communication with others, and enable exploration of far - off places. Don't you think this is wonderful? Please give it some thought."
1770	1774	1	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2 (our local newspaper), it has come to my notice that an increasing number of people have started using computers. This represents a remarkable advancement in our society! Computers have a positive influence on people as they enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about distant places and individuals, and even facilitate online communication among people. Undoubtedly, computers are making a significant impact!  Firstly, computers have a positive effect on people by enhancing hand - eye coordination. This skill is constantly useful in daily life! Statistics indicate that sports players who own computers are @PERCENT1 more proficient in activities requiring manual dexterity (such as baseball or basketball) than those who do not own computers. Owning a computer also improves the way one uses their hands in other activities. Even simple tasks like driving a car or doing the dishes become easier due to the enhanced hand - eye coordination provided by computers. This is an outstanding benefit that computers offer to people.  In addition to improving hand - eye coordination, computers also assist in learning about distant places and people. Thanks to computer technology, it is easier to access this valuable information. ""@CAPS2 If I hadn't used my laptop for my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 report,"" says @PERSON1, a @NUM1 - grade student, ""I would never have finished. Books take so much time, and I learned a great deal about my topic from my computer!"" If you are planning a vacation, you can easily research your destination's location and culture using the advanced search engine on a computer. Why wouldn't you utilize a computer when it offers so much knowledge?  Finally, computers have a positive impact on people by facilitating communication. There are multiple ways to communicate, such as video chatting, @CAPS6 messaging, and even speaking directly to the person you wish to communicate with. ""I had to relocate from my best friend last @DATE1,"" says @PERSON3, a resident of @LOCATION1. ""With my computer, we can still communicate and maintain our friendship."" Computers are definitely an excellent means of staying in touch with friends and family.  In conclusion, computers have a positive influence on people as they enhance hand - eye coordination, enable learning about distant places and people, and facilitate online communication. So, @PERSON2, the growing number of computer users is a positive development! Ask yourself, how could computers positively impact your life?"
1771	1775	1	1	"Dear newspaper, I firmly believe that computers confer substantial benefits upon society. A computer can be likened to a comprehensive electronic dictionary, and it also plays a crucial role in safeguarding our soldiers from harm. Computers are akin to electronic encyclopedias, which greatly facilitate knowledge acquisition. Instead of painstakingly leafing through a dictionary page by page to find a word, one simply needs to access the internet, navigate to @LOCATION1, enter the word in the search box, and all relevant information will promptly appear. Whenever I am tasked with writing a paper, I typically turn to the internet for research. For instance, when I had to write a paper on @PERSON1, I accessed the internet, found a suitable website, took detailed notes, rephrased them in my own words, and created a works - cited page. I found this method far more efficient than spending time searching for relevant materials only to discover that there were only children's books available on the subject. Moreover, computers enable users to explore various locations such as @CAPS1 @LOCATION2. One can also utilize @ORGANIZATION1 to determine the geographical location of a place. Computers also function as large - scale cellphones with extensive keyboards. My elder sister frequently uses @CAPS2 on the computer to communicate with her friends, which has enhanced her typing skills. Additionally, platforms like @CAPS3 allow users to engage in games with friends while conversing in real - time. Finally, computers contribute significantly to the safety of our soldiers. When I watch ""Future Weapons,"" I observe unmanned helicopters that can be remotely controlled from hundreds of miles away. There is also a robot designed to detect and remove mines, which has saved numerous lives. During an interview with @CAPS4 @CAPS5 from the military, he stated, ""@CAPS6 utilize those helicopters regularly. @CAPS6 appreciate the fact that no personnel need to be on board, eliminating concerns about their safety."" In conclusion, computers benefit society as they serve as vast electronic encyclopedias, function as large - scale cellphones, and help protect our soldiers. In educational institutions, @CAPS6 rely on computers extensively for academic writing and research."
1772	1776	1	1	"Technology, particularly computers, has reached a significant scale. I am convinced that computers exert a positive influence on individuals. Those who use computers predominantly employ them for connecting with family members, conducting research, or maintaining a neat presentation of their work instead of using paper. I hold the view that individuals who do not recognize the positive impact of computers should refrain from squandering their time using them. @PERCENT1 of people solely use computers to stay in touch with family. Often, family members reside in distant locations or different states, making face - to - face interactions infrequent. This is why I consider video - chatting on the computer to be a valuable tool. Moreover, if a family event arises, one can send @CAPS1 - mail to @CAPS2 family members rather than making phone calls, as phone conversations can be time - consuming. Additionally, social media platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, or Twitter enable users to reconnect with old friends, not just family. ""@CAPS2, my teachers are pleased when I use the computer for my assignments. They say it is much neater,"" remarked @CAPS3 Romano from Strong Middle School. Teachers generally prefer students to use computers for their work. When writing a book report or a story, it is advisable to use software like Microsoft Word to ensure that the paper is easily readable for teachers. In a science class, if one needs to create a chart, using Excel can make the chart or graph appear more professional. Finally, when preparing a presentation on topics like bloody @DATE1 or little @CAPS4 nine, using PowerPoint is a better option than simply reading from note cards. Without search engines like Google or Yahoo, people would be at a loss. Computers are highly effective for research purposes. When students are tasked with a presentation, they can use computers to gather in - depth information on the topic. Additionally, during family discussions at dinner, if one is unfamiliar with the subject matter, they can quickly look it up online. Finally, if there is a disagreement with a friend regarding song lyrics, the internet can provide the answer. Once again, I am firmly convinced that computers have a positive impact on people, facilitating connections with friends and family, ensuring neatness in work, and enabling comprehensive research."
1773	1777	1	1	Dear Newspaper, Computers have undergone remarkable advancements since their inception. While some perceive computers as a medium that deteriorates mental faculties, others recognize them as powerful learning tools. Although computers can have a negative impact on children, their positive contributions to society are far more significant. They empower individuals to explore distant places and communicate with others online. Initially, computers can have adverse effects, especially when used as a means of babysitting children. When using a computer, one simply sits in front of a screen, fixated on images and text. Some parents resort to using computers to keep their children quiet instead of taking them outdoors. As a result, children growing up in such an environment may develop a limited range of skills, primarily focused on computer games. Children possess abundant energy and need to engage in productive activities rather than spending excessive time on computer games and chatting with friends. After a long day at school, they should interact with family members and participate in activities that promote physical health. By using the computer as a substitute for parental attention, parents may inadvertently lead their children towards obesity, as they engage in sedentary activities and neglect proper self - care. On the other hand, computers offer unparalleled opportunities for learning about distant places and people. Suppose your teacher assigns a last - minute writing assignment on @LOCATION2, due in a week. Traveling to @LOCATION2 to gather information would be both time - consuming and expensive. Visiting the library may also prove fruitless if there are no relevant books available. However, by using a computer, one can access an extensive amount of information about @LOCATION2 and complete the essay within a day if necessary. Similarly, if you plan to visit @LOCATION4 but have limited knowledge about it, you may feel insecure and like an inexperienced tourist. By conducting online research, you can learn about the local traditions, clothing styles, and other cultural aspects, enhancing your confidence and preparedness. Moreover, if you are interested in learning about a deceased famous person, the computer can provide a wealth of information, including pictures, achievements, and the path to their fame. Finally, computers facilitate online communication. Consider a scenario where your grandmother lives in @LOCATION3, and frequent phone calls would result in a high phone bill. In such cases, online communication becomes a cost - effective alternative. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION1. Due to the long distance, phone calls were expensive. After they acquired a computer, we purchased webcams and started communicating via @ORGANIZATION1. This not only allowed us to talk but also enabled us to see each other. If your friend does not have a phone and you need to obtain homework information, you can use online platforms such as AIM or Facebook to reach out. Since most people are online at some point during the day, you are likely to receive a prompt response. In conclusion, despite the potential negative impact on children, computers have a predominantly positive influence on society. They enable individuals to acquire knowledge about distant places and people and facilitate online communication.
1774	1778	1	1	Dear Newspaper, I opine that computers exert a considerable influence on people. @CAPS1 individuals often fail to engage in sufficient physical exercise as they are primarily focused on using their fingers to operate the computer. While using the computer, they tend to fixate solely on the screen, which is detrimental to their overall health. Another aspect is that @CAPS1 people may neglect proper nutrition. They often opt for quick and unhealthy junk food so that they can return to using the computer promptly. All these factors have an impact on @CAPS1 individuals. They may find themselves lacking the motivation to go out or engage in other activities, which is essential for a balanced lifestyle.
1775	1779	1	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, *@CAPS1*. Presently, I am able to enjoy my favorite @CAPS2 melodies. With a few simple clicks and the input of a specific word, I can watch a hilarious episode of ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 #@NUM1"". I navigate to my @CAPS5 page, feeling the smooth keys beneath my fingertips as I send @CAPS7 to my friend in @LOCATION3. These are merely a few of the numerous functions that my computer offers. As is evident, I rely on my computer for a multitude of purposes. I wholeheartedly advocate for the use of computers and consider them to be a valuable resource. However, the benefits of computers are not limited to these. There are numerous additional reasons to embrace computer usage. Firstly, if you aim to save on fuel costs, refrain from using conventional means of communication! I cannot emphasize enough that when you need to communicate with a friend located at a distance, avoid driving and wasting gasoline, or incurring high long - distance phone charges. Instead, utilize platforms such as @CAPS5, Facebook, Twitter, or other similar services that can save both money and fuel. Some individuals wish to communicate with their friends in @LOCATION2 but do not have access to these computer - based communication tools. Encourage them to adopt these platforms! Another common concern is the need for physical exercise. My response to this is straightforward. Many individuals are unaware of the correct methods of exercise, which often leads to self - injury. By conducting online research, they can discover painless, cost - free, and enjoyable workout routines that are highly effective, thereby avoiding physical and financial setbacks. Additionally, some people argue that individuals should spend more time in nature. However, I pose the question: what if one encounters a wild animal without prior knowledge, or becomes lost and is unsure about edible plants? As I often say, ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11"", and remember the utility of @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, when preparing a formal report or document, you naturally desire it to present a professional appearance. It has been observed that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 individuals in @LOCATION4 have messy handwriting, and 9/@NUM3 teachers frequently misinterpret words written in a sloppy manner. This highlights the advantage of using a computer, as it not only displays the words accurately but also corrects spelling errors through spell - check. In conclusion, the advantages of using a computer are numerous. To summarize, computers can save money, time, and fuel. They can provide valuable real - world information and help prevent spelling and legibility issues. Act now! Demonstrate to others the benefits of using computers and showcase the wonders of this remarkable device, which is not merely a time - waster but a life - enhancer."
1776	1780	1	1	"Dear Newspaper, I opine that computers stand among the most remarkable creations of all time. They enable individuals to communicate with those in distant locales, facilitate exploration of career and educational opportunities, and offer access to a plethora of subjects. Computers are designed to benefit society, not cause harm; thus, why refrain from utilizing them? With computers, one can converse with people across the globe or even in space, for that matter. You may not be aware, but all global communications rely on a computer. However, these are not the kind that anyone can readily purchase. They are satellites that orbit the planet from space. @PERSON1, a professor at @ORGANIZATION1, informed students at @ORGANIZATION3 that, ""A significant number of everyday items, such as cars and phones, all incorporate some form of computer technology."" Computers empower people to interact with one another. Beyond enabling communication, they assist millions in making educational and career choices. Most college - bound students have limited knowledge of available colleges. When my sister was selecting a college, she was indecisive. She sat down and researched hundreds of institutions. After narrowing down her options, she made her decision and chose @ORGANIZATION4, an institution she had never even heard of a couple of months prior. People frequently find themselves in such situations. At @ORGANIZATION2, a survey was conducted among students to determine their career aspirations. Subsequently, students spent the remainder of the week exploring different career options. @PERCENT1 of the students selected a different career after that one - week period. Have you ever heard the adage ""@CAPS3 is power""? It holds true, and computers are an excellent source of @CAPS3. They cover diverse subjects, including math, science, history, language, and much more. People should leverage this @CAPS3, as @PERSON2 stated at the @CAPS4 Francisco National Debate: ""@CAPS5 are a valuable tool when used appropriately, encompassing activities such as researching new places, studying math, and communicating. These are the intended uses of computers, not engaging in unwholesome games."" One can learn about numerous new places using a @CAPS5. In @NUM1 grade, my teacher assigned a report on a country. My friend and I discovered a place we had never heard of. With the @CAPS5, we gathered a wealth of information about it, such as its main income sources, exports, resorts, and recreational activities. After perusing the facts, one would surely concur that a @CAPS5 is a remarkable tool that warrants utilization. It enables communication, aids in educational decision - making, and offers access to various subjects like math, science, and language. I firmly believe that everyone should utilize a @CAPS5."
1777	1781	1	1	Mother! Did you know that the human body possesses only one liver? Initially, I was unaware; did you learn this from the computer? Recently, I've heard that some experts are concerned that people are allocating excessive time to computers and less to physical activity and enjoying nature. I contend that their concerns are unfounded, as computers cultivate an open - minded perspective and impart new knowledge. In fact, computers offer numerous benefits, including opportunities to acquire new information, engage in conversations with distant friends, and broaden one's horizons regarding travel. Computers significantly enhance an individual's intellectual life. Just yesterday, I learned that the human body cannot survive without its liver. Additionally, computers have alleviated my struggles in mathematics. Although teachers are available for assistance, they are not always accessible, such as when I am at home or on vacation and wish to review mathematical concepts. Computers also facilitate language learning, such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. Evidently, computers exert a substantial influence on a person's life. Two days ago, I engaged in a video chat with my grandparents in @LOCATION2. It was an extraordinary experience. After six years of separation, they had changed significantly, and I was beginning to forget their appearances. I was astonished to discover that a computer could enable a video chat from such a great distance. I fail to comprehend why experts are so worried about computers encroaching on people's lives. Consider the positive impact it has had on my family. I am certain that if an expert's family member were away for an extended period, they would yearn to communicate. Many individuals, such as those in the military, relish video chatting as it allows them to see their loved ones. A round - trip ticket to @LOCATION3 to behold the magnificent sights and savor the delectable cuisine. Look at that waterfall! Where is it? In @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1. Now, I am determined to visit. Computers have introduced me to places I've never seen before. They are truly wonderful. Therefore, do not fret about our computer usage. In conclusion, disregard the experts; they may not understand what they are discussing. For all we know, they may use computers more than we do. Computers can teach us new things, enable communication with distant family and friends, and expand our understanding of travel. They are not detrimental; instead, they gradually enhance the quality of life.
1778	1782	1	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I assert that computers represent a valuable technological resource. The reasons I advocate for this view are as follows: children spend more than half of the school day in educational institutions. Parents should regulate their children's computer usage and the activities they engage in, and computers serve as a means of communication and research. To commence, children spend a significant portion of the school day in school. How can they spend excessive time on the computer when they are occupied with learning? It is simply not feasible. In school, children engage in ample physical activity as they are constantly on the move. After school, they typically complete homework or socialize with friends. Computers do not have a negative impact on individuals; on the contrary, they enhance cognitive abilities. Secondly, if children have access to a computer at home, parents should monitor their usage time and the content they access. Proponents of technological advancements are correct in stating that computers stimulate imagination and learning. Parents of children with computers should be particularly vigilant. If they are concerned, they may consider restricting access. Moreover, parents should encourage their children to engage in offline activities by taking them to various places. Lastly, computers are an effective means of communication. In the absence of a phone, one can use a computer to access email or personal websites. Additionally, computers are indispensable for academic work and professional tasks. Many individuals also rely on computers for research and report - writing. We require access to information! In conclusion, my perspective merits consideration, as many others may be hesitant to express their views and have them published in the local newspaper. I maintain that computers do not impede interaction with family, friends, or nature. As a society, we depend on computers for daily tasks. Without the ability to access the internet or save files, we would face significant challenges. Therefore, I urge you to consider my ideas. Thank you.
1779	1783	1	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe there are several reasons why technological advancements can be detrimental to our society. Firstly, they expose individuals to strangers in the outside world. Secondly, they detract from time spent with family and friends. Lastly, they prevent people from fully enjoying life beyond the digital realm. One of the primary reasons I perceive advanced technology as harmful to society is that it provides access to strangers, including teenagers, adults, and others. The issue lies in the fact that one can never truly ascertain the identity of the person on the other side of the digital ""door."" In chat rooms, individuals may mislead others into believing they are someone they are not. For instance, there is a show called Dateline. This program depicts how young teenagers post personal information online. Grown or young men click on their pictures, initiating a chat, which is akin to opening a door without knowing who is on the other side. These men manipulate the teens into trusting them and feeling secure. They may ask, ""Can I come over sometime?"" The unsuspecting teen, believing the person to be a friend, often agrees. Remember, they may not have seen the person's picture. In many cases, these men have ulterior motives. This is what occurs on the Dateline TV show, and one can only imagine how many other kids or teens are engaging in similar behavior without being caught. Another reason why technology is harmful to society is that it distances individuals from their family and friends. It creates a perception among family members, especially children, that one values the computer more than them. It also causes a rift with friends, as one may decline invitations to go to the mall or for a drink in favor of checking something online. Gradually, relationships will deteriorate, and one will lose those who are most important. My final reason for the potential harm of technology to society is that it discourages individuals from living their own lives and pursuing their interests. The online world is filled with trends that others claim are ""cool."" One should follow their own instincts. For example, if someone posts that @NUM1 guys think London is amazing and one should visit, but you've always dreamed of going to @LOCATION1, follow your own desires. Moreover, excessive time online can lead to a lack of outdoor activity, resulting in a pale complexion and a general sense of lethargy. In conclusion, while some may view advanced technology as beneficial, it is evident that it exposes individuals to danger, isolates them from loved ones, and prevents them from living a fulfilling life."
1780	1784	1	1	Do adults and children allocate excessive time to computers? I contend that they do not. While they do use computers frequently, it is primarily for entertainment purposes. Children need computers as an alternative means of communication. Texting incurs costs, as does phone conversation. If a child does not have texting capabilities, they can use platforms like Facebook to make plans with friends. On a rainy day when outdoor activities are limited, computers offer a viable solution. Children utilize computers for entertainment, with a plethora of games available on various websites. There are MMORPGs and RPGs, which are just two examples of the diverse gaming options. Computers serve as a virtual world for children. Additionally, computers are essential for school projects. They facilitate research and provide access to pictures. While books can be a source of information, they may not cover all topics comprehensively, and one cannot cut pictures from them. To achieve good grades on projects, students need to use computers. In summary, computers are indispensable for communication, entertainment, and academic pursuits.
1781	1785	1	1	In my perspective, individuals ought to possess computers in their residences. Computers should be utilized for significant purposes such as job - hunting and other essential tasks. People can conduct their work on the computer. One can instruct their children on how to operate a computer or allow them to access the internet so that they can search for children - related content. However, people should not squander all their time on computers and instead spend more time with their families and friends. I believe that people should allocate more time to their families and friends rather than dedicating it to the computer. Nevertheless, a substantial number of people use computers almost daily. Likely, one's family is concerned about individuals spending their entire day on the computer. They can teach their friends how to type on the computer and impart some historical knowledge to them. Do you think that people should spend considerably more time with their families and be content about the time they spend with them? I opine that people should refrain from using the computer when they have a guest at home, as they don't want the guest to think they are overly engrossed in the computer. Computers should endow people with the capacity to learn about distant locations and acquire knowledge from the internet. Yet, not everyone concurs that people should limit computer use because people can become addicted to it, and that's not desirable. And families are greatly worried about the extensive use of such devices. Some other individuals consider it a brilliant idea to use computers extensively and spend more time on them than with their families. So, do you think that people should spend more time with their families and friends instead of paying attention to the computers?
1782	1786	1	1	Dear readers, I contend that excessive computer usage has both merits and demerits.
1783	1787	1	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I concur that computers are beneficial for society. Without computers, numerous tasks would be unfeasible. Computers sometimes offer the most expedient solution, which is precisely why I hold them in high regard. Computers render almost anything achievable. For instance, if one is an elderly individual with limited mobility and poor physical health, all one requires is a computer. One can settle bills online, secure a job online, or even shop online. All that is needed is a computer. Computers are also advantageous for those who are indolent. One can simply lie in bed all day, work online, or visit virtual malls to place orders. The only thing one needs to be concerned about is personal hygiene. Sometimes, computers relieve a great deal of stress. There are no longer inconsiderate colleagues or irate bosses; everything is in order. Computers are also excellent as they provide an easy way out. However, one must ensure to acquire a high - quality computer, not an old one, as it may malfunction. That is one reason why computers are not entirely flawless. But as I've mentioned, computers are highly useful. They might be a bit troublesome at times, but once one masters their use, everything will be fine. Remember, one can accomplish almost anything with a computer.
