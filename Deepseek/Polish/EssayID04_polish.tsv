1	8863	4	1	The author concludes the narrative thusly because horticulture is impossible with frozen ground. Consequently, she resolves to attempt cultivating another garden once the snow has entirely dissipated.

3	8865	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that passage to underscore the significance of the inspiration Saeng derives from the hibiscus. Throughout the story, Saeng was consoled by the plant, which evoked memories of her homeland. The hibiscus in winter serves as a metaphor for Saeng's attitude toward her new country and her driving test; the plant is less resplendent in the bitter cold, yet it adapts, endures, and will regain its beauty in spring. Saeng, though embittered, is adapting and will be motivated by the hibiscus's springtime splendor to reattempt her test. In summation, the author concluded the story in that manner to emphasize the crucial relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus.

7	8869	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the protagonist's vow: ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This paragraph is employed because Saeng is distressed about her expenditure on a plant she initially perceived as dissimilar to the one from her homeland. She declares her intention to refrain from retaking the test of purchasing another until the geese return and the hibiscus buds."
8	8870	4	1	It is evident that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides a sense of closure. Within the paragraph, Saeng essentially declares that she will be sufficiently prepared to retake the test upon the geese's return and her flower's budding. Her preparedness will stem from having adapted and accumulated sufficient experience, analogous to the plant and the geese. She is drawing a parallel between her own life and the natural cycles of the geese and her flower.

10	8872	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes with a resonant resolution. The protagonist purchases a hibiscus that evokes memories of her homeland. She returns home, informs her mother of her failed test, and presents the plant. While planting it, she observes geese, which further reminds her of home. America began to feel more familiar, and her spirits lifted. The text states, ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now."" She is now prepared to attempt the test again with confidence in her success, as America is gradually beginning to feel more like home."
11	8873	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the story commenced with Saeng failing her examination, subsequently purchasing a plant for solace and confessing to her mother. The flora evoked memories of her homeland, and her failure precipitated profound despondency. Her tears manifested her anguish, and the acquisition of the plant served to elevate her spirits. As she confided in her mother, she revisited that distress, yet her mother prepared her favored meal and assisted in planting. She acknowledged its dissimilarity to the original plant, but the associated sentiment and recollections reinforced her resolve to persevere; consequently, she resolved to reattempt the examination at the opportune moment. This conclusion enhances reader comprehension and illustrates her refusal to capitulate. Her mother demonstrated profound empathy, ensuring Saeng will be prepared for her subsequent attempt, thereby providing narrative cohesion.
12	8874	4	1	The author likely concluded the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the cyclical nature of events within the story, mirroring the departure and return of the geese. This cyclical pattern symbolizes the protagonist's own experience of leaving and returning, which underpins the resolve to retake the examination.
13	8875	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify that once the seasonal cycle recommences and everything is restored, the protagonist will undertake the examination again. This resolution provides a fitting conclusion to the story's central arc.
14	8876	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate the sense of determination that Saeng possesses. When Saeng returns and presents the hibiscus to her mother, she is visibly distraught. Her mother initially expresses disappointment regarding the purchase but transitions to understanding upon recognizing Saeng's profound distress. The mother's offer to plant the hibiscus provides Saeng with a degree of comfort, facilitating the recovery of her resolve. The story states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This observation indicates Saeng's acknowledgment that elements of her new environment can attain the familiarity of her homeland. The author employs the term “familiar” to convey Saeng's growing acceptance that certain aspects will inevitably differ, yet she will gradually acclimatize, thereby cultivating a more positive perspective.
15	8877	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it encapsulates several of the story's principal themes. It references the seasonal cycles, their comparisons and distinctions, and discusses various botanical developments, such as the emergence of midribs, nodes, and heads of the plant. The hibiscus itself symbolizes a novel and agreeable form of beauty, rendering the paragraph a thematically rich conclusion.
16	8878	4	1	He posits this as the conclusion because it demonstrates the faith she invests in the flower and its capacity to bestow fortune upon her imminent examination. She perceives the familiar flower as being as displaced as she is, and they can consequently identify with one another.
17	8879	4	1	I contend the author concludes the narrative with Saeng to illustrate the moment she is reminded of her homeland. I posit she believed she could pass the examination upon seeing the flower bloom, as it evoked memories of home. For instance, Saeng murmured, “Not like the kind we had before,” which suggests to me she was likely experiencing homesickness. Subsequently, when spring arrives and the flower blossoms, it could provide her with the fortitude necessary to pass the test, which is why I believe the author concluded with this paragraph.
18	8880	4	1	The author employs this conclusion because Saeng regained her confidence through planting the hibiscus and the cumulative experiences of that year. Consequently, she is now prepared, and that is the realization the author intended for the reader to ascertain.
19	8881	4	1	"The author concludes the story in this manner due to Saeng's test failure, the solace provided by the hibiscus, and her feeling of affinity with the geese. For example, Saeng states, “I-I failed the test,” admitting her failure and distress while expressing a desire to “take that test again.” Furthermore, Saeng remarks, “And that rich sweet scent—that was familiar, too,” while describing the hibiscus; the plant's familiarity comforts her and will enable her to muster the courage to retake the test. Finally, Saeng reflects, ""the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese."" She feels akin to the geese in this cyclical pattern, which permits her to resolve to take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” The author thus provides a potent conclusion, delineating Saeng's failure, the comfort from the hibiscus, and her connection to the geese."
20	8882	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she will be reminded of her homeland and the concept of returning home. The rationale for this is that the geese are migrating back to their origin, a journey she herself desires to undertake. Additionally, the hibiscus will be blossoming in the wild, precisely as it did in her native land.
21	8883	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's development of confidence and her silent vow, intended to impart further lessons following her examination failure. Saeng informs her mother that she will retake the failed test in the spring, once the snow has melted. Her mother had been deeply disappointed upon initially learning of Saeng's failure.
22	8884	4	1	The author likely concluded in this manner to cultivate suspense and leave the reader with an optimistic impression, anticipating that circumstances will improve for the characters. One may surmise that Saeng will ultimately acquire her license and the family will achieve greater financial stability.
23	8885	4	1	"In ""The Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the protagonist, Saeng, confronts numerous obstacles while adapting to her new country, which differs significantly from her homeland. The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, a season symbolizing renewal with the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus. This conclusion assures the reader that Saeng has discovered newfound hope, symbolized by the flower, which also possesses sentimental value regarding her home. Ultimately, overcoming obstacles sometimes requires embracing them, as she did in the greenhouse, thereby creating the opportunity for a new beginning."
24	8886	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that an initial failure should not necessitate surrender. The implications within the passage suggest that Saeng will develop greater resilience by spring, enabling her to pass the examination successfully.
25	8887	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to underscore the inherent routines and survival mechanisms within nature. The geese migrate seasonally to avoid perishing in the cold, and the flower, having died in winter, is revitalized in spring. This cyclical pattern pertains directly to Saeng, as she will resume her test—the endeavor to assimilate into her new country—upon the return of the geese and the flower, which justifies the author's choice for this conclusion.
26	8888	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the designated paragraph, ""When they came back…then I will take that test again,"" because it generates numerous unresolved inquiries for the reader. This deliberate ambiguity may compel the reader to anticipate the author's subsequent literary work. Essentially, the final paragraph captivates the reader's attention. Many of these unanswered questions pertain to the statement, ""I failed the test."" Furthermore, the identities of ""her gentle grandmother,"" ""Mrs. Lambert,"" and the nature of ""home"" remain undefined. An additional rationale for this conclusion is to create a specific impact upon the reader, who is consequently left to speculate and envision future developments. Will she pass the examination? Will she return home? The sole certainty is, ""when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" It is highly probable the author concluded with this paragraph for its dramatic effect on the reader, which substantiates the reasoning behind its selection."
27	8889	4	1	"The author likely concluded the narrative in this manner to signify the protagonist's acclimatization to the seasonal cycle. The declaration, ""In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" indicates her intention to retake the examination once the cold subsides; she will await the geese's return, which heralds the spring season. This statement also implies that by the time the snow melts and the geese reappear, she will have successfully passed the test. This interpretation explains the author's choice of conclusion, as these natural elements hold profound significance for her."
28	8890	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the themes of transformation and adaptation to change. Saeng resolves that, amidst this evolution, she too can adjust to her new existence by returning to pass the driver's test. The hibiscus further symbolizes how an entity from her native land has migrated to America and must now endure. As it commences to bud, Saeng will initiate her own adaptation to America by succeeding in her driver's test. The core theme revolves around the endeavor to become accustomed to alterations. When Saeng feels disheartened by her failure, an artifact from her past provides substantial solace.
29	8891	4	1	"By concluding the narrative with the prospect of retaking a test in the spring, the author establishes a sentiment of renewal and perseverance. For instance, the phrase, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,"" conveys the concept of commencing a new life in the spring, symbolized by returning home and the hibiscus's rejuvenation through budding. This elucidates why Saeng desires to initiate a fresh start and retake the test during spring. The paragraph further demonstrates that Saeng, akin to the hibiscus, is persevering. The plant endures the winter to bloom again, while Saeng persists by retaking the examination. The author concludes with this paragraph to affirm that Saeng will not capitulate."
30	8892	4	1	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because Saeng feels most assured about retaking the test when the described conditions are met. Saeng experiences profound nostalgia for her homeland. She made a commitment to herself that she would attempt the test again upon the snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. This statement provokes curiosity regarding why she postpones the test until these events occur; their manifestation provides her with a profound sense of comfort and readiness.
31	8893	4	1	The concluding paragraph delineates her subsequent objective. She had undertaken an examination but did not pass it. She expended over nineteen dollars for the plant. It evoked memories of her former residence. She will possess confidence in the spring because the plant acclimated to its new environment, so she too will adapt to her new home.
32	8894	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph. She will retake the examination in the spring and endeavor to perform optimally. ""I-I failed the test,"" Saeng stated. Failing an assessment does not signify the termination of all prospects. She will approach the next attempt with greater assurance."
33	8895	4	1	"The author concludes the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" with this paragraph for several pertinent reasons. This conclusion illustrates Saeng's personal growth and her increased resolve to strive and excel. Her declaration to retake the test demonstrates her burgeoning confidence and her initial acclimation to a foreign land. She is now diligently working toward achieving success, making the most of her circumstances. The author thereby imbues the narrative with greater depth and significance. Saeng transitions from a state of anxiety, exclaiming, ""I-I failed the test,"" to establishing a goal to retry when the bud blossoms the following year. Essentially, the author completes a narrative circle, progressing from the test's mention, to the floral experience with her mother, and finally to her resolution to reattempt the examination."
34	8896	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph because it demonstrates that despite her sorrow and discomfort, Saeng retains the capacity for hope. In the narrative, Saeng encounters a hibiscus, which incites profound homesickness for her native Vietnam. The reader also learns that she failed an examination and feels profoundly displaced. However, the hibiscus symbolizes hope and solace. The author chooses this conclusion because, despite Saeng's hardships, the flower enables her to recognize that she can surmount her obstacles and anticipate the future.
35	8897	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when Saeng and her mother recall their former home, where the flowers were more beautiful than their current surroundings. She desires to cultivate flowers that will evoke memories of her homeland. In the story, Saeng's mother observed that the flowers are not as pretty, but they are resilient enough to endure the cold months; this winter hibiscus signified that the paramount quality is the plant's ability to persist through the winter.
36	8898	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng’s failure on the examination does not signify her surrender. She declared that once the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus begins to bud, she will attempt it again. The author implies that although she has presently failed, with time she can further study and prepare to retake it. By the time she is prepared, the snow will have vanished, the weather should be warm, the birds will have reappeared, and the flower will be thriving. She will undertake the test. The author’s concluding method informs us not only that she will retake it, but through his diction, suggests she will ultimately succeed.
37	8899	4	1	The author concludes the story in that manner because the hibiscus had commenced budding, indicating her present contentment. Consequently, she is asserting that after the geese return and the snow melts, she will endeavor to repeat the entire process once more.
38	8900	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative thusly to convey the imperative of perseverance. She failed her initial driving examination, and as someone who will soon undertake the test myself, I resolve to persist regardless of how many attempts are required. One must persevere through every adversity encountered in life. If one surrenders, nothing will ever be accomplished. She vows to retake the test in the spring, as the hibiscus buds. I aspire to pass my driving test on the first attempt, as I did with my learner's permit. Furthermore, one must never relinquish any endeavor, however minor; for instance, ceasing to work results in job loss. One must never capitulate."
39	8901	4	1	The author incorporated that sentence into the story to illustrate the depth of Saeng's affection for the snow and the flora. She states that she would prefer gardening to academic pursuits, as she adores cultivating new plants.
40	8902	4	1	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng's burgeoning acclimatization to her new environment. The narrative describes her feeling out of place, akin to the ""winter hibiscus."" Later, she observes how many previously strange elements have become, through seasonal repetition, almost familiar, signifying her adaptation. Therefore, the final paragraph demonstrates that once spring returns, the geese reappear, and the hibiscus buds, she will retake the examination. The author employs this conclusion to parallel her adaptation with that of the hibiscus."
41	8903	4	1	"The author imbues the reader with a sense of prospective optimism through this concluding paragraph. Although the narrator purchases the plant in a state of despondency, following her driving test failure and profound homesickness, it nonetheless functions as a potent emblem of hope. She signifies that the flower's eventual bloom will coincide with the resurgence of her own aspirations, compelling her to endeavor once more, perhaps then achieving success. Presently, she @MONTH1 experience sorrow and trepidation, yet she maintains faith in a favorable resolution and her ultimate well-being. She is progressively acclimating to her new existence, observing that ""many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now."" This indicates that despite her intense longing for her homeland, she is gradually growing accustomed to her new environment and life. Perhaps by spring, she will attain a state of contentment and comfort sufficient to attempt the driving examination again. The hibiscus thus embodies both nostalgia for the past and hope for the future."
42	8904	4	1	"The author likely concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng derives the greatest solace from elements reminiscent of her homeland. She anticipates being prepared to retake the examination upon the ducks' return and the hibiscus's initial budding. The narrator's recollection, ""‘A saebya hedge, tall and high, had surrounded their garden…’ @CAPS2 substantiates that hibiscus were present in Saeng's Vietnamese past, and the anecdote of the well evokes this memory. Furthermore, the narrator states, ""Overhead, a flock of @CAPS1 geese, their faint honks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now,"" @CAPS2 confirming that the geese also symbolize @CAPS3 home."
43	8905	4	1	The author selects this concluding quotation for a multitude of reasons, primarily to demonstrate the character's resilience and that her failure does not signify a definitive end, thereby conveying a moral of perseverance. The character appears to attribute profound significance to the hibiscus; its impending bud symbolizes her own potential for growth and expanded knowledge. By spring, she will have acquired sufficient experience and understanding to attempt the test once more. Simultaneously, the hibiscus serves as a memento of her homeland, whose presence will grant her the fortitude to persevere and confront challenges like her examination. The final quote effectively synthesizes the narrative while affirming the character's indomitable will to persist.
44	8906	4	1	"The author employs this concluding paragraph to synthesize the narrative's central elements, referencing the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant—three recurring motifs. The statement ""when the snow melts and the geese return"" alludes to the earlier depiction where ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky."" Saeng has undergone a significant transformation, analogous to the migratory patterns of geese. Her realization that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become...familiar to her now"" underscores a universal theme of adaptation, albeit one of greater magnitude in her particular circumstance."
45	8907	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it reiterates a previously established motif, now elaborated with greater detail, narrative complications, and substantive developments.
46	8908	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's profound reverence for her homeland and her poignant sense of nostalgia. The initial instance, wherein ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" demonstrates her deep respect and longing. It conveys her resolve to attempt once more to overcome her past failure. The final illustration is her determination to surmount that previous setback. The paragraph's concluding line, ""then I will take that test again,"" signifies her desire for another opportunity in life. These examples elucidate the author's rationale for concluding the story with this paragraph."
47	8909	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to evoke a sense of a clean slate, as though the characters have begun anew, leaving the past behind. Saeng exhibits a degree of relief after presenting her mother with the plate. One may infer her improved state because her tone at the paragraph's conclusion conveys self-assurance. She appears resolute, seemingly prepared for a fresh start, as evidenced by her declaration: ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She ultimately resembles a renewed individual who has relinquished the burdens of her history."
48	8910	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant is discovered upon her return home following the driving test failure. She subsequently declares that when conditions are favorable, she will retake the examination. The driving test itself is not the primary concern; she does not anticipate passing it immediately, but rather desires to attempt it again once the plant she acquired is budding and has reached its optimal state.
49	8911	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's significant personal growth from this experience and her resolute determination. This final passage provides a sudden, optimistic conclusion to an otherwise melancholic narrative, leaving the reader with the assurance that the protagonist is sufficiently self-confident to try again. The entire story was permeated with sorrow regarding Saeng's family relocating to a new nation and starting over. However, their gardening serves as a singular escape; in Vietnam, they possessed a splendid garden and derived great pleasure from it. Now, their garden and its plants serve as a reminder of their homeland and former life. Although disheartened by failing her driving test, Saeng discovers a plant that brings her happiness and appears to rejuvenate her determination to pass. The final paragraph confirms this transformation, illustrating her restored self-confidence, which is fueled by the joyful memories she contemplates.
50	8912	4	1	The author employs the final paragraph because the hibiscus functions as a symbol for Saeng. It indicates that she will be prepared when spring arrives. Once the plant is ready to bud, she will possess the conviction to undertake the test. She will likely attend to the plant's care before her examination. When the plant finally blossoms, Saeng will no longer need to tend to it, symbolizing her readiness.
51	8913	4	1	"I believe the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because Saeng expresses her intention to retake the examination when conditions improve, following her initial failure. For instance, on page @NUM1, she states, ""I-I failed the test,"" which substantiates the interpretation that the author chose this conclusion due to the significance of Saeng passing the test during the favorable season of spring."
52	8914	4	1	"""Winter Hibiscus"" chronicles the experience of Saeng, a girl who immigrated from Vietnam to the @ORGANIZATION1. After failing her driver's examination, she walks home and discovers a hibiscus. ""She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair…"" She visits a florist to inquire about purchasing the plant, for which she pays a substantial sum due to its rarity and value. The plant holds personal significance because she cultivated hibiscus plants in Vietnam. She brings it home and informs her mother that it evokes memories of their homeland, a sentiment her mother shares, though she disapproves of the expense. Saeng plants it in the garden. As the hibiscus was lowered into the ground, a flock of geese flew overhead. When the hibiscus re-emerges in the spring, Saeng will reattempt her driver's test. During spring, all the flowers begin to bud and bloom, symbolizing renewal, and Saeng will have a fresh opportunity to pass her examination."
53	8915	4	1	"I posit that this was included to illustrate her self-comparison to a flower. When she undergoes personal renewal, analogous to a flower's growth, she will endeavor to succeed on the test. She conveys that there is always a secondary opportunity, intending to communicate that a misstep or error is not definitive. For example, ""they said there were many things that she had perceived as peculiar, season after season."""
54	8916	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative in this manner to convey the protagonist's profound sentiment towards the hibiscus. She perceived the hibiscus as an extraordinary plant, describing it as ""smooth and cool"" toward the conclusion of the first page. When she initially encountered the plant in Vietnam, she believed it grew wild; consequently, she was astonished to find it cultivated in a pot within the United States. For example, she characterized the hibiscus's aroma as a ""sweet scent."" @CAPS1, this rationale explains the story's conclusion, which is predicated upon her emotional connection to the plant."
55	8917	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that statement because it demonstrates Saeng's fervent dedication to horticulture. Her willingness to retake the test is linked to observing whether her plants will flourish; when spring arrives and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will endeavor to cultivate it, thereby revealing her profound eagerness for gardening and her aspiration for the hibiscus to thrive during the spring season.
56	8918	4	1	The author concludes the narrative to signify that Saeng will undertake the examination once normalcy and beauty are restored, portraying her as an individual who thrives in spring and enjoys horticultural activities during that season. This also implies her perception of achieving superior academic performance throughout the springtime, reinforcing the thematic connection between personal renewal and seasonal change.
57	8919	4	1	"Transformation and disillusionment present significant challenges to overcome. Many individuals harbor a profound apprehension toward change. For Saeng, the protagonist of ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" this alteration materializes through her relocation to a new locale, where her entire environment is unfamiliar. Compounded by the disappointment of failing her driver's examination, a sentiment of helplessness pervades her existence. Upon acquiring a winter hibiscus, she resolves to retake the test upon its spring blossoming, finding inspiration in the flower's resilience and the nostalgic memories it evokes."
58	8920	4	1	The author likely intended to articulate Saeng's internal vow and convey her emotional state. This statement was crafted principally to foster reader comprehension, while simultaneously generating a compelling interest in the narrative's development and the protagonist's personal resolution, thereby enriching the textual engagement.
59	8921	4	1	Foreshadowing, future reference, and continuous behavior collectively justify the final paragraph's inclusion. It employs foreshadowing by indicating a future action Saeng pledges to undertake. She references her forthcoming intentions, thereby perpetuating a pattern of behavior established previously, as she commits to repeating an endeavor the subsequent year. Her vow to retake the test upon the return of spring, the melting snow, the geese, and the budding hibiscus exemplifies these literary devices, which effectively encapsulate her declared objectives and anticipated actions.
60	8922	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative in this manner to evoke a sense of life's perpetual continuity. Saeng fails a significant test and procures a hibiscus at an exorbitant price. This test symbolizes her struggle to overcome the poignant memories of her homeland, which now only evoke sorrow. The plant represents the existence she once possessed and yearns to reclaim. Her silent vow is to return to the evocative greenhouse when the geese migrate back, attempting once more to confront the concept of ""home"" without emotional collapse or further financial extravagance."
61	8923	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrator never explicitly identifies the examination Saeng has failed. Nevertheless, through thematic substance and lexical selection, it is evident that the test holds significance not merely for Saeng and her mother, but also for her nascent existence in America. Throughout the narrative, Saeng's yearning for her homeland is overwhelming. The deluge of recollections triggered by her acquisition of the hibiscus is palpably agonizing and constitutes a facet of her quotidian reality. Saeng endeavors to preserve her memories of Vietnam, while simultaneously acknowledging the necessity of assimilating into American customs and lifestyle. Certain elements, however, she need not alter, such as ultimately passing the examination. Saeng comprehends that she can utilize these memories to sustain her morale, employing them as impetus. This elucidates why the story's concluding sentence is so empowering, as she has learned to synthesize memory and transformation: ""when this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again."""
62	8924	4	1	"The author selected this concluding paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's adaptation to her new nation. Saeng profoundly missed her homeland, finding it difficult to mention her country without succumbing to emotion, as evidenced by her fragmented utterance, ""It's not like the wind we had at—at—."" She also expended a specific sum on a plant because it evoked memories of her former home. One can infer her successful adaptation from her familiarity with seasonal transitions and the declaration that upon the geese's return, she will retake the examination, signaling her integration and resolve."
63	8925	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it fosters a sense of belonging for Saeng. For instance, it states, ""the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The author likely employs this device because every element within that sentence serves as a mnemonic for her homeland. The plant and the geese, for example, are entities she associated with her native environment; thus, with winter's conclusion, her spirits will lift, enabling her to confront the examination with renewed fortitude and optimism."
64	8926	4	1	The rationale for the author's conclusion with Saeng's vow resides in her profound determination. Having failed initially, she is now resolutely committed to success, thus awaiting the season's turn. She pledges that once the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she will resume her endeavor, demonstrating her steadfast resolve to persevere and ultimately triumph over her challenge.
65	8927	4	1	I believe the author concluded the story in this manner due to the seasonal context established throughout the plot, which was set in winter. She may have intended for Saeng to attempt the test in a different season to determine if her performance would improve within an altered environment. This strategic narrative choice underscores the impact of setting on personal endeavor, which is why I posit the author selected this particular conclusion.
66	8928	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several specific reasons. Saeng genuinely intends to retake the examination in the spring. This interpretation is supported by her allusion to the snow melting and the geese returning, which signifies the coming spring season. Her statement is delivered with confidence, further evidenced by her additional observation that ""the hibiscus is budding."" Saeng's determined resolve to pass the examination is unequivocally conveyed through her declaration, which justifies the paragraph's position as the story's conclusion and clarifies its intended meaning."
67	8929	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the protagonist's resolution to retake the test ""in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" thereby signifying a new beginning.

The paragraph further draws a parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus. Her mother remarks, “I have observed this variety flourishing near the lake. Its blossoms are less ornate, yet it possesses sufficient resilience to endure the frigid season here, this winter hibiscus. That is what is significant.” Saeng embodies the winter hibiscus, robust enough to survive the winter; failing the examination becomes inconsequential until spring, when she will retake and succeed. This is symbolized by the hibiscus blooming. The denouement also integrates Saeng’s sentiments regarding her new and former homes, demonstrating her capacity to overcome adversity. She will disregard her initial failure and endeavor to pass upon its seasonal return.
118	8980	4	1	The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph because the hibiscus enables characters to surmount challenges.

Thus, the author elected this ending for its hopeful connotations, its theme of secondary chances, and its analogies to the indispensable quality of persistence.
120	8982	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that Saeng prefers undertaking endeavors in spring, when blossoming flowers evoke a sense of being in her homeland, thereby heightening her confidence regarding successfully passing the examination.
121	8983	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the quotation, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.""

Saeng anticipates that the sight of the blossoming hibiscus will rekindle connections to her home, thereby granting her the strength necessary to pass the test.
126	8988	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner because the plant and the departure of the geese symbolize transformation for Saeng. The hibiscus differs from her recollections of her homeland. Its budding signifies Saeng's rediscovered happiness, reminiscent of home. This passage demonstrates that the familiarity of the flowering plant imbues Saeng with the fortitude and capacity to surmount her challenge. The geese epitomize the passage of time, as the plant will bloom when they return in spring. Without this concluding paragraph, the complete resonance of Saeng's memories would remain unrealized.

Initially, the narrative commences with a melancholic tone, evident as ""Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test,"" a quote establishing dejection due to her failure and solitary journey. The moment ""she sees a familiar plant"" marks the story's inflection toward hope. Her purchasing the plant and presenting it to her mother is also delineated. Her mother inquired, ""Where did you get it?"" and Saeng replied, ""I bought it."" She purchased it for a sum her mother noted could have bought many garden seeds. Over time, her mother recognized the plant symbolizes strength and hope for her daughter, reminiscent of a time her own mother bought her a decorative candle she initially deemed wasteful, yet later cherished for its loving sentiment. Observing how the plants provided Saeng happiness and courage is the reason the author chose this resolution."
129	8991	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to provide narrative extension and a satisfying resolution; however, its symbolic meaning remains ambiguous, necessitating further authorial clarification for the reader's comprehension.
130	8992	4	1	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to inform the reader of subsequent events following the primary narrative. The intention was to provide clarity, which is the likely rationale for the author's decision to culminate with this passage.
131	8993	4	1	The author concludes this paragraph because Saeng intends to await the conclusion of winter to facilitate a new beginning. She desires to attempt the endeavor once more, as her previous effort resulted in failure and the destruction of the plants. Saeng aspires to become a horticulturist like her mother.
132	8994	4	1	The author incorporates those sentences as the conclusion to convey the protagonist's realization of their impending return.
133	8995	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow…” to illustrate Saeng’s increased fortitude. This strength derives from her successful adaptation to her new residence and unfamiliar surroundings. Saeng possesses greater self-assurance to retake the examination, determined not to succumb to tears as she did previously. Her enhanced confidence and adjustment are the fundamental reasons for her newfound resilience and her resolve to attempt the test again.
134	8996	4	1	Confidence, persistence, memories—these are the attributes that elucidate the author's concluding paragraph. Since relocating from her native country, Saeng has experienced profound unhappiness, characterized by persistent sorrow and longing for everyone and everything from Vietnam; every reminder evokes her past. The final paragraph, stating, “then I will take that test again,” demonstrates her self-confidence and determination to exert greater effort. She exhibits persistence through her declaration to reattempt the test, aspiring not to relinquish her efforts. Saeng misses nearly everything from Vietnam, including the cuisine, her family, and their traditional appearance and attire. These memories likely impeded her concentration during the driver’s test, though she desired to succeed and purchased the flower hoping for solace. Ultimately, one hopes Saeng's life in the United States will improve and she will learn to appreciate her new country.
135	8997	4	1	Because with the blooming of the hibiscus plant emerges renewed hope. Within the narrative, she perceives the hibiscus as emblematic of her former existence, and with the plant's budding commences a new chapter in the young woman's life.
136	8998	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with this paragraph to substantiate his central argument. It appears that Saeng draws a parallel between herself and the flower; for instance, the flower was initially a wild species subsequently transplanted into a pot. Similarly, Saeng was once a carefree and content individual before her relocation to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng experience a profound sense of displacement. Given this analogous relationship, Saeng presumably concludes that if the flower can endure the winter, then she too can persevere through her challenges in @LOCATION1 and ultimately pass her examination. This reasoning elucidates why the author employs the final paragraph to convey his message.
137	8999	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate Saeng's resolute determination to succeed on her subsequent driving examination. The author intends to leave Saeng on an optimistic note, thereby preventing her from succumbing to despondency. When she retakes the test, she will be better prepared and acquainted with the expectations. Consequently, she will experience a more favorable period ahead.
138	9000	4	1	The author concludes the story in this particular fashion to impart a significant lesson. Regardless of the obstacles one encounters or the setbacks that impede progress, one must persist and never relinquish their efforts. One should continue to endeavor relentlessly. If initial attempts result in failure, repeated attempts are necessary until one ultimately achieves success.
139	9001	4	1	Courage, memories, and arduous challenges constitute the reasons the author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring. Primarily, courage is essential because failing the initial test necessitates considerable fortitude and resolve to attempt it again. Furthermore, the painful memories of her grandmother undoubtedly require significant courage and human willpower to confront during a second attempt. Subsequently, memories motivate her, as she desires to honor the positive recollections of her grandmother and ensure they are not forgotten, which again relates to the willpower required for a subsequent test. Finally, the arduous challenges her grandmother endured inspire Saeng to appreciate and honor all her grandmother sacrificed. These factors elucidate the author's rationale for concluding with that specific paragraph.
140	9002	4	1	The author includes the final paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng retains hope. Its placement as the concluding sentence signifies that @CAPS1 Fong Ho intends to show that when circumstances appear most dire, one can always anticipate improvement; with the arrival of spring comes a new beginning, not only for Saeng's plant but also for her life in a foreign country.
141	9003	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" selected this concluding paragraph to reinforce the narrative's central theme and culminate with an optimistic tone. The story's theme concerns adaptation to unfamiliar circumstances and deriving the utmost benefit from each transition. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" indicates to the reader that Saeng is endeavoring to assimilate and identify positive aspects within her new existence. The hopeful tone generated demonstrates Saeng's readiness to embrace life's alterations and her commitment to surmounting challenges. Her declaration, “I will take that test again,” positions the test as a symbol for the obstacles she will conquer through persistent effort. The hibiscus in the sentence ""...when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding..."" signifies a new beginning. The budding hibiscus is analogous to Saeng herself, representing a fresh start and the resolve to accomplish her objectives of adapting to a novel lifestyle. The author chose this paragraph to conclude the selection in order to accentuate the theme and symbolize a nascent commencement."
142	9004	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that statement to facilitate a comparison between Saeng and the hibiscus for the audience. Upon reading the statement, one comprehends that Saeng and the hibiscus are analogous because both will ultimately persevere and succeed—Saeng by obtaining her license and the hibiscus by budding. The author likely concluded the story thus to illustrate Saeng's dedication to pursuing her objective and her refusal to capitulate, as evidenced by her silent vow: “I will take that test again.” Finally, this conclusion provides the audience with the satisfaction of knowing Saeng's intended course of action while preserving a degree of mystery for individual interpretation. For instance, while I am certain she will retake the test and believe she will pass, another reader might suppose she failed again and was compelled to repeat the process.
143	9005	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to enable the reader to draw a parallel between the protagonist and both the geese and the hibiscus. The geese depart for the winter and subsequently return in the spring, thereby foreshadowing the girl's own return to retake her driver's test in the spring. Conversely, the hibiscus withers during the winter and recommences budding in the spring, demonstrating that the cold season constitutes its vulnerability. Similar to the hibiscus, the girl surmounts her own weakness—an inability to drive—by drawing strength from memories of her homeland. The author positions this paragraph at the story's conclusion to illuminate the protagonist's symbolic resemblance to both the geese and the hibiscus.
144	9006	4	1	The author likely concluded the story with that phrase to illustrate the protagonist's impending maturation. She acknowledges that she was unprepared for the challenges she encountered; for example, although she failed her test, she responded not with despair but with a resolve to retake it the following year. Furthermore, she profoundly missed her homeland, a sentiment with which she coped by purchasing a winter hibiscus. This plant served as a memento not only of her native country but also of her grandmother, thereby demonstrating the character's considerable depth and maturity throughout the narrative.
145	9007	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate Saeng's readiness to adapt to her environment, much like the hibiscus. Saeng must acclimate to her new home, and the hibiscus must adjust to the impending winter. Saeng's vow, “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding…” reveals her optimism for both herself and the plant. Initially, Saeng was highly reluctant to accept her new home, noting of the hibiscus, “it’s not like the kind we had before.” However, she recognized that the hibiscus could function as a reminder of her homeland while also symbolizing the necessity of change for her new life. She understood that if the hibiscus could endure the winter, she too could survive residing in an unfamiliar location.
146	9008	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng’s personal vow to retake the examination come springtime, a resolution stemming from her struggle to adapt to her new environment and her refusal to capitulate after a single setback. Recollections of her former home, and the painful acknowledgment that she can never return, serve as a poignant counterpoint that helps her manage her profound sense of loss. The hibiscus and other familiar flora provided solace, evoking memories of her homeland. With the spring’s arrival, marked by the geese’s return and the hibiscus’s bloom, Saeng will feel sufficiently prepared to attempt the test once more; the season thus symbolizes both a renewed opportunity and a nascent beginning.
147	9009	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the final paragraph, a deliberate choice as it conveys Saeng’s intention to retake the examination. In a preceding paragraph, Saeng informs her mother of her initial failure. Thus, by the time spring arrives and the hibiscus begins to bud, Saeng will be prepared to attempt the test again. Furthermore, the geese, having departed temporarily due to winter conditions, serve as a metaphorical parallel for Saeng herself, who similarly yearns for her home. The author’s concluding thought establishes that, like the geese who return when the season is appropriate, Saeng will find her own moment for renewal.
148	9010	4	1	It is evident that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant symbolizes a determined will to survive. In essence, the hibiscus signifies a favorable omen for Saeng’s subsequent driving test, which she will undertake following the winter season when the hibiscus begins to bud. Moreover, the author selected this concluding sentence to elucidate Saeng’s prospective plans and her resolve for the future, thereby providing a sense of closure and forward momentum.
149	9011	4	1	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with this paragraph for several significant reasons. This passage demonstrates that Saeng possesses unwavering determination; she will await the next opportunity to take the test. It further implies she will be thoroughly prepared and will possess a greater degree of confidence for passing the examination. This provides the reader with the assurance that Saeng will not surrender but will ultimately succeed. Her mother will feel immense pride, and it illustrates Saeng's persistent resolve. Her declaration, ""let's plant it, right now,"" exemplifies that despite failing the test and disappointing her mother, she retains hope, much like her mother's enduring faith in her."
150	9012	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to articulate Saeng’s silent vow, which is prompted by her reflections on distant memories involving her mother and the plants in their garden. Saeng contemplates the cyclical return of life with the advent of spring, pondering how circumstances will transform with the melting snow, the geese’s return, and her own decision to retake the examination; this is the essence of the pledge she made to herself. This reflective resolution is the precise reason the author elected to conclude the narrative with this particular paragraph.
151	9013	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph. The story concerns a girl and her mother. The girl receives money to purchase a plant seed. She expends a specific sum on this plant. Her mother becomes distressed, yet everything culminates favorably, as they subsequently had egg omelets with pieces of melon.
152	9014	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that, following all preceding events, Saeng will persevere and endeavor diligently. For instance, when she declares, “When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This conclusion generates suspense for the reader, who remains uncertain of the geese's return. The author appears to demonstrate that Saeng is beginning to adapt to her new nation and render it reminiscent of her former one. For example, the mother observes, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This indicates their desire for their new country to resemble their old one, and when it does, she will attain contentment. Therefore, the author utilizes this concluding paragraph to depict her adaptation to environmental change.
153	9015	4	1	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she eagerly anticipates the spring, when her plant will bud and evoke memories of her homeland. She looks forward to retaking the test in spring, as she would have had sufficient time to prepare and might consequently pass it, having failed her initial attempt. Perhaps she concluded the narrative with this paragraph due to her affinity for spring and her profound anticipation for its arrival.
154	9016	4	1	I believe there is a meaningful reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph. I posit that the protagonist will feel more comfortable and prepared to take the examination. I derived this conclusion from her decision to wait until winter concludes before retaking the test, thereby allowing herself time for preparation. Furthermore, she awaits the hibiscus plant's budding. I inferred from her desire to wait for the hibiscus that it represents comfort; the entire narrative revolves around how Saeng comforted herself by reminiscing about her past experiences in Vietnam. When she perceives that an integral part of her life is returning, she can become comfortable and focused. I contend the author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the flower's significance in Saeng's life.
155	9017	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate her enduring hope. She is confident she can pass the test when conditions normalize in the spring. During spring, the geese will return and the hibiscus will bud, fostering a sense of familiarity because this was the perennial state before her relocation. Additionally, her affection for the geese and the hibiscus likely contributes to her comfort. This rationale explains why the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph, to illustrate her possession of hope.
156	9018	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to establish a parallel between Saeng's life and the plant. For instance, following her unsuccessful driving examination, Saeng encounters a plant that evokes memories of her homeland. From the florist to her residence, she draws a comparison between her native country and the flower, illustrating her profound connection to it. Thus, the concluding paragraph demonstrates that as the hibiscus enters a budding phase, initiating a new cycle, she will similarly progress and retake her driver's examination.
157	9019	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s resolve to adapt to the changes in her life. In the story, Saeng fails her driving examination and struggles to adjust to her new existence in @LOCATION1. However, upon recognizing the familiar hibiscus and geese, she becomes determined to assimilate. Saeng purchases a hibiscus because it evokes her homeland. This not only consoles her but also intensifies her longing for her previous home. The hibiscus, capable of thriving in both @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1, enables Saeng to realize that she can also endure. The geese are included to signify her growing familiarity with the United States, thereby facilitating her ongoing adaptation. Saeng notes that she now identifies the geese’s ‘V’ formation, and this recognition of her increasing acclimatization to @LOCATION1, alongside her capacity to survive, fortifies her determination to retake and pass her driving test, encapsulating the theme of adapting to change.
158	9020	4	1	The author likely incorporated that sentence to foster a degree of intimacy with the character, thereby enabling the reader to establish a personal connection with that individual and their experiences.
159	9021	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore the significance of new beginnings and to accentuate the narrative's central theme. The theme posits that one must surmount adversities and pursue fresh starts. The spring season serves as a representation of such a new beginning. Consequently, the advent of spring will permit her to recommence her efforts regarding the driver's test. Furthermore, the author employs the paragraph to highlight the symbolic attributes of mundane objects; just as the hibiscus reminded her of her homeland, the geese will subsequently remind her of the springtime.
160	9022	4	1	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" author Minfong Ho concludes with that paragraph to signify Saeng's intention to transcend her past failure on the driving test and to improve upon her subsequent attempt. The author implies that Saeng will experience a renewal, akin to the hibiscus with the arrival of spring. Throughout the narrative, Saeng was compelled to adapt, much like the hibiscus. The plant ultimately inspired Saeng to thrive within her new environment, marking a new beginning for her after assimilating the lessons embodied by the hibiscus."
161	9023	4	1	It functions as a central motif within the narrative. The hibiscus blossoms inspire her to pursue new endeavors, evoking memories of her homeland and compelling her to embrace novel experiences. This is significant because it underscores the profound importance the hibiscus held for Saeng.
162	9024	4	1	The author likely concluded the narrative in this manner to illustrate the protagonist's reflection upon her past and her attainment of tranquility. Through the flower, she discovers a state of serenity. The writer intends to convey that regardless of one's background, it is possible to discover an element that provides both happiness and a sense of purpose.
163	9025	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate her resolute determination to pass the examination, affirming she will persevere relentlessly until she ultimately succeeds.
164	9026	4	1	The author likely concluded the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the character's maturation and personal growth within her circumstances. This demonstrates that an initial failure does not predestine future outcomes. Furthermore, it is acceptable to feel displaced; life invariably presents opportunities for new beginnings, and the choice to seize that chance or remain constrained by one's own limitations ultimately rests with the individual.
165	9027	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the narrative concludes with Saeng’s silent vow: “when they come back, I will take that test again.” Like many adolescents, Saeng failed her driving test and is profoundly distressed by the experience, as failure can be a humiliating ordeal, particularly when others have succeeded. The introductory quote functions symbolically; the geese returning north signify a readiness to begin anew, while the budding hibiscus represents the commencement of a fresh cycle of life. Observing these natural repetitions empowers Saeng to persevere and attempt once more. She recognizes that failure is an inherent aspect of life and a necessary precursor to achievement. Minfong Ho concludes with this assertion to communicate that one must persistently endeavor to overcome obstacles, understanding that success is ultimately born from dedicated effort and resolute commitment, which forges a resilient and formidable individual.
166	9028	4	1	The author concludes the paragraph with that sentence to convey to the reader that the narrative is not concluded. He intends for the reader to comprehend that @ORGANIZATION1 will retain its memory and that these events are destined to recur.
167	9029	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the statement, “I will take that test again,” signifying that her present struggles will reoccur, yet she will be prepared subsequently. Saeng endures considerable difficulty relocating to a foreign nation and acclimating, a process during which her mother provides support. The hibiscus she procured functions as a potent symbol, representing concepts beyond its physical form. In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" this flower, purchased during her most arduous period, accompanies her through the winter. The final paragraph, expressing “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” reveals her anticipation for the future and her silent vow to persevere until spring arrives."
168	9030	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to delineate the protagonist's anticipated actions upon the arrival of spring. This signifies her intention to resume the care of her plants following her return. Her desire for the snow to melt and for a general renewal upon her homecoming is the fundamental message the author conveys through this concluding segment.
169	9031	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to assure the reader of the protagonist's eventual return. Furthermore, this conclusion demonstrates that, irrespective of one's location in life, there will invariably be something or someone to provide reassurance. The author also sought to evoke a sense of identification with the character, implying that feelings of displacement can always be mitigated by finding a relatable element.
170	9032	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to generate anticipation for a subsequent publication or to sustain the reader's heightened engagement.
171	9033	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this particular paragraph, wherein Saeng resolves to retake the examination in the spring, when the snow has melted, the geese have returned, and the hibiscus is budding, because she requires her entire environment to be ideal, incorporating elements she favors such as the flowers, the geese, and the climate. A further rationale for the author's selection of this concluding paragraph is to illustrate Saeng's desire for her surroundings to mirror those of her native country, where, for instance, snow was absent and the climate perpetually resembled spring. This constitutes the reasoning behind the author's decision to terminate the story with this paragraph.
172	9034	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate that the protagonist is consoled by memories of her homeland and profoundly values the beauty of tropical flora. She is convinced that, as it is winter and the hibiscus remains dormant, she cannot pass the examination until it blossoms. The line, ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had previously considered foreign had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" illustrates the depth of her belief in her homeland's beauty and its tropical plants, as she reflects on past instances where circumstances felt alien in winter yet improved in spring and subsequent seasons when plants bud. Consequently, she is confident she will pass the driving test only when she feels comfortable, coinciding with the plants' budding."
173	9035	4	1	The geese migrating south for winter and the hibiscus budding represent phenomena that are customary for Saeng. The author selected this conclusion to demonstrate that Saeng derives comfort from elements to which she is accustomed. She desired the presence of the geese and hibiscus to foster a greater sense of ease during her driving examination. Saeng continues to yearn for her homeland and does not feel entirely assimilated into the United States. The hibiscus provides her with a comforting sensation, as if she has returned to Vietnam; she remains homesick, longing for circumstances to revert to their former state. The plants in the greenhouse, coupled with the disappointment of failing her test, precipitate her emotional condition. In the penultimate paragraph, the author references Saeng's feeling of repetition upon observing the V formation, as she believes winter will not afford the same solace as when she can observe the hibiscus and the geese overhead. The text notes that upon her arrival in the new location, nothing was familiar, but now she derives that feeling from the geese and plants. The author's conclusion that Saeng will retake her test after winter is an effective closure, as it offers insight into her forthcoming actions.
174	9036	4	1	"I believe the author concludes with the sentence, ""‘when they come back,’ Saeng vowed to herself, ‘in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,’"" because it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese return, it will signify spring, and thus the time to return to school. I consider this to be the underlying reason for the author's chosen conclusion."
175	9037	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with a seemingly peculiar ending: ""‘when they come back,’ Saeng vowed silently to herself, ‘in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’"" I contend that beyond the literal interpretation, the author illustrates Saeng's process of adapting to a new country. Failing her driver's test symbolizes her initial failure to adapt and accept the new nation; vowing to attempt again signifies her willingness to grant the country another chance. The statement, ""She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home,"" indicates that she did not yet consider this country her home, as she remained psychologically anchored in her past."
176	9038	4	1	The author concludes the narrative to illustrate that Saeng will not desist due to an initial failure. It further conveys her resilience, demonstrating that she will not permit specific setbacks to subdue her permanently.
177	9039	4	1	The concluding sentence of a narrative often carries profound significance. The author selected this denouement for several deliberate reasons. Principally, it imbues the reader with a potent sense of determination. The declaration, “I will take that test again,” employs the definitive word “will” to underscore the protagonist’s resolve; it is not a tentative attempt but an unequivocal commitment. Furthermore, this ending accentuates the theme of new beginnings. The statement, “when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again,” signifies that with the spring, a period symbolizing life's renewal, she will endeavor anew, which substantiates the author's deliberate choice of conclusion.
178	9040	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made an astute decision to conclude with Saeng’s silent vow to retake the test upon the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding in spring. This resolution suggests Saeng’s intention to synthesize her old and new existences. The hibiscus signifies her former life, a constant from her homeland, whereas the geese, now “almost familiar,” represent her new life. The driving test constitutes her immediate obstacle. The author implies that in spring, when these disparate elements of her life coalesce, Saeng will surmount her challenge, achieving a sense of completion and harmony as her life comes full circle.
179	9041	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore the significance of Saeng’s declaration regarding the geese's return and the hibiscus budding, which precedes her vow to retake the examination. Its purpose is to inform the reader of the specific conditions under which she will resume her endeavor, thereby justifying its inclusion within the narrative’s final moments.
180	9042	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng’s resolve to retake the test. Furthermore, the penultimate paragraph states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had previously considered strange had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This realization indicates Saeng’s gradual acclimation to her new environment and her evolving perspective toward the plant, recognizing that it can hold meaning despite its differences. Consequently, the author’s choice to conclude with this paragraph is highly effective.
181	9043	4	1	The concluding paragraph asserts, “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” I believe the author has concluded with this paragraph to convey that when her new environment begins to resemble her former home, she will likely experience greater confidence and a sense of belonging, in contrast to the cold winter which represents the complete antithesis of her previous life. The evocation of her former home within her new surroundings will foster a more positive and comfortable disposition. Consequently, she will undertake the examination while feeling at ease and thus achieve success.
182	9044	4	1	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author illustrates how the protagonist believes that through her memories and eventual adaptation to the new culture, she will acquire the fortitude to retake the examination she previously failed. Saeng profoundly misses her homeland and initially fails to perceive the parallels between her new and former environments. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Although Saeng was initially resistant to the relocation, recognizing that she will retain her memories enables her to gradually accumulate new ones. Initially, everything seemed foreign; however, she is now beginning to recall aspects of her new home, which signifies a growing comfort. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" Given Saeng's emotional response to the transition, the final paragraph informs the reader that hope exists for her progression within her new home. She is progressively gaining self-assurance and understands that once this is solidified, she can retake her test and succeed. The author demonstrates the positive potential of change provided one is willing to adapt. Circumstances may not always align with one's ideal, yet courage can cultivate a fulfilling life, integrating both new experiences and cherished memories, as Saeng begins to comprehend in the concluding paragraph."
183	9045	4	1	The author articulates a fundamental theme within this brief narrative. This excerpt primarily signifies that with the arrival of spring, the protagonist will revisit the greenhouse or botanical area. Upon her arrival, she will endeavor to locate the plant species that grows indigenously in her native country and subsequently introduce it to her new residence, thereby symbolizing a connection between her past and present.
184	9046	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with such a paragraph, I contend, to portray Saeng as an individual characterized by resilience and a capacity for continuous growth, analogous to the hibiscus plant. This is because she comprehends that many elements she previously perceived as foreign have become, through the cyclical progression of the seasons, nearly familiar to her. Saeng recognizes that a subsequent season will arrive, marked by the plant's maturation and the geese's return in a distinctive V formation, symbolizing renewal and opportunity.
185	9047	4	1	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to illuminate Saeng's emotional state. Within the paragraph, Saeng's declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" signifies her resolve to confront her challenges anew. This statement reflects her internal determination to persevere despite previous difficulties, thereby concluding her character's arc on a note of resolute anticipation."
186	9048	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate the perpetual possibility of a felicitous resolution. The geese's return elicited profound joy in the girl, thereby affirming this optimistic perspective.
187	9049	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify the principles she refuses to relinquish. She conveys that once her convictions culminate in success, she will undertake her driving examination. Her mother observes that the flower possesses the tenacity to endure and the fortitude to survive the winter. The geese will invariably return, a certainty she applies to her test; she will persist in her attempts until she ultimately passes.
188	9050	4	1	Saeng experiences greater comfort during the spring season because it evokes memories of her homeland. Having likely never encountered snow or winter previously, this season offers no familiar reminders. Spring, however, provides this connection through the returning geese and the reblooming hibiscus, restoring a sense of home. This seasonal renewal bestows upon her a renewed sense of confidence.
189	9051	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph because it encapsulates the strength and courage the hibiscus has imparted to Saeng. Similar to the plant, Saeng felt displaced in a new country, and the hibiscus illuminates the necessity of adaptation for survival and contentment. She recognizes she cannot perpetually dwell in the past but must learn to appreciate her present environment. Consequently, her declaration to retake the test in spring symbolizes her own budding openness to new experiences, such as mastering driving."
190	9052	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" likely employed this final paragraph to suggest that the hibiscus will revive memories of home, thereby providing encouragement for her test. The geese symbolize Saeng's resolve to pass the examination and adapt to the new nation. Her observation of their distinctive formation etched against the evening sky creates a vivid image, confirming her commitment to retake the test when fortified by the encouragement derived from both the geese and the hibiscus."
191	9053	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph to convey a sense of resolution and assurance. Saeng will reattempt her driving examination, restoring her preferred state of affairs. This instills a feeling of optimism, suggesting that her circumstances will improve. Furthermore, it indicates her intention to embrace life's opportunities fully, which substantiates the rationale for the author's concluding choice.
192	9054	4	1	"The author employs this paragraph to conclude the narrative because it illustrates Saeng's desire to assimilate into the country, a process she has already commenced by understanding and appreciating it. Her statement, ""and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" functions as a metaphor for her own development; she will blossom and flourish just as the plant does. This symbolic parallel justifies the author's decision to end with this passage."
193	9055	4	1	Saeng declared she would retake the examination once the purchased tree began to bud, implying she lacked the motivation without the plant. This stems from the plant's lifelong presence in her experience. She perceives an inability to succeed without it, believing its familiarity is necessary, though this may not be objectively true. Ultimately, the plant appears to function primarily as a source of psychological comfort for her.
194	9056	4	1	The author perceived that Saeng was unprepared for the test until she attained greater familiarity with her environment. Preoccupied with gardening and isolated at school without companions, she was reluctant to attend. Her vow was beneficial, however, as she would otherwise remain uncertain of her capabilities. Consequently, the author recognized that Saeng would ultimately undertake the test and achieve success.
195	9057	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph primarily to emphasize the protagonist's nostalgic memories of her homeland, signified by her resolve to retake the driving test the following spring. This decision stems from the understanding that spring's arrival, with its blossoming trees and emergent wildlife, will evoke profound recollections, thereby creating a beautiful, supportive context derived from her native country for her renewed attempt.
196	9058	4	1	Upon concluding Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author culminates the narrative in a distinctive manner that conveys a powerful will to survive. For instance, the text describes how the *dok faeng-noi* plant has acclimated to its frigid environment, distinct from its native counterparts. This illustrates the concept of survival, as the species originally migrated to a seemingly temperate locale, yet when confronted with cold conditions, it discovered mechanisms to transform and adjust, driven by a fundamental survival instinct. Another illustration involves the protagonist Saeng resolving that she will endeavor to retake the examination in the spring. This exemplifies the will to survive because Saeng, upon failing the test, experienced profound melancholy and a sense of defeat. Her courage to prepare anew demonstrates the human compulsion to persevere; for her to exist in a foreign nation, she must adapt by passing that examination to ultimately become a survivor.
197	9059	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this specific paragraph to depict the accumulation of snow upon the roads. He illustrates the necessity for individuals to observe their path with vigilance. Ultimately, the paragraph demonstrates that he successfully navigated through the blizzard.
198	9060	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng vows to herself that in the spring, as the snow recedes, geese reappear, and the hibiscus buds, she will retake the examination. The author concludes with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides her with solace reminiscent of home and a renewed confidence. The quotation, “Almost familiar to her now,” indicates that her circumstances are becoming agreeable and she is beginning to experience comfort, realizing her new environment can resemble her former residence. The hibiscus evokes recollections of the flora from her native land. Both the mother and daughter value the discovered flower for its resemblance to their previous hibiscus. For example, the mother remarks, “Its flowers are not as pretty, but it is resilient enough to endure the cold season here.” This reveals their appreciation for its similarity to the original. In conclusion, the author ends the narrative with that paragraph to elucidate the significance of the girl’s memories of her former home.
199	9061	4	1	The author selected this conclusion to demonstrate that Saeng has not yet relinquished her efforts within her new existence. It reveals that despite her profound affection for her homeland and her persistent, poignant recollections, she perseveres. Having failed the examination, the pressures of her current life appeared overwhelming. Although she has not yet fully acclimatized, she will strive to overcome the adversities she encounters. This conclusion affords the reader a sense of hope, rather than merely concluding with her purchasing a flower after her failure and proceeding indifferently. For example, her distress and considerable anger upon failing are evident: “I—I failed the test,” Saeng uttered. For an extended moment, Mrs. Panouvong remained silent. Saeng could not meet her mother’s gaze, instead staring at the hibiscus and anxiously tearing a leaf into fragments. It enraged Saeng that she had to abandon a contented past for a life that is dissimilar and demanding. When confronting such a challenge, intense emotional states arise; Saeng merely required hope, and the author chose this ending to convey to the reader that a possibility for hope exists.
200	9062	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author Minfong Ho concludes the narrative as she does for a multitude of significant reasons, thereby providing a resonant and meaningful resolution to the protagonist's journey.
201	9063	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it synthesizes the preceding events into a cohesive resolution. It conveys her anticipation for the spring season, when the hibiscus will bloom.
202	9064	4	1	The author concludes with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, to articulate her realization. She observes that the birds possess a permanent home and the plant can thrive in its new environment; similarly, she can persevere if she endeavors to do so. She resolves to wait until the birds’ return signifies renewal and the plant flourishes, indicating that her circumstances will have stabilized. Consequently, she will feel sufficiently secure and confident to attempt the examination once more.
203	9065	4	1	The author selected this conclusion for the narrative for several reasons. Primarily, it is intended to provoke the audience's contemplation regarding potential subsequent events, thereby fostering anticipation. Furthermore, this ambiguous resolution strategically allows for the possibility of a sequel, which is the fundamental rationale for its implementation.
204	9066	4	1	She vowed this because, analogous to the geese's inevitable return, she too shall persevere. The test represents an opportunity for learning and personal growth that she would embrace. Furthermore, she would confront the trials of love, survival, and family tradition, recognizing their arrival as her destiny. For instance, the geese return to nurture their offspring for the impending journey, realizing they must always return because their existence originated there and to evade the cold and humankind's threats. The severe winter necessitates their departure merely to survive. Through this, she internalizes the essential lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival.
205	9067	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's personal commitment to retaking the examination. This resolution suggests that future opportunities persistently exist for improvement and redemption. The primary intent is to reinforce the notion that one can always endeavor anew following a setback. Ultimately, it serves to remind the reader that second chances are a universal possibility deserving of acknowledgment.
206	9068	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner because the seasons are transitioning, thereby concluding their cycle and initiating a new one. Consequently, this constitutes an effective denouement for such a story, as it establishes a particular ambiance and emotional resonance at its conclusion.
207	9069	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph because it conveys the central theme of adjusting to life's alterations. Many circumstances have changed for Saeng, who has not yet fully acclimated to her new existence. However, she comprehends the necessity of possessing the determination to adapt and survive, akin to the hibiscus. The text notes, ""In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding,"" illustrating how the plant instructs Saeng to persevere, as it endures the winter. She learns resolve; although she initially failed her examination, her memories have fortified her, and she will endeavor once more. These concepts are encapsulated in the final paragraph to summarize the imperative of perseverance despite feeling displaced, as she gradually becomes accustomed to her new environment and recognizes the seasonal transitions in her concluding reflection."
208	9070	4	1	The purpose is to establish a specific tone and to depict their appearance. Furthermore, that brief paragraph could potentially serve as an introduction for another literary work or to stimulate intellectual inquiry. It could also facilitate a comparison between one's own life and the existence of geese, such as by elucidating the various adversities one has encountered.
209	9071	4	1	The author elects to conclude the narrative thus for several reasons. Throughout the story, the author implies Saeng's homesickness. This is paralleled with the flower's resilience in surviving the winter, signifying that she, too, will endure. Although the flower differs from those in her homeland, change is inevitable, yet she can still retain this symbolic connection. Therefore, the author likely decided to end the story on this note to affirm that, like the plant, she will survive and endeavor to adapt with the spring, as evidenced by her driving test.
210	9072	4	1	The author concluded in that manner because he was responsible for evaluating the subsequent content. The assessment pertains to the level and key for improvement. Regarding all matters, he was astonished to be graciously distinguished, thereby elevating the situation so that a superior outcome is bestowed, which will ultimately suit everyone until the author's final resolution.
211	9073	4	1	"I posit that the author incorporated this paragraph to illustrate her resilience and persistent efforts following failure. Saeng explicitly informed her mother, ""I failed the test,"" thereby conveying a sense of pride and optimism about retaking it. Personally, I have also failed examinations and declared my intention to retake them, yet I did not follow through. Consequently, the author included this element to underscore Saeng's profound determination."
212	9074	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey to the reader that Saeng retains future opportunities and refuses to surrender regarding the examination. The text reveals that Saeng finds solace in memories of her homeland, indicating the considerable difficulty of her relocation. The author describes, ""It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel."" This sensation and the fragrance of the hibiscus provided her comfort. Following her test failure, she purchased the plant to elevate her spirits. The author chose to conclude with Saeng's resolution to retake the test once the hibiscus buds because, as established, the plant represents the sole positive influence since her move, supplying the motivation to persevere and signaling her enduring resolve to the reader."
213	9075	4	1	"Minfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a potent final paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's fervent resolve to succeed in her new environment. The closing declaration that Saeng ""vowed"" to pass the examination reveals her tenacious fighting spirit. This fortitude likely originates from memories of her grandmother and the flowers reminiscent of her native land. Saeng's courage in confronting her homesickness forms the narrative's core; by concluding with such a definitive statement, Minfong Ho transforms an ostensibly melancholic tale into one celebrating willpower and the drive to succeed. ""Winter Hibiscus"" is a passage concerning heartache, despair, and yearning for a former life. By concluding with Saeng's uplifting promise, the author provides a hopeful resolution to a potentially sorrowful story."
214	9076	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it coincides with the conclusion of the seasonal cycle and provides a fitting denouement for the narrative itself.
215	9077	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph because it implies an inevitable recurrence of the event. This is evident from the statement, ""in the spring... I will take this test again."" She is essentially mentally preparing herself for the subsequent attempt the following year. This anticipated cyclical effort is the rationale for the story's concluding paragraph."
216	9078	4	1	Following her evening meal, Saeng contemplated the examination. She was confident in her capacity to improve upon her prior performance. Consequently, she resolved that with winter's conclusion and spring's commencement, she would retake the test, determined to succeed with distinction.
217	9079	4	1	Saeng aspires to retake the examination during pleasant weather, coinciding with the hibiscus's blossoming. The plant symbolizes the accomplishment of passing the test. Its resilience, strength, and refined beauty will metaphorically guide her to success. These attributes parallel both the girl and the flower. The day was agreeable, and she desires to take the test then. The plant's previous strength and toughness represented her during her initial failure, about which she informed her understanding mother. The plant and the geese both signify beauty. She intends to attempt the test at that specific time, believing she will succeed on her next endeavor. Upon completing and passing her examination, she wishes to return to the beautiful surroundings to commemorate the occasion. The author concluded with this statement to emphasize the significance of the plant and the environment for her anticipated success.
218	9080	4	1	The author likely concluded the narrative with that paragraph to remind the reader of Saeng's profound sincerity toward the hibiscus. This is evident because throughout the story, the character demonstrated considerable compassion for the flower. It seems she felt a distinct personal connection to the plant, perceiving a shared experience.
219	9081	4	1	"The author concludes with this paragraph as it symbolizes a new beginning. Saeng's admission, ""I failed the test,"" is accompanied by profound disappointment; she is pledging to pursue a fresh start in life, analogous to the world's renewal each spring. The narrative's theme suggests adopting a new approach when confronted with life's difficulties, which aligns with her intention to retake the driving examination."
220	9082	4	1	The author concludes the story thus to illustrate that Saeng will eventually be prepared to take the test, but only after she has grown and adapted to her new environment, much like the hibiscus and the geese. The hibiscus must now acclimate to conditions outside the store, while the geese adapt by migrating south for winter. Saeng must continue learning and adjusting before she can pass her driving test. This final paragraph demonstrates Saeng's realization of the necessary steps: she must cease dwelling on her past home and commence her new life in this unfamiliar country.
221	9083	4	1	"Minfong Ho concluded her narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" with an optimistic statement, intending this resolution because the protagonist was descending into despair. Saeng resolved to retake the driving examination upon her hibiscus blossoming. This flora evokes memories of her former existence in Vietnam alongside her grandmother. ""Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb"". She favored her Vietnamese life over her current one in @LOCATION2. She would await the moment ""this hibiscus is budding,"" thereby attaining greater comfort and contentment. The author deliberately concluded with Saeng's anticipated happiness."
222	9084	4	1	The author concluded the narrative thusly because the protagonist's sorrow necessitates instilling hope within the reader, advocating for persistent effort and resilience. Furthermore, it culminates positively; an conclusion depicting the protagonist weeping incessantly in her @CAPS1 would be profoundly unsatisfactory. This denouement offers the reader encouragement and underscores the necessity of diligent practice. This is because, with spring's arrival, the protagonist intends to practice driving extensively to ensure she does not fail her subsequent test. The character's increasing happiness at the conclusion also elicits satisfaction from the reader. In summary, this story ending was an astute selection for numerous reasons, including generating reader contentment, inspiring courage to persevere, and emphasizing practice following initial failure, alongside assisting one's mother with horticultural tasks.
223	9085	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to develop its thematic essence and foreshadow the protagonist's subsequent actions after planting the hibiscus. The central theme involves adapting to life's transformations, a concept the author reinforces within the final passage. The concluding paragraph states, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This illustrates Saeng's process of acclimating to altered circumstances. Here, having failed her driver’s test, Saeng procures a hibiscus to evoke her homeland as a coping mechanism. The hibiscus symbolizes a recommencement and her pledge to retry the examination upon the geese's return.
224	9086	4	1	Consequently, she remained determined to retake the examination.
225	9087	4	1	Saeng refused to succumb to despair, resolving to retake the test with the expectation of eventual success. One does not invariably succeed on the initial attempt; occasionally, achievement requires repeated effort. Saeng serves as an inspiration to persevere despite early setbacks. She concurrently cultivates self-assurance. This rationale elucidates the author's chosen story conclusion.
226	9088	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with Saeng's vow to retake the examination in the spring to illustrate how the geese and the hibiscus embody a concept of rebirth or revival for her. He intended to conclude on an optimistic tone. Spring constitutes an archetypal season, a period of birth and maturation. After failing her initial test, Saeng encountered the hibiscus, which evoked memories of Vietnam, thereby comforting her. She believes that witnessing the plant flourish and the geese return might facilitate a similar renewal for herself.
227	9089	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the final paragraph, given Saeng's initial test failure. After her botanical encounters and subsequent realizations, Saeng's decision to retake the examination in the spring represents a natural progression. This interpretation stems from Saeng's understanding that she must acclimate to life in @LOCATION1; the plant reminded her of this necessity, just as the geese flying in a ""V"" formation mirrored sights from her native Vietnam. She recognized the parallels and resolved to retake the driver's test to adapt to the changes in @LOCATION1. Furthermore, concluding with the spring test is appropriate, as the geese return and the hibiscus buds, signifying a commencement for them as well as for Saeng."
228	9090	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's resolve to procure a plant that will evoke memories of her grandmother and her former home, which she might revisit one day @MONTH1. Consequently, she can behold the cherished flower she adores rather than the substitute she initially obtained.
229	9091	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate that Saeng is not surrendering. In the spring, she will observe the plant and recall her homeland, which will alleviate her homesickness. The quotation, ""Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world,"" indicates that familiar flora remind her of home. Thus, in the spring when her plant blooms, the sight will provide comfort and a sense of belonging, thereby empowering her to pass the driving examination. Therefore, as the plant blossoms, so does her level of solace."
230	9092	4	1	I believe the author was describing the snow and how the external conditions were harsh for the birds; subsequently, the snow commenced melting.
231	9093	4	1	He concluded the narrative with that particular sentence because it conveyed her acquisition of a profound life lesson. Throughout her journey back to her original home, she felt the absence of her friends and missed observing her mother laboring in the garden during this cold season. Their poverty is perhaps of a particular nature. Ultimately, he selected this sentence because it signifies her having learned a significant lesson and commencing anew, yet with a more profound comprehension from her experiences.
232	9094	4	1	Saeng articulates this statement because she desires to earn her mother's pride; consequently, she intends to retake the examination following the winter season.
233	9095	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to emphasize her resolute determination, as she cherishes the hibiscus. What superior method to conclude the story than by having her draw a parallel between herself and the hibiscus? When she states, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” she implies that the snow currently impedes the hibiscus. Similarly, her failure temporarily hinders her progress. Therefore, she will prepare through study, so that when spring arrives and the hibiscus buds, she too will blossom by passing her examination.
234	9096	4	1	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow that “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because the spring and the hibiscus evoke memories of her homeland. For instance, within the article, she becomes emotionally overwhelmed, unable to speak of home due to profound longing. Thus, she seeks objects that remind her of it, such as a plant named dok faeng-noi. Although it is not the authentic plant, she acquires it to memorialize her origins. In summary, Saeng discovers a plant and favors the spring because they remind her of home, prompting one to consider what personally evokes such memories.
235	9097	4	1	The author selected this paragraph to conclude the story in order to communicate to the reader that circumstances improve with the passage of time. Saeng failed her driver’s test because she was not adequately prepared, just as a flower may bloom prematurely. The author suggests that patience is essential, and that favorable outcomes will eventually materialize.
236	9098	4	1	"The author selected the concluding sentence, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to illustrate the parallel between the hibiscus's resilience and Saeng's own fortitude. Following her failed driver's test, Saeng discovers solace in a hibiscus indigenous to her homeland. Her mother subsequently observes, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here,"" revealing Saeng's initial struggles within her unfamiliar environment. The final quotation encapsulates the notion that Saeng derives her strength from the flower's endurance, implicitly reasoning that if the plant can thrive in a foreign land, she possesses the same capacity."
237	9099	4	1	She resolves to retake the examination once she feels adequately prepared and competent, and when the external conditions are favorable and serene, thereby fostering the necessary confidence for the endeavor. The author sought to convey her profound sentiment of having disappointed her mother.
238	9100	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph due to its thematic significance and its function in providing closure. It elucidates the protagonist's gradual adaptation to her new surroundings and her renewed determination to assimilate successfully. Her declaration to retake the test signifies a fundamental shift in her perspective. The author employs this concluding segment to synthesize the narrative's elements and demonstrate the character's substantive transformation.
239	9101	4	1	In the short story “The Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with this paragraph to signify the specific moment when Saeng would achieve the readiness and resolve necessary to attempt the test again.
240	9102	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate her enduring sense of hope. The hibiscus serves as a symbol, providing her with both hope and resilience. With the arrival of spring, she intends to retake her test, aspiring to succeed, which justifies the author's decision for this concluding passage.
241	9103	4	1	"In the final paragraph of Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow: ""when they come back... I will take that test again."" This quotation was selected to demonstrate her resolute determination to surmount this obstacle. For Saeng, the hibiscus embodies solace and the capacity for perseverance. Her considerable strength is derived from the determination rooted in her history, which is why the author chose this concluding emphasis."
242	9104	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author employs the concluding paragraph to illustrate the profound significance the flower holds for Saeng. The narrative describes how ""in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter Hibiscus' into it,"" indicating the plant's deep personal meaning. This final statement further enables the reader to comprehend her burgeoning affection for her new country. Moreover, the conclusion provides a sense of comfort during a period of disappointment, underscored by the observation that ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This also reveals the symbolic connection between Saeng and the flower, which supports her through adversity."
243	9105	4	1	The author likely incorporated this resolution to signify that Saeng requires a period for personal development, analogous to the plant's growth, before she attempts the examination again. Occasionally, additional time is essential for one to successfully pass a test. The process of education imparts more than mere knowledge; it facilitates maturation and a deeper comprehension of life. As a tenth-grade student, I recognize that my own understanding of life has expanded considerably since first grade. Saeng still possesses substantial mental and emotional growth regarding her past and present circumstances to undertake.
244	9106	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this specific line to convey that hope for the protagonist endures and that the flower served as a significant inspiration. When Saeng declares, ""when they come back... then I will take the test again,"" she deliberately selects a moment of renewal, intending to recommence her efforts concurrent with the other cyclical events mentioned. The phrase ""and this hibiscus is budding"" signifies the flower's reblooming, representing a fresh inception paralleling her own endeavor to succeed at the requisite examination. Furthermore, the tone of her statement conveyed hope and a determined conviction that she would undoubtedly pass upon her next attempt."
245	9107	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to indicate that although this specific narrative concludes, Saeng's life will persist. The passage offers closure for the reader while also clarifying that, in due course, Saeng will retake the test after she has more fully acclimated to the new culture.
246	9108	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey her aspiration for the protagonist's ultimate success and moral integrity.
247	9109	4	1	The explanation for the author's concluding paragraph is that the narrative concerned a perennial plant regenerating annually. The paragraph signified that the plant's return each spring, alongside the geese, represents a subsequent trial for its cultivation and preservation.
248	9110	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to demonstrate her resolve. The discovered hibiscus, resembling one from her homeland, symbolized her solace and personal determination. The phrase ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now"" indicates her growing recognition of the geese, which bolsters her self-assurance. The imagery of her lifting her head as ""their distinctive v was etched"" conveys the enduring hope within her, thereby unifying the paragraph's conclusion with Saeng's nascent beliefs and aspirations."
249	9111	4	1	Saeng pledges this to herself at the story's conclusion to signify her intention to adapt to change, analogous to the hibiscus preparing to bud. She acknowledges the inherent difficulty and duration of the process but anticipates achieving acceptance and contentment. Her emotional breakdown and interactions with her mother illustrate the present struggle. By planting the hibiscus, she symbolizes a future improvement contingent upon her not remaining excessively anchored to the past.
250	9112	4	1	"The author concludes the paragraph with Saeng's declaration to illustrate her motivation and determination. Her resolve is demonstrated through multiple actions, such as offering, ""Here let me help you, mother,"" indicating motivation through assisting her mother. Furthermore, her realization that ""through a quiet repetition of season upon season,"" previously strange elements had become familiar reveals her determination to persevere without perceiving it as peculiar, which justifies the author's concluding statement."
251	9113	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng’s silent vow to retake the examination in the spring, as the snow recedes, the geese reappear, and the hibiscus flourishes. This determination stems from the author's own biographical context. One detail is her family’s relocation to the United States from Vietnam. A second is the author’s potential for crafting an autobiographical story. The narrative centers upon Saeng’s initial failure of her driving test.
252	9114	4	1	"The author concludes ""The Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to illustrate the narrator's realization that, despite residing in a new nation, certain elements remain constant, thus fortifying her resolve to pass the examination. For instance, the narrator observes that many phenomena she initially perceived as strange had become familiar through the cyclical repetition of seasons. This demonstrates her awareness that while life has transformed, some fundamentals are immutable. This also indicates that the test, once alien, is now familiar enough for her to pass. The narrator's statement that Saeng could not meet her mother's gaze reveals her profound disappointment at failing, signifying the test's importance and the accompanying pressure to succeed. Now acclimated, she is prepared to attempt the test again with greater readiness. The story's theme suggests that one should not be discouraged by obstacles, as the narrator has recently endured numerous difficulties, yet persists through the seasons."
253	9115	4	1	The narrative conveys a resolute determination to persevere. The protagonist declares she will retake the test in spring, as the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This signifies the author's recognition of the necessity to adapt. Her decision to wait for spring indicates a commitment to persevere rather than surrender. The author also attributes profound sentimental value to the hibiscus. By awaiting its bloom, she implicitly connects the flower to her homeland; having left her country, the hibiscus represents the closest link to it, and thus she will wait in concert with the flower's natural cycle.
254	9116	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's newfound perception of imagery linked to memories within her new environment, alongside recollections from Vietnam. Initially, in the floral shop, she remembers her grandmother, a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other elements evoking specific sentiments and past experiences. Ultimately, she employs both the hibiscus, which recalls her former home, and the Canadian geese, which no longer seem entirely foreign, to symbolize the passage of time. She now regards her new home as containing familiar objects imbued with memory, much like her previous life.
255	9117	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several reasons. One rationale is that the protagonist desired something profoundly. She brought it home and presented it to her mother, who then regarded her with astonishment, as the text states, ""Her mother stared at her incredulously."" She subsequently explains her failure of the driving examination, yet she refuses to capitulate. Therefore, at the story's conclusion, she vows to retake the test. In summary, this illustrates the author's purpose for concluding the narrative with this particular paragraph."
256	9118	4	1	"The narrative concludes with Saeng’s silent vow to retake the examination in the spring, a season of renewal marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. This resolution underscores her resolute determination to succeed in her subsequent driving test. Furthermore, the flora evokes potent memories of her native Vietnam, as illustrated by the observation that ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world."" By the following year, coinciding with the flowers' bloom, she will be more prepared and resolute. The blossoming hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning, paralleling Saeng's aspiration for a fresh start upon passing her test, which justifies the author's concluding statement."
257	9119	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to articulate an unwavering perseverance. It conveys Saeng's absolute determination to surmount all challenges, implying she will persist in retaking the examination relentlessly until she ultimately achieves success. This concluding segment serves to affirm the imperative of relentless persistence, thereby providing a definitive and motivating closure to the story.
258	9121	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng’s vow: “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph signifies that despite failing her initial driving examination, Saeng remains steadfastly committed until she ultimately secures her license. The conclusion further emphasizes her anticipation for winter's end, when she can witness the hibiscus budding, symbolizing hope and renewal."
259	9122	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's conclusion reconnects to the protagonist's initial conflict of failing her driver’s test. This technique returns the reader to the central dilemma while also foreshadowing future events, as indicated by the line, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" This sentence informs the reader that a plant reminiscent of her homeland will facilitate her progress. The hibiscus inaugurates a new phase by budding in spring, a fresh start that Saeng will emulate by retaking her test. This conclusion effectively prevents reader confusion regarding the driving test's narrative significance."
260	9123	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey its fundamental significance. For instance, upon returning, she experienced profound contentment because she had come back to where she felt a sense of belonging. This is exemplified by her silent vow, made ""in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,"" which signified that returning was undoubtedly the most beneficial action she could have taken for her well-being."
261	9124	4	1	It appears to me that the author selected that particular conclusion primarily to employ sarcasm and emphasize his declaration, thereby clarifying his absolute refusal to retake the examination; essentially, one would have to kill him to compel a second attempt.
262	9125	4	1	"I contend that the author concluded the narrative with this paragraph to convey Saeng's resolve to retake the examination upon the hibiscus's return. Substantiating this, the final paragraph states, ""when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This evidence confirms my interpretation of the author's concluding intent."
263	9126	4	1	The author employs this conclusion to represent a cyclical process. By not concluding at the cycle's terminus, he cultivates suspense, leaving readers with a sense of anticipatory curiosity. This constitutes a skillfully composed narrative and denouement.
264	9127	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a teenage girl fails a driving test but vows to retake it in the spring. The story concludes thusly to symbolize the protagonist's impending renewal. For instance, she vows, ""When they come back... then I will take that test again."" The hibiscus provides her with a connection to her homeland; its budding signifies a new beginning, which she feels she can emulate, thereby justifying the story's final sentiment."
265	9128	4	1	"Several reasons elucidate the author's chosen conclusion. Primarily, the narrative maintains a serious, straightforward tone, yet ends with a resonant vow, compelling readers to contemplate its significance. A simple recounting of events would have sufficed, but this addition provokes deeper reflection. The author selected this specific pledge—""then I will take that test again""—precisely because its distinctive nature enhances the story's overall impact."
266	9129	4	1	Through dedicated practice, she will enhance her driving proficiency, and upon the flower's bloom, she will undertake the examination once more, endeavoring with greater resolve on her subsequent attempt.
267	9130	4	1	The author incorporates that particular paragraph to facilitate a mental visualization for the reader, as the capacity to conjure such an image signifies effective descriptive power.
268	9131	4	1	The author concludes thusly to convey her intent to spend an entire season without dwelling on home; having failed in winter, she will attempt again in spring. This interpretation is supported by her reflection on how the plant evokes memories of life prior to their urban relocation. For instance, its scent seemingly transports her back to her childhood, when such plants grew wild and possessed a particular beauty.
269	9132	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in spring, symbolizing hope and providing narrative closure. This conclusion fosters anticipation, as the return of geese and the blooming hibiscus signify Saeng's growing acclimatization to her new environment and her expanding social connections. Concurrently, the flowering hibiscus will evoke fond memories of her youth in her homeland, which will bolster her determination to pass the examination. Furthermore, this passage creates a compelling and satisfying resolution that encourages rereading or recommendation, as it definitively conveys Saeng's resolve to succeed."
270	9133	4	1	"The final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" features Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring, a statement that underscores her enduring hope and ongoing adjustment to her new surroundings. Throughout the narrative, Saeng realizes she remains connected to her Vietnamese heritage, a sentiment awakened by plants in a florist's shop that vividly recall her childhood. Although she initially fails her test, overwhelmed by homesickness after purchasing a winter hibiscus, she gradually grows more accustomed to her new life, finding elements that are ""almost familiar."" Thus, her concluding vow signifies her aspiration that, by spring, she will have overcome her nostalgia and begun to perceive her new location, with its geese and hibiscuses, as home."
271	9134	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate Saeng's nascent resolve. The entire story chronicles Saeng's afternoon journey toward accepting her new environment, rendering it appropriate to culminate with her determination to pass the driving examination and establish a viable life in @LOCATION1. The plot involves several discoveries that foster Saeng's sense of belonging, such as the pungent bitter melon and the resilient hibiscus. These @CAPS1 cultivate Saeng's acclimatization, justifying the conclusion with her acceptance of remaining in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is similarly motivated by the hibiscus, which is ""strong enough to endure the cold months—that is what matters."" This sentiment translates to Saeng's resolve to persevere in her new existence. Ultimately, the geese signify Saeng's recognition that life in @LOCATION1 is growing ""familiar."" These geese prompt @PERSON1's realization that this is her permanent home, precluding a return. The narrative is replete with such incidents, all of which culminate in the @CAPS2 determination, thereby making the story's concluding focus on her resolve entirely fitting."
272	9135	4	1	The author employs this concluding paragraph to signify the commencement of a new beginning, exemplified by the characters' relocation to a foreign nation. This concept is metaphorically conveyed through the arrival of spring, which symbolizes a renewed life for Saeng and her mother. Concurrently, the snow represents a blanket obscuring past hardships. Furthermore, the budding of the hibiscus also denotes a fresh inception. Synthesizing these elements, the melting snow signifies the dissipation of difficult times, while the advent of spring and the flowering buds herald a new commencement. The author incorporated this paragraph to articulate the necessity for a definitive fresh start.
273	9136	4	1	The author selected that sentence as the conclusion because Saeng believes she merits another opportunity to retake the driving test, having previously failed and consequently disappointing her mother. Saeng's final declaration indicates her intention to approach the subsequent driving test with significantly greater confidence and self-assurance.
274	9137	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it symbolizes the conclusion of winter, thereby representing an end to a period of hardship and the imminent arrival of a more hopeful season, which aligns with the protagonist's emotional arc and the story's thematic resolution.
275	9138	4	1	"The author likely concludes the story in this manner to evoke a sense of hope and wonder. The narrative is fundamentally about overcoming adversity. For instance, Saeng failed her driving test and appeared overwhelmed by the concept of ""home."" Her evident concern over this failure precipitated a visit to a greenhouse. There, while searching for a specific plant that evoked memories of home and her grandmother, she experienced profound distress. Saeng endures an internal conflict, and the author concludes the story this way to leave the reader with a palpable sense of hope for her future and a feeling of contemplative wonder."
276	9139	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate her resilience following an initial failure. This passage further illustrates her endeavor to embrace the country as fully as possible, anticipating the spring season when the hibiscus blooms, a sight that will evoke memories of her homeland while simultaneously symbolizing her nascent existence in @LOCATION1.
277	9140	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed to acquire a specific plant that had perished; however, with winter's conclusion and spring's arrival, she has another opportunity to obtain the flower. For instance, the narrative describes Saeng breaking down in tears. She arrived home at dusk, a circumstance for which she was not responsible, as the text notes the intensifying wind stripped the remaining vestiges of greenery and chicory weeds. The conclusion thus signifies a future moment when Saeng will be seen again, holding the beautiful plant.
278	9141	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the character Saeng intends to complete her objective or retake the examination upon their return. Furthermore, the author is conveying that individuals should not abandon their pursuits; she then states, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signifying her absolute determination to persevere."
279	9142	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with that sentence to signify Saeng's intention to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with her hibiscus finally budding. Saeng will retake the examination because she did not pass it the initial time. This rationale explains the author's placement of that sentence at the story's conclusion.
280	9143	4	1	The author composed this paragraph at the story's conclusion to symbolize a new beginning. This is evident because the spring season and the budding hibiscus will remind her of her homeland, inspiring her to make a fresh attempt at the test.
281	9144	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify Saeng's resolution to retake the examination in the spring, anticipating heightened confidence coinciding with the snow's thaw, the geese's return, and the hibiscus's initial budding. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her."" She experiences loneliness stemming from her foreign origins and a profound longing for all she previously knew and cherished. Now the hibiscus serves as a memento of her homeland."
282	9145	4	1	"The author employs this paragraph to conclude the narrative, illustrating a deliberate process of learning and maturation undergone by the protagonist. Initially, Saeng is profoundly uneasy and disappointed in herself. ""I-I failed the test,"" Saeng states. ""For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing."" One can discern the mother's initial disappointment, which subsequently dissipates during their conversation while gardening, thereby alleviating the tension. ""How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?"" ""I’d love it,"" Saeng said. Her disposition has now brightened, and she is formulating a calm, collected decision to attempt the examination again—a rational choice made from a composed, rather than distraught, state of mind."
283	9146	4	1	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" possesses an unconventional conclusion. The author selected this denouement for several reasons. Initially, the protagonist's test failure precipitated a withdrawn silence; her subsequent agreement to retake it signifies a resilient will to endure and demonstrates her persistence toward achieving the objective. Ultimately, the ending could symbolize a new commencement, analogous to the snow melting and transforming winter into spring. This interpretation elucidates the meaning behind the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" and the author's rationale for its composition."
284	9147	4	1	"The author concludes with this sentence to demonstrate Saeng's intention to adapt to her new environment. It conveys that Saeng will no longer succumb to grief and sorrow, but will instead adjust and persevere with her life. The author includes this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at-at—"". This occurs after Saeng returns home and converses with her mother, feeling despondent due to reminiscing about her former life. However, the final statement of the story reveals Saeng's decision to progress forward and relinquish her sadness, having established an objective to accept her new circumstances, which justifies the author's chosen conclusion."
285	9148	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph to convey that the hibiscus symbolizes solace during a period of disillusionment for Saeng. She encountered the plant immediately following her unsuccessful driving examination.
286	9149	4	1	"Authors utilize conclusions to culminate a narrative or to provoke reader introspection. In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author employs the concluding statement, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" to illustrate her intent to assimilate into the culture. For instance, her emotional collapse within the garden shop is described: ""and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept."" One can deduce that she weeps not from an inherent inability to belong, but from a fear, prompted by her failed test, that she will not. Consequently, she ultimately resolves to attempt the examination once more. In summary, the author deployed that paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's renewed commitment to passing the test, thereby facilitating her integration into this unfamiliar society."
287	9150	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to convey her resolute refusal to surrender. It demonstrates her determination to retake the examination and apply greater effort to surmount her challenge, thereby refusing to concede defeat. The author aims to portray her as an individual of steadfast perseverance, filled with resolve despite confronting significant personal conflicts. This final assertion solidifies the theme of unwavering tenacity in the face of adversity.
288	9151	4	1	"The author elected to conclude the narrative with this particular paragraph because it delineates the protagonist's future intentions. For example, subsequent to informing her mother, ""I failed…,"" while she was situating the flower in the garden soil, a flock of geese was observed flying southward. This imagery, coupled with her silent vow, projects her resolve forward, establishing a trajectory of hope and renewed endeavor beyond the story's immediate events."
289	9152	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to convey her resolve to attempt the test once more. Her declaration, ""Then I will take that test again,"" signifies her recognition of a subsequent opportunity. This demonstrates her strong will and refusal to capitulate easily. The final paragraph's essence advocates for persistent effort following initial failure. The story notes, ""she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" indicating her ongoing process of adaptation. Consequently, one may reasonably anticipate her future success."
290	9153	4	1	"The author selected this conclusion to underscore the protagonist's determination to pass the examination, which pertained to cultivating a garden. This is evidenced by the statement, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" linking the test to the spring season and floral blossoming, implying a horticultural endeavor. The narrative references her assistance to her mother in the garden, suggesting that after the plants failed to thrive, she resolved to try again. This rationale explains the author's choice to culminate with her vow to retake the test in the spring."
291	9154	4	1	"The author employs this paragraph to evoke recollections from when Saeng deposited the soil during the ""winter hibiscus"" and a flock of Canada geese traversed the sky above her. Having failed her initial test, Saeng could not bear to face her mother. She derived fortitude from the hibiscus, which instilled a desire to retake the examination, contingent upon their re-budding."
292	9155	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to synthesize the story's central themes. The text previously addressed the spring season, and now it depicts Saeng and her mother cultivating flowers, symbolizing a new beginning and the cyclical nature of life.
293	9156	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate her resilience, paralleling the survival of the birds and the hibiscus. Their perseverance signifies an inherent strength, which she mirrors by resolving to endure her new surroundings and adapt to the demands of her contemporary life.
294	9157	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to generate suspense, compelling the audience to anticipate a subsequent story that reveals whether she ultimately passes the driving test, thereby enhancing the plot's engagement.
295	9158	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to symbolize Saeng's resolution to persevere and surmount her challenges. Rather than a literal statement, it employs diction to convey her objective metaphorically. The narrative notes her growing familiarity with once-alien elements, like the geese, suggesting the driving test will also become manageable. As an immigrant from Vietnam, Saeng has continually adapted to new circumstances, demonstrating a determination to thrive. The paragraph's imagery of the geese, representing new skills, and the hibiscus, symbolizing constancy, poetically underscores the story's central themes of resilience and the will to survive.
296	9159	4	1	The author possesses a profound affection for @CAPS1 plants; consequently, with the conclusion of each winter, her @CAPS2 commences to ascertain the feasibility of cultivating exquisite flora. The spring @ORGANIZATION1 represents the singular @ORGANIZATION1 where one can cultivate unique specimens akin to hers. Her objective is to cultivate a garden replete with beautiful plants and vegetables. The author will labor diligently, emulating her mother's efforts, to animate the gardens, particularly following the winter season.
297	9160	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph, reflecting extensively upon the profound beauty inherent in nature. He also postulated that, given Saeng's profound adoration for nature, she would inevitably return to school to complete the examination when she could otherwise remain at home in the garden, tending to the plants. This rationale elucidates why the author likely elected to conclude with that paragraph; it would effectively articulate the depth of his appreciation for the natural world.
298	9161	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the narrative with that specific paragraph to symbolize nascent beginnings. The story chronicles the failure and humiliation Saeng experienced upon failing her driving examination, and how encountering a familiar hibiscus plant instilled her with renewed vitality. Purchasing the hibiscus evoked memories of her homeland, and by providing that single hibiscus with a new, unfamiliar environment in which to flourish—paralleling her own situation—she established a profound connection with the plant. The spring season symbolizes the commencement of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the genesis of its new life; consequently, Saeng resolves to recommence her own life as the plant initiates its cycle anew by retaking her driving test.
299	9162	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its symbolism conveys that once everything reverts to normalcy, as “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” she will retake the examination, signifying her willingness to progress and endeavor to adapt.
300	9163	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph concerning retaking the test to illustrate that Saeng is acclimating to @LOCATION2, that our memories are perpetual, and that even the most minuscule objects can encapsulate our recollections. The paragraph demonstrates Saeng's increasing familiarity with @LOCATION2 by revealing her determination to persevere there and to continue striving to comprehend its customs. The final paragraph also illustrates the enduring nature of memory through the hibiscus, which symbolizes Vietnam and her home. Furthermore, it indicates that she can initiate a new life there, just as the hibiscus does at her residence. Ultimately, the paragraph demonstrates how even the smallest items can preserve memories, as the hibiscus represents her Vietnamese home. The hibiscus evokes numerous memories for Saeng, assisting her in coping with @LOCATION2. Thus, the concluding paragraph effectively conveys Saeng's acclimatization, the permanence of memory, and the mnemonic power of small things.
301	9164	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @PERSON1, a teenage girl, Saeng, and her family have relocated to the United States from Vietnam. Saeng is returning home after an unsuccessful driver's examination when she encounters a recognizable plant. She subsequently enters a florist to procure the specimen. Upon arriving home, she informs her mother of her failure; her mother is understandably disappointed, yet she prepares dinner. With the ""winter hibiscus"" present, Saeng ultimately reflects, ""when they come back, in spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Saeng's declaration to retake the test in spring stems from her renewed confidence and contentment, now that she is comforted by the plant and her mother's moderated reaction. She perceives that circumstances will improve, enabling her to retake the examination when life is resurgent."
302	9165	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this line to illustrate that the geese, paralleling the flower, provided inspiration to return, persevere, and not surrender. For instance, Saeng vowed silently that, ""In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This statement demonstrates that the hibiscus was the catalyst for her resolve and that she would return, just as they did. Consequently, the author selected this concluding line to portray Saeng as inspired and resilient."
303	9166	4	1	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with that paragraph to convey the protagonist's determination to succeed. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" This illustrates her resolve because geese migrate and flowers bud with annual regularity. She will persistently return, emulating the geese and the hibiscus. She is determined to eventually pass the examination and assimilate into her new environment, whereas a lack of determination might have precluded success and integration."
304	9167	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this sentence to demonstrate how Saeng surmounts emotional obstacles and how the hibiscus plant signifies hope for the future. Initially, Saeng is distressed by failing her driver's test and is further unsettled upon encountering native flora from her homeland. The narrative states, ""When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub."" This reveals how the plants evoke memories of her homeland, for which she dearly longs. Acquiring the plant is akin to possessing a fragment of her origin. Her statement, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" indicates a restored optimism, a significant emotional shift that will enhance her happiness in @LOCATION1, justifying the story's concluding sentiment."
305	9168	4	1	"The author concludes the story in this manner because Saeng is not yet prepared to advance fully; she will undertake the test and progress only when natural cycles resume. Until her flowers depart, she will not prioritize academic concerns. For example, the text notes, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese."" This signifies that she has grown accustomed to change and has accepted her present circumstances."
306	9169	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that statement because the snow does not melt in the spring, the geese do not return in the winter, and the hibiscus does not bud until spring. The hibiscus is a beautiful plant, which Saeng cherished.
307	9170	4	1	"Saeng's procurement of the hibiscus directly follows her failure on the driving test, an event which devastated her. She seeks a reminder of her native land, where she was not required to undergo such driving lessons. Consequently, she visits a greenhouse to locate flora reminiscent of her homeland, attempting to console herself. Yet, within the warm, humid sanctuary of the greenhouse, Saeng ultimately broke down and wept. She feels defeated, and the hibiscus provides her with hope and memories of her former country. Her mother clearly perceives and comprehends this, evident when she refrains from reprimanding Saeng for the plant's expense, stating, ""I am glad you got it,"" recognizing its comfort for her daughter. Together they plant the hibiscus, an act symbolizing the cultivation of Saeng's hope—not merely to pass the driving test, but to prosper in the new country. The story concludes with these lines because Saeng resolves that if the hibiscus flourishes, so will she. She will be prepared to confront the driving test with hope and support, having adapted. Although the hibiscus is not identical to the one from her old country, she understands both can acclimate to their environment, as the plant has in the new country. The plant will thrive if it adapts, just as Saeng will prosper if she adapts to this new nation."
308	9171	4	1	The author intends to convey that Saeng possesses an indefatigable spirit; her confidence will develop, enabling her to retake the test, analogous to the hibiscus in spring. The comparison drawn between Saeng and the hibiscus in the final paragraph illustrates her potential for growth and advancement, preparing to retake the examination when the timing is opportune. The melting snow signifies her sorrows dissipating, while the emerging sun symbolizes her impending success and development, mirroring the hibiscus she purchased. The plant thriving in sunlight represents her burgeoning confidence for the subsequent test, eliminating the cold, brisk snow of her negative self-esteem and attitude. The author elected to compare Saeng to the plant in the concluding paragraph to demonstrate its profound relevance to her life and outlook, and the transformative impact the hibiscus will effect.
309	9172	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it effectively conveys Saeng's profound resilience and inner fortitude. Furthermore, it provides significant insight into her character and culminates the story with a powerfully resonant tone, which justifies the author's chosen conclusion.
310	9173	4	1	The melting snow and the returning geese signify the imminent arrival of the spring season.
311	9174	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey her readiness for the subsequent examination. The text indicates that, after returning home from failing the driver's test, she observes a recognizable plant. Subsequently, she visits a florist to inquire if the plant is available for purchase, resolving to retake the examination because she feels sufficiently confident to pass it on her next attempt.
312	9175	4	1	The author concludes with this sentence to illustrate the protagonist's fortitude in immigrating to @LOCATION1. Following her unsuccessful driver's test, Saeng felt defeated and disheartened. Her mother demonstrated consideration and refrained from reprimanding her for purchasing the flower; indeed, she elected to plant it, signifying to Saeng that circumstances would ultimately improve. Witnessing her mother's actions, Saeng was imbued with resolve and assumed the task of planting the flower herself. Immigration presents considerable challenges, and many immigrants confront daily difficulties. Saeng's mother, laboring in the cold and striving to ameliorate her situation, established an example that inspired Saeng to adopt a similar perspective, culminating in her decision to retake the driver's test and embrace her mother's resilient attitude.
313	9176	4	1	One can draw a parallel between the narrative and this assertion because the protagonist in the story demonstrates perseverance, and similarly, the individual retaking the examination exhibits a comparable refusal to surrender by deciding to attempt it again.
314	9177	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to express a sense of optimism. The author's intention was to suggest that, after that duration, Saeng will have surmounted her initial failure and will be better equipped for her second attempt at the test. The text elaborates that Saeng recognized how many elements she previously found unfamiliar had since become almost customary, indicating significant progress.
315	9178	4	1	"Minfong Ho concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the transformation in Saeng's spirit and her perspective toward her new existence in @LOCATION1. Spring symbolizes renewal, a motif the author deliberately incorporates. Spring will represent Saeng's period of rebirth, during which she can undertake the examination and recommence her life in @LOCATION1. The phrase ""When the snow melts"" is included because winter symbolizes dormancy, and as the snow dissipates, so too will Saeng's apprehensions."
316	9179	4	1	In the spring, the snows thaw and the grass emerges, yet it is not aesthetically pleasing but rather a sodden turf for the swine who delight in the mire. Consider a vehicle mired in mud; observe winter's transformative effects. Contemplate the tree now burdened with foliage, striving to exist a commendable existence.
317	9180	4	1	"The author elected to conclude the final paragraph with this narrative to demonstrate her persistent resilience. This is evidenced by the description of ""overhead...geese...honk...familiar to Saeng now,"" which signifies her acclimation. Her purchase of the hibiscus, an object imbued with mnemonic significance from her homeland, serves as a catalyst for perseverance. Furthermore, her mother preparing an ""omelet with slices of bitter melon"" stimulated her salivary glands, a poignant reminder of her origins that instilled hope and fortified her resolve."
318	9181	4	1	Saeng possesses a profound affection for flora and vegetation. The author concludes with this paragraph because it corresponds thematically with the narrative. During the vernal season, as the snow recedes, Saeng anticipated winter's conclusion to behold her plants and flowers once more. She appreciates the horticultural virtues and derives satisfaction from their cultivation. The inclusion of this passage illustrates the author's intention to portray Saeng's deep-seated ardor for botany, as she eagerly awaited the cessation of the winter interlude.
319	9182	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to illustrate how Saeng forges an emotional connection to the plant, which serves as a mnemonic device for her homeland. This linkage is significant as it exemplifies how individuals devise mechanisms to navigate life's transitions. Saeng achieves this by procuring and cultivating the hibiscus, thereby ensuring a perpetual visual reminder of her origins. She also acquires the plant to provide motivation for retaking the examination she previously failed, coinciding with the spring season when the flower commences its budding phase.
320	9183	4	1	This is because she experiences disorientation and has not yet acclimatized to her new nation. She believes she can concentrate on her examination once the flower blossoms, for it will evoke a greater sense of belonging, thus fostering her conviction that she will perform more proficiently on the subsequent test attempt.
321	9184	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides her solace; she states, “when they return in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese arrive and this hibiscus is budding, then I will retake that examination.” Since the author previously failed the test, as recounted, she will derive comfort from attempting it again upon the hibiscus's resurgence following the winter season.
322	9185	4	1	The author concludes the narrative by declaring that upon the geese's return in the spring, she will endeavor to pass the examination. This illustrates the adage that persistence is essential following initial failure. Furthermore, the author employs this conclusion to demonstrate that Saeng has resided in the location for several years yet continues to yearn for her native Vietnam.
323	9186	4	1	She anticipates passing the examination in the spring because everything revives; flowers reemerge, trees regain their verdancy, and geese return. Animals reawaken, and people seek diversion at the beach, an activity she herself may wish to pursue as a form of respite.
324	9187	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with this quotation to signify her renewed optimism. She was profoundly disheartened by failing the driving examination, and the sight of the hibiscus intensified her emotions, evoking homesickness. However, upon seeing the geese after planting the flower, she resolves to reattempt the test the following spring.
325	9188	4	1	The author concludes with, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to illustrate Saeng's maturation. As another year elapses, Saeng will grow more acclimated to her situation, prepared to commence anew, analogous to the plants blooming. Failing her driving test greatly distressed Saeng; by waiting a year, she can practice extensively, improving her skills to become a more proficient driver upon retesting. This period represents a fresh start for Saeng; as her familiar plant buds and rejuvenates, so will she. The hibiscus, being familiar, allows her to identify with its cycle, and as it begins anew, Saeng will similarly embark on her own renewal.
326	9189	4	1	The author likely incorporates this paragraph because its thematic resonance is significant: the geese's return following the snowmelt coincides with Saeng's resolve to retake her examination, symbolizing a period of renewal.
327	9190	4	1	In Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with Saeng’s declaration, “When they come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to illustrate her nascent readiness to adapt, albeit while requiring additional time. Throughout the narrative, Saeng grapples with the challenge of relocating from her homeland to an unfamiliar environment hundreds of miles distant. Nevertheless, she remains unprepared to relinquish her past. Consequently, she attempts to cling to former memories, only to discover that in @LOCATION1, everything is altered. Upon purchasing a plant reminiscent of her home, she realizes that even it is different in @LOCATION1, provoking frustration that it diverges from her expectations. However, she ultimately recognizes that difference is not inherently negative and pledges to endeavor accepting this new culture, yet acknowledges that complete assimilation will necessitate a considerable duration.
328	9191	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this particular paragraph to signify the protagonist's intent to retry upon spring's arrival. While reading the story, one encounters the moment her mother inquires, “What happened,” to which Saeng replies, “I- I failed the test.” This interaction suggests her mother will likely provide further academic assistance and gardening guidance. As the snow melts, Saeng has vowed to apply greater effort and ultimately pass the examination, demonstrating her determined resolve.
329	9192	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph because it denotes the moment she will retake the examination. Furthermore, the geese prompted her realization that numerous elements she initially perceived as strange had become familiar, much like the geese themselves. This transformation occurred through the quiet, cyclical repetition of the seasons, fostering gradual acceptance.
330	9193	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph because it signifies a new beginning. The return of the geese and the budding hibiscus represent a symbolic renewal, allowing her to attempt anew her reconciliation of memories from home with her adaptation to a new country. This conclusion suggests she will manage this process more effectively and retake the test, thereby illustrating her persistent and resolute character.
331	9194	4	1	She attributed her statement to her failure to sustain the tropical plant, a circumstance that left her profoundly disappointed in herself. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. This resolution emerged following her failure and her mother's reassurance that it would be acceptable to attempt it once more.
332	9195	4	1	I contend that the author concludes with this paragraph to convey to the reader and herself the notion that she will once again labor in the garden to ascertain if it captures her interest. This expression is justified because the story's commencement depicts the author exhibiting no interest in the garden or her surrounding environment. For instance, when instructed to purchase seeds, she instead appropriated a portion of her mother’s money to acquire a Big Mac. Consequently, this analysis elucidates the author's sentiments and the rationale behind the story's particular conclusion.
333	9196	4	1	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s silent vow, “when they come back… then I will take that test again,” because her previous failure has been supplanted by a determined resolve to succeed. Her perspective was fundamentally transformed by the profound lesson her mother imparted that day, which entirely altered her attitude toward life and its challenges.
334	9197	4	1	The author likely concluded the story with that sentence to demonstrate her continued concern for the test, rather than for a seemingly insignificant plant destined to perish. Furthermore, she must pass the examination, and the author implies that the protagonist will ultimately succeed, thereby avoiding a retake. This also serves to communicate that life’s priorities do not revolve around other costly distractions, but that scholastic achievement is fundamentally paramount.
335	9198	4	1	"The author, Minfong Ho, concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the final paragraph because the protagonist, Saeng, failed a driving test and returned with a saebba hedge, a cultivated plant cherished by her family. As newcomers to the United States from Vietnam, this failure carried significant weight. Her mother questioned the expenditure on the plant instead of a ""Big Mac,"" their favored sandwich. Saeng purchased the plant despite failing her parents, yet she vows to retake the test when the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, believing she will then pass. This success would alleviate her shame and honor her family, for whom driving represents a considerable achievement they lacked in Vietnam."
336	9199	4	1	It is evident that Saeng is contending with profound homesickness following her recent relocation from Vietnam. However, she will gradually learn to reconcile her affection for both her new nation and her homeland. Throughout the narrative, Saeng evidently yearns for memories of her past life while simultaneously discovering novel aspects of her new environment to appreciate. For instance, although she is deeply moved by the nostalgia evoked by the hibiscus, she is equally captivated by new experiences, such as consuming Big @CAPS1 and forging new friendships. While homesickness has precipitated her struggle, she understands that, in time, she will surmount the challenge of relinquishing the old ways for the new without entirely eradicating either. She is confident that by spring she will overcome this obstacle and possess the fortitude to confront any future challenges that may arise.
337	9200	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's vow to convey a profound sense of her transformation. The winter season is brutally harsh, as Saeng’s mother observed, yet spring signifies a period of renewal and vitality. This seasonal metaphor reflects Saeng’s internal state. Just as one may be buffeted by the relentless winter winds, the advent of spring will inspire her to retake her test, rejuvenate her spirit, and find pleasure in the @LOCATION1 despite the distance from her native rains. The author's decision to conclude with this vow was indeed a fitting and resonant choice.
338	9201	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the theme that those who depart from their homeland often feel a compelling pull to return. The hibiscus serves as a potent reminder of her home, which is where her deepest desires reside. Having failed her driver's examination, Saeng resolves to attempt it again upon the geese's return. While the plant evokes memories of home, she notes, ""It's not like the ones we had before,"" suggesting a perceived superiority of the Vietnamese flora and underscoring her longing to go back due to profound nostalgia."
339	9202	4	1	"Saeng reflects upon the cyclical return of flowers in the spring. She vows to retake the examination once the snow has melted and is determined to succeed. ""The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green from the chicory weeds."" Consequently, she eagerly anticipates the return of spring, which will allow her to attempt planting once again and embrace the new season's potential."
340	9203	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate that when circumstances revert to their former state, she will recommence her efforts. However, things are not identical to how they once were, and she aspires for them to evolve, indicating her acceptance of change and hope for a renewed beginning in her altered environment.
341	9204	4	1	The protagonist, Saeng, exhibits a profound affinity for nature and welcomes the arrival of spring, which signifies a new, natural inception and motivates her to retake the examination she previously failed. The author likely concludes with this paragraph to convey that hope exists for Saeng, compelling her to undertake the necessary actions to achieve comfort within her new homeland. The narrative extensively details her persistent dissatisfaction with her new environment, yet this is juxtaposed with the prospect of new opportunities and a fresh beginning, a theme symbolized through the imagery of springtime.
342	9205	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to suggest her eventual acclimatization to her new home. This perspective is informed by a personal parallel; following a relocation, initial discontent stemming from a lack of companionship gradually subsided over a year or two as social circles expanded. Saeng's experience is analogous, as she frequently reminisces about her former home, a sentiment that evokes distress, exemplified when encountering a plant reminiscent of her past life, which prompted an emotional reaction. In conclusion, this rationale explains the author's deliberate placement of the paragraph at the story's denouement.
343	9206	4	1	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author incorporates a significant resolution from Saeng at the conclusion. The rationale for her declaration is that with the renewal of all aspects of her life, she will rediscover her affection for living and become a considerably more contented individual."
344	9207	4	1	The author includes this element because it demonstrates the necessary course of action following her failure, illustrating what she must undertake to derive sustenance from the geese.
345	9208	4	1	"The author likely chose to conclude with that paragraph because it symbolizes new beginnings and starting afresh. After failing her driving test, Saeng experiences a moment of vulnerability and loneliness; subsequently, she encounters a plant evoking memories of her home in Vietnam. In a sense, the plant provides her solace. ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to survive the cold months here."" In this statement, Saeng's mother indicates that the flower, while out of place, has discovered the resilience and determination to flourish. In the final paragraph, Saeng resolves that, akin to the flower and the birds, she can also summon the courage to confront her fears and decides to retake the examinations."
346	9209	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate her own resilience and to convey that same determination to her mother."
347	9210	4	1	I contend the author was conveying the theme of a new beginning. This interpretation is supported by the motif of cyclical renewal and by Saeng's newfound comprehension of her priorities, which she will now pursue with earnest commitment. Such is the thematic conclusion the author intended to impart.
348	9211	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, a young girl and her mother relocate to a new country, where the daughter, Saeng, struggles to adapt. Saeng discovers a plant, the *dok faeng-noi*, which evokes memories of her homeland. She purchases it and presents it to her mother, who is initially dismayed at the cost. However, upon perceiving her daughter's profound disappointment in herself, she finds solace in the plant's beauty. While her mother prepares dinner, Saeng plants it, resolving that when the geese return, the hibiscus buds, and spring arrives, she will retake the test. She discovered an internal fortitude and the courage to improve, which the author illustrates as her achieving self-respect by the passage's conclusion."
349	9212	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it encapsulates the story's central theme. It concerns how Saeng's longing for home, triggered by purchasing the hibiscus, contributed to her failing the test. By indulging in the flower and its associated memories, she succumbed to melancholy. In the final paragraph, she resolves that upon the geese's return in spring, she will be acclimated to her new country and will not fail again. If tempted by a memento from home, she will resist, recognizing its potential to induce sorrow. The author thus concludes with this paragraph to underscore the core idea of her gradual adaptation.
350	9213	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with that paragraph to synthesize the narrative's central themes. The author also employs this conclusion to sustain the reader's contemplative engagement with the text."
351	9214	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng’s silent vow, “when they come back… then I will take that test again,” to illustrate that despite her failure, she remains resolute and will persevere. This denouement underscores Saeng’s profound determination. She possesses sufficient fortitude to persist despite failing her examination and disappointing her grandmother, continuing her efforts to achieve success for both their sakes. This conclusion is profoundly effective, and the author’s choice to employ it enhances the story’s thematic resonance.
352	9215	4	1	Saeng was deeply distressed by failing her driver’s test. Compounding this setback, her relocation to a new country and her grandmother’s passing exacerbated her difficulties. The hibiscus plant functions as a potent symbol within the narrative. It signifies her existence and evokes memories of Vietnam. The flood of recollections triggered by the blossoms reflects her emotional state, representing new beginnings and overcoming adversity. Her statement, “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” signifies her personal renewal and triumph over hardship, symbolized by winter, marking a symbol of her resilience and the challenges she will surmount.
353	9216	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in the final paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng perseveres through her hardships, striving to establish a normal life after her displacement. For instance, her silent vow, “in the spring I will take the test again,” exemplifies the notion that one should never capitulate after a single failure, yet also should not disregard the past. This resolution powerfully conveys a message of enduring resilience while acknowledging one's history.
354	9217	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus,” Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a profoundly meaningful paragraph. The line, “When they come back…in the spring… then I will take that test again,” signifies Saeng’s commitment to progress and her capacity to overcome failure. The season of spring symbolically represents a new beginning, just as the budding flower initiates a fresh life cycle, paralleling Saeng’s decision to start anew. Ultimately, this illustrates her adaptation to a new life through acquiring a familiar plant; the hibiscus provided solace during disappointment, while the geese offered a reminder of continuity, emphasizing Saeng’s successful adaptation.
355	9218	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph to convey Saeng’s resolve to retake the test and persevere. She intends to emulate the flowers, which require time to bloom; similarly, she will attempt again when they bud, symbolizing her own delayed but inevitable renewal.
356	9219	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the story culminates with Saeng resolving to retake the examination during the spring. The author likely concludes in this manner to illustrate Saeng's progression beyond her sorrow, coinciding with the hibiscus blooming in its new environment. This evolution is demonstrated when Saeng acknowledges, ""I-I failed the test,"" an admission that underscores the pain of her displacement from her native land. However, she subsequently pledges to herself, ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This declaration signifies her transcendence over grief, her newfound determination, and her forward-looking resolve to attempt the examination once more."
357	9220	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow: ""when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again."" This serves to demonstrate Saeng's gradual adaptation to change while retaining a connection to her origins. This is conveyed through the combined symbolism of the geese and the hibiscus. The geese signify the unfamiliar environment and sounds to which Saeng must acclimatize, whereas the hibiscus embodies memories of her former life and homeland. Uniting these symbols indicates her acceptance of both locales. By vowing to retake the test in spring, she reveals her readiness for transformation, as the test represents her sentiments toward her new situation; succeeding on it would permit her to reconcile with her circumstances and adapt to the changes in her life."
358	9221	4	1	The author employs this sentence to signify her desire to witness the flower bud, an experience that evokes a sense of being home once more, after which she will undertake the test. She will consequently feel fortunate and possess a comforting memory of her homeland, which is why Saeng vowed silently to herself, thereby fortifying her resolve for the forthcoming challenge and providing the emotional sustenance required to persevere.
359	9222	4	1	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's resolution: ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The narrative delineates the numerous hardships and obstacles Saeng has endured, with the two primary difficulties being relocation to a new country and failing her driver's examination. Saeng struggled to surmount these events among others. Consequently, this sentence was positioned at the conclusion to allow readers to perceive that she would ultimately be alright and overcome her tribulations. We now understand that this particular plant will assist Saeng with future difficulties, symbolizing resilience and the promise of renewal."
360	9223	4	1	"After reading the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I contend the concluding quote was included purposefully. I believe this quote, wherein Saeng vows to retake the test upon the return of spring and the budding hibiscus, provides a tone and sentiment of hope. For instance, the story notes that ""Saeng dug a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it,"" indicating the plant's profound significance to her. The narrative explains that it evokes memories of her grandmother, representing hope for Saeng because it perpetually recalls former happiness, thereby motivating her to overcome her profound sense of loss. Therefore, the quote concludes the story by affirming Saeng's will for hope and peace, symbolizing that the plant's spring bloom will herald a newly discovered sense of hope and contentment for her future."
361	9224	4	1	"""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho chronicles a transition to a new nation and the protagonist's capacity for resilience. Having failed her driving examination, Saeng returned home disheartened. She paused at a florist, observing a plant reminiscent of one from her native land. This rediscovery evoked potent memories of her homeland. Upon arriving home, she planted it and resolved to retake the driving test when the geese return. The plant thus functions as a personal encouragement."
362	9225	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to underscore the narrative's focus on Saeng's acclimation to nature's cyclical patterns. The final segment conveys her intention to replicate her actions with each recurring cycle, thereby justifying the author's decision to terminate the story with this reflective observation.
363	9226	4	1	I believe the author includes that detail because she may have failed and required additional time to study in order to achieve her objectives, which is the primary reason aside from the challenging new circumstances.
364	9227	4	1	The author employs this sentence to conclude the narrative, illustrating the restoration of Saeng's hope. Throughout the story, Saeng experiences sorrow and nostalgia for her homeland, feeling hopeless in unfamiliar territory. The hibiscus triggers memories of her grandmother and her former life, intensifying her longing. The geese's departure is included to parallel their obligatory leave from home. The hibiscus thus symbolizes her fortitude and ultimate success in adapting to a foreign land.
365	9228	4	1	I believe the author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's perseverance and continued effort. Throughout the narrative, memories of her native country fortified her resilience. For instance, the flower initially evoked sadness but ultimately proved strengthening. Furthermore, while she initially resisted new changes and longed for home, she ultimately discovered familiar memories within her new environment. These are the reasons I posit for the author's concluding choice.
366	9229	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with that paragraph to illustrate that if the hibiscus possesses sufficient resilience to regenerate and flourish, then Saeng equally possesses the fortitude to retake the examination. For instance, the text states, ""but it is strong enough to endure the cold months."" This quotation demonstrates the plant's inherent strength. Saeng perceives this as a parallel; if the plant can resurge after a harsh winter, she too can return to the test following her failure. Ultimately, both Saeng and the hibiscus exhibit profound resilience."
367	9230	4	1	"This story delineates the parallels between Saeng and the hibiscus plant concerning their adaptation to surroundings, illustrating how both will persist, akin to Saeng's perseverance with her ""test."" This is evident from her declaration, ""Then I will take that test again,"" which signifies her resolve to thrive once more, mirroring the hibiscus. In conclusion, she is profoundly analogous to the plant, destined to endure for many forthcoming seasons and adapt to transformations, just as the hibiscus does."
368	9231	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with the final paragraph because the arrival of spring and the return of the geese will improve her self-perception, thereby enabling her to retake the examination with renewed focus and determination. This seasonal renewal instills the confidence necessary for her to persevere.
369	9232	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with that paragraph because it corresponds with the narrative's themes. Saeng sought the plant that evoked memories of her grandmother. Upon finding it, she was reminded of her grandmother and wept. This suggests she was testing her ability to progress in life, yet she faltered. Consequently, she purchased the plant to attempt anew when it blossoms, symbolizing her own potential for renewal."
370	9233	4	1	He aspires to learn the resilience of the hibiscus. One must not fear failure. By persevering and continuously pursuing one's goals, success is attainable. The hibiscus possesses a tenacious vitality, combating its environment. Thus, the author employs this paragraph to conclude, illustrating that Saeng will retake her test, just as the hibiscus will bud with the arrival of spring.
371	9234	4	1	Upon their return in the spring, as the hibiscus buds, Saeng silently vowed to retake the examination. The author likely concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify Saeng's renewed determination and resilience, framing the test as a symbolic act of perseverance.
372	9235	4	1	The author structured the conclusion to mirror the story's commencement, as the young girl was initially observing the flora. This cyclical return underscores how Saeng's affinity with the plants, which will re-emerge in the vibrant spring, provides profound solace during her tribulations, thereby justifying the botanical conclusion.
373	9236	4	1	In Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with a significant paragraph intended to convey a message to Saeng. Observing the geese fading into the distance prompted Saeng to reflect upon her own situation. Their eventual return, coinciding with the budding hibiscus, symbolizes Saeng's own return to school and personal renewal. The budding flower signifies her continued development, and her decision to retake the test represents a new beginning, leveraging spring’s archetypal association with rebirth and new life.
374	9237	4	1	Saeng resolved that she would retake the test when the hibiscus commenced its budding cycle, as the plant symbolizes hope and the potential for success upon a second attempt. The author concludes with this vow to express her final reservoir of hope; the hibiscus has consoled her within a foreign nation and unfamiliar environs, mirroring her internal state. Her pledge demonstrates her refusal to capitulate despite an initial failure, a sentiment powerfully captured in the intense, visceral shock of recognition she felt upon seeing the plant.
375	9238	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s resolve. Her family relinquished much in Vietnam, including memories of her grandmother and the hibiscus. In their new location, they face hardship, implied by her mother’s reaction to expenses. The purchased hibiscus serves as a source of comfort; Saeng reasons that if the plant can endure the severe winter, she too can persevere despite the unfamiliar challenges, and passing the driver’s examination represents a common step toward acclimatization.
376	9239	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this sentence to illustrate the girl's resolve to surmount challenges; although she may have previously failed, she will persist in her efforts. It further establishes a symbolic connection between the geese, the hibiscus, and the girl's aspiration to overcome her personal obstacles, which she intends to confront at a specific, significant time.
377	9240	4	1	In the final paragraph, when she declared her intention to retake the examination in the spring, she selected that season due to its association with melting snow and budding hibiscus flowers. This period is her favorite, a time when she consequently feels most self-assured. Her reference to the Madagascar hibiscus, which grows through bricks, demonstrates her affinity for the flower; thus, she desires to undertake the test when her confidence is at its peak.
378	9241	4	1	I believe the author concluded the narrative with that paragraph to convey to readers that Saeng possesses a resilient spirit, analogous to the hibiscus plant. Having not fully acclimated to America, she finds that this particular flora serves as a poignant reminder of her homeland and her own capacity for endurance.
379	9242	4	1	The author concludes with this passage because spring symbolizes a new beginning. Since Saeng failed her test, she desires to recommence in the spring, just as the flowers regenerate. The knowledge that the currently dying hibiscus will grow back is crucial; spring's arrival represents a time for renewal, where life is born, flowers bloom, and a fresh start is initiated.
380	9243	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to demonstrate that Saeng is a profoundly determined individual who, regardless of failures, will persistently endeavor until she succeeds. This illustrates Saeng's conviction that any challenge, however formidable, can be overcome through perseverance. Her relocation was immensely difficult, presenting struggles with communication and forging friendships, as adapting to a new environment is inherently challenging. This experience compelled her to reassess her surroundings, which appeared alien to her. However, with time, she acclimated, proving that sustained effort ultimately leads to success, which is the fundamental message the author conveys through the conclusion.
381	9244	4	1	"In the narrative, a young woman named Saeng fails an examination but resolves to retake it the following spring; consequently, the final paragraph states: ""when they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently, ""in the spring when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus buds, then I will take the test again."" The author concludes with this resolution. The story references hibiscus blossoms, so instead of explicitly stating she will retry in spring, it employs the imagery of the hibiscus budding, which coincides with that season."
382	9245	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to convey the daughter Saeng's resolve to return and retake the examination; her affection for the garden ensures she will remember spring's significance to her.
383	9246	4	1	This illustrates her profound affinity for botany. The narrative meticulously describes the various plants and her appreciation for them, characterizing each as distinctive and indicating that she derives greater satisfaction from them than from academic pursuits or other interests.
384	9247	4	1	"Minfong Ho concludes ""The Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination to succeed in her new country despite formidable obstacles. The winter hibiscus symbolizes the resilience Saeng must embody to endure hardship, analogous to the plant surviving winter, or in Saeng's case, to pass her driving test. The text asserts, ""....but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus....""(Ho @NUM1). Saeng comprehends that she must also be ""strong"" like the ""winter hibiscus."" She further realizes she is acclimating to the new country, as expressed: ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become almost familiar...""(Ho @NUM1). Saeng recognizes her capacity to adapt and is resolute in her pursuit of success. The author's conclusion, ""..in the spring, the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho @NUM1), signifies that the ""spring"" will ultimately belong to Saeng."
385	9248	4	1	"In the story @ORGANIZATION1 by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with the final paragraph to signify that as the flower revives and commences a new cycle, Saeng will similarly embark on a new beginning by retaking the test. For instance, ""Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,"" illustrates the plant's near demise when purchased. Another example, ""I-I failed the test,"" reveals her despondency over this failure. Thus, in @CAPS1, both the flower and Saeng were at their breaking points. The paragraph conveys that @CAPS2 intended to pause and await the flower's, and her own, renewed strength before attempting the examination again."
386	9249	4	1	The author incorporates the final paragraph because Saeng’s vow enables the reader to comprehend her anguish, yet also her optimism for future improvement. The vow is interpreted as a conviction that circumstances will significantly ameliorate for her in this unfamiliar nation once life regains normalcy. Spring symbolizes this normalcy, as her native land, which she associates with normality, is adorned with resplendent blossoms reminiscent of spring. The melting snow signifies the dissipation of her pain, while the returning geese represent Saeng’s certainty that conditions will improve, just as she is assured of their seasonal return. The hibiscus has consistently symbolized her homeland and grandmother, emblems of felicity; thus, she will experience greater happiness as her situation ameliorates.
387	9250	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this sentence because the protagonist Saeng aspired to retake the examination, yet simultaneously desired for her hibiscus to remain resilient and continue flourishing. Consequently, she resolved that she would undertake the test again once her hibiscus commenced blooming anew.
388	9251	4	1	"""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho explores an individual's quest for acceptance and adaptation to life's transformations. Saeng, the youthful protagonist, grapples with her recent relocation to America from her Asian homeland. After failing an examination, Saeng expends a considerable sum on a floral specimen. Upon consulting her mother, she silently articulates a personal vow: ""when they return in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese reappear and this hibiscus begins budding, then I will retake that examination."" Minfong Ho elected to conclude the narrative thusly because it epitomizes the pursuit of adaptation. Independently, Saeng formulated a vow demonstrating her acceptance of her new, foreign American home, despite perpetually cherishing the memory of her native land."
389	9252	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph because the protagonist develops an affinity for the plant and utilizes it as a temporal indicator for when she may retake the examination. If one is not a U.S. citizen, the driver's test can only be attempted once annually.
390	9253	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination to pursue a positive objective for her own benefit. This interpretation is substantiated by the final paragraph's declaration, ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" which signifies her commitment to securing what is most advantageous for her personal advancement."
391	9254	4	1	"Saeng believes that her failure on the driving test signifies an inability to transition to a new country, prompting her to seek solace in her past. She discovers this past within plants, recollecting Vietnam with profound sorrow. The narration describes ""a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes,"" illustrating her profound longing for her former life, her grandmother, and her homeland. Returning home with a plant, she disappoints her mother with its cost, yet her mother comprehends the underlying pain, stating sadly, ""it's a beautiful plant you got."" Ultimately, Saeng recognizes the plant's effect on her and its resilient survival, vowing to herself that when the hibiscus buds, she will take the test again."
392	9255	4	1	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the driving test in the spring, as the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This emphasizes that if the hibiscus, a botanical reminder of her home, can endure and flourish, then she possesses a similar capacity for resilience. After failing her driving test, the protagonist, walking home, encounters flowers that evoke memories of her homeland, connecting her to her past and mitigating her isolation. For instance, the narration states, ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes,"" demonstrating how the flora facilitated a profound connection to her memories. Similarly, the geese formation, ""the distinctive V against the sky,"" symbolizes migration and adaptation, suggesting that if they can transition to a new beginning, she too can gradually adapt. The ending ultimately accentuates her complex sentiments toward both her native home and her new environment."
393	9256	4	1	The author concludes the narrative by drawing a parallel to the processes of adaptation, transformation, and recommencement. For instance, geese depart with the cold yet consistently return, granting their home another opportunity. The hibiscus serves as another prime example; it consistently blossoms in spring but does not perish in winter, instead perpetually returning. Saeng has evidently discerned this cyclical pattern and consequently vowed to attempt her driving examination again, anticipating a potentially successful outcome. The author's intended message disseminates the imperative to persevere and never capitulate in the face of adversity.
394	9257	4	1	Determination, assistance, and fortitude are all reasons I believe the author selected this concluding paragraph. Firstly, determination constitutes a primary reason Saeng will retake the examination. Having failed her initial driving test, she resolves to wait and attempt it again, demonstrating a determined commitment to adopting new strategies for success. Secondly, I contend that assistance is a significant factor for this conclusion; Saeng will require support to pass the test, and she believes the hibiscus plant will provide the necessary help for this and other endeavors, proving her readiness to return. Finally, strength is the ultimate reason the author chose this paragraph; Saeng is convinced the plant will grant her the fortitude to succeed. The author concludes with this passage to illustrate that she will return, stronger than she was previously. These are the rationales for my interpretation of the story's conclusion.
395	9258	4	1	"Mingfong Ho concludes ""The Winter Hibiscus"" with the paragraph wherein Saeng silently vows to herself that in the spring, as the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she will take the test again. This final passage demonstrates Saeng's refusal to relinquish her struggle to adapt to her new environment. She has endured considerable hardship, including relocating to the United States and failing her driver's examination, even breaking down in tears within the greenhouse. Although the hibiscus Saeng purchased represented a significant financial expenditure for her family, to her it was immensely important, symbolizing hope. Its subsequent budding would signal the opportune moment to retake her test. Furthermore, the flower embodies the theme of adaptation; just as Saeng must acclimatize to the United States, the hibiscus must adapt to its new garden."
396	9259	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's transformation. Initially, Saeng lacked the confidence to undertake the examination. Throughout the story, her mother provides unconditional support, demonstrating profound understanding when Saeng purchases a plant for @MONEY1 due to its nostalgic resonance. Having received solace, Saeng now feels more composed and is consequently prepared and self-assured to attempt the test once more, signifying her personal evolution.
397	9260	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow: ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion serves to underscore the necessity of maintaining faith. Saeng's persistent homesickness likely impaired her performance on the driving examination. By waiting a season, her melancholy would presumably dissipate, enabling her to concentrate on achieving her objective. The profound impact of missing her grandmother and Vietnam undoubtedly contributed to her initial failure. Furthermore, the author likely intended to ameliorate the somber mood; the melancholy of Saeng's breakdown in the greenhouse is counterbalanced by her resolution to retake the test, which elevates the reader's hopes for her future."
398	9261	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to convey that Saeng's inability to concentrate on the examination stemmed from a profound yearning to return to her homeland.
399	9262	4	1	The author likely concluded with this passage to convey Saeng's anticipated return and renewed assistance. Evidently, Saeng possesses an affinity for horticulture. She will probably assist her mother with considerably more tasks, now that she comprehends the potential outcomes of such cooperation.
400	9263	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's reflective thoughts. Her resolution to retry the test upon the hibiscus's budding effectively unifies the narrative. The plot primarily involves her search for a flower and the memories it evokes, a quest that would not have occurred had she passed her examination. This creates a comprehensive connection between the test and the hibiscus, highlighting the flower's symbolic importance. Both Saeng and the flower must adapt to survive within unfamiliar environments; Saeng is from Vietnam and the flower from a shop, both displaced from their origins. In this regard, Saeng metaphorically becomes the flower, requiring adaptation to her new home for survival, just as the flower must endure the harsh cold. When she observes the flower surviving the winter, she will recognize her own capacity to endure living in @LOCATION2, thereby instilling within her a sense of strength and focus."
401	9264	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph constitutes a vow by the protagonist, Saeng, to retake her driver's test upon spring's arrival and her hibiscus's budding. The author selects this conclusion to imbue the melancholic narrative with a sense of hope, suggesting Saeng will ultimately persevere and transcend her profound longing for her native land. Within the warm, moist sanctuary of the greenhouse, Saeng succumbed to tears, overwhelmed by sorrow and misery. The floral surroundings evoked potent memories of her homeland, plunging her into a state of depression and acute homesickness. Upon returning home, she planted a hibiscus in the frozen earth, a plant whose spring blossoming would symbolize a renewed existence and a subsequent opportunity, signifying Saeng's resilient refusal to surrender. Minfong Ho thus concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" on an affirmative note with this final paragraph."
402	9265	4	1	The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow—to retake the test in the spring as the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds—to cultivate narrative suspense. This resolution signifies that Saeng has internalized a lesson regarding patience and natural cycles, implying she will postpone the test until the appropriate season rather than acting impulsively. This strategic choice for the story's denouement effectively communicates her character's development and newfound understanding.
403	9266	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this specific paragraph to provide the story with a resonant and optimistic resolution. This deliberate structural choice imparts a sense of closure and forward-looking positivity, leaving the reader with a definitive and uplifting impression as the final words are absorbed, thereby completing the literary experience on a hopeful and satisfying note.
404	9267	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to evoke a reader perception of impending accomplishment, symbolized by the hibiscus and the geese. For instance, the hibiscus represents achievement through its association with cherished memories of her grandmother, with whom she shared time and activities, and who would adorn her hair with the flower. Similarly, the geese signify accomplishment as she observes them migrating south to survive the winter in a warmer climate, mirroring a journey toward survival and success.
405	9268	4	1	The rationale for concluding with this paragraph is to delineate the story's final resolution. The author's intention is to provide the audience with a clear understanding of the narrative's outcome and the protagonist's ultimate trajectory, thereby offering definitive closure and ensuring comprehension of the concluding events that shape the story's end.
406	9269	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to culminate the story on an optimistic note. Saeng's primary conflict is her ""wave of loss"" that overwhelms her during recollections of her homeland. The entire account concerns Saeng's melancholic struggle to discover fulfillment within her new, unfamiliar, and seemingly inhospitable country. This sentiment of loss and isolation is intensified by the examination she subsequently failed. Following a chronicle of such despondency, the author demonstrates Saeng's newfound confidence and optimism by concluding the narrative with this paragraph."
407	9270	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey to the reader her resolute determination to persevere and her commitment to retaking the examination in order to succeed.
408	9271	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify her adaptation to her new environment. Furthermore, it provides a conclusion by revealing the protagonist's final reflections. This serves as the ultimate sentiment, illustrating the author's purpose for concluding the narrative with the declaration, ""when they return, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""
409	9272	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to gauge the potential reaction and interpretation from the readership.
410	9273	4	1	This statement signifies that snow has descended upon their garden, and once it melts, they must replant everything anew. This serves as an ideal conclusion for the narrative. The story discusses floral growth in the spring and Saeng's mother cultivating produce in her garden. Since it has snowed, a period will elapse before spring returns. Saeng possesses considerable planning to undertake for the forthcoming spring, when the hibiscus will bud and the geese will return.
411	9274	4	1	The author concludes that paragraph with the narrative because Saeng asserts that upon her return or when she next observes the hibiscus blooming, she will subsequently undertake the examination. Until that time, however, she feels profoundly displaced and extraneous to her current domestic arrangements, experiencing considerable discomfort. She believes she will be incapable of successful action until she is within her element, a harmonious environment suited to her nature.
412	9275	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph to demonstrate that she will return to a singular place and will not succumb to emotional collapse, thereby ceasing to grieve over her losses and confronting the necessity of adapting to change.
413	9276	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because, analogous to plants perishing in snow and regenerating only after its thaw, the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding signify a future moment when she will witness her garden's spring renewal. Consequently, the author employs this concluding paragraph since Saeng possesses a profound affinity for gardening, a passion that has intensified since her relocation to the United States. Following their move, the family has achieved unprecedented contentment, finding profound joy in their shared moments during dinner and collaborative planting, which constituted the most fulfilling period of their lives.
414	9277	4	1	For anyone who has relocated from their homeland, the profound comfort derived from an object connecting the old country to the new is deeply understood. The presence of the geese and flora sufficiently consoled Saeng, assuring her that she could attempt the test the following spring. Throughout the narrative, every element reminiscent of her native Vietnam appeared to provide her with warmth and solace. Early passages illustrate her sentiments as she traverses the greenhouse, and frequently one could discern the palpable affection in her voice as she identified plants by their native names. A pervasive sense of her devotion and care is evident. The author, recognizing how these elements inspire her, consequently chose to conclude the story in this manner.
415	9278	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph due to the symbolic potential of the hibiscus. Saeng will therefore retake the examination despite her prior failure. She embodies the characteristics of the hibiscus, which appears misplaced yet is determined to endure once the snow recedes. Thus, she will undertake the test again, utilizing the hibiscus as her fundamental inspiration.
416	9279	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with the paragraph depicting Saeng’s silent vow to retake the examination in the spring, intending to highlight the maternal and filial bond forged through horticulture. Among the various elements the author presents concerning Saeng and her mother, he illustrates a method of their connection, which I found to be a rather elegant narrative construction. The story proved compelling, sustaining suspense and speculation until the concluding segment, yet I found it an enjoyable read. I also appreciated the profound friendship between daughter and mother, a refreshing dynamic to witness. Furthermore, the author reveals aspects of his own perspective through this portrayal, demonstrating considerable intellect and a refined mode of thought. He relates an excellent account of a girl and her mother, which resonated positively. This narrative chronicles a gardening story of a daughter and her mother emigrating from Vietnam to @ORGANIZATION1 to establish their future existence.
417	9280	4	1	Numerous motivations could underlie the author's decision to conclude the narrative with that specific paragraph. Perhaps Saeng desires to pass the examination presently to gratify her mother. Alternatively, she might require the ability to drive in the forthcoming year for practical reasons. Another possibility is the financial burden of repeated testing. Nevertheless, she evidently possesses a profound appreciation for her hibiscus.
418	9281	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate Saeng's resolute character. The return of the geese symbolizes her decision to retake the test, correlating with her initial failure upon their departure. The melting snow and budding hibiscus signify spring, a season traditionally representing renewal and new beginnings. This final paragraph functions as an emblem of a fresh start. Saeng's distress over failing was evident in her stammered admission, ""I—I failed the test,"" indicating her emotional state. Allowing a period of time before attempting the test again is therefore prudent. The author ended the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's fortitude and her impending commencement of a renewed life."
419	9282	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng discovered a sense of solace through the flower. It also demonstrates her resilience and determination to persevere. Initially, she was disheartened and distressed, but upon encountering the flower, a reminder of her homeland, her spirits lifted and her disappointment over the test diminished. The flower profoundly affected her, evoking memories of home and her grandmother, which induced melancholy; however, the flower's significant meaning ultimately provided her with comfort. I feel the author concludes the story on an affirmative and optimistic note.
420	9283	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to leave the reader with a sense of hope. Saeng intends to retake the examination she previously failed. Struggling to adapt to her new environment, by waiting for the snow to melt, the geese to return, and the hibiscus to bud, Saeng allows herself time for adjustment and emotional recovery. The paragraph effectively conveys Saeng's courage and hopeful anticipation regarding her second attempt.
421	9284	4	1	Truthfully, I am not entirely certain. Perhaps because she now feels secure. Conceivably it is a psychological trial we all must confront. Perhaps the geese returning and the plant budding constitute a metaphorical test as well.
422	9285	4	1	The author selects this concluding paragraph to convey the theme of acceptance and resolve. Saeng feels a profound attachment to the hibiscus, as it symbolizes her homeland and everything she relinquished. This final line signifies multiple concepts. The melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus all denote a period of renewal and genesis. Saeng's desire to retake her examination demonstrates how obstacles may be surmounted and aspirations ultimately realized.
423	9286	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner because it aligns with the protagonist's perspective. She possesses a deep affinity for flowers, plants, and animals, favoring the Madagascar periwinkle. The environment from her former residence was abundant with diverse plants, animals, and flowers.
424	9287	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph that conveys profound sentiment. The passage illustrates the protagonist Saeng's determination to pass her examination, evidenced by the text: ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This demonstrates her resolve not to be deterred by an initial failure. The girl also articulates her emotional connection to the geese and the plant, as the textual reference to their return in spring alongside the melting snow and budding hibiscus indicates she does not regret her purchase."
425	9288	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" in this manner to establish a sense of hope that Saeng feels for her future. Saeng experienced profound dejection while returning home after failing her driver's test. The author depicts this moment with, ""The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds,"" where the winter and cold symbolize Saeng's diminishing hope. Upon presenting the hibiscus to her mother, who remarks it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here,"" it becomes symbolic of Saeng's own resilience. Ultimately, observing the geese, Saeng realizes ""many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar,"" confirming her adjustment to her new home and her hopeful anticipation for the spring's return with geese and blooming hibiscus."
426	9289	4	1	Her principal objective in hunting was to capture them, constituting her entire ambition. She endeavored to capture geese, having observed her grandparents attempt the same pursuit. Consequently, this rationale underpinned her ultimate declaration.
427	9290	4	1	"The author concluded the narrative with this paragraph to convey her unwavering resolve and refusal to relinquish her efforts. For instance, the story depicts Saeng declaring, ""I-I failed the test,"" conveying her sense of unfulfilled aspiration. Therefore, her final statement, ""I will take that test again,"" exemplifies her character and demonstrates that she will not capitulate after an initial setback."
428	9291	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with this paragraph because spring symbolizes rebirth, a period when Saeng will have acclimated to her environment. One illustration is the author's assertion that ""she realized that many of the things she had previously considered strange had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This signifies her gradual adaptation to her new home with each passing season. Another instance is when the author describes her watching ""their distinctive V etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance,"" which evokes memories of her native land."
429	9292	4	1	In the story, Saeng is compelled to adapt after her family's abrupt relocation from Vietnam to the United States. The narrative describes how various elements in the new location trigger recollections of her former life. The penultimate paragraph references the hibiscus, the geese, and the seasonal transition. The concluding paragraph synthesizes these elements, illustrating how familiar symbols from Vietnam manifest in her new surroundings, reinforcing her determination to persevere with her driving test and ultimately adapt. This demonstrates Saeng's capacity to overcome national obstacles. The paragraph concludes the story by reflecting its central themes of change and adaptation, yet primarily introspection. The author meticulously explains how each item reminds Saeng of her homeland, and to elevate the tone from regret to hopeful optimism, recollects them in the final passage, affirming hope for Saeng and her family.
430	9293	4	1	The author concluded the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This concludes the narrative because it reveals Saeng's profound affinity for nature. This is evidenced by the quote, “one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it,” demonstrating her appreciation for nature's minutiae. Another illustrative quote is, “she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand,” indicating her solicitous care for a small plant. Therefore, the author employed the final paragraph to illustrate Saeng's caring disposition toward the natural world.
431	9294	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with that paragraph to elucidate the symbolic significance of the hibiscus. This flower holds profound importance for her cultural identity. When hibiscus are present, Saeng feels empowered to overcome any challenge, which conversely explains her initial test failure. Consequently, she implies that during her next attempt, she will draw upon the strength the hibiscus provides to achieve success.
432	9295	4	1	This demonstrates her resilience and determination to adapt and prosper in a new country. It concludes a melancholic narrative on an optimistic note. The hibiscus functions as a symbol of hope, as does the spring season; this imbues the entire story with a sense of purpose. Without this element, the story would be purely sorrowful, but with it, it becomes one of hope. The narrative's tone suggests this is a pivotal moment, a resolution that paradoxically remains open-ended.
433	9296	4	1	The author concludes the passage with this phrase to illustrate that, despite the preceding heartache and confusion, she recognizes that adjustment requires time. She realizes she will be prepared, given sufficient time to heal and commence anew, analogous to the plant's cycle of renewal.
434	9297	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to establish a future objective for the protagonist. She is determined to pass the examination and will endeavor diligently to accomplish this the following year. For instance, while her mother's displeasure over the failure was transient, Saeng herself did not forget. She pledged her resolve to the hibiscus, a plant she cherishes deeply and for which she would exert immense effort.
435	9298	4	1	The author concludes the passage with this sentence to convey that perseverance is essential for success. Saeng will eventually adapt to her new country, but not if she dwells on longing for her homeland. The hibiscus serves as a reminder to embrace new beginnings and assimilate into society. Saeng will retake her driver's test when the plant re-buds, symbolizing the recommencement of its life cycle.
436	9299	4	1	She states that she will retake the examination after the spring thaw, when she can observe the geese and the budding hibiscus during the test, endeavoring to succeed.
437	9300	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with this paragraph to convey Saeng's emotional state. She felt a profound connection to the geese and the hibiscus; having lifted her head, she watched as their distinctive forms were etched, becoming almost familiar to her now. She will retake the examination in the spring. The hibiscus and its blossom will provide her solace, and she anticipates passing the test.
438	9301	4	1	"The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate how the hibiscus flower profoundly impacted Saeng’s life, imparting newfound courage and strength. For instance, after failing her driver’s test, Saeng sees a flower and experiences ""a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral,"" demonstrating the deep connection between her and the hibiscus, a bond that will guide her through adversity. Saeng subsequently entered a florist and identified all the blossoms from her childhood. Realizing her former home possessed these flowers, she used this link to her past to fortify her courage in adapting to her new life. Another example is the text stating, ""She realized that many of the things she thought were strange before had become…almost familiar to her now."" Saeng reaches this understanding upon hearing her mother explain how the hibiscus, which thrived in their native land, could also survive here. She comprehended that she, too, could persevere and no longer perceive elements of her new environment as alien. In this manner, the hibiscus tree provides Saeng with essential support, courage, and strength."
439	9302	4	1	“When they return,” Saeng vowed silently to herself, “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will retake the test.” This signifies her commitment to remediate the examination promptly to avoid future concerns. During their excursion, they encountered numerous unfamiliar sights; the soil was frigid and unyielding, offering little utility. She felt as though she had entered another world—a hot, moist environment exploding with verdure where a profusion of flora in myriad shades and shapes grew in seemingly random arrangement. Beside it stood yet another familiar plant: a small shrub with waxy leaves and a delicate flower possessing purplish petals and a white center. Dusk had fallen when Saeng arrived home; the wind blew fiercely, stripping the last remnants of green from the chicory weeds sprouting through sidewalk fissures. Thus, their journey revealed many novel sights, such as weeds growing through the concrete.
440	9303	4	1	The author includes this to demonstrate an unwavering determination to pass the examination regardless of circumstance.
441	9304	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative thusly to illustrate the protagonist's profound conviction that the flower's blossoming signifies her imminent success. Within her native culture, the blossom held immense significance, a value it retains. This particular flower evidently embodies her hope and dignity. She formerly gathered it with her grandmother to adorn her hair. Consequently, upon seeing the bloom, she will recall her grandmother, a memory that will galvanize her perseverance. The flower possesses a resilient nature, capable of enduring harsh winter conditions, thus the girl is resolute that its flowering will coincide with her ability to pass the examination.
442	9305	4	1	The author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the examination in spring, concurrent with the hibiscus's budding, because she endeavored to cultivate the tropical plant during winter. Having initially failed, she sought redemption upon her second attempt. To avert another failure, she modified her approach, tending to the plant with meticulous care and firming the soil around its base. This deliberate cultivation provides the rationale for the author's concluding paragraph.
443	9306	4	1	The protagonist's declaration that she will retake the test upon the hibiscus's blooming signifies her profound homesickness and enduring desire for a tangible connection to her homeland. Undertaking the examination as the plant flowers symbolizes supportive strength from her native country. The hibiscus functions as a metaphor for her personal development, as her growth parallels the plant's own. Initially, she was unready to venture forth, having not fully acclimatized to her new surroundings, just as the hibiscus was unaccustomed to the climate and had to await the spring to bloom.
444	9307	4	1	"Saeng's statement, ""then I will take that test again,"" encapsulates her primary objective throughout the story. However, her initial failure served as a pivotal narrative element. Yearning for solace, she sought the ""Malik,"" which evoked potent memories of her former life that sustained her resolve. This experience subsequently fostered a deeper bond with her mother and instilled a renewed sense of hope for her future in a new land—sufficient hope to declare her intention to retake the test with the return of spring and the budding hibiscus."
445	9308	4	1	The author selected this sentence for the denouement because it provides an effective resolution. It constitutes a fitting conclusion by delineating the protagonist's future course of action. This is successful because it demonstrates Saeng's ultimate realization that she must undertake the examination, notwithstanding her profound affinity for the natural world.
446	9309	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concluded the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's resolve to attempt the examination once more. The author intended to illustrate that Saeng would not capitulate, and once the matter most significant to her was resolved, she would subsequently retake the test. The story states that ""Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus,"" which was what held importance."
447	9310	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the conclusion features Saeng vowing silently that in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus buds, she will take the test again. The author employs this quotation to conclude the narrative because spring symbolizes a new beginning. The author recognizes the necessity of diligent effort and commencing anew. For instance, certain students who fail the second semester perceive winter as an opportunity for a fresh start."
448	9311	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the season is winter, a period during which the snow precludes any significant action. The climatic conditions necessitated that she postpone the examination until the spring.
449	9312	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has surmounted a significant obstacle and is learning to progress forward. Throughout the narrative, Saeng remains fixated on past memories rather than forging new ones. For example, when she visits the florist, she is inundated with recollections of her homeland. Upon seeing the jasmine plant, she reminisces about her deceased grandmother and the blossoms she wore. Furthermore, she tells her mother the purchased hibiscus is ""not a real one"" and ""not like the kind we had before,"" consistently comparing her new existence unfavorably to her former life. Therefore, the concluding paragraph signifies Saeng's personal growth and her newfound willingness to advance, exemplified by her decision to retake the driving test."
450	9313	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the narrative is reaching its resolution. The author provides a poignant final touch, suggesting that strength will return and beautiful flowers will blossom. This allows the readers to understand that nature will persist and the seasons will inevitably cycle back.
451	9314	4	1	This paragraph incorporates details to inform the reader that the season is winter, which is discernible from the textual reference to the melting snow.
452	9315	4	1	"Having failed her driving test, Saeng visited a florist and purchased a plant, the ""dok faeng ñ noi,"" which evoked fond memories of its ubiquitous presence in Vietnam. She acquired the hibiscus as a source of personal solace. The concluding paragraph states, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" Saeng ultimately reasoned that events transpire purposefully and opportunities perpetually recur, analogous to the geese migrating south and the progression of the seasons. She resolved to retake the examination at the next available opportunity."
453	9316	4	1	"The author concluded the narrative with the paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to illustrate the character's integration into her new environment. Similar to the natural world, she undergoes continual transformation; in the spring, when all elements that were dormant during winter begin to flourish, she will also thrive. Once she is prospering and has regained her sense of self, she will be prepared to take and pass the driving test. She will have returned to her former resilience, just as the geese return home; her period of sorrow will have concluded, like the melting snow, and when she is prepared to blossom, akin to the budding hibiscus, she will be ready to undertake the examination."
454	9317	4	1	"Throughout the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author conveys a sentiment of hope and comfort that Saeng derives from her recollections of the past. To perpetuate this hopeful feeling, the final sentence imparts the sense that Saeng's circumstances will improve beyond her initial state in the narrative. For instance, at the story's commencement, Saeng felt alienated, isolated, and displaced within her new country. However, as the plot advances, she begins to cultivate a peace of mind and a certainty that her future will brighten with the passage of time and her increasing confidence. In conclusion, the author utilizes the final sentence to impart a feeling of hope for Saeng's future and her burgeoning self-assurance."
455	9318	4	1	The meaning of the final phrase is to observe whether the winter hibiscus can propagate from seed and endure all necessary stages to blossom for the season, subsequently repeating this cyclical process.
456	9319	4	1	"Minfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to convey hope and renewal for Saeng. Spring symbolizes birth and renewal, offering Saeng a second chance. She had previously failed what appears to be a significant examination, perhaps her citizenship test, which motivated her to reconnect with her past, for which she feels profound longing. The winter hibiscus seems to represent Saeng herself, a connection illustrated when she mumbles, “it’s—it’s not a real one,” still too emotionally fragile to speak the words at home without risking tears. Her mother quietly observes that while its flowers are less splendid, the plant possesses the resilience to endure the cold months. This perfectly describes Saeng’s situation; she is not identical to her former, happier self, yet she possesses the fortitude to persevere through hardship and ultimately flourish in the spring to retake the test. This demonstrates the purpose of the final paragraph: to illustrate the renewal and hope that Saeng will experience."
457	9320	4	1	This sentence was selected as the concluding statement because it affirms Saeng's potential to pass the examination. Although she is no longer in her homeland, she retains the capacity for achievement. As the plant evocative of home returns and commences growth, Saeng will undergo a parallel development. It is an effective concluding sentence, leaving the reader to contemplate whether she will ultimately succeed on the test.
458	9321	4	1	The author concludes the narrative thus because the flower provides Saeng with fortitude. It offers her hope and serves as a memento of her homeland, where such flowers were ubiquitous, unlike the one she had to purchase. She planted it to grow throughout the winter. Following the winter, the flower blooms expansively, and she passes her driving examination. As a reward, her mother procures for her an authentic Vietnamese flower.
459	9322	4	1	The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng recognizes her prior error and wishes to atone with her mother. Furthermore, she is demonstrating the depth of her genuine appreciation for the natural world to her mother.
460	9323	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng initially failed her driving test and is now resolving internally to attempt it again.
461	9324	4	1	The author likely employed that response to illustrate her necessity of enduring another @DATE1 or arduous labor in cultivating the flowers.
462	9325	4	1	"The author concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" in that manner to demonstrate Saeng's resolve. At one juncture, the author noted, ""she was still too shaky to say the words at home."" Saeng profoundly missed her former existence and her native land, frequently contemplating when she might return and relish it, as she continued struggling to adapt to her new life. The story's conclusion portrays Saeng as an individual who would not readily capitulate. Despite her prior difficulties, the ending offers renewed hope for her acclimation to her new environment. Furthermore, after Saeng fails the test, the final sentence provides optimism; when she informed her mother, ""I failed the test,"" she was profoundly disheartened. The concluding sentence instills hope that she will labor more assiduously and improve in the spring. The author reveals Saeng's determination to transcend failure and carve her own niche in life. Ultimately, the closing sentence in ""Winter Hibiscus"" is utilized to exhibit Saeng's determination."
463	9326	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with that paragraph because she feels an affinity for the geese, and her memories are associated with the instances she observes them. It is plausible that her test is academic, yet she maintains a belief that she will pass it by recollecting the memories with which she feels connected to the external world. For instance, she possesses a profound affection for flowers. Consequently, this is the rationale for the author's decision to conclude the story with that particular paragraph.
464	9327	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a profoundly spiritual and confident paragraph to demonstrate hope's significant role in our lives. In the story, Saeng, a foreign Chinese citizen, is deeply moved and overwhelmed by the majestic plants and nature thriving within the greenhouse. She endeavors to locate all the flora that evoke memories of her home and connect them to her past experiences. As she traverses the greenhouse, she whispers and articulates the names of the nature she observes; ""Saebba,"" Saeng whispered, ""Madagascar periwinkle,"" its tag pronounced. ""How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild."" However, as her tour progressed, she soon realizes she is forgetting some memories and begins to weep. Upon arriving home, her mother greets her. ""I-I failed the test,"" Saeng said. Saeng's mother is touched by her comment and consoles her by planting the ""hibiscus."" Ultimately, the author employs a powerful final paragraph to evoke hope and emotion, representing the notion that everyone merits a second opportunity."
465	9328	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that he is fundamentally declaring he will never undertake that examination again. The author illustrates the character's profound aversion to this test and his preference to abstain from taking it entirely.
466	9329	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a particularly resonant paragraph addressing the necessity of surmounting obstacles and exhorting the reader toward perseverance. It is imperative to persist in one's efforts until success is ultimately achieved. In the story, Saeng, having recently relocated from Vietnam, experienced profound homesickness, compounded by her failure of a driving examination. She was deeply disheartened. Observing a flock of geese overhead, she resolved that upon their spring return and the growth of her new plant, she would retake the test. Geese must overcome the adversity of cold by migrating south for the winter. The frigid climate constitutes a significant obstacle for them. Similarly, her nascent plant cannot flourish until warmer conditions arrive. The plant must endure its diminutive state until it can blossom in the spring. Individuals perpetually confront impediments, and one must continually endeavor to navigate past them.
467	9330	4	1	"The short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes as it does to convey the narrator's realization that winter heralds a new opportunity for commencement, a symbolic rebirth. A passage demonstrating the narrator's hope states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before, through that quiet repetition of season upon season, [had become] almost familiar to her now.” This excerpt illustrates her recognition that numerous previously perplexing elements had suddenly acquired purpose. She comprehended that spring introduces a new beginning. The concluding sentences declare her intention to retake the examination in spring, signifying her acknowledgment of an entirely new opportunity and life awaiting initiation. The final sentence of ""Winter Hibiscus"" thus represents an epiphany regarding the opportunities concomitant with the advent of spring."
468	9331	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the motivation and confidence Saeng has derived from her experience with the plant. Several reasons and examples substantiate this assertion. Primarily, the author aims to demonstrate Saeng's transformation following her initial test and her purchase of the flower for solace. For instance, after failing the driving examination, Saeng visits a florist. Upon encountering the plant, memories of her childhood resurface, allowing her to momentarily disregard her failure. This flower subsequently motivates her to pursue her license. Furthermore, the paragraph reveals the confidence this experience has instilled within her. This is evidenced by her resilient declaration after failing: “… I will take the test again.” In summation, the author incorporates this paragraph to delineate the profound self-assurance Saeng has cultivated through her experience.
469	9332	4	1	The author includes that statement at the story's conclusion to demonstrate that Saeng will not capitulate, much like the hibiscus. For instance, the hibiscus exerts its utmost effort to endure the winter, ultimately blooming and recommencing its cycle in spring. Similarly, Saeng will persevere through her personal winter and begin anew in the spring by retaking the examination. The author intended to reveal to readers that Saeng embodies the hibiscus in the sense that she must start over and reattempt what she has failed, analogous to the hibiscus which appears to perish in the winter.
470	9333	4	1	My interpretation is that the narrative concerns winter, and therefore it will inherently involve themes of traversing the winter landscape, engaging in recreational activities, and all such associated endeavors.
471	9334	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in such a manner to heighten reader engagement and to underscore the perpetual recurrence of these events with each passing year.
472	9335	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to illustrate that the flower previously served as her inspiration to undertake the examination. My interpretation was derived from the story's consistent portrayal of @PERSON1, who was perpetually either cultivating the hibiscus or in its presence. This persistent motif clearly indicated that she derived her inspiration from this particular flower and its aesthetic appeal. In summation, the author deliberately concludes the story to emphasize the hibiscus's profound significance to Saeng.
473	9336	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to symbolize the impending rebirth that will occur. It is as if she is declaring that she will hibernate throughout the winter, and when spring returns, initiating a new cycle of life, she will consequently do the same. Saeng “realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She is conveying that the advent of a new season will mark her own new beginning, accompanied by a transformed perspective on her life.
474	9337	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this fashion to provide a comprehensive resolution. The author integrated elements of nature and their detailed descriptions. This technique was employed to evoke a vivid mental image for the reader, illustrating the purported beauty and tranquility associated with the spring season.
475	9338	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it implies that her fortitude will emerge concurrently with the flowers, thereby enabling her to undertake the examination.
476	9339	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" author Minfong Ho concludes with that paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's profound determination. Initially, the girl succumbed to purchasing the costly flower, yet her desire to avoid disappointing her mother fueled a resolve to ultimately ""pass the test."" When spring arrives and seed purchasing commences, she aspires to be financially prepared, a circumstance through which the author demonstrates the girl's controlled and resolute character."
477	9340	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow—""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again""—because the hibiscus's budding symbolizes renewal. Saeng's decision to retake the examination represents her seizing an opportunity for a fresh start. Just as the hibiscus persistently buds, so too must Saeng persist in her endeavors."
478	9341	4	1	"In the final paragraph, the author concludes the story thus to signify the hibiscus as a symbol for overcoming adversity. For instance, the mother observes, ""Its flowers aren't pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This exemplifies resilience, as the plant endures harsh seasonal conditions. For Saeng, this symbolizes her capacity to thrive in a foreign country. Consequently, when she vows to retake the driver's test upon the snow's melting and the hibiscus's budding, she employs the flower as a metaphor for conquering the obstacle of her initial failure, which justifies the author's concluding choice."
479	9342	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to convey Saeng's determination to complete what she initiated. Having failed her driver's test, she experiences profound disappointment, evidenced by her tear-stained, puffy eyes as she reminisces about her Vietnamese homeland and past life. She identifies with the migrating geese that return, recognizing that as new beginnings emerge in spring, so will hers—a fresh commencement mirrored by the blossoming hibiscus and her resolve to retake the test.
480	9343	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate to the audience that since Saeng did not surrender, neither should they. This passage articulates a fundamental life principle: perseverance. Despite her initial failure, she remains willing to endeavor once more.
481	9344	4	1	Upon their return in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese reappear, and this hibiscus begins to bud, Saeng vowed silently to retake the examination. The author likely incorporated this to illustrate the imprudence of postponing obligations, which should instead be addressed promptly as they emerge. Consequently, the protagonist initially exemplifies a flawed approach, with the author emphasizing the necessity of avoiding such conduct. Ultimately, including this phrase was appropriate to effectively model the correct method for managing such circumstances.
482	9345	4	1	She must comprehend that substituting a plant with an identical specimen will not yield an equivalent entity. This is a fundamental lesson she needs to assimilate into her understanding of life.
483	9346	4	1	"The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's intention to align herself with nature's rhythm and assimilate into her new environment. Having failed her driving test, Saeng feels profoundly displaced. The text describes a garden where the plant stands ""tall and lush,"" evoking memories of her native land where she belonged. The sight of the hibiscus inspires her to postpone retaking the test until the flower blossoms. Simultaneously, observing geese overhead while planting reinforces this resolve. The author notes her realization that previously strange elements had become ""almost familiar."" The geese's spring return will now symbolize her new identity and the necessity of forging a contented existence. The final declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" conveys Saeng's commitment to a fresh start in her new home."
484	9347	4	1	This powerful sentence encapsulates central story themes. Saeng's determination to recommence is fortified by the comforting symbol of her homeland. The statement reveals the plant's profound effect on her morale and its role in her emotional recovery. It provides a cohesive story conclusion, highlighting the hibiscus's significance. The narrative characterizes the plant as a companion and a memento of her origins. Its eventual blooming will signal her readiness to retake the test. This paragraph serves as an exceptional passage conclusion by synthesizing the profound meaning the hibiscus holds for Saeng.
485	9348	4	1	The author aims to convey the imperative of perseverance and to illustrate nature's inherent beauty. This is demonstrated through Saeng, who, despite failing her test, resolves to attempt it again. The narrative incorporates the winter hibiscus she planted, which becomes integral to the resolution. The conclusion fundamentally signifies the promise of a new beginning.
486	9349	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with the paragraph wherein Saeng vows to retake the examination in the spring, as the paragraph itself provides a definitive resolution. It essentially encapsulates her determination to repeat the entire process, having already undertaken it previously. The author's implication is that with the flora's resurgence in spring, she must recommence her arduous efforts, which fundamentally constituted the test.
487	9350	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey the protagonist's resilience. Readers might have presumed she considered examinations from her homeland more significant. Consequently, she would appear indifferent toward passing this particular test due to her homesickness and a perceived lack of concern for such assessments.
488	9351	4	1	The author likely concluded the narrative in this manner to serve as a metaphor, encouraging readers to think beyond conventional parameters. Alternatively, the author may have intended for the conclusion to provide readers with a vivid mental image illustrating the protagonist's circumstances and reflections.
489	9352	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey the protagonist's emotional perspective regarding her experiences. This segment represents her internal affirmation that circumstances are acceptable and that she will improve subsequently. Its inclusion enhances Saeng's characterization by projecting greater self-assurance. Earlier, during her conversation with her mother, she appeared uncertain; this conclusion, however, establishes her resolve and clarity of intention.
490	9353	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring because she has established a parallel between the hibiscus's capacity to rejuvenate and produce new blossoms and Saeng's own potential for renewal. This symbolic correlation justifies the inclusion of the quoted passage at the story's denouement."
491	9354	4	1	"Saeng initially failed her driver's examination. She subsequently discovered a hibiscus plant and purchased it, as it evoked memories of her former existence in Vietnam. She observes, ""The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long grey hair."" The blossom serves as a memento of her grandmother. Her mother remarks, ""??? Seen this kind blooming along the lake, its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months,"" in an attempt to console her daughter. The narrative continues, ""Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by their faint honks clear and yes-familiar to Saeng now. She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now."""
492	9355	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate her dawning realization that elements which once appeared foreign had become recognizable with the passage of seasons and the resilience of the flora. Consequently, the author positions this paragraph at the conclusion to signify her renewed determination, as she intends to return in the spring to retake the examination.
493	9356	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate that the discovered plant symbolizes her future success in obtaining a license, thus serving as a significant reminder. Furthermore, this structure parallels the plant's cyclical blooming, which signifies a new beginning, just as her decision to attempt the test again represents a personal renewal and a fresh start.
494	9357	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph to demonstrate how the tranquility the flower imparted will bolster her confidence and deter her from surrendering. This is evident after the protagonist fails her driving test; encountering the flower reminds her of her homeland in Vietnam. Moreover, the flower's perpetual spring blooming symbolizes perseverance, prompting her realization that she too must persist. Thus, the plant provides the fortitude to endeavor once more, and the concluding paragraph reveals the empowering influence of the familiar flower and her resultant resolve.
495	9358	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this final paragraph because it synthesizes two disparate situations. When Saeng vows that upon the snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding in spring, she will retake the test, she demonstrates her determination to ultimately prevail and to resolve her challenging circumstance.
496	9359	4	1	The author indicates her preference for retaking the examination in the spring rather than the winter, as she would possess greater focus to concentrate exclusively on the test without the distraction of planting.
497	9360	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner because the protagonist demonstrates persistent effort throughout the entire story. The final sentence signifies that her journey is not concluded; she intends to return and attempt the test once more. She strives to validate her capabilities across the entire book and will persist in her diligent efforts to achieve her objectives.
498	9361	4	1	The author concludes the story thusly because it functions metaphorically; she draws a parallel between herself and the hibiscus plant. Just as a hibiscus is tested to overcome harsh conditions like the cold—with the author noting its flowers are less vibrant yet it remains resilient enough to survive the winter months—so too will she, like the winter hibiscus, bloom again. Having endured her own trial, she will subsequently have an opportunity to pass her examination, which justifies the story's conclusion.
499	9362	4	1	"The concluding paragraph in ""Winter Hibiscus"" conveys a powerful message of transition from a state of cold, detached failure to a renewed existence. Saeng associates her personal transformation with the seasonal shift from winter to spring. This is evident when the text states that in spring, as the snow melts and the geese return, the hibiscus buds. She accepts this as a fresh opportunity to begin anew and subsequently attempt to pass her test. The seasonal metamorphosis symbolizes Saeng's arduous struggle to adapt to her new home. Furthermore, the returning geese and the hibiscus adapting to its new environment symbolize the path Saeng follows, as the plant originates from her native Vietnam yet can now also flourish elsewhere."
500	9363	4	1	The author selected this conclusion for its profound impact and significant meaning. The final paragraph's implication is that time will facilitate her adjustment to her current residence. It also integrates the hibiscus flower, noting its eventual re-bloom, which possesses a dual meaning suggesting the author's life will also flourish again. Ultimately, this constituted an effective method for concluding the narrative.
501	9364	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the conclusion is structured as it is because Saeng's vow to retake the examination upon the season's renewal signifies her transcendence over the disappointment and alienation of immigrating to a new nation. The archetypal significance of a flower bud—representing prosperity, inception, and development—illustrates her personal evolution, a vital component of the human experience, thereby justifying the optimistic resolution."
502	9365	4	1	The author selects this concluding paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's recognition of her symbolic connection to the hibiscus. Throughout the narrative, Saeng observes flora native to her homeland now thriving within the greenhouse, noting their successful adaptation to a new environment, much like the hibiscus enduring the winter. This prompts her realization that she, too, must adapt to achieve success in her new home. Her vow to retake the test in spring, coinciding with the hibiscus's budding—a recommencement of its growth cycle—signifies her own intended renewal.
503	9366	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the final paragraph underscores the hibiscus's profound significance for the protagonist. The author employs the plant as a symbol of resilience, a quality the girl must embody to ultimately pass her driving examination. Positioning this paragraph at the denouement illustrates that if the hibiscus can rejuvenate after winter's dormancy, the girl possesses a similar capacity for recovery. Ultimately, the author utilizes the concluding passage to accentuate the symbolic meaning of the hibiscus."
504	9367	4	1	"The narrative, imbued with profound emotion and melancholic nostalgia, could verge upon the disheartening; thus, the author deliberately concludes with a message of hope. Following Saeng's failure, where ""in the main shelter of the greenhouse she broke down and wept,"" it is profoundly inspiring to learn of her resolve to persevere despite adversity. Experiencing homesickness is profoundly challenging, and discovering the fortitude to continue, making a pledge to retake the examination, is a difficult yet ultimately rewarding endeavor. The author further utilizes the ending to imbue the hibiscus with additional meaning: its bloom upon the geese's return signifies that after hardship, new hope and beauty will emerge with the spring."
505	9368	4	1	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because it provides a comprehensive resolution. It elucidates her commitment to diligently prepare for the test she previously failed and her determination to attempt it again with the arrival of spring. For instance, the geese's departure for the winter and their subsequent return in spring parallels her decision to retake the examination. In conclusion, the author selected this paragraph for the denouement as it most effectively clarifies the story's final resolution.
506	9369	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's personal growth and the burgeoning hope that she will ultimately acclimate to life in the United States. Her statement, ""I-I failed the test,"" can be interpreted as failing an assessment of whether she had overcome her attachment to her homeland."
507	9370	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the narrative with a specific paragraph wherein Saeng vows to herself, ""When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This resolution demonstrates the necessity of persevering for one's convictions and for what is fundamentally right."
508	9371	4	1	Saeng sought to demonstrate her resilience and determination, aspiring to optimize her circumstances with available resources. The relocation to another country had substantially diminished her hope, and the winter deepened her melancholy, intensifying her longing for home. She purchased the flower to symbolically evoke her homeland. With the arrival of spring, she will blossom alongside the flower and retake the examination, embracing this new environment with its own hibiscus, recognizing that winter is an inhospitable season for such flora.
509	9372	4	1	Saeng experienced a profound sense of emptiness, which she attempted to fill by purchasing an item that offered comfort while simultaneously intensifying her nostalgia for her origins. Her mother expressed mild frustration regarding the expense. Consequently, Saeng vowed silently that in the spring, she would undertake the examination once more.
510	9373	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this particular paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has cultivated the requisite confidence to undertake the driving examination once again, demonstrating her resolve to succeed.
511	9374	4	1	The author terminates the narrative at this juncture to sustain suspense regarding subsequent events. This constitutes the essential information about the story. The author has already conveyed the crucial elements, and the future constitutes an entirely separate matter. Whether Saeng passes the examination or what transpires during the winter is immaterial. The author has communicated everything necessary regarding this individual's significance and her mother.
512	9375	4	1	Saeng experiences a sense of displacement in her unfamiliar residence and nation. She internally resolves to retake the examination in one year. She pledges that within a year she will have acclimated to her new environment and will commence deriving satisfaction from life once more. The author concluded with this paragraph to express the hopeful prospect that Saeng will ultimately appreciate her new home and, in a year, will have grown accustomed to her new country's circumstances. Saeng merely feels dislocated and prefers to postpone her attempt to retake the assessment. The author ends the narrative thus because Saeng made a solemn vow to herself, which she will hopefully honor and realize.
513	9376	4	1	The author likely concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng is not resigning but is instead resolved to strive with greater determination. Witnessing the geese adapt, she elects to endeavor and render their new home successful. After they vanish, she composes herself and declares her intention to attempt again. Through this action, she is committing herself to experiment with novel approaches to accommodate change.
514	9377	4	1	I believe the story concludes with this paragraph because she intends to take the test during a subsequent period when the experience will be less arduous. The weather will be warm again and not quite as severe.
515	9378	4	1	The narrative concludes with this paragraph for several reasons. Primarily, the spring's warm and sunny ambiance facilitates ending the story on an optimistic note. Furthermore, this demonstrates Saeng's capacity to adapt to her new home, akin to the hibiscus surviving the winter. Ultimately, it reveals Saeng's determination and her refusal to disappoint her mother. These are the reasons for the story's concluding paragraph.
516	9379	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that if they can adapt, then she can as well. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This statement is selected because it demonstrates that if they are capable of returning after all that has occurred, she possesses the same capacity. She should be able to acclimate to a new environment just as they do.
517	9380	4	1	"Authors frequently conclude their stories with paragraphs that provoke readers to contemplate subsequent events. In Minfong Ho’s ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a concluding paragraph serves precisely this function. The author employs this conclusion to signify a forward-looking perspective. She declares her intention to retake the test upon the snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus blooming. She perceives this moment as a new commencement, a chance to begin anew. Furthermore, the geese, the blooming hibiscus, and the melted snow instill in her the hope that she will pass her examination. She believes that possessing a hibiscus may render her new surroundings more reminiscent of her former home. Authors utilize such speculative endings to stimulate reader reflection."
518	9381	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to ensure the reader comprehends the narrative's developments. For instance, Saeng’s silent vow—""in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again""—serves to reveal the characters' perspectives, thereby enabling the reader to grasp the author's intended meaning."
519	9382	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the geese and the hibiscus represent elements familiar to Saeng, reminding her of her homeland. When these familiar entities return, she will possess the fortitude to retake the test and aspire to improve. The narrator states, “Overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yet-familiar to Saeng now.” This illustrates how the geese symbolize the familiar aspects of her homeland that assist Saeng in feeling more comfortable within her new environment.
520	9383	4	1	"The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant evokes memories of her origin and assists her in accomplishing specific objectives. The hibiscus originates from her homeland, as indicated when she states, “I mean, not like the kind we had at—,” finding herself too emotionally overwhelmed to utter the word ""home."" She longs for her home, and this plant helps resurrect those memories. Consequently, the author incorporated this paragraph to demonstrate to the reader her profound sense of nostalgia."
521	9384	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate its significance regarding Saeng's character. It pertains intimately to her personal history and geographical origins. She endeavors to convey that upon spring's arrival, she intends to retake the academic examination. Alternatively, she plans to cultivate something anew during the spring season. Since snow persists and conditions are too frigid for planting presently, her native land remains profoundly significant to her; she misses it and aspires to return to her place of origin.
522	9385	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng’s silent vow: “when they come back, I will take the test again in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” This resolution occurs because the plant has instilled within her a substantial degree of self-assurance, thereby fostering her capacity for future improvement.
523	9386	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner for several reasons. Primarily, she will have accrued greater experience within her new nation. Having departed her homeland merely months prior, an additional six months will render her more conversant with its customs, thereby enhancing her capability to pass the examination. Furthermore, spring signifies the flower's resurgence, which will provide her with renewed fortitude conducive to success. This interim allows the author sufficient opportunity for both mental and physical preparation, involving necessary study and the acquisition of knowledge through maturation.
524	9387	4	1	To overcome her failure, Saeng purchased a flower evocative of her homeland, which moved her to tears as she longed to return. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to demonstrate how she will retake the examination upon experiencing a sense of belonging. Saeng resolved that when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she would attempt the test again. These elements foster a feeling of welcome that will facilitate her success. The paragraph concludes the story by assembling all the components with which she finds solace, thereby aiding the reader's comprehension of what evokes her homeland and the flower's profound significance. The purchased flower assists in mitigating her troubles, while the sight of migrating geese evokes memories of home, culminating in a conclusion that highlights the recollections which will support Saeng's future endeavors.
525	9388	4	1	The author likely concluded the narrative with this resolution because everyone merits new beginnings and subsequent opportunities. The author appears to impart a message advocating for perseverance following initial failure. When Saeng failed the examination, her self-esteem demonstrably diminished; however, after her mother's attempts to console her, she ultimately recognized the detriment of surrendering and the necessity of endeavoring anew with a fresh perspective.
526	9389	4	1	"Minfong Ho incorporated the concluding paragraph to allude to Saeng's enhanced morale and confidence upon being reminded of home. Upon seeing the hibiscus, she experienced a sensation so profound it was nearly visceral. Ho employed the flower symbolically, noting the winter hibiscus's resilience to endure the cold season, prompting the reader to infer that this blossom must instill hope and assurance within Saeng. Furthermore, the geese formation into a V is inferred to represent Vietnam for Saeng, an association the author intends the audience to recognize. This explains the inclusion of ""and the geese return"" in the final passage. Ho aims for her readers to comprehend that objects evoking comfort and happiness ultimately foster inner strength and confidence. The author adeptly positioned this culminating idea within the last paragraph, as it perfectly encapsulates the narrative's lesson: one should pursue endeavors when feeling self-assured and in a familiar, supportive environment. An individual may feel diminutive and vulnerable, but by establishing roots, one can flourish with renewed confidence."
527	9390	4	1	The narrative's final paragraph functions as the author's method for illustrating Saeng's desire for an early spring, motivated by her aspiration to see her hibiscus blossom. Should spring be delayed, she would be deprived of this sight and the snow would remain. When Saeng emerges, her hope is that she will subsequently be prepared to undertake the examination once more, symbolizing a personal renewal aligned with the changing season.
528	9391	4	1	"The author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" because the winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. In her homeland, hibiscus plants were part of her normal, settled life. After moving to the U.S., where she possesses no hibiscus, fails her driving test, and feels displaced, encountering the winter hibiscus provides a profound sense of solace and familiarity. It offers a feeling of security. Ultimately, the author selected this concluding sentence to represent Saeng's impending renewal, with the hibiscus signifying this fresh start and the resilience required to embrace it."
529	9392	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it mirrors Saeng's own life, suggesting she will receive another opportunity, just as the geese inevitably return. The concluding section reflects her personal experience through its reference to spring, a season traditionally associated with positive change as temperatures warm and flora reemerge. The reblooming hibiscus will symbolically renew her comforting memories of her native home. That period will then be the appropriate time to reattempt the driving test she previously failed, an event which preceded her acquisition of the plant. The author included this final segment for its exceptional cohesion with the story's central themes of cyclical renewal and personal resilience.
530	9393	4	1	The author concludes the story with a brief paragraph to demonstrate that sometimes the most minor details carry the greatest significance. The author believed that within two succinct sentences, the most crucial elements of the narrative could be summarized, and this objective was accomplished with considerable effectiveness, providing a resonant and focused finale.
531	9394	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph because Saeng must retake the examination. She believes her prospects for success are greater when the hibiscus blossoms and the snow dissipates. Consequently, Saeng intends to attempt the test again following the snow's departure and the hibiscus's flowering.
532	9395	4	1	The author concludes with this sentence for several reasons. Saeng perceives that she cannot succeed until spring, as that season heralds the geese's return. It is also the period when the hibiscus buds. In a sense, she feels she will similarly flourish in spring and consequently possess the capability to pass the examination.
533	9396	4	1	The author likely includes this paragraph in the narrative because the grandmother might interpret the situation as a test to determine what she can accomplish within a designated period. The grandmother may potentially achieve more than is reasonably expected.
534	9397	4	1	The author likely concludes the story in this manner to suggest that Saeng will be prepared to retake the test by that time. Alternatively, the author implies that when spring arrives, she will feel ready and more self-assured. Essentially, the author conveys that, much like the commencement of a new spring, this will represent a new beginning for her.
535	9398	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to convey Saeng's resolve to attempt the test again. For instance, despite failing her driving examination, she decides to retake it after the experience of gardening with her mother. Planting the hibiscus appears to have restored her confidence to strive for success once more. Within the narrative, she seemed to be acclimating to the planting process. Having accomplished this task, she now believes she can similarly pass the test upon her next attempt.
536	9399	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a reflective statement to underscore the parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus. Similar to Saeng, the hibiscus exists within an unfamiliar setting and must acclimate to its environment. Having recently failed her driving examination, Saeng is disheartened. The concluding sentence conveys the realization that Saeng can surmount her automotive difficulties, just as the plant endures its severe conditions.
537	9400	4	1	The author incorporates this as the final paragraph to potentially provide hope for Saeng’s mother. This hope is significant because the family may genuinely require Saeng to pass the examination for their collective well-being and future prospects.
538	9401	4	1	"It was imperative that the author concluded the narrative with that specific paragraph. It reaffirmed the symbolic meaning of the hibiscus and its profound significance to Saeng. It demonstrated her resolve in confronting the challenges of residing in a new country. Without this paragraph, the reader would be left to speculate about Saeng's future. While ambiguity functions in some stories, it was essential here. Her initial encounter with the hibiscus caused an emotional collapse, as she struggled to recall her homeland, which explains the plant's crucial role. Reiterating its importance at the end guided the reader regarding subsequent developments, despite the story's conclusion. This reinforcement was necessary. The final paragraph states, ""This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The buds symbolize a fresh commencement for Saeng and a renewed opportunity to conquer her obstacles. This paragraph was vital; its omission would leave these narrative threads unresolved, rendering the story's meaning far less clear for the reader."
539	9402	4	1	"Including the detail about retaking the test when the ""hibiscus is budding"" provides a sense of closure and a moral to an otherwise open-ended conclusion. Saeng fails her driver's examination early in the narrative and subsequently purchases a hibiscus on her journey home. The correlation remains obscure until this final passage. The hibiscus symbolizes perseverance and resilience. After a severe winter, this plant can blossom once more and continue to thrive. Similarly, despite relocating from Vietnam and grappling with adaptation, Saeng must recuperate and persist in her efforts. Just as the flower blooms again, so too will Saeng. She will retake the examination and succeed, ultimately adapting to her environment and persevering, much like the hibiscus."
540	9403	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" because the narrative commenced following Saeng's failure of her driving test. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of her homeland. After Saeng planted the hibiscus in the garden, ""a flock of Canada geese flew by,"" and as they passed, Saeng experienced a feeling of comfort and made the vow that initiated her transformation. Had Saeng passed the driving test initially, she would never have discovered the hibiscus."
541	9404	4	1	The author includes this detail because her mother undertook the examination and succeeded, compelling the daughter to emulate her maternal figure. She can only undertake the test during the spring season due to the absence of floral blooms throughout the winter period.
542	9405	4	1	"The author endeavors to illustrate that Saeng is ultimately commencing to acknowledge and surmount the tribulations in her life. This demonstrates her eventual acclimatization to @LOCATION1 and its conventions, although she has not relinquished her heritage. The statement, ""But she had herself much preferred it to a Big Mac,"" substantiates her resolve to maintain a positive disposition and not permit discouragement to prevail. She intends to retake the assessment and endeavor once more. Initially, her perspective on her life circumstances was bleak, but following her visit to the floral shop, she uncovers a more cheerful and optimistic outlook, deciding to take proactive measures."
543	9406	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with that particular paragraph for several reasons. A primary rationale is to signify the presence of winter and the subsequent renewal that will commence with its conclusion, as flowering and planting will resume. The story states, ""the winter hibiscus was in the ground now…,"" indicating a necessary period of waiting for winter to pass, after which the hibiscus will begin to grow and is anticipated to be fully established by spring. This symbolic transition explains the author's chosen conclusion for the story."
544	9407	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to address the unresolved question regarding her test, indicating the moment she felt sufficiently comfortable to undertake it. Within the text, the plant felt smooth and cool, a sensation she recognized and found comforting. She enclosed it within her palm, clutching it tightly; this, at least, was something tangible she could retain. Unlike her grandmother, she experienced a profound and potent wave of loss that brought stinging tears to her eyes, imbued with sadness and perhaps disappointment—emotions she would likely prefer to avoid for some time. This is intimated in the conclusion, further emphasized when her mother uttered a small cry of surprise and delight upon seeing the flower, even before expressing shock at Saeng's revelation of its cost, over nineteen dollars. With this concluding paragraph, it is believed she will feel more comfortable at the planned time, as she will have both new and familiar elements, such as the geese and the plant, to which she can return.
545	9408	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author incorporates this concluding paragraph to demonstrate that upon the next occasion, she will be prepared and equipped for the garden and the challenges it presents. Initially, she was unready and unfamiliar with the winter hibiscus, having never previously engaged in such an endeavor."
546	9409	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the protagonist's resolution to retake the examination in the spring, following the snow's thaw, the geese's return, and the hibiscus's budding. This conclusion illustrates that despite her initial failure, she will not capitulate due to the challenges of adaptation. The hibiscus serves as a metaphor, demonstrating to the protagonist that just as the plant can acclimate to its new environment, so too can she."
547	9410	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to signify that once the natural world is flourishing, the protagonist will feel more established and psychologically fortified. This interpretation is supported by the girl's previous custom of assisting her grandmother with her hair prior to relocating. Consequently, the flower's blossoming would evoke memories of her grandmother, thereby providing the necessary incentive to excel on the examination.
548	9411	4	1	The author employs this concluding paragraph as a form of personification, depicting the snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. These images collectively represent a passage of time and a period of renewal. Furthermore, the author accentuates the hibiscus's isolation within its new setting, mirroring the protagonist's own initial solitude.
549	9412	4	1	The author selected this concluding paragraph to articulate Saeng's sentiment regarding the approaching winter and her requisite patience until spring's return to attempt her test again. The seasonal transition symbolizes a period of waiting and preparation, framing her resolve within a natural cycle of dormancy and subsequent renewal, which underscores her determination.
550	9413	4	1	Saeng exhibits a profound regard for the flowers, particularly the hibiscus. She is captivated by their natural processes, especially their unique capacity for growth and survival under unfamiliar conditions. This botanical interest reflects a deeper appreciation for resilience and the distinctive beauty inherent in natural occurrences.
551	9414	4	1	I remain uncertain regarding the author's rationale for the narrative, as I genuinely do not comprehend it; perhaps she intended to convey that, having completed all her examinations, she would not repeat the experience. The moment has arrived. She is in school, and having undertaken that particular assessment, it represented a form of attainment, yet it is now @DATE1 and the academic term has concluded.
552	9415	4	1	The author integrates this concluding paragraph into the narrative because a resolution was requisite for the story's denouement. Furthermore, the selected conclusion was chosen as the denouement that most appropriately complements the narrative's overarching themes.
553	9416	4	1	I posit that the author elected this particular denouement because the narrative's central theme is perseverance. For instance, the story was fundamentally structured around the winter hibiscus plant. This serves as an apt illustration because, ultimately, Saeng resolves that she will persevere and retake her examination, just as the hibiscus perseveres and endures through the winter, refusing to perish. Another exemplar is that @CAPS1 mother labored outdoors in the cold to complete her gardening. This correlates with the narrative because she remained in the frigid garden to accomplish her task; she could have relinquished the effort and retreated indoors to the warm house, analogous to Saeng potentially quitting and declaring she would not attempt the test again. However, she did not; she affirmed her intention to endeavor once more.
554	9417	4	1	"I believe the author concluded the story in this manner to signify that the protagonist has not yet surrendered; despite her initial failure, she is resolved to attempt again. The phrase, ""In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" signifies that when all is @CAPS1, she will endeavor once more, for success would render the situation @CAPS1. The narrative was somewhat deficient because the nature of her failure remained unclear, which diminished my appreciation for it."
555	9418	4	1	"I surmise the author concluded the story with the paragraph, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again,"" because, akin to the plant possessing little chance for survival in winter, the girl faced similar odds during her driving test. However, in spring, the plant has an opportunity to bloom, just as she has a prospect of passing the examination, for there exists an appropriate time and place for everything."
556	9419	4	1	Emotion, commitment, and hope collectively constitute the rationale for the author's decision to conclude the narrative with Saeng’s silent vow to retake the examination upon the spring’s arrival, the snow's melting, the geese's return, and the hibiscus's budding. The final paragraph initially demonstrates her profound emotional state. Subsequently, it reveals her steadfast commitment, as she resolves to attempt the test again coinciding with the plant’s resurgence. Ultimately, it conveys a sense of hope and her determination to redeem herself. These are the fundamental reasons for the inclusion of the concluding paragraph.
557	9420	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this specific paragraph to underscore the protagonist's newfound resolve in surmounting her challenges. For instance, she articulates a realization that many elements she previously perceived as foreign had, through the quiet repetition of seasonal cycles, become almost familiar. This moment constitutes an epiphany, wherein she comprehends life’s cyclical nature, akin to the seasons. She subsequently applies this insight by declaring her intention to retake the test in the spring. This illustrates that, just as the winter hibiscus endures the cold season to bloom eventually, she must demonstrate fortitude during her own difficult period, awaiting her eventual opportunity to flourish.
558	9421	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph to illustrate that the protagonist would not capitulate after a single failure. Having already failed the test once, she was deeply disheartened. She subsequently purchased a plant, and her mother advised pursuing the correct method. Although Saeng was tearful when confessing, her mother responded with understanding rather than anger. They could have utilized a plant they cultivated themselves; however, the plant would not thrive under the present conditions. Therefore, acquiring an established plant from an external source was a necessary and appropriate course of action.
559	9422	4	1	Determination, new beginnings, and symbolism are the central reasons for the author's choice of the concluding paragraph. The protagonist discovers renewed hope upon purchasing the plant, fostering a fresh determination to pass the examination she references. Observing the geese's migration, she recognizes their inherent resolve and vows to improve her performance on the test. The new flower signifies a personal renaissance, enabling her to approach this significant challenge anew. The author's description of the returning geese and the budding hibiscus employs symbolism; the flower's new growth represents Saeng's desire to commence a new chapter in her life.
560	9423	4	1	"The author of ""The Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in spring, as it signifies her having overcome a personal struggle and pledging to rectify it. This ending demonstrates how nature's beauty can facilitate problem-solving, which Saeng experiences. Witnessing the geese's migration and the ""Winter Hibiscus,"" she realizes that many things once deemed strange had become familiar through seasonal repetition. The test, initially foreign, became comprehensible through her engagement with nature. The plant also evoked memories of her past in Vietnam and positive recollections of her grandmother. This fragrance elicited joyful reflections, shifting her focus from past difficulties toward future prospects, including retaking the test and her new life."
561	9424	4	1	The author incorporates the concluding line to illustrate the cyclical nature of existence, demonstrating that although a particular phase concludes, it will inevitably recommence. The author expresses a reluctance for the conclusion, yet acknowledges an inevitable renewal, as circumstances will revert to their former state the following year. This cyclical perspective elucidates the rationale for the narrative's final statement.
562	9425	4	1	The author concludes with Saeng’s resolution, articulated as “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to convey her determination to assimilate and signify her acclimatization to change. The depiction of spring is crucial because it represents the seasonal transformations Saeng initially found peculiar but to which she eventually became accustomed. Upon recognizing the necessity of confronting change, she understood she must reattempt the examination. The author’s concluding statement was therefore essential for expressing Saeng’s acceptance of transformation in her life.
563	9426	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author employs the hibiscus to symbolize beauty discovered in unforeseen circumstances, adaptation to a new existence, and Saeng’s native land. The narrative suggests that despite her initial failure, Saeng comprehends that her situation will ultimately resolve. Observing the hibiscus evokes memories of her former life and reinforces the presence of natural splendor. This serves as a universal reminder that while disappointment is inevitable, one must persist, recognizing that life continues and further opportunities will arise, provided one can find solace and beauty in positive elements.
564	9427	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to establish a parallel between Saeng and the plant, which symbolizes her inherent resilience and capabilities. She recognizes that only upon achieving greater personal fortitude, analogous to the plant’s rejuvenation in spring, will she be prepared to reattempt the examination. Her aspirations will be revitalized, mirroring the plant's seasonal resurgence, which justifies the author's decision to conclude the narrative in this manner.
565	9428	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to create cohesion by referencing prior events, such as the phrase ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" which recalls the story's commencement when the plant evoked memories of Saeng's homeland. This technique provides an effective conclusion. Furthermore, the summary mentions her initial failure of the driving test, while the final paragraph states, ""then I will take that test again,"" indicating that Saeng's previous lack of confidence, born from unfamiliar surroundings, has been replaced by familiarity and a newfound passion, fostering a belief in her future success as she seeks a fresh start and redemption."
566	9429	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because she has surmounted her challenges and desires to retake the examination for her own benefit, proving her capability solely to herself. She articulates, “when they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This declaration confirms her intention to retake the test, demonstrating that she is not externally coerced but is internally motivated to validate her own abilities for herself alone.
567	9430	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named Saeng reminisces about her former life prior to relocating to an unfamiliar location. She longs for her homeland and the cherished elements of her past. The author incorporates a concluding paragraph wherein Saeng vows to retake her driving examination upon winter’s conclusion, coinciding with the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding. This concluding segment serves a singular purpose: to illustrate that Saeng possesses the resilience to endure the winter, akin to the hibiscus, and will be prepared when the arduous winter concludes and the splendor of spring arrives. Saeng’s mother observes, “…it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months…. That’s what matters.” The winter hibiscus functions as a direct parallel to Saeng, symbolizing that she, too, possesses sufficient fortitude to survive the winter season.
568	9431	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to cultivate a sense of anticipation within the reader. When concluding a chapter or an episode, employing a cliffhanger is a conventional technique to maintain audience engagement. This device is utilized across numerous literary works. For instance, in a particular book series, the narrative consistently concludes with a suspenseful moment. At the end of the third volume, a soldier is killed, yet the perpetrator's identity remains undisclosed until the subsequent installment, thereby compelling continued readership.
569	9432	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to convey the girl's determination to persist in her efforts to assimilate within the new country. This conclusion signifies that her journey is not concluded; despite her initial failure on the test, subsequent attempts will yield success. The author indicates that the girl values the examination and wishes to demonstrate her capability to pass it. The flowers serve as a poignant reminder of her homeland, and with this connection, she feels empowered to retake the test and perform correctly.
570	9434	4	1	The author likely included that detail within the paragraph because Saeng disliked the cold, prompting her to postpone her actions until the snow melted and the geese returned, which would signal the appropriate time to re-evaluate the plants. Furthermore, its inclusion suggests that she intended to return for a future visit with her mother, reinforcing the theme of seasonal cycles and familial connection.
571	9435	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to underscore Saeng's failure on the examination and her intention to retake it in the spring.
572	9436	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it provides closure for both Saeng and the story. Saeng was distressed about failing her examination; however, she ultimately recognizes that unforeseen events occur, and while one may lack control over circumstances, one must nevertheless recover from adversity. Upon observing the geese and the hibiscus, she comprehends that all entities must continually adapt to novel situations. Saeng likely failed her driving examination due to differing conventions in Vietnam, necessitating her adaptation to local driving regulations and laws. This rationale explains the author's concluding approach.
573	9437	4	1	Saeng undertook an examination which she did not successfully pass. She was apprehensive about informing her mother, yet felt compelled to do so. Her mother expressed disappointment regarding the outcome. Saeng understands that once winter concludes, she will undertake the identical examination again, with the aspiration of achieving success on this subsequent attempt.
574	9438	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author incorporates the phrase, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” to conclude with Saeng cultivating an optimistic perspective toward her new home and future, anticipating it positively. Throughout the narrative, Saeng exhibits a melancholic disposition regarding her new environment, where the flora evokes memories of her former home. “I mean it’s not the kind we at-at—” she discovered she remained too distraught to utter the words ‘at home,’ before she burst into tears once more. This excerpt demonstrates Saeng’s profound homesickness and sorrow. The final phrase signifies that she discovered the fortitude to regard her new home’s future with optimism.
575	9439	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because, initially, Saeng undertook a driving examination which she did not pass; subsequently, she procured a hibiscus that evokes memories of her homeland, providing her with fortitude and solace. Her mother articulates this sentiment ultimately because she recognizes Saeng is struggling to adapt to her new country and wishes to avoid exacerbating the pressure, understanding Saeng is deeply distressed. She attempts to console her by purchasing a flower, suggesting that by the subsequent spring she should be acclimated and prepared for the examination, as the blossom should instill hope, demonstrating her maternal support.
576	9440	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” likely concludes the narrative with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in spring for several reasons. Primarily, it demonstrates her resilient refusal to surrender. Secondly, it evokes a profound sense of anticipation for future possibilities. Finally, it introduces an element of uncertainty, leaving the reader to ponder her eventual success. These factors collectively justify the author’s chosen denouement.
577	9441	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with the paragraph to illustrate the symbolic connection between the hibiscus and Saeng. The plant must endure the winter to ultimately bloom in spring, becoming large and beautiful. Saeng identifies with the flower, reasoning that she can overcome her own obstacles—the challenges of a new environment—if the hibiscus can tolerate confinement within a plastic container and survive the harsh weather. She perceives her current state as analogous to the plant; she feels trapped and alienated, requiring adjustment. Just as the container is foreign to the hibiscus, which is accustomed to freedom, so too is her new surroundings to her. However, once planted, the hibiscus will integrate into its environment and flourish. Similarly, once Saeng accepts change and commits to beginning anew, she will develop, thereby facilitating her success on the driving test. This symbolic parallel constitutes the author's rationale for the concluding sentence."
578	9442	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the protagonist Saeng resolving to retake the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” The hibiscus and the driver’s test are metaphorically linked to a flower's blooming cycle; an initial wilting can precede a subsequent blossoming. The author employs this to signify that Saeng wilted initially but will blossom come spring, symbolizing her continual development. This thematic intention is foreshadowed when Saeng is disheartened by her test failure. Yet, upon encountering a flower from her homeland, her spirits are bolstered, and she weeps, demonstrating her emotional blossoming as her mood shifts from negative to positive. This cycle of wilting and blossoming recurs when she informs her mother of the result. Initially nervous and fearful, she shreds a leaf, but her mother calmly wipes the matter away and instructs her to plant it. This action provides a moral boost, illustrating her resurgence, as she anticipated reprimand but instead received acceptance. Saeng repeatedly falters yet consistently rises above adversity, cultivating the determination to achieve her goal. Her resolve to pass in spring mirrors the hibiscus in its budding stage; both are poised to blossom.
579	9443	4	1	The author likely includes the paragraph to imbue the conclusion with greater thematic depth. The author elaborates on Saeng’s life through her silent vow to retake the test in spring, as the snow melts and geese return, coinciding with the hibiscus budding. This signifies that when nature rejuvenates and spring arrives, she will attempt the test again, determined to succeed.
580	9444	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative thusly to demonstrate Saeng's fortitude in recommitting to a task at which she initially failed. She regarded the plant as both a memento and a marker of temporal passage. Saeng planted it as a tangible reminder of her homeland and her personal pledge. Her observation, “It’s not a real one… Not like the kind we had before,” reveals her nostalgia for home, yet her new promise ultimately held greater significance for her future.
581	9445	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify the commencement of an entirely new temporal phase. This signifies that she will undertake the examination on an incipient day. For instance, the geese return during the spring, the hibiscus buds emerge, and her test is scheduled for spring, thereby initiating the rationale for the author's concluding paragraph.
582	9446	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the protagonist intends to undertake the driving examination during the spring season. Spring functions as a symbol of optimism, as she derives affirmative sentiments from the blossoming of the winter hibiscus.
583	9447	4	1	They were compelled to return, and thus they did, proceeding into a world within the corner, a realm of childhood that felt precisely as she had anticipated it would.
584	9448	4	1	This concluding paragraph is composed for several purposes. Primarily, she will attempt the endeavor again when she perceives the moment is opportune. Similar to the geese's return, Saeng will return to undertake the test, just as the hibiscus plant will blossom anew. She believes it is the correct course of action and the appropriate time to return for the examination. This passage effectively characterizes Saeng's approach to life and her intention to retry when conditions feel suitable.
585	9449	4	1	The author concludes to illustrate Saeng's profound determination to pass the examination. The description of her tear-stained cheeks and puffy eyes reveals the test's significant emotional impact. Her distress stemmed from failing the test, an outcome she deeply regretted, manifesting her sorrow. Her declaration to retake the test demonstrates her resolve to succeed despite the failure, which wounded her considerably. She eagerly anticipates another attempt, driven by an unwavering determination to ultimately achieve success, underscoring that perseverance is essential for accomplishment.
586	9450	4	1	"The author employs this paragraph to conclude the narrative, thereby illustrating Saeng's resolve and her acclimatization to her new environment. This demonstrates her determination through the declaration, ""I will take that test again."" It further signifies her successful adaptation to her new home."
587	9451	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey the protagonist's distress regarding her relocation and her subsequent failure of the driver's examination. By planting the flower and resolving to retake the test in the spring, she demonstrates a commitment to persevere despite her initial disappointments.
588	9452	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph depicting Saeng's vow to retake the examination in the spring. Ho utilizes this paragraph to convey the theme of perseverance despite initial failure. For instance, although Saeng failed her driving test, her discovery of the hibiscus prompted a deeper reflection, leading to her resolution not to surrender."
589	9453	4	1	The author concludes with this sentence for emphasis, redirecting Saeng's focus from the flower to her examination. By postponing the test until spring, she acquires a future objective to anticipate. This assertion further underscores the principle of unwavering persistence in one's endeavors. The narrative concludes positively with this explanation, providing a distinct break from prior events and culminating in Saeng's final, resolute thoughts.
590	9454	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph, it seems, to suggest that the hibiscus's regeneration symbolizes her return to her initial pursuit. This interpretation is supported by her statement, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""
591	9455	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a definitive paragraph to ensure readers engage with the complete text rather than surmising its trajectory.
592	9456	4	1	The author’s concluding message elucidates that, following considerable collaboration and diligent effort, one should perpetuate that momentum annually despite potential alterations in circumstances.
593	9457	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to evoke a sentiment of hope. Saeng endured a difficult period, from failing the examination to experiencing profound loss; however, upon discovering and planting the hibiscus, she attained a state of enlightenment. While she continues to yearn for her homeland, the memories provide solace. She demonstrates resolve by declaring her intention to retake the test, exhibiting greater self-assurance. The author notes Saeng will retake the test in the spring, a season archetypally representing new beginnings and life. As the hibiscus buds, symbolizing rebirth, she will undertake the examination, marking a fresh, more promising commencement for her.
594	9458	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey determination. It illustrates Saeng's desire to allow herself time to acclimate to her new existence and environment. She subsequently considers that this location may eventually evoke a sense of home. She believes that, after a period of adjustment to this unfamiliar setting, her prospects of passing the examination will improve, demonstrating her resolute commitment to succeed.
595	9459	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng’s internal monologue constitutes a pledge to persist in obtaining her license, and the hibiscus evokes a feeling of being home again. In the text, the mother observes, ""@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thats what matters."" This statement mitigates Saeng’s sorrow, as she recognizes the hibiscus will serve as a reminder of those from her homeland, thereby instilling the fortitude to endeavor again in the spring."
596	9460	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng’s silent vow to retake the examination in spring, symbolizing her profound persistence. This persistence is evident in her repeated attempts to pass the assessment and her arduous adaptation to a new nation. The quotation explicitly demonstrates Saeng’s capacity to endure failure and summon the determination to endeavor once more. Furthermore, her relocation across continents represents a monumental transition, and her sustained self-assurance throughout this process underscores her resilient character. Ultimately, the author’s decision to conclude with this resonant declaration definitively portrays the protagonist as tenacious, which is the fundamental purpose of the excerpt.
597	9461	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this particular paragraph to provoke reader contemplation regarding the preceding events and to cultivate a desire for further engagement. For instance, a book concluding with an unresolved question can generate compelling curiosity about potential answers. Similarly, another story might conclude with a definitive statement, yet if a sequel is unavailable, the reader is left contemplating the unresolved narrative. Authors deliberately employ such conclusions to foster anticipation and encourage continued readership of subsequent works.
598	9462	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph for several deliberate reasons. It aims to convey a sense of hope, illustrate the protagonist's development, and signify impending change. Her vow to retake the test fosters an assurance that circumstances will improve. Previously, the tone was somber and distressed, characterized by her tears and longing for her homeland. This final passage, however, establishes a hopeful tone, as her decision to persevere despite failure highlights her enhanced determination. Furthermore, the paragraph demonstrates significant character growth, revealing her strengthened resolve. Lastly, the imagery of returning geese, melting snow, and budding hibiscus foreshadows future developments; this seasonal shift metaphorically represents the internal transformation she has undergone and portends that her circumstances will henceforth be altered.
599	9463	4	1	The author concluded the story with that message to compel deeper reflection from the reader. Without it, the narrative would feel complete yet would lack an opening for a potential continuation. It is evident that the story's fundamental objective is to engage the audience's intellect and provoke thoughtful consideration regarding its themes and implications.
600	9464	4	1	The author included this paragraph because it signifies a new beginning for the protagonist. Although she has endured significant hardship, this does not preclude the possibility of future challenges, yet it marks a pivotal moment of renewal and resolve for her character development.
601	9465	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph because it held profound significance for Saeng. Having failed her driving examination, she dreaded informing her mother that she had also expended nineteen dollars on a ‘Dok Faeng-noi,’ a plant reminiscent of their homeland. For instance, “As Saeng walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant.” This particular plant carried deep sentimental value for her mother. “@PERSON1 uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. ‘Dok faeng-nor,’ she said. ‘Where did you get it.’” This quotation illustrates her mother's exhilarated reaction. The story culminates with that paragraph because, despite Saeng's tribulations, her mother ultimately expressed appreciation for the purchase. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.”
602	9466	4	1	"Authors occasionally employ intriguing sentences as their concluding statements, which can initially prove challenging to decipher. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes by stating, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author utilizes this to demonstrate that Saeng is not yet prepared to graduate and requires further learning. The mother is profoundly disappointed in her daughter for purchasing an excessively expensive plant, revealing her inexperience and the fallacy of acquiring items based on sentiment. This is evidenced by the exchange, “I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” “You what?” Furthermore, she states, “@CAPS1 facing. Now where did you get that,"" conveying her astonishment at the costly, beautiful plant. Authors use such paragraphs and sentences to illustrate or recapitulate the narrative's themes. The author of “Winter Hibiscus” @CAPS2 her story with this paragraph to underscore that Saeng should not have purchased the plant based purely on emotion and that she must endeavor to succeed the following year."
603	9467	4	1	The author of the passage concludes the narrative with these statements to generate intrigue. This curiosity is cultivated through allusions to the spring and the geese's return. Spring signifies a genesis for many earthly creatures; consequently, Saeng endeavors to recommence, as she must await the spring. The hibiscus reinforces this sentiment of a new beginning, as each year new buds emerge, paralleling her opportunity for a second chance. Saeng awaits the spring because she recognizes it as the period when all other entities generate new life; therefore, she must wait until then to secure her own new beginning.
604	9468	4	1	The author likely concluded the narrative with that paragraph because it signifies the period when the protagonist believes she will be prepared to retake her driver’s examination. Prior to this resolution, she felt disheartened by her initial failure. Perhaps she selected the spring season because it affords her the necessary interval to compose herself and practice extensively before that time arrives.
605	9469	4	1	The author incorporates the sentence, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to convey her resolute determination. She is steadfastly committed to passing the examination. Despite confronting challenges while adapting to @LOCATION1, she possesses a profound desire to succeed there. Therefore, she will postpone her attempt for a year and endeavor again once she is more thoroughly prepared.
606	9470	4	1	"This narrative concerns a girl who has recently relocated from Vietnam to the United @ORGANIZATION1. She will struggle to comprehend her new environment, and any detail may trigger recollections of Vietnam. The author concludes with this paragraph because Saeng indeed failed her examination and wishes to observe the budding hibiscus. ""I-I failed the test,"" Saeng confessed to her mother, who comprehended the reason and permitted her to keep the plant for its comforting effect. Saeng profoundly misses Vietnam and is resolved to diligently overcome her challenges."
607	9471	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to enhance clarity for the reader's comprehension and to render the narrative more distinctive and impactful.
608	9472	4	1	"The author concluded the narrative with that paragraph because it conveys that, over time, as she adapts to her new circumstances, she will be prepared to retake the examination. This is why she states, ""...and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" signifying that all it requires is time—time to grow warm and to develop. Furthermore, the paragraph is meticulously constructed and thematically connected to the entire story, providing a fitting and meaningful conclusion."
609	9473	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with the paragraph because the flower symbolizes the happiness and comfort of her homeland. The hibiscus represents her past; as Saeng began to plant it, ""she could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now,"" indicating the return of her senses and her ensuing contentment. Similarly, the geese illustrate Saeng's growing comfort as her new country began to feel familiar. Numerous references to home are made throughout the piece, as it is a place of solace and joy, which explains why @CAPS1 Ho concluded with that sentence to signify Saeng's burgeoning confidence."
610	9474	4	1	"I believe the author concludes the story with the paragraph containing the vow, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the @CAPS1 melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to convey a profound message akin to a philosophy of life: that failure is acceptable, and one should simply endeavor to try again and improve."
611	9475	4	1	"She concludes that paragraph with the anecdote because she genuinely desires the audience to comprehend that she is, and perpetually remains, engaged in enjoyment. Furthermore, she adores her current position. She is establishing herself in the world, and she cherishes observing flowers, ""geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" which demonstrates that her preferred activity, which she loves, involves flowers."
612	9476	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative in this manner to reiterate the story's significant elements. ""I will take that test again,"" refers to the examination she previously failed. This test evaluated her recollection of her homeland, which was profoundly important to her. The segment within the quote, ""when they come back.... when they show me it and the geese return,"" alludes to her statement, ""She realized that many of the things she had previously considered strange had become... almost familiar to her. Like the geese."" She indicates that everything in this country is becoming accustomed to her, similar to the geese migrating south each winter. When she employs ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" she signifies how she will recall all that she forgot upon moving to this nation. Upon reaching the hibiscus, she extended her hand and gently touched a petal. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—precisely as she had anticipated. This entire statement essentially conveys that she is beginning to forget aspects of her native country as this one grows more familiar, but when the geese return, meaning in the spring, she will remember again and will retake that test of her knowledge and succeed."
613	9477	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the message that the plant symbolizes new beginnings, which represents Saeng's vow. Furthermore, within the narrative, tending to the plant instructs Saeng in responsibility; by caring for the plant she will learn patience, and that she must learn from errors previously committed.
614	9478	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it demonstrates her unwillingness to relinquish her new life. ""I-I failed the test,"" Saeng had failed her driver's test and was deeply disheartened. She also held a strong aversion toward her new home. ""She was still too shaky to stay at home,"" indicates she missed her former home and genuinely contemplated surrender. However, after conversing with her mother, her hopes were revitalized; thus, the author utilizes this paragraph to signify that she ultimately retains hope and, upon readiness, will endeavor once more. ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again."""
615	9479	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to establish tone. The paragraph illustrates Saeng's determination to attempt again and succeed. This imparts a lesson to the reader about striving to one's utmost and persevering. The final paragraph ends the narrative with a sense of curiosity, compelling one to wonder if she ultimately passes.
616	9480	4	1	I posit that the concluding paragraph signifies that after all other significant events have transpired and her intended destiny is fulfilled, she will undertake the examination because it constitutes the final requisite occurrence, and I am convinced she will succeed as it is her predetermined fate.
617	9481	4	1	I believe Saeng formulated that silent vow because the plant endures the harsh winter, and once conditions revert to her preference and the plant commences budding anew, it symbolizes her own difficulties with relocation; therefore, if this cherished plant can persevere through adversity, she possesses the capacity to do so as well.
618	9482	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the excerpt to emphasize Saeng's anguish in arriving at an unfamiliar location and failing her initial examination, while also underscoring her determination to persevere after encountering a flower reminiscent of her homeland. The flower holds profound significance for Saeng; for instance, the text states it was ""yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers."" This demonstrates Saeng's affection for her native country through a botanical specimen she recognizes. Another instance occurs when Saeng relayed the unfortunate news to her mother; her attention was immediately drawn to the flower, and her mother could only offer comfort. In conclusion, the hibiscus serves as Saeng's source of fortitude, being a familiar entity in the United States, and she aspires to demonstrate the same resilience on her test that the flower exhibits during the severe winter."
619	9483	4	1	The author concludes the story with the aforementioned paragraph to illustrate the correlation between the hibiscus's budding and the resurgence of Saeng's resolve. In the photograph, the hibiscus appears out of place, seemingly not belonging, analogous to Saeng's own situation. The hibiscus symbolized a connection to Saeng's past, as depicted when the author notes that plants she had forgotten drew her back into her childhood. Native to her homeland, the hibiscus assisted Saeng in recollecting her past, thereby enabling her to manage the present and subsequently the future, as she vowed to retake the test upon its return in spring.
620	9484	4	1	Through this quotation, the author conveys that Saeng will ultimately prepare herself for the examination. The returning geese signify their readiness following migration, and the budding hibiscus indicates its preparedness to blossom. Saeng maintains that in the spring, once the flower and the geese have achieved readiness, she too will attain the necessary state of preparation.
621	9485	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate the narrator's newfound willingness to accept and adapt to her new environment, akin to a flower's natural acclimatization. Geese, which favor warmth over cold, migrate south for the winter. Saeng's comfort zone resides in @LOCATION1, where she holds numerous childhood memories involving her grandmother and the hibiscus. She is accustomed to the flower thriving in a warm climate. Consequently, when the geese return in the spring and the flower blossoms anew, she will be prepared to further adapt to @CAPS1 life and retake her driver's examination. The geese and the hibiscus function as symbolic recollections of her former home in @LOCATION1, for which she feels profound nostalgia, and after these elements reappear, she will endeavor to assimilate into @CAPS1's way of life.
622	9486	4	1	Saeng would ultimately return to her native land.
623	9487	4	1	"In the passage ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author employs this phrase in the final paragraph: ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus buds, I will take that test again."" The narrative concludes with these words to signify her transformation, as she implies that when the birds migrate, even they return with the seasons. An illustration of this is her observation of the birds alighting upon the hibiscus, mingling with it, which prompts her reflection on persevering into the next season and pursuing her aspirations. This is the interpretation derived from the story's concluding paragraph."
624	9488	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate that, upon the arrival of spring and the budding of the geese, Saeng made a silent vow to herself to retake her driving permit examination.
625	9489	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination to persevere and find contentment in her new home. Although dissatisfied with her purchase, she attempts to cultivate a more familiar ambiance. Her statement, ""will take that test again,"" reveals her desire for a comfortable environment. This conclusion also underscores the resilience inherent in seasonal cycles, suggesting Saeng will recommence and persevere with her life. She is presently satisfied but intends to endeavor anew for her and her mother's happiness in the spring. This passage further functions as a pledge to explore a novel lifestyle and establish friendships. The plant symbolizes her impending transformation; she will endeavor to succeed in her own test, thereby validating her right to happiness and a sense of belonging."
626	9490	4	1	The author concluded this narrative segment to illustrate the presence of geese inhabiting the garden during the spring season.
627	9491	4	1	The author elucidates the profound difficulty inherent in certain life changes. Furthermore, the author articulates how familial bonds and domestic objects, such as a flower, can provide significant solace. The narrative's purpose is to convey a formative personal experience from the author's life.
628	9492	4	1	The author concludes this passage to convey that the girl's endeavors were not concluded and that she remained resolute in her horticultural pursuits. Following the spring thaw, she intended to plant additional flowers to observe their performance, despite their prior lack of success during winter. This outcome did not deter her; the author's central argument is that perseverance in the face of failure can yield different results.
629	9493	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the protagonist resolving, ""When they come back I will take that test again."" This demonstrates her enduring hope and refusal to surrender. Having endured considerable hardship after her move, accompanied by a palpable sense of despondency, she ultimately regains the fortitude to persevere. Her emotional release within the greenhouse underscores her distress, triggered by the plant's connection to her homeland. Ultimately, concluding the passage with this affirmative resolve constitutes a profoundly astute narrative decision."
630	9494	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several significant reasons. Primarily, it establishes the certainty that Saeng will persist in her efforts. Moreover, it demonstrates how a simple flower can inspire continued perseverance, even amidst profound discouragement. Saeng attributes such importance to the flower that it motivates her to strive toward her utmost potential. The author selects this sentence for its powerful resonance, which effectively instills courage within the protagonist.
631	9495	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner because she had previously failed the examination and aspired to succeed subsequently, thereby avoiding her mother's disappointment.
632	9496	4	1	I interpret the narrator's statement to mean she desires to return once the landscape is beautiful again. She intends to await the snow's complete thaw and the geese's reappearance so she can observe the flowers' full spectrum of colors; furthermore, should she pass her examination on this attempt, she will then drive past all the blossoms. This is my interpretation of the character's intended meaning within the story.
633	9497	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it illustrates Saeng's perseverance, mirroring the resilience of the hibiscus. Earlier passages describe how the winter hibiscus endures. Within the paragraph, the phrase ""the snows melt"" signifies the perpetual cycle of the seasons, a cycle Saeng should emulate by continuing her efforts. Similarly, the mention of ""the geese return"" symbolizes their reliable recurrence, a pattern Saeng should follow by persistently attempting to pass her examination."
634	9498	4	1	"I believe the author employed these lines in the final paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again,"" because he found the symbolism profoundly effective."
635	9499	4	1	I believe the author concludes with that paragraph to imbue the story with greater significance. The author likely intended to provide enhanced detail and a deeper thematic resonance for the narrative.
636	9500	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate her intent to commence anew by retaking the examination, analogous to the hibiscus initiating its renewal by budding. Saeng demonstrates her resolve to surmount forthcoming adversities, mirroring the perseverance of the hibiscus and the geese through winter. Within the story, the author employs the hibiscus to symbolize adaptation to life’s transformations. In essence, the winter hibiscus epitomizes Saeng herself, as the flower acclimates to its circumstances, namely the harsh season. Similarly, Saeng must conquer the challenges of residing in a foreign nation and successfully retaking her driver’s examination.
637	9501	4	1	The author selects the vow, “When they come back, Saeng pledged inwardly, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” as the story’s concluding paragraph. This inclusion serves to convey Saeng’s dedication to acclimating to her new environment while relinquishing her former life. For instance, earlier in the narrative, Saeng could not utter, “I mean, not like the kind we had at home,” without weeping, which exemplifies her profound sorrow and initial inability to release her past.
638	9502	4	1	The author likely elected to conclude the narrative with this paragraph for several reasons. Presumably, the intention was to demonstrate Saeng’s commitment to adapting to her new circumstances, thereby refuting any notion of failure or resignation. Furthermore, the conclusion underscores Saeng’s determination to achieve success and to fulfill her mother’s aspirations. These thematic concerns elucidate the author’s rationale for selecting this particular paragraph as the story’s denouement.
639	9503	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus provides Saeng with a faint glimmer of hope. The plant evokes nostalgic memories of her native Vietnam, which brings her solace. Moreover, the purchased hibiscus’s capacity to endure winter, unlike the varieties from her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s resolute determination to adapt to her new country. The future prospects of the hibiscus metaphorically represent Saeng’s own survival and acclimatization, a process that will encompass her retaking the driving examination.
640	9504	4	1	The author concludes her narrative with this declaration for multiple reasons. Primarily, just as the hibiscus will regain its strength when the harsh winds subside, so too will Saeng find renewed fortitude. Additionally, Saeng is allowing herself a period to adjust and become accustomed to her new surroundings, thereby establishing a tangible objective. She identifies profoundly with the flower, which provides her solace and evokes cherished memories of her homeland and her grandmother, elements central to her former happiness.
641	9505	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination. The protagonist perceives the hibiscus, experiencing elation upon encountering the plant; however, the memory of adorning her grandmother’s hair resurfaces. She regards this as a personal trial, endeavoring to progress beyond her past. Upon returning home, she laments, ""I failed the test,"" revealing her aspiration to advance has proven more challenging than anticipated. Therefore, the hibiscus symbolizes vitality within this paragraph, signifying Saeng's endeavor to evolve and her nascent resilience."
642	9506	4	1	Within the narrative, Saeng experiences sorrow due to longing for her homeland and the hibiscus blossom. She concludes the story favorably by attaining a state of internal serenity, resolved to retake the examination. This conclusion prevents her from remaining anxious or embittered, transforming a negative disposition into a positive resolve as she declares her intention to retry when the geese return and the hibiscus buds.
643	9507	4	1	"The author concludes with this sentence to demonstrate Saeng's intention to adapt to her new environment. He conveys that Saeng will cease grieving and instead persevere with her life. The author incorporates the line, ""I mean, not like the kind we had—"" which occurs after Saeng returns home, converses with her mother, and feels despondent from reminiscing. However, the final statement signifies her decision to advance beyond sorrow, having established the objective of acceptance, thus justifying the author's chosen conclusion."
644	9508	4	1	"Authors frequently conclude their stories diversely, yet Minfong Ho terminated hers with a quasi-proverbial statement. One rationale for this conclusion is the subtle revelation of Saeng's future, as the ending declares, ""I will take that test again,"" intimating a potential sequel concerning her re-examination. A secondary illustration demonstrates Saeng's strength and beauty alongside her resolve to persevere, evidenced by the author's phrase, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" wherein the hibiscus metaphorically represents Saeng. Absent such literary techniques and implications, the possibility of a sequel and its potential events would remain ambiguous."
645	9509	4	1	The author likely incorporated this element to illustrate transformation. For all actions undertaken, we reciprocate and replenish, as the author suggests. Individuals often overlook minor damages, which necessitate reconciliation with significant alterations; these subtle shifts constitute the pivotal moments. Furthermore, past influences propel us forward. Everyone endures severe trials, both major and minor, yet we must surmount them collectively.
646	9510	4	1	This paragraph holds significant importance for the narrator to incorporate. For example, Saeng asserts that her new residence and its flora hold greater significance than her academic pursuits and an examination. Furthermore, while she possesses few companions to visit at school, her hibiscus will evoke memories of all her former acquaintances. Saeng is essentially resolving that once circumstances normalize or align with her desires, she will undertake the examination again. Ultimately, the narrator employed this paragraph to convey Saeng's emotional state.
647	9511	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it provides a resolution, thereby completing the story. It illustrates the connection between nature, adaptation, and how this combination pacified her following her examination failure.
648	9512	4	1	The author concludes this narrative with a sentence of this nature because, at winter's conclusion into spring, the snow dissipates and the trees and flowers blossom into various hues. Subsequent to the flowers' blossoming, the foliage emerges and the pollen locates the appropriate tree species. At the termination of summer into autumn, the leaves commence to perish and alter color, subsequently detaching. Then the snowfall recommences.
649	9513	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” because it demonstrates Saeng's resilience. It illustrates that the hibiscus will endure the winter, as Saeng’s mother observes, “'…but it's strong enough to survive the cold months here, This winter hibiscus that’s what matters.” This symbolizes Saeng overcoming not merely her driver's test failure, but also her relocation. She is not identical to her former self from home, yet she possesses sufficient fortitude to endure this life alteration. Moreover, taking the examination in spring symbolizes a new beginning, when everything is renewed, and she has surmounted her personal winter. This concluding paragraph is crucial because it reveals Saeng’s personal commitment to transcend her present challenges and the future that awaits. When Saeng states “…When the snows melt…” it symbolizes the period in her life when her failures will be redeemed. She will undertake the test with a transformed perspective on her existence. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to affirm Saeng's determination to persevere.
650	9514	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph: “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Minpong Ho did so because Saeng failed the test. Saeng had failed to locate the fine-toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apparently, these elements could be rediscovered after the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds.
651	9515	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s perspective on the future. It constitutes an apt denouement, deriving from numerous story elements and demonstrating Saeng’s personal growth. Saeng alludes to “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” a phrase conveying her burgeoning acceptance and even affection for her new homeland. The geese, once perceived as strange, are now “familiar to Saeng.” The hibiscus symbolizes her past, adapted to her present circumstances. Saeng’s vow to “take that test again” in spring reveals her determination to thrive despite profound losses—her home, grandmother, and former life. She intends to pass her driving test, irrespective of challenges. This concluding paragraph suitably resolves the story, intertwining the threads of Saeng’s past and present while exhibiting her forward-looking attitude. Its optimistic language nearly reconciles a mood of hope with lingering regret, a testament to the author’s skillful composition.
652	9516	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey the extent of Saeng’s adaptation to life’s transformations. The declaration, “I will take that test again,” signifies her resilient resolve. Furthermore, the allusion to “when they come back” suggests that with the flowers’ return next season, she will reflect upon her memories of her homeland, her grandmother, and the positive experiences from her past, thereby completing her emotional journey.
653	9517	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s lack of enthusiasm for the changing season, indicated by the snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. Additionally, this conclusion functions to imply the potential for a subsequent narrative, suggesting to the reader that Saeng’s story may continue to unfold in a future installment, thereby providing a sense of ongoing possibility.
654	9518	4	1	Her acquired botanical knowledge leads the narrator to portray the protagonist as fascinated by the new world and its distinct, beautifully blooming flora. From this perspective, the girl exhibits a genuine appreciation for plants and their characteristics, suggesting she possesses an adventurous spirit inclined toward exploring unfamiliar realms and discovering phenomena awaiting explanation and understanding.
655	9519	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s capacity to overcome her limitations and achieve success in her new environment. Her statement, “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” signifies her intention to reattempt the driving examination, embracing her new circumstances and the potential benefits she can derive from the experience, thereby affirming her resilience.
656	9520	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several reasons. Primarily, it illustrates Saeng's resolute character. By pledging to retake the examination, she demonstrates profound determination and a refusal to capitulate. Another rationale is that the author sought to underscore the significance of Saeng's personal resolve and intrinsic personality.
657	9521	4	1	Minfong Ho concluded the narrative with this passage to highlight Saeng's resolve to ultimately pass the driving examination. Her initial failure provoked considerable distress and evoked profound homesickness, much like the familiar plant; however, in this final reflection, she vows to surmount the challenges of her unfamiliar environment and consolidate her fortitude to achieve her objective, paralleling the winter hibiscus's own perseverance.
658	9522	4	1	The author incorporated this sentence within the paragraph to convey that Saeng possessed an exceptionally determined disposition. She would persist relentlessly until she succeeded, irrespective of the duration or difficulty involved. This is analogous to the hibiscus flower discovered beside the highway, which appeared distinctly out of place yet would tenaciously strive to survive. Maintaining resilience during periods of sole self-reliance is arduous, yet Saeng's resolve is fortified by her recent setback and the symbolic perfection of the hibiscus.
659	9523	4	1	In the concluding statement, Saeng declares, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the narrative with this passage to employ the hibiscus as a metaphor for survival. Originating from another locale like herself, she utilizes it to symbolize her own well-being within the new environment. Essentially, she asserts that if the hibiscus endures the winter, she will as well, a conclusion which effectively depicts her initially uncertain nature towards her new home.
660	9524	4	1	The author likely selected this as the final paragraph because it conveys Saeng's aspiration to overcome adversity and cultivate strength despite her profound homesickness. For instance, Saeng interpreted her emotional reaction to the hibiscus plant as a failure, yet she maintains a belief in her capacity to grow more resilient with the passage of time, thereby concluding her character's arc on a note of prospective fortitude.
661	9525	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this particular paragraph to encapsulate the realization and determination Saeng attains. Initially, Saeng is distraught following her failed examination. Upon encountering the flower and subsequently locating it at a shop, she is profoundly affected by this modest memento of her former home. That diminutive blossom prompted her recognition of the profound longing for her past life, rendering its purchase an imperative. She likely perceived that possessing the flower would perpetually connect her to a fragment of her homeland within her new environment. After comprehending the significance of memories and observing the flower's tenacity in surviving a frigid season, she cultivates the resolve to retake the examination. She pledges to do so, having derived conviction from the flower's endurance and her own epiphany regarding cherished recollections. Ultimately, that concluding paragraph discloses these specific themes.
662	9526	4	1	The author's inspiration originated from the flower, which possessed a remarkable capacity to endure severe winters and adapt to unfamiliar environments. She resolves that she will surmount her own obstacles, just as the flower prevails over its challenges each winter.
663	9527	4	1	Memory, promise, and life are concepts that elucidate the author's rationale for concluding the narrative with this paragraph. Memory is one such concept, as Saeng profoundly misses her former life and homeland. Promise is another, for Saeng makes a vow to retake the examination upon the return of spring. Life is a further concept, since Saeng purchased and planted the flower so it may flourish again in spring, coinciding with her intention to retake the test. Memory, promise, and life collectively clarify the author's conclusion; memories will resurge in spring alongside the promises she has made and the new beginning she desires, which Saeng initiates by planting the hibiscus, a potent evoker of her past experiences.
664	9528	4	1	The author concludes the story with that statement because the temperature had declined, precipitating the demise of all the plants and flowers.
665	9529	4	1	Reasons for the author's concluding statement are evident. The author likely concludes thus because she was intensely determined to pass the examination. She pledged to herself that she would retake the test upon the geese's return and the snow's melting. Another reason is her initial failure, which constituted a significant event for her, fueling her profound eagerness to succeed. These factors explain the author's inclusion of this element in the story.
666	9530	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng fails her driving examination; while walking home, she discovers a flower evoking memories of her former homeland. She purchases the blossom and returns to her new residence, where her mother is gardening. They resolve to plant the flower, and upon its placement, a flock of geese traverses the sky. Saeng then comprehends that her surroundings, once entirely foreign, have become familiar. She concludes by resolving to retake the examination upon the geese's spring return. She observes that the hibiscus will be budding, signifying its bloom, and by that time she will have acclimated and matured, thus preparing her for the test as the geese return and the flower blossoms."
667	9531	4	1	The author employs this device to establish a parallel with the plant. This comparison is drawn because the plant's blossoming coincides with the restoration of the character's self-assurance. The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to imbue the story with significance and a resonant conclusion.
668	9532	4	1	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to accentuate its thematic resonance and enhance its engagement, thereby cultivating a desire within the reader for the narrative to continue and its outcomes to be revealed.
669	9533	4	1	I believe the author incorporated this final paragraph to demonstrate the protagonist's profound determination to pass the examination and to underscore the personal significance of this endeavor, which is the reasoning behind its inclusion in the story.
670	9534	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the connection between nature and the girl. The paragraph states, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" These events are anticipated for the spring, a season symbolizing life, birth, and renewal. The geese returning are symbolically renewed. The melting snow reveals the grass, a sign of life, and plants budding signifies their birth. The protagonist has decided that when nature is symbolically reborn and renewed, she too will begin again, in harmony with the natural world."
671	9535	4	1	He concludes the narrative with his paragraph to convey his intention to retake the examination once winter had passed, thereby illustrating how Saeng vowed to herself that she would attempt the test again in a more temperate season, since her initial failure occurred during winter and success was more probable once the ground was free of snow.
672	9536	4	1	The author incorporated that concluding paragraph to elucidate, for those who have read the preceding narrative, the protagonist's resolution to retake the test under more favorable climatic conditions than her initial attempt. Furthermore, the author appended this final paragraph to ascertain whether the reader truly comprehended the novel's core themes and the author's ultimate objective, thereby ensuring a more profound understanding of the book's denouement. These constitute the reasons for the inclusion of that concluding paragraph.
673	9537	4	1	The author sought to conclude the narrative expediently, thus crafting an ending that mirrors the story's initial segment. I particularly appreciated the segment depicting the birds' return, which coincided with the reappearance of some of their flowers.
674	9538	4	1	Saeng and her mother must possess unwavering determination to persevere and survive. Having endured considerable hardship, Saeng was profoundly disheartened by her test failure. The author concludes with this paragraph to provoke reader contemplation on the resolve required to adapt and survive in a foreign environment. Although displaced from their homeland, Saeng and her mother still find solace in Vietnamese traditions, such as cultivating familiar flowers, hot peppers, and bitter melons; her friends' distaste for these flavors does not diminish her personal enjoyment.
675	9539	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to demonstrate her persistent resolve and the eventual certainty of her passing the examination. The vow she made to herself exemplifies a determination to surmount obstacles. It also engenders a desire within the reader to discover whether she honored her pledge and ultimately succeeded. For instance, the narrative concludes with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again.”
676	9540	4	1	The author concluded the narrative in this manner because she possessed an alternative perspective of Saeng. He would perceive that with each season, her disposition would vary, and consequently, the garden would transform, ensuring Saeng's mother remained outdoors throughout the year.
677	9541	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate how a recollection can instill determination within an individual. For instance, although Saeng failed her driving examination, encountering the hibiscus evoked memories of her former residence. Simultaneously, as she plants it, she observes the geese with a newfound recognition. This confluence of experiences fortifies her resolve to retake the test, as these dual reminders of both homes reassure her of her adaptability and the value of preserving her memories.
678	9542	4	1	He was conveying that one must persevere and persist in their efforts, akin to the flora that rejuvenates during the spring season.
679	9543	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is pledging to herself to retake the examination in order to pass it. She intends to do so in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding. She needs to undertake the test and commence driving. This act of making a personal vow is often a commendable practice for individuals.
680	9544	4	1	He is alluding to Saeng's manner of living and their customary activities, as well as the climatic conditions characteristic of the region.
681	9545	4	1	The author deliberately concluded the narrative with that specific phrase to illustrate her resolve to await the subsequent year and repeat the entire process. She will anticipate its arrival, thereby demonstrating her capacity to undertake the endeavor once more, signifying her present acclimatization to residing there.
682	9546	4	1	The author concluded the narrative in this manner to signify a new commencement in the spring. Analogous to the manner in which flowers blossom and bud during that season, she will transform into a renewed and improved individual, which constitutes the rationale for the author's chosen conclusion.
683	9547	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey Saeng's determination to retake the examination and secure a new beginning. Furthermore, it demonstrates to the reader that initial failure should not deter subsequent attempts. The hibiscus appears to symbolize her own situation; she failed the test in winter and feels discontent. However, in spring, as the hibiscus develops buds, she will embark on a fresh attempt at the test, while the flower will inhabit a new environment in which to thrive.
684	9548	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with that paragraph because it invites personal interpretation and judgment. It refrains from explicitly stating the test's purpose or its outcome, leaving those elements for the reader to determine. It additionally fosters suspense regarding future events, allowing the story's conclusion to be shaped by individual perspective, which will inevitably vary among different readers.
685	9549	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it specifies when she intends to retake the test and institute changes within her evolving life. For instance, her sorrow in the narrative stems from failing the examination and desiring to return home. Should she succeed in the spring, she may endeavor to implement changes and establish her life here, which explains the author's concluding choice.
686	9550	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng is ultimately at ease within her new environment. Following a passage that is predominantly a reflection upon Saeng’s former existence, it culminates in this manner to signify her acclimation to a novel way of life. For instance, the text states, “in the spring, and the geese return…” which demonstrates her newfound familiarity with the geese and the natural world of her new home. The author also employs that concluding paragraph to convey a sense of liberation. Saeng possessed numerous memories confined to her previous life, which prevented her from embracing new experiences in her current home. The author’s utilization of this paragraph provides an effective denouement, permitting the reader to perceive the tranquil imagery of birds departing; Saeng emancipates herself from her anguish and genuinely integrates into her new world.
687	9551	4	1	This final paragraph discloses a particular significance to the reader. Saeng discovered renewed hope through her mother’s winter understanding and the hibiscus plant. She initially felt despondent, disconsolate, and inadequate upon encountering the hibiscus, which evoked memories of her homeland. However, upon returning home, observing the plant’s roots embedded in the soil instilled a fresh resolve within her. The flower functions as a representation of her own self. It adapted to endure cold climates, or in Saeng’s circumstance, arduous periods. The roots symbolize her history, and although they are submerged, they are not eradicated. The blossom itself signifies a renewed existence for Saeng in a foreign nation. The author, Minfong Ho, imbues non-living entities with personification throughout the story. This elucidates the rationale for the author's implementation of the concluding paragraph.
688	9552	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s resolute determination. It also establishes a correlation between the driver's test and the hibiscus plant. The implication is that as the surrounding environment commences its revival, she too will attain her objective. She requires the motivation derived from her milieu to propel her forward. Throughout the story, Saeng is profoundly influenced by her surroundings. For example, her experience within the greenhouse transports her back to her youth, “It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery…. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.”
689	9553	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng discovers solace in the plant subsequent to failing her examination. The plant evokes memories of her homeland and connects her with her prior experiences. Although she initially failed the test, she feels that through study and renewed effort, she can ultimately succeed. This connects to the hibiscus, for in winter the plant perishes, yet in spring it becomes beautiful and blossoms once more. Saeng perceives a correlation with the plant’s regeneration and believes she can likewise recommence and perform well on the examination. This explains the author’s inclusion of the paragraph wherein Saeng vows to retake the test when spring arrives and the hibiscus blooms."
690	9554	4	1	"The author concludes the story by stating, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concluded in this manner because Saeng is essentially affirming that the time will arrive for her to retake the test, and she will pass it through belief in her own capabilities."
691	9555	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to articulate her intention to retake the failed examination in due season, believing the hibiscus will facilitate overcoming her obstacles. I posit that she procured the plant following her initial failure, hoping its blossoming would provide a natural timetable indicating her readiness to attempt the endeavor anew.
692	9556	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as it provides a meaningful summation of the story's events. All that transpired with Saeng at the florist is ultimately distilled into a sentiment resembling vindication. Her profound sadness originated from failing the driving examination. In the final passage, she resolves to retake the test upon the hibiscus's budding. The plant she purchased will commence this process in spring, concurrent with the melting snow. This concluding segment allows Saeng to reconcile her winter nostalgia. Ultimately, the geese migrating south evoke her melancholy, yet they simultaneously ignite a resolve; she determines to retake the driving test upon their return, the budding of the hibiscus, and the thawing of the snow.
693	9557	4	1	The concluding paragraph endeavors to express imminent renewal. The conclusion of winter heralds spring's arrival, signifying the hibiscus's return and a sensation reminiscent of home. Furthermore, the geese will reappear, prompting her to retake the examination. For her, this represents a fresh commencement and a prospective success. Her affection for the hibiscus, and its subsequent resurgence, suggests her potential for significantly improved performance. Ultimately, a new era is approaching.
694	9558	4	1	"I believe the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concluded with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in spring—amidst the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus—to demonstrate the plant's significance and its role in her eventual success. It symbolizes that as the plant buds and conquers seasonal hardships, she too will overcome obstacles to pass her driving examination. For instance, the textual reference to the melting snow and returning geese parallels Saeng's struggle to pass her test with nature's struggle to survive the winter. Another quotation, describing her lifting her head to watch the geese's distinctive formation etch the sky, signifies her resolve to rise and surmount this challenge. Ultimately, this concluding vow illustrates the shared struggles of the flower, Saeng, and the geese to conquer their respective trials and complete their commenced journeys."
695	9559	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for its profound significance. The implication is that as these natural entities receive their opportunity, she too will receive hers. For instance, the geese will return, the hibiscus will attain its chance to bud, and she will secure her opportunity to retake the driving examination. This is evident when Saeng’s mother remarks on the plant’s potential in spring, stating, “But it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This indicates the mother’s assurance that her daughter will receive a subsequent chance, which justifies the story’s concluding sentence.
696	9560	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the cyclical progression of the seasons, their inherent transience, and the commencement of each new cycle. The title ""Winter Hibiscus"" is significant because winter follows spring; during spring, fragrant and beautiful flowers flourish, but once spring concludes and winter arrives, the plants perish and will never again resemble their former state."
697	9561	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng's perseverance is evident as she continually endeavors to succeed. The author concludes with a succinct paragraph of profound significance. By declaring, “...in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” Saeng demonstrates resilience, a willingness to embrace new opportunities, and a enduring connection to her homeland. This inspiring conclusion powerfully reinforces the story's central theme, conveying a substantial lesson through remarkably few words."
698	9562	4	1	The author selected the concluding paragraph for several significant reasons. Saeng declares her intention to retake the driving examination in the spring, a season which archetypally represents renewal and fresh opportunity. This archetypal conclusion suggests that Saeng will subsequently have a new chance to succeed and to optimally adapt to her life in her new location. The hibiscus plant evokes memories of her homeland, providing her with hope; the final paragraph's mention of the hibiscus signifies that it will sustain her hope for passing the test and adjusting to her new environment while cherishing her past in Vietnam.
699	9563	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the final sentence to articulate that she will attempt again once the plants commence regrowth and the geese reappear. For instance, the plants must regenerate their petals and the geese must reconstruct their nests and forage for sustenance anew. The author thereby indicates that she will retake the examination upon the return of the geese and the resurgence of the plants.
700	9564	4	1	The author composed the paragraph because she returned indoors for dinner and would not see the garden again until the following day, as winter's arrival precludes further outdoor activity until the season passes. As she stated, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quotation elucidates the rationale for the story's concluding paragraph.
701	9565	4	1	The narrator concludes with this passage because it represents a thematic resolution, which logically belongs at the narrative's terminus, thereby justifying its placement there.
702	9566	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng is persevering and has discovered a fulfilling pursuit. The detail, ""the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by,"" illustrates precisely why the author selected this concluding passage."
703	9567	4	1	The author selected that specific quotation for the denouement because it conveys a profound appreciation for nature's marvels. Saeng expended considerable funds on a distinctive flower, the 'dok faeng-nol.' While failing her driver's examination, she discovered this plant. Despite her shame, she presented the flower, unlike those from her homeland, to her mother. Her mother, recognizing the failure, observed that the winter hibiscus, while less ornate, possesses the fortitude to endure the cold, a metaphorical assertion that Saeng, with refined skills, can succeed upon a subsequent attempt. The geese's departure and eventual return signify a renewed opportunity for achievement.
704	9568	4	1	The author concludes in this manner to suggest that Saeng will undertake the examination again during favorable seasonal conditions, as the present inclement weather is prohibitive for a successful attempt.
705	9569	4	1	"This is a profoundly resonant concluding statement. Despite failing her driver's test, Saeng realizes she must remain resilient and patient. The eventual return of the geese and the thawing snow will signal her own ""return"" to the test, which she will be determined to pass. She purchased the hibiscus to evoke her native Vietnam, hoping it would fill an emotional void. Her statement, ""I paid nineteen dollars for it,"" conveys disappointment in her failure and underscores the flower's stark contrast in value from its commonplace status in Vietnam. As a tropical plant, its spring blossoming will coincide with her readiness for a second attempt."
706	9570	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this resolution to illustrate that the plant's resurgence and subsequent bloom symbolize her decision to retake the examination with renewed determination. She acknowledges the inherent difficulty of achieving success but maintains a conviction in her own capability, mirroring her faith in the plant's ability to endure the harsh winter and flourish anew. This parallel instills within her the confidence that she too can overcome her formidable challenge, just as the plant perseveres through its seasonal adversity, thereby justifying the author's chosen conclusion.
707	9571	4	1	"In this interpretation, the author concludes the narrative by indicating the protagonist will retake the driving examination, as this act signifies not merely a second attempt but a broader acclimatization to her new existence. The driving test itself is not the central issue; rather, Saeng's profound distress stems from her struggle to adapt to an unfamiliar environment. For instance, the text describes ""a wave of loss so deep and strong"" that overwhelms her, causing her to weep within the greenhouse's refuge. This demonstrates her difficulty reconciling with her new life and the poignant memories of her former home. The failed examination was merely the culminating incident that precipitated her emotional release, and her vow to retake the test alongside the budding hibiscus signifies her ultimate resolve to surmount these challenges and progress."
708	9572	4	1	It is thematically appropriate that the author concluded the narrative with this paragraph. Saeng holds a deep affection for the hibiscus; therefore, its anticipated bloom in spring represents the most auspicious moment for her to reattempt the examination following her initial failure. This symbolic association would undoubtedly bolster her confidence to undertake the driving test again under more favorable circumstances. In conclusion, the author's decision to end with this paragraph is justified by its powerful symbolic resonance and its affirmation of future perseverance.
709	9573	4	1	"The author concludes the story thusly to articulate the protagonist's parallel growth with the changing seasons. Having recently immigrated and failed her driving test, she experiences dejection; however, the hibiscus serves as a poignant reminder of her homeland. Her mother's observation that the plant is ""strong enough to make it through the winter"" provides a potent analogy. Saeng internalizes this, reasoning that if the flower can endure a harsh season, she too possesses the resilience to thrive in a new country, thereby finding the fortitude to persevere."
710	9574	4	1	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the paragraph wherein Saeng vows to retake the test in spring, coinciding with the hibiscus's bloom. This concluding segment is significant because Saeng originally purchased the plant for its evocative connection to her childhood home, as flora ""drew her back into her childhood world."" However, adverse weather prevented her from transporting it home successfully, mirroring her initial failure. Her declaration to try again in spring, when the hibiscus flowers, symbolizes a renewed attempt aligned with natural renewal and hope, which is why the author selected this paragraph to conclude the narrative."
711	9575	4	1	The author concludes the paragraph in this manner to demonstrate her resolute determination not to capitulate. This is inferred from her silent vow to retake the examination in the spring; furthermore, it was the auxiliaries, not the prior years' cumulative efforts, that proved exigent. In summation, this constitutes the rationale for the author's concluding the paragraph thusly.
712	9576	4	1	"Minfong Ho's narrative, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" culminates with the excerpt: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The author selected this conclusion to afford Saeng a period for acclimatization. She requires solace, as her environment is entirely unfamiliar. The language is figurative, for the geese evoked a sense of personal identification, described as ""Almost familiar to her now. Like geese."""
713	9577	4	1	The environment is nearly vernal, as indicated by the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus. Furthermore, the grass is proliferating, trees are developing buds, and birds are vocalizing.
714	9578	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the narrative concludes with a significant paragraph: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" The author employed this conclusion because Saeng was displaced from her comfort zone, having relocated to a foreign nation and yearning for elements like the hibiscus. Consequently, she would postpone retaking the examination until she felt reestablished and at ease. The text notes, ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" indicating her dawning realization that her circumstances were ameliorating and she was gradually adapting."
715	9579	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to provoke audience contemplation and thereby impart a more resonant, dramatic effect to the story's denouement."
716	9580	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative in this manner to convey her resilience and sustained resolve. Her discourse regarding future events demonstrates a confident expectation of persevering until spring, while her mention of the test underscores her determination. The deliberate use of the word ""vowed"" signifies a solemn commitment to fulfilling her declaration."
717	9581	4	1	The author selected this concluding sentence to communicate her profound appreciation for nature, which she values more highly than her academic pursuits.
718	9582	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the flower serves as a central motif throughout the story; the author's statement that she will retake the test when the hibiscus buds creates a powerful symbolic connection between natural cycles and personal resolve.
719	9583	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to project events beyond the immediate narrative. It signifies that following the snow's thaw, she will commence anew and reconstruct the greenhouse, thereby completing the arc of renewal.
720	9584	4	1	"The author concludes the story thusly to illustrate profound determination. This resolution also symbolizes adaptation; as the seasons transition, so too will Saeng, who will retake the examination. The environment will revert to its familiar state, and she will correspondingly adjust, with everything becoming ""almost familiar to her now."""
721	9585	4	1	The author concludes with this denouement because it provides a sense of hope. It functions as a positive resolution to an otherwise somber narrative. It also represents her ultimate reflection for the story and an appropriate terminus.
722	9586	4	1	The author concludes this narrative segment because it coincides with her recommencement of horticulture, signifying her desire to initiate a new beginning.
723	9587	4	1	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to articulate Saeng's resolve to attempt the examination again in the spring. For instance, the statement, ""I failed the test,"" confirms her initial failure, yet she procured a hibiscus for her mother's garden. Her mother, sympathetic to the disappointment, prepares a meal to console her and mitigate the failure's impact. This is significant because it affords Saeng a sense of solace and reassurance, knowing she can retake the test with renewed confidence."
724	9588	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. Saeng's silent vow indicates she has achieved composure and feels more acclimated to her new country. She observes the snow melting and the geese returning, resolving to retake the examination. This demonstrates that she no longer dwells on her initial failure, recognizing the opportunity for a subsequent, improved attempt. Her perspective on her challenges has shifted, and she now regards her new country with a transformed outlook, as her overall circumstances have improved. These are the principal reasons justifying the author's choice of this concluding paragraph.
725	9589	4	1	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, to illustrate her commitment to a renewed endeavor. Upon seeing the flower identified as a hibiscus, it evokes potent childhood memories. She presents the plant to her mother, whose astonished reaction underscores its significance. The hibiscus, representing something profoundly important, instills within her a greater sense of hope. By pledging to begin anew with the budding flower and the geese's return, she signifies her intent to commence again with a fresh and revitalized perspective.
726	9590	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve despite her profound melancholy. She longs for Vietnam, yet she intends to retake the examination the following year. The author's lexical selections in the concluding passage evoke a sense of hopeful anticipation. Within the story, Saeng is disheartened by her failure, yet the purchase of the plant provides solace by evoking memories of her homeland. The concepts of Saeng's perseverance and the story's optimistic tone are articulated in this final segment.
727	9591	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with that specific paragraph because it represented a pivotal reflection for Saeng, essentially constituting the story's central theme rather than merely a primary cause. The author may have also concluded with that paragraph because it signifies Saeng's ultimate recollection of her former existence and lifestyle prior to her current residence.
728	9592	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the line, “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” because Saeng failed the examination after spending her money on a fast-food item, leaving insufficient funds for the specific flower her mother requested. Consequently, since Saeng failed the test, she resolves to retake it to fulfill her mother's expectations.
729	9593	4	1	I believe the author concluded the narrative with that sentence because it provides an uplifting sentiment following a profoundly sorrowful story. Saeng missed her homeland, experienced sadness, utilized the flowers for emotional relief, was disheartened about her driving test, and genuinely appreciated the plant. Therefore, the final sentence functioned as a comforting resolution, offering the reader a measure of relief.
730	9594	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with these final lines to establish a hopeful tone that reinforces a central theme. Concluding passages profoundly impact the reader as they form the ultimate impression. In this story, Saeng alludes to the time “when the snow melts,” wherein the snow symbolizes the sorrow she has endured since leaving home. At one point, “Saeng broke down and wept!” Spring represents an archetypal period of rebirth; thus, the “snow will melt,” and her grief will dissipate, establishing a hopeful tone for future happiness. Subsequently, Saeng references the hibiscus budding, a plant representing a comforting connection to her native country, which she called “yet another old friend.” If the hibiscus blooms, her new life may also flourish as she attains a sense of security, creating a tone of hope for future comfort. The forthcoming events she describes are followed by a commitment to retake the test despite her initial failure, demonstrating optimism and a willingness to confront challenges, thereby conveying a life lesson about courage.
731	9595	4	1	The author concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph to underscore the symbolic importance of the plant. Having immigrated from Vietnam, Saeng experiences profound homesickness. Her failure on a driving test exacerbates her distress. Encountering the familiar hibiscus, however, evokes potent memories of her homeland. The Winter Hibiscus specifically recalls cherished moments with her grandmother and mundane yet poignant artifacts like her fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb and the hibiscus hedge whose soft red petals would drift into her well water. The narrative describes how “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral,” highlighting the flower’s profound significance. The author’s concluding paragraph thus establishes the winter hibiscus as a source of solace for Saeng, one that will fortify her resolve to succeed on her subsequent driving examination.
732	9596	4	1	From the narrative of “Winter Hibiscus,” it is evident that Saeng possesses a determined character and an affinity for nature, including a specific resolve to pass her examination. The author selects this concluding paragraph because, at the story’s outset, Saeng fails her driving test. Her subsequent walk home leads her to discover a familiar botanical specimen, which transports her back to her childhood. Had she not failed the test, she would not have embarked on this pedestrian journey and encountered the significant plant. The author’s intention was to ensure the reader recalls the causal link between her failure and this pivotal, restorative discovery, an event that otherwise would not have transpired.
733	9597	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will have another opportunity with the coming spring. The narrative suggests she will identify with the resilient hibiscus blooms and subsequently retake her examination. This technique creates a narrative cliffhanger, indicating that Saeng's journey continues beyond the story's confines. Throughout the plot, Saeng struggles to acclimate to profound change, a difficulty her mother attempts to mitigate. Yet, just as winter gives way to spring, Saeng will have a future season in which to attempt the driving test once more.
734	9598	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng, like the hibiscus, requires time to adapt and flourish. Having performed poorly on her test, Saeng resolves to try again after the snow melts and spring arrives. Following her relocation, she feels isolated and yearns for her former home, yet she internally acknowledges that, given time, she can endeavor anew. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of the flora from her native country, ultimately helping her recognize the necessity of releasing her past to fully inhabit the present.
735	9599	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's mature acceptance of her setback and her confident resolve to attempt the test again. The statement that “Saeng vowed silently to herself” implies a period of introspection, and the phrasing suggests a conscious decision to embark on a fresh start, embracing the future with renewed determination.
736	9600	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a sentence concerning her test retake coinciding with the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding, as each symbolizes a distinct concept. The geese signify transformation, for they alter their habitat seasonally, analogous to Saeng modifying her own by visiting the plant establishment. The hibiscus evokes memories of her homeland, where analogous flora were prevalent. Its budding denotes a nascent existence, paralleling the life Saeng must forge in her new surroundings. Ultimately, the sentence with which the author concludes serves to illustrate Saeng's life through its comparison to the geese and the hibiscus.
737	9601	4	1	Saeng felt elated as the snow receded, for she eagerly anticipated spring's return to observe the fauna traversing her garden and witness the majestic geese arriving after their protracted and arduous migration. Consequently, Saeng was exhilarated to witness the resurgence of nature, thereby assuring her success on the forthcoming examination.
738	9602	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because Saeng was anticipating the conclusion of the winter season. Following winter, Saeng intends to retake an examination and she will be able to cultivate the flower. Saeng holds a profound appreciation for this hibiscus and desires to prevent its demise during the winter months.
739	9603	4	1	"The author concluded the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate how the flower provided the young girl with fortitude. The girl, situated in an unfamiliar location, recalled her native land which possessed an abundance of beautiful blossoms she adored; the absence of these flowers in her new environment profoundly disheartened and distressed her. She experiences sorrow from missing her home, and the only entity offering her slight solace is the floral presence. For instance, the girl states, ""It's-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", halting mid-sentence due to overwhelming distress preventing her from uttering ""home."" The flower she currently possesses is artificial, yet when the authentic one blossoms in spring, its sight will console her and instill the confidence required to retake the test."
740	9604	4	1	"The author's conclusion elucidates her sentiments. The concluding statement, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signifies that she is embarking upon a new beginning. For instance, retaking the examination signifies her intent to transform. Furthermore, it denotes her preparedness to embrace new challenges. The test, therefore, represents her readiness to undertake a novel endeavor, which is the interpretation derived from the conclusion."
741	9605	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng possesses hope, indicating that potential for success remains. The final passage allows the reader to envision a resolution for Saeng; one might imagine her cultivating an expansive garden and ultimately passing the examination.
742	9606	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several reasons. This final section synthesizes and unifies the central concluding ideas. It conveys that in spring, as life reemerges, Saeng will find the resilience to retake the examination. These principal concepts illustrate how Saeng and her mother have adapted, and how spring inaugurates new beginnings and possibilities. The text states, ""‘I know,’ her mother said quietly. ‘I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.’"" This signifies that although life is different away from Saeng's homeland, they will adapt and survive in their own manner."
743	9607	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate that Saeng requires time to recover from her failure before attempting the test again. Saeng already comprehends her capacity for healing. She recognizes her acclimatization to her new environment, where elements like the sound of geese have become “familiar to her.” The narrator states, “..she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” Aspects of her new home, initially strange, have become accepted. Saeng has also healed from departing her native Vietnam. Although she experienced profound sorrow, “A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her,” she has reconciled this loss. Remembering flowers from Vietnam as “old friends” indicates the memory is no longer painful. Once Saeng recovers from failing her driving test, as she did after immigrating, she can reattempt it without distress.
744	9608	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that the character, Saeng, will adapt to her new home and remain resilient. When Saeng’s mother remarks, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,” she is implicitly reflecting upon Saeng. The statement suggests that the relocation has wounded Saeng, yet she possesses the strength to survive the transition; like anyone who has failed a test, she will study more diligently to pass subsequently. Saeng will not surrender and will persevere through adversity. She understands that adjusting to life's changes is challenging, yet with courage and effort, it will become manageable. By believing in herself, she will successfully establish herself in this new location.
745	9609	4	1	"""When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This is included for several reasons. One reason is that winter, with its snow, destroys her garden. Consequently, she anticipates spring to recommence cultivating plants. She must undertake an examination on the items she is growing to ensure they are safe for consumption. This explains the significance of the paragraph stating, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""
746	9610	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a significant paragraph. It states, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This illustrates the protagonist's adaptation to her new nation and her aspiration to improve upon the season's renewal. The author selected this concluding paragraph to demonstrate the girl's successful assimilation and her resolve to strengthen herself progressively, declaring that upon the hibiscus's return, she will be prepared to retake the examination and succeed."
747	9611	4	1	The hibiscus budding signifies the flower's development. It is a blossom possessing vibrant, resplendent colors, rendering it incomparable to other flora. Its superiority stems from its profound symbolic meaning and its status as one of the most inherently natural flowers in existence.
748	9612	4	1	The author selected that paragraph for the conclusion to fulfill a deliberate narrative purpose. The intention was to culminate the story with a moment of internal resolution, conveyed through her silent vow.
749	9613	4	1	"Individuals must acclimate to different cultures upon relocation. They may achieve this through various methods, such as forging new friendships and adapting to the local environment. However, while adjusting to a new location, one should also preserve memories of their former home. This is the thematic essence Minfong Ho conveys in the final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus."" In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng, having moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2, experiences numerous recollections of her homeland while visiting a botanical shop. She purchases a plant common in Vietnam and cultivates it in her garden. The concluding paragraph declares, “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again.” This demonstrates Saeng's desire to assimilate into the new culture by passing the driving test, while simultaneously honoring her heritage through the flower. This final passage encapsulates Saeng's emotional connection to her native country alongside her determination to prosper in her new one."
750	9614	4	1	She was pledging to herself that upon spring's return, she would undertake the driver's examination once more.
751	9615	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate her resolve. When she states, “when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” Saeng is articulating how the geese possess the fortitude to migrate back and the hibiscus the tenacity to rebloom; thus, she should equally possess the determination and confidence to retake the examination. Saeng’s admission, “I-I failed the test,” implies that failing the driving test initially made her feel as though she would fail in the new country. However, after observing the geese's and hibiscus's perseverance through adversity, she resolved to attempt the test once more.
752	9616	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to elucidate how, having already taken the test during winter, she will reattempt it when the flora reanimates and recommences its cycle. Saeng intends to retake the test to demonstrate to her mother her capability of passing; she purchased a plant called Dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars to mitigate her mother's potential disappointment. Nevertheless, her mother was dismayed by the exorbitant expenditure on a single plant.
753	9617	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it illustrates that encountering elements from her homeland provides her with solace and fortitude in her endeavors. The author appears to require familiar objects from her native country that enable her to optimize her situation and evoke positive recollections of her former life. Personally, I find that reflecting on personally significant and cherished things enhances my morale and motivation to perform well. The author is astute to seek out these symbols before retaking her test, as witnessing her plant thrive and recalling the geese will function as auspicious omens for her success.
754	9618	4	1	The author elects to conclude the story with such a paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has derived a renewed sense of hope from her memories and the increasingly familiar elements within her new environment. The confluence of failing her driver’s test and displacement from her original home precipitated a profound sense of loss in Saeng. While in the flower shop, she was “aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Throughout the subsequent narrative, Saeng remains despondent, leaving the reader uncertain of her recovery. Her convalescence commences with the emergence of familiar stimuli: “The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered,” “The winter hibiscus was in the ground now,” and “overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and – yes – familiar to Saeng now.” This recognition of the geese's familiarity catalyzes a new awareness and a surge of optimism. She apprehends that she is growing accustomed to many aspects of her new home she initially perceived as foreign. The final paragraph summarizes Saeng's nascent hope that she will learn not merely to reside in, but to flourish within, her new surroundings.
755	9619	4	1	The author concludes the story with this statement to reveal that, for her, the hibiscus symbolizes transcending adversity. This symbolism is evident when she declares, “…and the geese return and this is budding, I will take that test again.” This indicates that despite her initial failure, she will retake the examination once the hibiscus matures, representing perseverance and overcoming obstacles. Furthermore, this symbolizes triumph over challenges because the plant “gives her strength from her old country,” implying it will assist her in surmounting this test by providing fortitude and consolation. From this, one can discern the author's rationale for concluding the narrative with this assertion.
756	9620	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey Saeng's burgeoning self-assurance and her resolve to retake the examination, reflecting her positive self-perception and determination to succeed.
757	9621	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it depicts Saeng undertaking an examination. Textual evidence supports this interpretation, such as Saeng's statement, ""I-I failed the test,"" which indicates the test pertained to botany. Furthermore, the paragraph serves as a conclusion by encapsulating the story's central themes of spring, horticulture, and its significance to the characters, as it references the season and flora while illustrating how the mother and daughter sustain themselves by cultivating vegetables and fruits."
758	9622	4	1	"The final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho provides a definitive conclusion, offering the reader clarity regarding future events. This segment constitutes a profoundly significant denouement because it embodies the story's central symbols. The author establishes the hibiscus as essential to the protagonist. Concurrently, the geese and the thawing snow symbolize a fresh start and a new beginning. These symbols are crucial to her, as they provide an opportunity for renewal, which she perceives within the winter hibiscus."
759	9623	4	1	Saeng was profoundly distraught upon failing the test, which she perceived as a profound disappointment. This sentiment, however, underscores the ambition and determination she possesses to ultimately pass the examination.
760	9624	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative upon their return to demonstrate Saeng's character development throughout the plot. Initially, she describes her new home as ""walking into another world."" As a teenager who relocated from Vietnam, where traditions differ significantly from those in the United States, she found connection through one similar plant, the winter hibiscus. This plant bridges her past life with her present one. While adapting to the move was challenging, the plant provided familiar scents and a ""familiar fragrance"" that ""filled her lungs."" She even struggled to utter the words ""at home"" without weeping. Once the winter hibiscus was planted, it transformed Saeng, enabling her to appreciate her current circumstances. Ultimately, the author ended the story with that paragraph to illustrate how the plant symbolized Saeng and the fundamental shift in her perspective on life."
761	9625	4	1	The author concludes the story with this phrase to illustrate Saeng's adaptation to her new environment while still valuing her past. The sentence's essence conveys her perseverance, as she will retake the test in spring. Simultaneously, it signifies her growing familiarity with her new land; her reference to the melting snow and returning geese indicates acceptance of these elements from her present home. Conversely, her mention of the budding hibiscus demonstrates a continued connection to her former life, as the plant symbolizes her memories of Vietnam. Thus, the author employs this concluding statement to portray Saeng's maturation and her capacity to navigate profound life changes.
762	9626	4	1	The author's implication is that the hibiscus endures the winter's harshness. While most plants perish, the hibiscus confronts the adversity directly, demonstrating remarkable resilience against the challenging conditions.
763	9627	4	1	"The author includes this to provide narrative closure, preventing audience speculation. The declaration, ""I will take the test again,"" signifies that despite failing the botanical examination, her resolve remains unbroken; she will endeavor anew in spring. This addition fosters a deeper comprehension of the immigrant experience—the disorientation of arriving in an unfamiliar land, exemplified by the floral incident. The plants' scent evoked potent memories of her homeland and her grandmother, contrasting her accustomed liberty of wild growth with the constrained potted plants she encountered. This dissonance precipitated Saeng's emotional breakdown. Ultimately, the concluding paragraph elucidates Saeng's circumstance, affirming that while she resides in a new culture, she will persist relentlessly until she achieves success on her test."
764	9628	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" deliberately incorporated the final paragraph, which significantly enhances the narrative. The line, ""In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" is particularly potent. The natural phenomena cited by the author symbolize rebirth and a fresh start—a new opportunity that Saeng requires for her driver's license test. These symbols were powerfully inserted to convey hope for the girl's ability to overcome her difficult period. Finally, this concluding passage imparts a sense of completeness and structural unity to the story."
765	9629	4	1	The author likely concluded the story with that paragraph to impart a meaningful lesson, from which one can glean significant insight. Its purpose is to furnish a more comprehensive understanding of the narrative's context. The text mentions that Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family relocated to the United States from Vietnam, thereby providing essential background preceding the story's main events. This serves to consolidate the narrative's overarching themes and components, effectively summarizing the core message for the reader. This rationale explains the author's decision to conclude with this paragraph.
766	9630	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative in this manner to underscore Saeng's resolution to retake the examination. She commits to the endeavor upon the snow's thaw, the geese's return, and the hibiscus's budding—signaling the arrival of spring, when she will be prepared. Saeng observes, ""The flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to survive the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters."" This statement functions as a guiding principle for Saeng, who has recently emigrated from Vietnam; she intends to persevere, employing the plant as a symbolic representation of her own resilience and determination to succeed when she attempts the licensing test at spring's commencement."
767	9631	4	1	"The author employs Saeng's silent vow—""when they come back... in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again""—because it parallels her mother's process of rejuvenation, awakening, and self-restoration. Saeng declared she would retake the driving examination upon that occurrence, profoundly disheartened by her initial failure. Her utterance, ""I—I failed the test,"" conveys a palpable sense of embarrassment and sorrow. Consequently, the concluding paragraph effectively delineates Saeng's intended course: she will adopt an optimistic perspective and restore her own resolve to return and ultimately pass the assessment."
768	9632	4	1	The narrator includes this paragraph because the hibiscus represents a valuable plant, and a garden constitutes a personal decision, analogous to her mother's choice to cultivate hot peppers. A garden serves as a means to express individuality, reflected in the diverse array of cultivable foods and the myriad plant species existing in the world, such as roses, lilies, and other similar flora. This illustrates the personal and varied nature of horticultural expression.
769	9633	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's determination to surmount an impediment. Failing the driver's test constituted a significant setback for Saeng, who consequently plans another attempt. She intends to utilize the hibiscus as motivation, perceiving its endurance through winter as a metaphor for overcoming adversity, thus framing her own challenge within a broader context of resilience.
770	9634	4	1	The author likely concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate the profound significance of the event for Saeng, revealing her genuine investment in the outcome. This demonstrated concern substantiates her resolve and provides the necessary impetus for her commitment to retake the examination, thereby concluding her character's arc on a note of determined perseverance.
771	9635	4	1	She concludes the narrative with that particular paragraph to convey her profound sense of comfort during the spring season. It further articulates her eager anticipation for the budding of geese and hibiscus, as this period constitutes her most cherished time of the year.
772	9636	4	1	Saeng feels ill at ease within her surroundings and has not acclimated to the alterations following her relocation. She discovers the hibiscus and elects to purchase it, as it evokes memories of her home. Initially, her mother appears astonished by the price Saeng paid, but subsequently becomes more sympathetic upon realizing her daughter's longing for her homeland. Saeng declares her intention to retake the examination in the spring, thereby implying a forthcoming shift in her attitude toward her new residence.
773	9637	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in that manner to signify the impending return of the geese, thereby using this natural event as a symbolic representation of renewal and hope within the story's context.
774	9638	4	1	The author concludes thusly to demonstrate that Saeng was not capitulating. This is evident from her relocation to an unfamiliar and initially unwelcoming environment. The author conveys that one must persevere and maintain faith despite adversity. Ultimately, Saeng possesses the self-assurance to pass the test subsequently, having realized that an undesirable situation does not preclude personal progress and resilience.
775	9639	4	1	The author concludes the story in that manner to impart the notion that one cannot simply abandon an endeavor after a failure. Saeng's declaration that she will retake the test in the spring demonstrates her resilience and the continuous progression of life, which is the rationale for the author's chosen conclusion.
776	9640	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate her resolve not to succumb to homesickness. The initial purchase of the plant evoked potent memories of her former home, revealing the depth of her longing. Her declaration to retake the examination signifies a refusal to be defeated by her new environment and a commitment to her new life.
777	9641	4	1	The author concludes Saeng's vow within the narrative to illustrate her capacity to surmount adversity. Saeng perceives herself as a failure. The hibiscus symbolizes the fortitude required to overcome the obstacle of her failed driving test. The geese represent resilience and perseverance, embodying the necessity of relentless effort to achieve success.
778	9642	4	1	The author concludes the narrative thusly because the protagonist is analogous to the flower. Just as the hibiscus will bloom, Saeng will retake the examination, both receiving a fresh commencement. This conclusion leaves the reader with a positive sentiment; it is a concise yet profoundly meaningful ending. The final sentence is nearly inspirational, compelling one to desire a new beginning alongside Saeng.
779	9643	4	1	The author concludes with the statement for several significant reasons. Primarily, it signifies her intention to persevere and adapt to her new existence. She will alter her lifestyle and strive to assimilate into the unfamiliar culture. Furthermore, she must confront the memory of her grandmother anew and aspires to manage that profound loss more effectively. The author thereby emphasizes that the character's journey remains ongoing.
780	9644	4	1	The narrator likely concluded with this paragraph for several reasons. Since winter is commencing, the hibiscus will not return until spring, creating a parallel with the story's conclusion. The final paragraph effectively summarizes the narrative in a succinct and poignant manner, providing a distinctive and fitting denouement. Its uniqueness stems from its natural symbolism, which distinguishes it from conventional story endings. Ultimately, these elements justify the narrator's decision.
781	9645	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate how individuals can reclaim their resolve. Initially, Saeng is dispirited following her unsuccessful driving examination. Upon encountering the Hibiscus, she is inundated with recollections and weeps. Her mother's compassion inspires Saeng to derive fortitude from the flower, described as ""strong enough to endure the cold season."" Assured that the Hibiscus will blossom in spring, Saeng reaffirms her determination to pass the test."
782	9646	4	1	The author concludes with this response to convey that Saeng will reapply herself, now with greater assistance in the garden and for her mother. She will intensify her academic efforts while reducing her focus on horticultural pursuits, thereby achieving a more balanced and dedicated approach to her obligations.
783	9647	4	1	Saeng's character in this narrative exhibits determination and confidence. She likely believes she could undertake more sophisticated botanical endeavors. This seems an ideal avocational pursuit for a plant enthusiast. She appears to have achieved her horticultural objectives and may wish to pursue a career in gardening. Her statement about retaking the test when plants return suggests a willingness to investigate further flora. This experience was presumably inherited from her mother, suggesting a familial tradition. Saeng will likely perpetuate this legacy by instructing her own children about various flowers.
784	9648	4	1	"The author concluded the story with the paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's optimistic forward-looking perspective on life. It reveals she will no longer be despondent about life's alterations. The hibiscus functions as a plot device; its transformations parallel the narrative's developments. Initially, Saeng, devoid of the hibiscus, feels desolate. Its sight evokes melancholic memories. After planting it, her prospects improve. She embraces change, as the final paragraph indicates: ""when they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signifying Saeng's positive outlook and the concurrent blossoming of the flower. The author thereby provides a symbolic conclusion that articulates the story's central themes."
785	9649	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow because she intends to act in the appropriate season. During the ""winter season,"" the frigid soil prevented proper plant growth. The ""Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars"" coincided with Saeng's test failure. The description of her mother possessing a ""frail, wiry beauty"" that moved Saeng deeply portrays her mother's radiance while gardening. These elements collectively depict a past from which Saeng seeks to learn, aspiring to emulate her mother's resilience and ultimately pass her examination."
786	9650	4	1	"Toward the conclusion of the brief narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng resolves, ""when they return in the spring, as the snow recedes and the geese reappear and the hibiscus buds, then I shall retake that examination."" This declaration pertains to her driving examination, which she vows to reattempt, prompted by the recollection that her family persevered, having relocated to @LOCATION1 for a new beginning. The plant, which she had forgotten, evoked memories of her childhood. Encountering these blooms following her failure reminds her of her own past resilience, thereby reinforcing her present determination not to surrender."
787	9651	4	1	The author endeavors to convey a sentiment of optimism for Saeng within her adopted nation. Following her evident failure on a test, likely a significant citizenship examination given her inability to meet her mother's gaze, the narrative concludes with a reassuring tone for the reader. This resolution alleviates any uncertainty regarding Saeng's future prospects, suggesting a positive outcome is attainable despite the initial setback she experienced.
788	9652	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination to locate the flower, thereby reconnecting with memories of her native land. It signifies resilience, demonstrating that the hibiscus, though not indigenous, will endure and return. Saeng's statement, ""I failed the test,"" follows her purchase of a hibiscus that was not authentic to her memories. Her final vow to retake the test in spring, as the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, symbolizes her hope for the plant's survival and her quest to find a specimen reminiscent of her homeland, affirming her perseverance."
789	9653	4	1	The author selected this particular conclusion to provide a succinct and resonant closure to the narrative, effectively encapsulating its central themes of resilience and renewal without unnecessary elaboration.
790	9654	4	1	When spring arrives and the snow dissipates, she intends to cultivate new seeds. The narrative concludes thus because her initial test performance was unsatisfactory. The subsequent year, she will dedicate herself to horticulture before reattempting the examination to ensure her success. This concluding element is included to demonstrate that her concerns extend beyond mere botany, reflecting a broader commitment to her personal integration and future endeavors.
791	9655	4	1	"The narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" centers upon a young woman, Saeng, her mother, and grandmother. They possess a profound appreciation for floral beauty, cultivating them throughout the day, harvesting and arranging them. ""Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye."""
792	9656	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the adage to illustrate Saeng's regained self-assurance; although she failed the examination, she recognizes her capacity to retake it and succeed. Her initial distress was alleviated by her mother's conversation, which instilled the confidence necessary to undertake the test again with the conviction that she would pass, which explains the adage's placement.
793	9657	4	1	This passage signifies that upon winter's conclusion and the geese's return from the south, alongside the reappearance of her favored plant from her native country, she will resume her previous endeavors with renewed confidence. This is the interpretation of its meaning.
794	9658	4	1	"The author concludes with this paragraph because it resolves the central conflict of her failed driving examination. Saeng's declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" demonstrates her determination to succeed. Since the primary conflict is resolved, introducing a new one would be necessary to continue, so the author concludes the story. This excerpt also draws a parallel between Saeng's difficulties and the geese's, as both must return and confront hardships again."
795	9659	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes in a well-mannered fashion. The final paragraph illustrates that Saeng will not surrender, despite being far from home. Initially in a downward spiral after failing a test, the hibiscus evoked nostalgia. Her mother's kind greeting and the provision of food with peppers and bitter melons acted as an antidepressant, allowing Saeng to perceive life's positives, fostering the confidence that she will ultimately pass the examination."
796	9660	4	1	"In the narrative, Saeng fails her driving examination. While walking home, she encounters a familiar plant; subsequently, she visits a florist and discovers it is a hibiscus. She purchases the plant with her limited funds because it evokes memories of her homeland and her childhood. It also reminds her of the grandmother she left behind, thus establishing a profound connection to the plant. Furthermore, she observes geese flying south for the winter and remarks, ""When they come back,"" signifying their return northward in the spring. And when ""the snow melts,"" indicating the warmer weather and the onset of spring, and ""this hibiscus is budding,"" as the plant begins to bloom, she declares she will ""take that test again."" She grants herself the winter to practice and prepare. She vows that by spring, she will be ready to retake the examination and, this time, achieve success."
797	9661	4	1	She articulated this to demonstrate the requisite determination to succeed despite repeated failures, emphasizing the necessity of resilience to persevere and attempt once more. She thereby exhibits considerable courage, as it requires significant fortitude for an individual to confront failure and resolve to try again. She refuses to accept defeat and seeks to redeem her previous failure by committing to a subsequent attempt. This rationale explains the story's concluding sentiment.
798	9662	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this specific paragraph. This deliberate choice informs readers of her intentions for the coming spring and potentially establishes a foundation for a subsequent story, allowing the audience to anticipate her retaking the examination in that season. This provides a sense of closure while simultaneously suggesting future possibilities for the character.
799	9663	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with that paragraph because the plant she cherishes will become dormant in winter, and the flower, which symbolized her fortune, prompted her to declare, ""when the snow melts in spring, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The flower held immense significance for her. She noted, ""that rich, sweet scent that was familiar,"" comparing the flower's fragrance to that of her grandmother's shell, which was identical."
800	9664	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to signify her resolve to return and undertake the same endeavor again the following year, thereby illustrating a cyclical theme of perseverance and renewal. This ending reinforces the protagonist's unwavering commitment and the story's central message of resilience.
801	9665	4	1	The author concludes the narrative thusly because she intends to retake the examination, aspiring to pass it for her mother's sake. Consequently, she brought the flower home to offer an apology to her mother.
802	9666	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate how events will recur, such as seasonal changes, wherein one cannot plant nor cultivate during winter. For instance, she described the flora as dissimilar to her homeland's, yet she must accept her displacement and acclimate to her new environment. This is necessary, for otherwise she would remain discontent, perpetually preoccupied with her origins.
803	9667	4	1	The author concludes the response by stating she will retake the examination when spring arrives and the hibiscus buds, as she is imbued with hope and faith. The protagonist, having recently relocated, experiences profound loneliness and despondency due to her yearning for home. She feels nostalgic for her past, and the plant provides a sense of solace, reminiscent of home. Her declaration to retake the test stems from her distress over failing, yet the hibiscus offers comfort, instilling faith that she will succeed in the spring.
804	9668	4	1	Upon their return, Saeng made a silent vow to herself that in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus buds, she would take that test again.
805	9669	4	1	"In “The Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author selected the final paragraph for its alignment with the essay's tone, thematic hope, and symbolic representation. The story's tone is predominantly somber, as her failure of the driver's test causes profound distress. Memories of her native country resurface upon seeing the winter hibiscus, leading to her emotional breakdown within the greenhouse. She misses Vietnam intensely, and the plant triggers poignant recollections. The winter season initially fosters a sense of hopelessness, as the strange surroundings become familiar through seasonal repetition, yet offer no renewal. The plant's symbolism deeply affects her; she cannot utter the word ""home"" without tears, as her true home remains Vietnam. The hibiscus evokes an immense emotional response concerning her past. Thus, the final paragraph signifies how, with hope's return in spring, she will endeavor once more, with tone, hope, and representation justifying its fitting conclusion."
806	9670	4	1	This narrative proved profoundly compelling, illustrating the tribulations endured by the young protagonist; the author culminated it with remarkable artistry. Upon concluding, I reflected on the resolution's elegance. The author executed her task masterfully, portraying Saeng's accumulated hardships as a severe winter. Subsequently, with the phrase “as the snow melts away,” the author intimates that although Saeng's struggles appear interminable and severe, they will ultimately dissipate, allowing beauty to re-emerge, akin to a budding flower in spring. Furthermore, the author succeeded in evoking profound empathy; I could palpably sense her anguish. Her deployment of descriptive terms such as “exploding,” “shock,” and “intense” rendered the events startlingly immediate, as though I were present. The denouement then effectively conveyed Saeng's enduring hope for a more promising future, despite her circumstances differing radically from her life back home.
807	9671	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in spring, as the snow recedes, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, because she perceives the blossoming flower as symbolic of her own potential to flourish by passing the examination. Saeng identifies profoundly with the hibiscus, which her mother describes as possessing flowers less conventionally beautiful yet possessing the resilience to endure the winter. Her mother's implication is that Saeng, too, can demonstrate comparable fortitude to persevere through her own difficult period. Similarly, as Saeng observes the geese forming their distinctive V-formation against the evening sky, she internalizes the lesson to maintain self-esteem and recognize that future opportunities will arise. One must not succumb to self-doubt, for other chances will present themselves, and one should never fear to attempt anew.
808	9672	4	1	The author selects this concluding paragraph to signify Saeng's commitment to return after winter to tend to the plant. Its placement at the narrative's end underscores the depth of her attachment to it, as the hibiscus serves as a poignant memento of her native land. This profound sentimental value is the precise reason she devotes such meticulous care to the plant, ensuring she retains a tangible connection to her homeland.
809	9674	4	1	The author concludes with the paragraph concerning the geese to illustrate Saeng's parallel capacity to adapt to her unfamiliar surroundings. It demonstrates her resolve to undertake necessary measures for survival, mirroring the geese's innate behavior. She is determined to retake the examination and will not capitulate. This passage highlights her desire to assimilate into the new nation. For instance, the narration mentions, “she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes,” revealing Saeng's initial discomfort and dissatisfaction with her new environment. Nevertheless, the final paragraph confirms her intention to acclimatize and exert her utmost effort to do so. Additionally, the narration observes, “she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac,” proving that despite occasional dislikes, Saeng is prepared to experiment to become accustomed to her new country. The narration further states, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now,” indicating Saeng's increasing familiarity and adaptation to her milieu, analogous to the geese's adaptability, which justifies the author's thematic choice.
810	9675	4	1	The author composed the concluding paragraph to convey Saeng's optimistic anticipation of a more promising future. She eagerly awaits the geese's return, which evokes memories of her homeland, and she aspires to pass her driving examination. Throughout the narrative, Saeng emerges as an intensely sentimental individual, a fundamental character trait that logically motivates the author's decision to craft this particular concluding reflection.
811	9676	4	1	The author concludes this narrative segment to achieve a resonant effect and to demonstrate to his audience that, irrespective of life's adversities, one must persistently pursue a personally determined course of action. This is analogous to the flower, which continually reemerges despite enduring considerable hardship.
812	9677	4	1	The author deliberately concludes the narrative with that paragraph for a specific purpose. The hibiscus evokes memories of Vietnam, while the geese symbolize her present home. These dual elements collectively provide her with fortitude, thereby compelling her decision to undertake the examination upon their return. She is confident in her capacity to succeed while these symbolic presences endure in her life.
813	9678	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's nascent commitment to her academic responsibilities. Previously, the story made evident her greater preoccupation with the garden than with her scholastic duties, a disposition which is now shifting.
814	9679	4	1	Saeng was evaluating the plant placements to ascertain the geese's approval of their arrangement. This is evident from her reference to the geese in the final paragraph, whose implied affirmation she interpreted when she successfully planted the hibiscus.
815	9680	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph because the narrative primarily centered upon the hibiscus. Saeng resolved that when spring arrives and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will reattempt the examination. The flower served as a poignant reminder of her ancestral homeland.
816	9681	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph because the final passage discusses a new commencement. Furthermore, regarding what will transpire at this new beginning, she declares her intention to retake the examination.
817	9682	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph because the protagonist achieves an improved psychological state upon discovering a flower reminiscent of her homeland. Apprehensive that her parents will be angered by her test failure, she purchases a flower she encounters for its mnemonic qualities. Upon returning home and confessing the flower's cost and her academic failure, her mother's initial disappointment swiftly transforms into empathy for her daughter's ordeal. Ultimately, the protagonist possesses renewed confidence in her capacity for future success.
818	9683	4	1	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with a segment of dialogue because it encapsulates the narrative's central theme. Saeng intended to purchase a plant and present it at home, yet her mother disapproved upon its presentation. The text states, ""'You what?' Her mother stared at her incredulously"" (Ho). This reaction demonstrated maternal displeasure. The narrative continues, ""'I-I failed the test'"" (Ho). Saeng felt profound remorse for disappointing her parents. By vowing, ""'When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again'"" (Ho), the author illustrates Saeng's devotion and desire for personal growth to honor her family, thereby signifying her maturity."
819	9684	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey to the reader that Saeng intends to retake the examination. The author aims to communicate that, having failed the test, Saeng now recognizes her errors and is resolved to rectify them. For instance, when Saeng states, ""then I will take that test again,"" she expresses regret for failing a simple assessment and thus resolves to retake it once the snow melts."
820	9685	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant was not budding and the geese were departing, circumstances which contributed to her despondency following the test failure. However, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the plant begins to bud, her spirits will be restored. Consequently, she will retake the examination and achieve success, empowered by her renewed happiness.
821	9686	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner for several reasons. One objective is to illustrate Saeng's persistent resolve to pass her examination. Furthermore, it demonstrates that significant life alterations do not necessitate surrender. These represent some of the author's motivations for concluding the story as he does.
822	9687	4	1	"The author likely concluded the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate her profound connection to nature, particularly the hibiscus. She perceived the flower as significant due to her interactions with it, exemplified when ""she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the centre."" This rationale explains the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph."
823	9688	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because Saeng believes the optimal moment to retake her driving test coincides with the hibiscus budding. An additional reason is the author's intention to convey her unwavering determination, thereby providing a fitting conclusion to her character's journey.
824	9689	4	1	She vowed this paragraph because she aspired to make her mother proud by ultimately passing the test after an initial failure, yet she awaits the plant to emerge and begin budding. The hibiscus bud symbolizes a new beginning; having endured the winter, it will flourish. Similarly, Saeng will succeed, reasoning that if a tropical plant survived a severe winter, she can certainly pass the test the following spring.
825	9690	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the final paragraph because it functions as the story's moral. She intends to convey that when the moment is appropriate, she will persevere until she succeeds. Without this concluding paragraph, the central message of the story would remain unclear and incomplete.
826	9691	4	1	Saeng is an exceptionally supportive young woman who assists her mother; the author crafted the concluding sentence to enhance the narrative's intrigue and sustain the reader's engagement until the finale.
827	9692	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that sentence because she intended to convey that she will repeat this action when the hibiscus returns to season.
828	9693	4	1	One might surmise she expresses this because she only wishes to undertake the examination when she feels assured amidst the flowers, plants, and verdant foliage.
829	9694	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it states that when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test, signifying that as she matures and gains greater confidence, she will flourish and undertake the examination when she is prepared, just as the hibiscus will be ready to commence budding again.
830	9695	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph because, concerning flowers and nature, there are seasons when they do not emerge, such as winter. The paragraph indicates that in spring, after winter concludes, she resolves to anticipate observing all the flora that nature provides.
831	9696	4	1	I posit that he employed this conclusion to affirm her resilience and her unwavering commitment to persevere through any adversity.
832	9697	4	1	The author incorporates this sentence within the paragraph because it signifies the commencement of a new inception.
833	9698	4	1	The author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test upon the geese's return, the snow's melting, and the hibiscus's budding, thereby conveying a message of perseverance. Saeng purchases the plant after touching its petal, seeking a memento of her former home, yet this action suggests she is not relinquishing her past but rather integrating it. By planting it with her mother, she endeavors to assimilate her memories into her new environment, effectively transforming her present home through the incorporation of her heritage.
834	9699	4	1	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring, a device symbolizing her acquired insights. She learned to adapt to life's changes and acclimate to unfamiliar elements, as the geese and snow, once strange, had become familiar. The hibiscus embodies the capacity to overcome obstacles, maintain a connection to the past, and provide solace. The final paragraph thus encapsulates these multifaceted symbols, and a profound examination reveals the lessons Saeng internalized.
835	9700	4	1	"The author concludes by linking Saeng's vow to retake the test with the hibiscus's significance, a flower connected to her past in Vietnam where it was known as the ""Madagascar periwinkle."" It symbolizes adaptation, mirroring Saeng's adjustment to her new environment. Her resolve to try again in spring parallels the flower's budding, representing her determination to overcome obstacles, her connection to past experiences, and the comfort it provided after her failure. Ultimately, the author ties the flower's symbolism to the ending, illustrating Saeng's hope and dedication in confronting the challenges that define her journey."
836	9701	4	1	The author concluded the narrative in that manner to convey the protagonist's perpetual resolve to recommence her endeavors. For instance, upon failing the examination, she initially presumed she would capitulate. Consequently, this rationale substantiates the author's decision to conclude with that particular statement.
837	9702	4	1	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph to articulate that Saeng will perpetually recommence her efforts, analogous to the resilient hibiscus. Despite encountering adversity, one must persistently endeavor until circumstances improve. Furthermore, the author selected this conclusion because the paragraph effectively mirrors the cyclical nature of Saeng's intended actions, symbolizing a new beginning.
838	9703	4	1	She signifies that upon her return, she intends to repeat the identical process to ascertain whether she can achieve a superior outcome.
839	9704	4	1	"Saeng silently vowed to herself that ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because her thoughts diverged upon observing a flower. She notes that ""one of the blossoms had fallen off,"" then carefully retrieves and smells it, which distracted her. Her mother's reaction following the failure was prolonged silence; she expressed no anger, merely brushing the green fragments from Saeng's hands. Her mother remained preoccupied with plants throughout the day, as Saeng excavated a hole and gently placed the ""winter hibiscus"" within it. Observing her mother inspired a cascade of thoughts, prompting an attempt to visualize geese. She resolved to retake the driving test as she acclimated to her new environment. The introduction states that ""Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam,"" though it omits details regarding her family."
840	9705	4	1	"The author incorporated this paragraph to illustrate the girl's profound longing for Vietnam. Encountering the hibiscus evoked nostalgic memories, providing her with solace. The paragraph further underscores the contrast between the United States and Vietnam. The distinct seasonal cycle in the United States facilitates her gradual acclimatization. While the plant remains a constant, she must actively seek the advantages her new environment offers. The author observes, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This demonstrates her growing familiarity with the United States, wherein she perpetually cherishes Vietnam yet discovers comforting resemblances within her new surroundings. Ultimately, the paragraph conveys her nostalgia for Vietnam alongside the consolation she finds in the United States."
841	9706	4	1	These words essentially signify his inevitable return, analogous to the perennial migration of geese.
842	9707	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several reasons. Primarily, she remains uncomfortable discussing her former home, as indicated by the text, “She was still unable to articulate the word ‘home’.” Consequently, the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus serve as poignant reminders of her homeland. This is confirmed when Saeng observes, “Just as she knew it would feel… Back home it just grew wild, sprouting from cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs.” These reminders of her home provide her with both solace and fortitude. The author therefore concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate that the seasonal symbols, which evoke her homeland, coincide with the moment she will retake the test, when she feels confident and resilient.
843	9708	4	1	The inclusion of this concluding paragraph demonstrates a narrative resolution and reinforces the theme of overcoming adversity. After failing her test, Saeng was disconsolate; however, upon purchasing the hibiscus, she discovered renewed hope and determination, resolving ultimately to retake the examination “in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” This hopeful conclusion provides readers with a sense of closure regarding future events. It functions to guide the story toward its denouement, which is why meaningful endings of this nature are significant. Readers can discern the author’s message through such passages; in this instance, the imperative to persevere and find inspiration in simple things. Understanding an author's intent is crucial, both for readers interpreting a story's purpose and for writers seeking to convey their ideas effectively.
844	9709	4	1	The author employs the quote, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” to symbolize how spring heralds renewal and hope. Her reflections, “But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?” and “BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone,” chronicle her journey from Vietnam to a new location. One night she possessed immense hope, an abundance of it, yet the next she found herself in an unfamiliar land, entirely dissimilar to her home. Flowers blooming in spring represent new life and the potential for progress; there is hope that spring will arrive, bringing flowers and birds. It signifies an opportunity for release. The final quote was intended to instill hope, as she makes a silent pledge that circumstances will improve. Hope is the element that renders every obstacle surmountable and every hardship endurable.
845	9710	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to establish the hibiscus as a symbol for Saeng. In spring, the hibiscus flourishes, paralleling Saeng's own growth. Upon arriving in the new environment, she was diminutive and frail, much like the plant. The description, “Its leaves quavering in the wind,” indicates the plant's fragility and lack of strength, as a robust plant would not tremble. Saeng’s emotional breakdown and subsequent purchase of the plant reveal her own vulnerability. Ultimately, the author utilizes the paragraph to convey that both the hibiscus and Saeng have gained strength, possessing the capacity to overcome any challenge.
846	9711	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate Saeng's unwavering resolve and determination to succeed on the examination. The narration observes, “Not like the kind we had @NUM1],” indicating Saeng’s profound emotional connection to her former home and her desire for a hibiscus identical to the one she and her grandmother cultivated. Her sorrow and subsequent resolve stem from her inability to procure the identical hibiscus variety. The text further declares, “Ö and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2],” demonstrating her perseverance, as she intends to attempt the test again despite her initial failure, motivated by her longing for her homeland and its familiar flora.
847	9712	4	1	The author concludes the narrative thusly to establish a tone of reassurance for attempting the examination anew. The individual who will retake the test may have selected this tone in relation to her personal history, utilizing this period for mental preparation, a practice potentially instilled in her by her parents or grandparents, thereby concluding the rationale.
848	9713	4	1	"The author concluded in this manner because she deems the present moment opportune for retaking the examination. She incorporates this detail because the melted snow, the budding hibiscus, and the returning geese signify a period of renewal, as everything is restored and the climate is warm. Her statement, ""when they come back...then I will take the test again,"" signifies her intention to approach the test with full confidence. Saeng vowed to retake it and is resolved to do so, believing she will ultimately pass, which is the author's intended conclusion for the narrative."
849	9714	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the hope and symbolic significance the hibiscus holds for Saeng. This conclusion is also appropriate because spring represents a period for new beginnings, when life reemerges and regenerates, as suggested by the melting snow and returning geese. The text implies it is the right moment for a second chance. The earlier failure and the act of tearing a leaf symbolize the withering of her hope, which the hibiscus represented. Therefore, the author concluded in this fashion to illustrate a new beginning.
850	9715	4	1	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with the potent single-sentence paragraph stating Saeng will take the test upon the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding. This sentence sustains suspense while integrating the narrative's central themes to suggest potential future developments for @CAPS1. Saeng originally purchased the hibiscus to provide solace for both her mother and herself. As she observed the geese, the author selected this moment to articulate Saeng's resolute feelings and her commitment to retaking the test, culminating the story with a strong sentence that summarizes the narrative while creating a cliffhanger.
851	9716	4	1	“When they return,” Saeng vowed silently to herself, “in the spring, when snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to provoke contemplation about the story’s implications after one has finished reading it.
852	9717	4	1	In many narratives, the author employs a dramatic yet conclusive statement to conclude the story. An illustration of this technique occurs in the short story “Winter Hibiscus.” The young protagonist concludes by revealing when she will retake her test, although not addressed directly to the reader, as the text states “Saeng vowed silently to herself,” yet it still informs the audience. The author incorporates this final vow not only to apprise the reader of future events but also to demonstrate the girl’s determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For instance, the phrase “and this hibiscus is budding” reveals her bond with the flora, deriving from the comfort and confidence it has provided, particularly given her need to retake the examination. In conclusion, the narrator ended the story with this paragraph to indicate forthcoming events and to elucidate the spiritual connection the girl maintained with the flower and her homeland.
853	9718	4	1	In the story, the author concludes the final paragraph with the statement: “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends the narrative with this paragraph to convey that Saeng is a student who had previously failed an examination. Although Saeng possesses a profound interest in flowers, she remains equally dedicated to her academic pursuits. As the snow melts, Saeng will retake the test, paralleling the hibiscus as it buds and commences its blossoming.
854	9719	4	1	After they come, Saeng vowed silently to herself, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Uttering this sentence transports her psyche back to her homeland. She reflects on how familiar it once was to Saeng. She contemplates how quietly she pledged this, as she does every season. Her existence feels very tranquil and leafy. She experiences a sense of displacement. Failing her driving test compounded her feelings; her transition to the United States was profoundly different from Vietnam, and she expresses these emotions through her reflections on the flower.
855	9720	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to remind the reader and to summarize the narrative. The intended summary traces the story's trajectory, beginning with Saeng failing the test and concluding with her planting the hibiscus in the winter. The author aims to remind the reader of the story’s entirety through this reflective denouement.
856	9721	4	1	He concludes the narrative in this manner to prevent the impression of her defeat. She now possesses greater awareness and confidence in her capacity to accomplish the objective. Furthermore, the flower has augmented her self-assurance, serving as a perpetual memento of her homeland.
857	9722	4	1	The author concluded the story thusly because, akin to the flower, it will regenerate, and so shall she. The blossom symbolizes determination, employed to illustrate her own resolve. Despite failing her driving examination, she retains the fortitude to retake it and endeavor to succeed. Even following failure, she remains determined to overcome it, just as the flower loses its buds in winter only to regrow them. Saeng is thus transcending her failure and emerging renewed.
858	9723	4	1	"The author utilizes this paragraph as a symbol of realization and a new commencement for Saeng. She had devoted excessive time to longing for the past, neglecting to appreciate the present; thematically, the author advocates to ""live in the moment."" The hibiscus signifies resilience, as her mother asserted, ""It's strong enough to survive the winter months... that is what matters."" Ultimately, the author conveys that adversity is inevitable; therefore, one must cherish the moments that bring joy, for they will provide the strength to persevere through difficult times."
859	9724	4	1	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the protagonist Saeng confronted numerous obstacles to surmount. At the narrative's conclusion, Saeng resolves that she will retake the examination after winter passes. The author likely concludes in this fashion to foreshadow Saeng's future, suggesting she will require time to adapt to her new environment and concentrate on other pursuits beforehand. This also demonstrates Saeng's considerable courage to complete a task she once failed. Her evident perseverance will undoubtedly assist her in overcoming future challenges in her new country. When Saeng's mother begins digging a hole and Saeng offers, ""Let me help, Mother,"" it reveals her affection for her mother and her concern for the plant representing her heritage. Thus, the concluding vow effectively illustrates Saeng's commitment."
860	9725	4	1	The author includes that excerpt to demonstrate to the reader that she acknowledged her error and intends to rectify it subsequently. This interpretation is supported by the text, wherein Saeng wept upon confessing her failure to her mother, indicating profound distress and a hope for future improvement. Another rationale for this conclusion is to lead the reader to infer that Saeng will ultimately overcome her profound homesickness.
861	9726	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative of ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's silent vow to retake the examination in the spring, following her initial failure. The hibiscus provided her with considerable solace, evoking memories of her homeland and inspiring a more optimistic perspective. Consequently, she associates the plant's budding with her own renewed resolve, shifting her mindset from anticipating failure to expecting success. The comfort she derived from the hibiscus significantly improved her emotional state, reinforcing her determination to persevere."
862	9727	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to signify reassurance. Having endured considerable difficulty adapting to the United States from Vietnam, Saeng's experience leaves the reader with hope that she will surmount this challenge. After failing her driver's test, she purchases a plant, and in the greenhouse, she laments the absence of familiar elements from Vietnam. The final passage offers hope for her eventual success on the retake. Winter symbolizes her ongoing hardships, a period of endurance for the migrating geese, the dormant hibiscus, and Saeng herself, separated from her homeland. As they all persevere, so will she, providing a positive and hopeful resolution that encourages the reader to maintain faith."
863	9728	4	1	This elucidates the author's rationale for concluding the narrative with this paragraph. It signifies that upon winter's conclusion, she will resume her cyclical tasks, such as digging, sending flowers, and attending to customers, only to repeat the process the following winter. Essentially, the author employs varied diction to convey the repetition of her actions with the season's end, which justifies the selected paragraph as the story's conclusion.
864	9729	4	1	The author introduces the paragraph wherein Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring to articulate the story's central theme. Saeng utilizes the hibiscus as a symbol of hope within her life. Furthermore, the author's deliberate diction illustrates Saeng's existential dependence upon the flower. The paragraph also elucidates the connection between her cultural identity and the narrative's overarching theme, thereby providing a cohesive conclusion.
865	9730	4	1	"The author concludes with this paragraph because the plant evokes poignant memories for Saeng, with whom she shares a distinct parallel. Saeng can be likened to the plant, as both are nascent within an unfamiliar environment. The plant, now situated in foreign soil, must acclimate and flourish. Similarly, Saeng must learn to adapt, improve, and prepare to retake her examination. She believes that once the plant has matured and adapted, she will have undergone a comparable transformation, making this paragraph a fitting denouement for ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho."
866	9731	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to encapsulate the story's central themes and to convey Saeng's resolve to reattempt the examination. The text states that she recognized how many elements once perceived as foreign had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, nearly familiar, and this final passage synthesizes these realizations.
867	9732	4	1	A vow constitutes a fitting conclusion; she pledged to retake the examination following her initial failure. It articulates her emotional state and signifies a commitment toward eventual success. The author sought to convey profound sentiment and her underlying desperation. Consequently, she perceived sufficient beauty in her surroundings to sustain her motivation.
868	9733	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph featuring Saeng’s silent vow: “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She purchases the plant subsequent to failing her driver’s examination. Having noticed the familiar species, she visited a florist to acquire one. The flower elicits happiness and evokes memories of her homeland. This concluding passage provides a sense of hope, thereby preventing a sorrowful ending, as she retains the aspiration of ultimately passing the driving test.
869	9734	4	1	She failed the test on the same day she acquired the plant and observed the geese migrating overhead. The plant and the geese function as potent symbols for her. The plant symbolizes her native home, while the geese likely represent progression in life, overcoming adversities like harsh weather to advance toward a more favorable situation. Collectively, they signify a new beginning. Therefore, she resolved to retry the test coinciding with this symbolic renewal, when the geese return and the plant blossoms. Having failed, she believes she should commence anew.
870	9735	4	1	The author incorporated this paragraph for several reasons: to extend the narrative's length and, moreover, to demonstrate that an initial failure does not preclude a subsequent attempt.
871	9736	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author incorporates this paragraph, wherein Saeng resolves internally that in the spring, once the snow dissipates, the geese reappear, and this hibiscus commences budding, she will undertake the examination anew, thereby underscoring her determination to attempt cultivation again. Saeng intends to endeavor planting once more during the spring season to substantiate her efforts to acclimate to the unfamiliar environment and to demonstrate her dedication to horticulture."
872	9737	4	1	Saeng signifies her intention to undertake that examination the following spring and to succeed, buoyed by the prospect of her winter flower and the vision of a flock of geese; she possesses considerable optimism regarding her success. When she observes buds emerging upon her hibiscus, she will then retake the test. Saeng was profoundly disheartened by her initial failure and consequently aspired to pass during the subsequent spring season.
873	9738	4	1	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph specifying when the protagonist, Saeng, will reattempt her driving examination. She declares she will do so ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" This concluding paragraph illustrates that Saeng has discovered newfound hope. For instance, since relocating from Vietnam, she has experienced profound homesickness. ""She found that she was still too emotionally fragile to utter the words 'at home,' fearing she would succumb to tears once more."" However, encountering a hibiscus plant evokes memories of her homeland. ""Previously, it grew wild, emerging from fissures in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng purchases the hibiscus to cultivate in her new residence. Possessing the plant provides her with recollections of her former existence and the fortitude to persevere in her new one. The hibiscus imbues her with the resilience to reattempt her driving test. The paragraph ultimately demonstrates Saeng's emotional transition from despondency to optimism and underscores the strength derived from the plant."
874	9739	4	1	The author concludes the story's final paragraph to convey that Saeng has comprehended the necessity of confronting a new existence and environment. For example, within the narrative, the mother remarks, “Its flowers aren't pretty, but it's sufficiently resilient to endure the cold months, this winter hibiscus.” This indicates the mother's desire for Saeng to understand the importance of strength during arduous periods. A further instance occurs when the narrator states, “she realized that many elements she had previously perceived as foreign became familiar, through the quiet repetition of season upon season…” This reveals Saeng's recognition that her new locale is gradually becoming analogous to her former home. Ultimately, the concluding paragraph communicates that Saeng must accept her new reality, demonstrating resilience and adapting to life's progression.
875	9740	4	1	“In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” Saeng resolves internally. Saeng finds herself in an unfamiliar location where she lacks companionship. She discovers solace within a floral establishment one day upon encountering a Hibiscus blossom. The flower pacifies her spirit and facilitates her initial adaptation to the life alterations she currently faces.
876	9741	4	1	The author concluded with the paragraph concerning the transition from winter to spring, when she intends to retake her driving examination for a singular, principal reason. The protagonist articulates this because, analogous to the flora reanimating and recommencing, she too will begin anew. In the narrative, Saeng, the young woman, declares, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” Having previously failed the assessment, she resolves to await the spring to secure a fresh commencement. Within the essay, the “winter hibiscus” evokes for Saeng recollections of her grandmother and her native land in Laos. This initially provokes melancholy, yet she subsequently recognizes the profound value of her memories, which assist her in enduring this challenging period. These recollections will furnish the fortitude necessary to persevere with her life and to attempt the driver’s examination once more in the spring.
877	9742	4	1	The author concludes with that particular paragraph because the protagonist is articulating her intention to attempt the test again upon the arrival of spring. The author selected this conclusion because it elucidates the character's profound sentiments regarding the spring season and its associated fauna. The young woman frequently references the geese within the story, thereby indicating her appreciation for wildlife and the natural world's symbolism.
878	9743	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph because it encapsulates how her memories and the plant influence her. Similar to the plant, Saeng flourished more readily in her native country and preferred it there; nevertheless, she can still endure in a new environment if nurtured and struggles to retain her beauty. The denouement demonstrates that Saeng comprehends that with greater effort, she can survive like the plant, compelling her to retake the examination. Her mother observes, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” Her mother endeavors to reassure her daughter that she will persevere through difficult times. Ultimately, Saeng is convinced of her own capability.
879	9744	4	1	"In ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author elected to conclude the story with a hopeful paragraph stating, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The rationale for this optimistic conclusion is multifaceted. For instance, the hibiscus embodies the concept of resilience when confronting challenges, and the determination to adapt and prosper. Saeng’s circumstance parallels the flower’s, having been uprooted from its native soil, transplanted, and compelled to survive the winter. Saeng has relocated from her cherished homeland, must commence life anew in a foreign nation, and has encountered the obstacle of failing an unspecified test. In the final paragraph, she realizes that, like the treasured hibiscus, she must demonstrate resilience and determination to succeed in her new environment."
880	9745	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph—""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again""—because it delineates her intentions for the season following winter. It also functions to maintain reader anticipation regarding the future developments for Saeng and her mother. A further rationale is to imply the potential for a new narrative commencing once the winter has concluded."
881	9746	4	1	I comprehend the rationale behind the author's conclusion, and it is a compelling one. The narrative indicates that since she failed this year, she will attempt again next year when it is time to prepare the garden. This constitutes an admirable moral, as one must persist in endeavoring to succeed, for even in failure, one does not forfeit progress. This parallels the experience of @PERSON1; although it required @DATE1 attempts to successfully invent the light bulb, he simply stated, “I have discovered @NUM1 ways not to create a light bulb.” Therefore, I concur with this author and his chosen story resolution.
882	9747	4	1	The author employs this to illustrate her persistent struggle with gardening. This is the case because each year she must labor upon her garden, as the winter destroys it, thereby causing its demise.
883	9748	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's unwavering determination. Saeng aspires to make her mother proud and will therefore endeavor to do whatever is necessary. Her primary objective is to ensure her mother's happiness. Her mother was disappointed by the failure, yet proved surprisingly understanding. When Saeng confessed her failure, she began to cry, but her mother subsequently wiped the tears away, concluding the emotional moment.
884	9749	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify that when the shovel emerges again in spring, as the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus begins budding, she will retake the test. Consequently, she will await the subsequent spring to undertake the examination once more.
885	9750	4	1	In the story, the test was whether she could overcome her homesickness. When she visited the greenhouse, all the plants and flowers evoked memories of her homeland. Observing the flower reminded her of occasions when she would fetch water from the well and a flower was floating within it. Therefore, after winter, she would return to the location to determine if she remained homesick. I believe it ended this way to demonstrate her perseverance and refusal to surrender, indicating she will endeavor once more.
886	9751	4	1	"I believe the author incorporated the concluding paragraph to furnish a final reflection upon Saeng's character and her subsequent intentions. Furthermore, the author may have appended this section while contemplating a potential sequel to ""Winter Hibiscus,"" thereby introducing a narrative element that could be developed in a future story. This inclusion prompts the reader to speculate whether she will ultimately pass the examination upon her next attempt, following the snow's thaw, the geese's return, and the hibiscus's budding. This literary strategy likely constitutes the rationale for the paragraph's inclusion."
887	9752	4	1	The author likely concluded the narrative with these particular lines to illustrate Saeng's burgeoning confidence. Initially, upon encountering the hibiscus, she experienced sorrow, yet the sight of the flower subsequently elicited happiness. Subsequently, her mother assists her in planting it, and Saeng becomes assured of its presence in the spring. Ultimately, Saeng's emotional state improves as a consequence of her introspective reflection upon her past.
888	9753	4	1	"I believe Minfong Ho concluded her story ""Winter Hibiscus"" in this manner to underscore the resolute determination of the protagonist, Saeng. Although she failed the test, she acquired the hibiscus, which facilitated the restoration of her resolve to succeed. Possessing a tangible memento of her homeland and her family likely reminded her of their expectations for her success, thus compelling her to vow to retake the examination when the hibiscus plant begins to bud. This constitutes the reasoning behind the story's concluding passage."
889	9754	4	1	"The conclusion of the essay ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho is decidedly affirmative. The rationale for the author's inclusion of Saeng's vow is to demonstrate her profound connection to her native country. When her current environment enters its spring season, she will undertake the test again because this period evokes memories of her homeland in the spring. This association fosters a sense of belonging, thereby empowering her to confront the examination, which explains the author's strategic placement of that sentence."
890	9755	4	1	Saeng vows that she will retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus functions metaphorically for Saeng's childhood. Having grown up in Vietnam before relocating, she profoundly misses her homeland, and the flowers vividly remind her of it, at times overwhelming her with memories. Adapting to change, particularly emigration, is profoundly challenging. Planting the winter hibiscus constitutes her method of coping, and she recognizes her gradual adjustment to this major transition. She pledges to retake the driver's test when the hibiscus blossoms because, like Saeng, a flower undergoes transformation. Its eventual blooming symbolizes her own readiness for change. Similarly, the migrating geese symbolize cyclical change, avoiding winter and returning in warmth, mirroring Saeng's decision to postpone the test until a more favorable season.
891	9756	4	1	She has declared her intention to undertake the examination the following year.
892	9757	4	1	The author concludes the narrative to convey the protagonist's resolution to be prepared the subsequent year to flourish once more; he will be ready to confront the challenge, to refrain from emotional distress upon encountering the plant, and to reflect upon childhood recollections with composure.
893	9758	4	1	"Saeng purchases a winter hibiscus to cultivate in her garden as a reminder of her homeland. Having failed an examination, she is distressed, and her mother, sympathetic to her plight, refrains from expressing dismay over the plant's cost. After planting it, Saeng resolves, ""In the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus buds, I will retake that test."" The author employs this passage to provoke contemplation regarding Saeng's potential success or failure, while the references to the budding hibiscus and returning geese imply an annual testing opportunity, as she specifies ""in the spring."""
894	9759	4	1	The author concluded the paragraph to communicate a specific message to the reader. The intended implication is that if a plant can endure a harsh winter, then she, too, possesses the resilience to pass her driving examination, which is the rationale for the paragraph's inclusion.
895	9760	4	1	"The author concludes ""The Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's silent vow: ""When they come back... I will take that test again."" This concluding commitment exemplifies hope and determination. Her resolve demonstrates an unwavering refusal to accept failure, offering encouragement to anyone who has faced defeat and desires another opportunity. This passage also encapsulates Saeng's commendable character, revealing her fortitude in choosing to endure the difficulty of another attempt after an initial failure, which signifies profound inner strength. Furthermore, the imagery of melting snow, returning geese, and the budding hibiscus brings the narrative full circle, symbolizing the promise of spring and the prospect of improved circumstances. These are the principal reasons for the author's selected conclusion."
896	9761	4	1	"The author incorporated this final element not merely to furnish the narrative with an optimistic and hopeful conclusion, but to demonstrate to the reader Saeng’s gradual acclimation to life’s transformations. The preceding paragraph elucidates Saeng’s realization that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost familiar to her now."" Consequently, the author ultimately affirms that although she failed the examination on this occasion, just as the geese will inevitably return in spring, she can subsequently retake the test. She thereby successfully conveys the narrative’s central theme in an appropriately uplifting manner."
897	9762	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with Saeng’s vow, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" to illustrate how the hibiscus plant has instilled within her a sense of hope. It has assisted her in navigating a period of considerable adversity. Within the narrative, Saeng has just failed her @CAPS1 test and is returning home, profoundly disheartened. During her journey, she encounters a recognizable flower and enters a floral shop to inquire about the hibiscus she observed. An employee directs her to the plant, which evokes potent memories of her native Vietnam. After planting the hibiscus in her vegetable garden, the flower provides her with renewed hope, and she resolves to attempt the @CAPS1 test once more."
898	9763	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this particular paragraph to underscore the thematic conclusion of a seasonal cycle. For instance, the story commences in winter as the hibiscus plants are perishing. Furthermore, the protagonist is departing, with her return contingent upon the spring season, when she can cultivate flowers once more and concurrently retake her examination. In essence, this symbolic parallel between the natural cycle and her personal resolve justifies the author's decision to culminate the story with this specific passage.
899	9764	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the narrative with the final paragraph to imbue the ending with a sense of prospective hope. It provides a distinct elevation of spirit at the terminus of a moderately somber story. This conclusion serves to demonstrate that with sufficient determination, one can persistently advance forward. It further suggests that defeat is only absolute when one concedes to it, which is the rationale for the author's implementation of such a potent final statement.
900	9765	4	1	The protagonist appears to possess a newfound confidence and a revitalized appreciation for the plant that reminds her of her homeland, which simultaneously comforts and motivates her. She declares that upon the return of these elements, she will endeavor diligently to pass the examination. She is thereby establishing a temporal benchmark to propel herself forward, a practice commonly adopted by individuals striving for achievement.
901	9766	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to illustrate how one must occasionally await the opportune moment to attempt anew. For instance, the text states, “Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, ‘How strange to see it in a pot,’ Back home it just grew wild jutting from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs.” This demonstrates that any endeavor can be achieved when circumstances are favorable.
902	9767	4	1	Emotions, symbolism, and thematic realization are all reasons the author concluded the narrative in that manner. A rationale for this conclusion is to leave the reader with mixed sentiments, such as sorrow, hope, and wonder. The author evokes sadness through the girl’s failed test and her longing for home, while simultaneously imparting a feeling of hope for her eventual return. A sense of wonder arises because the resolution leaves numerous questions unanswered. The author employs symbolism in the concluding sentences, attributing significance to the plant and the geese within the narrative; the plant, in particular, is associated with the home she profoundly misses. The finale presents multiple perceptions for consideration, such as the plant’s importance and the reason for relocating from a beloved place, which explains the author's chosen ending.
903	9768	4	1	In the story, Saeng possesses a fondness for beautiful flowers that once grew in her homeland. Her favorite was the winter hibiscus, adorned with exquisite red petals resembling velvet. Having failed an examination, the narrative suggests that nothing can rival the comforts of home, yet sometimes one merely requires another opportunity to succeed.
904	9769	4	1	I believe he did so to express his profound appreciation for all aspects of existence.
905	9770	4	1	The author concluded the story in that manner because, despite the hardships the plant endured, it remained at the conclusion of winter. The author indicated the plant would undertake the test again—the test of surviving the harsh winter and ultimately blooming at its end.
906	9771	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with that particular paragraph for numerous reasons. A principal reason is to convey her resolute determination to overcome the obstacle, specifically the test, irrespective of any difficulty. The text states, ""it can make through the cold months,"" a sentiment which consumes her and substantiates the final paragraph's message; she is in a foreign nation, commencing a new existence. The phrase, ""Not like the same kind we had before,"" implies a distinct environment to which she will ultimately adapt. Finally, the declaration, ""this hibiscus is budding,"" signifies her imminent personal flourishing."
907	9772	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because Saeng is isolated, reassuring herself that she will reattempt the previously failed examination, as she is now acclimating to her new home after discovering an element reminiscent of her former life.
908	9773	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to elucidate the central theme: one can perpetually commence anew following a misstep. For instance, after Saeng failed her driving examination, which profoundly affected her, she resolves to attempt it again in the spring. She presumably deduces that once she has undergone personal renewal, her performance will improve accordingly.
909	9774	4	1	"This explains the author's rationale for concluding the narrative with this paragraph, as it provides a coherent resolution. The paragraph serves as a fundamental component of the story. ""In the spring, when the snows melt and after return,"" signifies that once the snow dissipates and vegetation reemerges, she will recommence cultivation and find contentment. ""This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again,"" indicates her intention to restore her plants and test their resilience, enabling her to attempt the test once more. Saeng cherished this plant so intensely that she anticipates its flowering; when it occurs, she will cultivate numerous specimens. The paragraph conveys that Saeng will patiently await the opportunity to plant a hibiscus, a flower she has adored since arriving in the United States."
910	9775	4	1	For her, it represents the optimal period for action, as joyful recollections are revived concurrently with the return of the geese and the hibiscus blossom.
911	9776	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the hibiscus motivates her endeavor to undertake the driving examination. In the spring, as the snow recedes, the geese reappear, and the hibiscus initiates its budding cycle, she will resume that test with renewed determination.
912	9777	4	1	Several factors contribute to this decision; primarily, by spring she will have acclimated more thoroughly to her new existence. Furthermore, the hibiscus's initial budding provides profound comfort, as it seemingly evokes her childhood recollections automatically. It additionally serves as a tangible connection to her former home in Vietnam. As the plant adapts to its new life within the terrestrial soil, she too will adjust and finally feel prepared to retake the examination. It is as though the plant's readiness to bud signifies her own concurrent readiness to proceed.
913	9778	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that sentence as a vow directed toward the flower. It essentially declares that Saeng will return to attempt the examination again the following year, anticipating a more favorable outcome alongside the hibiscus.
914	9779	4	1	The author included the paragraph to demonstrate the character's profound regard for the flowers. Flowers blossom specifically during the spring season, which is the period dedicated to studying botanical growth within a garden. Consequently, she can ultimately pass the test and achieve contentment within her garden.
915	9780	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, as the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, for several significant reasons. Foremost, the hibiscus's blooming symbolizes profound hope; the plant will endure the winter months, subsequently regenerating with vitality. Similarly, Saeng, though situated in an unfamiliar and unwelcome environment, possesses the resilience to overcome adversity and hardship. The hibiscus's capacity to withstand winter parallels her own fortitude, which is precisely why the author concludes in this manner, leaving a lasting impression of Saeng's enduring hope."
916	9781	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng pledges to herself that, come spring—when the snow thaws, the geese arrive, and the hibiscus blossoms—she will retake the examination. This vow signifies her commitment to a new beginning, embracing transformation and adapting to her unfamiliar environment. She resolves not to disappoint her mother nor to be overwhelmed by nostalgic recollections. The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate the forthcoming evolution of her existence and her eventual acceptance of her present circumstances."
917	9782	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph stating, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to convey Saeng’s unwavering resolve. She is determined not to concede defeat but to undertake and ultimately pass the assessment. Furthermore, this signifies that Saeng will await the opportune moment for her endeavor, delaying until conditions ameliorate, as indicated by the imagery of melting snow, returning geese, and budding flora.
918	9783	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this final paragraph to demonstrate that by spring, Saeng will be prepared to retake her examination. It illustrates that, akin to the geese which reliably return, she will utilize the intervening period for study and eventual success. This concluding segment underscores her profound dedication to gradually acclimating to her new home and passing her driving test in due course. Although Saeng presently feels discomfort in her unfamiliar life due to lingering attachments, she recognizes the opportunity to attempt anew, mirroring the geese's perennial return. This proved an exceptionally effective conclusion, powerfully communicating Saeng's resolve and aspiration to surmount her challenges regarding her new environment and driving.
919	9784	4	1	The author concludes in this manner because it represents a symbolic rebirth. The story’s ending suggests that Saeng intends to progress with her life, drawing a parallel to the hibiscus plant. Just as the flora recommences its cycle by budding, she, too, will initiate a fresh start. It further demonstrates her determination to continue her existence in her new locale, refusing to let her relocation from Vietnam devastate her. She aspires to rebuild her life entirely. The conclusion acts as an open-ended resolution, indicating her story remains unfinished and potential for advancement persists. It also reveals her refusal to be governed by past failures, portraying her as a resilient individual resolved to overcome adversity.
920	9785	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it constitutes a compelling finale that captures the reader's engagement. Moreover, it reveals the protagonist's steadfast determination to pass her examination, thereby characterizing the narrative as one of resolve. This rationale explains the author's decision to culminate the story with this particular passage.
921	9786	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate Saeng's resolve to attempt the endeavor anew. An instance of her renewed determination occurs when she observes the plant and comprehends its symbolic significance to her. A further example is her declaration to cultivate the hibiscus personally, thereby preserving the associated memories perpetually. This rationale elucidates the author's decision to conclude the story thusly.
922	9787	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that since the hibiscus is planted, its endurance through the winter will be observed. When spring arrives and the plant remains viable, she can then proceed to retake the examination. The author appears to draw a parallel between the hibiscus and the protagonist's life, including the obstacles she will encounter; thus, the plant's survival signifies that circumstances will be favorable for her to return and undertake the test again.
923	9788	4	1	"The final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" conveys determination and personal maturation. Saeng declares that when ""this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the hibiscus will blossom, Saeng will emerge and persevere through her own figurative winter to endeavor toward passing her examination. She articulates this as a realization that she cannot remain despondent indefinitely. Success necessitates her determination, and the ensuing season will represent a renewal, a fresh commencement culminating in a beauty analogous to a blooming hibiscus."
924	9789	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho, concluded her narrative with the paragraph describing Saeng's intention to retake her driver's test when the geese return and the hibiscus blooms, intending to conclude on an optimistic note. Initially, Saeng, having recently relocated from Vietnam, failed her test. Discovering a plant reminiscent of Vietnam initially provoked sadness, as she felt too distraught to utter the word ""home."" Therefore, by concluding with a description of positive future prospects, Saeng can focus on these and divert her mind from her troubles."
925	9790	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a significant reason. In a sense, she is releasing her immediate disappointment and will await another opportunity to attempt the test again. Discovering the flower proves beneficial because it provided a connection for her and her mother, thereby improving her emotional state. This is evidenced by her statement: ""when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""
926	9791	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate the protagonist Saeng's evolution from the story's inception to its conclusion. It reveals a nascent, albeit modest, confidence she has acquired. This denouement further underscores the profound impact of the ""Winter Hibiscus"" upon her, by evoking recollections of her native land. Had Saeng not encountered the hibiscus, she would not have begun to reminisce about her former home. This reflection not only prompted memories of her past but also facilitated a comparison between her new and old environments. Through this process, she recognized that existence in @LOCATION1 is not so dire and that she retains a fragment of her homeland daily. This epiphany furnished her with sufficient hope and confidence to endeavor the driving examination anew. The ending conveys Saeng's transformed perspective toward @LOCATION1 and her incremental acquisition of optimism and self-assurance."
927	9792	4	1	The author elects to conclude the narrative thusly to sear the story's moral into the reader's consciousness. She posits that one perpetually possesses an opportunity for renewal, just as the flower recommences its cycle and receives another chance to blossom, symbolizing the capacity to begin afresh and reattempt, analogous to the girl's intention regarding the examination. She will retake the test concurrently with the flower's resurgence, thereby allowing the plant's budding to bolster her resolve and instill hope.
928	9793	4	1	I contend that the author concludes the story in this specific manner because it addresses both thematic elements. The author endeavors to convey that, upon her next attempt at the driving test in spring, the hibiscus will furnish her with the requisite confidence to succeed. The author thereby unifies the protagonist's personal resolve with the symbolic resonance of the natural world.
929	9794	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the narrative in a fashion that signifies her desire for a new beginning. This is evidenced when she informs her mother, ""In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again,"" indicating her aspiration to start over and assimilate into her new nation. Furthermore, her decision to postpone the test until the seasons transition, stating ""when the snow melts and the geese return,"" demonstrates her pursuit of a completely clean slate for her subsequent attempt. This rationale elucidates the author's chosen conclusion for the story."
930	9795	4	1	"I believe the author concludes the story in that manner to signify the passage of time. As time progresses, she will have matured further and may consequently feel prepared to retake the test, now possessing prior experience. Additionally, the budding hibiscus will provide a sense of comfort and tranquility, as it evokes a more secure, homelike atmosphere. The phrase ""hibiscus is budding"" indicates the flower's new beginning, a cycle in which she will concurrently partake."
931	9796	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate her necessity to acclimate to the foreign nation. She resolves to wait until the hibiscus begins budding. The plant's budding signifies its adaptation to a novel environment, paralleling Saeng's own experience. The story demonstrates that Saeng is unaccustomed to her new country; she weeps upon seeing the plants as they evoke memories of her native home. The flora also provides her solace. Once she adapts to the new country, she will subsequently retake the examination.
932	9797	4	1	The author concludes this story with Saeng's silent vow, made in the spring when the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus buds, to retake the examination. This resolution stems from Saeng's failure to pass her test and her anticipation of her mother's displeasure, which initially motivated her to acquire the flower. Had she not failed the assessment, she likely would not have procured the plant in the first instance.
933	9798	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with Saeng's vow to herself to underscore the flower's profound significance. For instance, the hibiscus instills determination by evoking memories of her homeland. Saeng declares, “and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The hibiscus flower bolsters her confidence, reminding her of her former life in Vietnam prior to relocating. Consequently, the author selects this specific paragraph to symbolize the flower's immense importance."
934	9799	4	1	She feels a profound connection to this hibiscus plant because it reminds her of her homeland. She implicitly suggests that when the hibiscus reveals its nascent buds, she will similarly emerge. The plant must strive to produce flowers, and the scene necessitates the snow's melting, implying that she must likewise shed her detrimental habits and fulfill the requirements to pass the examination, all while preserving the memory of her origins. “Vowed silently to herself…then I will take that test again.”
935	9800	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the final paragraph to signify that when the season for budding returns, she will resume her explorations. She will aspire to learn more about the hibiscus and its properties, eagerly anticipating its care as it begins to bud. This thematic resonance is the reason for concluding the narrative with that particular paragraph."
936	9801	4	1	"This paragraph serves several distinct purposes. It illustrates how the budding flower will provide her with emotional solace by evoking memories of her homeland, as evidenced when she remarks, ""a blossom or two would have blown into the well."" Furthermore, it demonstrates her gradual adaptation to her new environment; upon observing the geese, she reflects that ""many things she had previously perceived as strange had become, almost familiar."" This signifies her successful adjustment and burgeoning appreciation for her new life. The paragraph's significance lies in its portrayal of her transformative personal journey."
937	9802	4	1	The author conveys that she will be sufficiently prepared once the flowers commence their growth and the geese initiate their return; at that juncture, she will be ready.
938	9803	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph following Saeng's failure of the driver's examination. She implies that once the climate becomes milder and the flora begins to flourish, she will likely attempt the test again with the aspiration of succeeding. Her failure is explicitly stated: ""As Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test."" One may infer that the snowy conditions contributed to her errors during the examination. In conclusion, this rationale explains the author's decision to end the story with this particular reflection."
939	9804	4	1	"In ""The White Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the statement, ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to establish a specific point. She requires all of those conditions to be met for her to feel sufficiently composed to attempt the test once more."
940	9805	4	1	The author concluded the narrative in this manner because the plant symbolizes the new beginning that Saeng requires. Having failed her test and needing solace, she visited a greenhouse and purchased a hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland. Simultaneously, the plant signified that her new home represented another fresh start. The hibiscus provides Saeng with renewed optimism that starting over can be positive and that upon her next attempt, she will pass the examination.
941	9806	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several reasons; primarily, he intends to culminate by describing the geese. Additionally, he appreciates botanical life and the seasonal cycles of budding flora. He resolved to undertake that examination in the spring. He eagerly anticipates the snow's thaw, thereby enabling him to take the test.
942	9807	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to evoke the identical environment and all the aspirations she possessed previously when she undertook the examination.
943	9808	4	1	The author’s lexical choices in the story’s conclusion, I believe, conveyed to the reader that the narrative persists. However, I contend that the test functions to evoke memories of her home.
944	9809	4	1	The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She concludes with this because the narrative commences with Saeng failing her driver's license test. Furthermore, she considered the Winter Hibiscus auspicious after its departure and her familiarity with the geese; she associated these elements, hence her statement regarding the geese's return and the melting snow. That is the rationale for her declaration.
945	9810	4	1	I believe Saeng concluded with this narrative because there is perpetually an opportunity to redress the past, provided circumstances permit, signifying that she did not pass the test. I perceive that her statement, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” implies that despite the present snow, a subsequent spring always offers renewal, much like a garden. This analogy relates to Saeng; although she failed the test, there invariably exists another chance to compensate for that loss, to reattempt and strive for success.
946	9811	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative of ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's silent vow to retake the examination in spring, as the snow recedes, the geese reappear, and the hibiscus buds. This winter hibiscus symbolizes her profound nostalgia for her former homeland. The plant is not authentic, as she haltingly clarifies, ""not the kind we had at—at home,"" yet its eventual budding signifies that while her affection for her past home will persist, she will have acclimated more thoroughly to her present surroundings. The geese's return to their home metaphorically suggests she will ultimately establish a place she can call home within this new environment. Upon achieving this sense of belonging, she will feel prepared to ""take the test"" and resume ordinary activities. The author selected this concluding sentence to illustrate Saeng's eventual integration into her new existence."
947	9812	4	1	"The author concluded the narrative in this manner to convey a tone of optimism. Analogous to the geese's return, Saeng is confident in her capacity to reattempt the examination, assured of her eventual success. In the story, she reflects, ""Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This signifies that upon her initial arrival, the unfamiliarity of her surroundings was disconcerting. However, through sustained residence, her environment has grown customary, as she now comprehends the cyclical patterns of life there, solidifying it as her home."
948	9813	4	1	"The reader interprets the author's concluding paragraph as illustrating the protagonist's resolve to endeavor once more and retake the examination. In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng initially failed a test, but encountering the flower evoked potent memories from her past, compelling her decision to attempt it again as circumstances improve. Furthermore, upon observing the geese migrating overhead, she recognized their inevitable return following winter; with spring's arrival, her flower—a vessel for positive recollections—will bloom, and she will retake and pass the assessment. These elements substantiate the reasoning behind the author's chosen conclusion."
949	9814	4	1	The author concludes the story in this fashion to articulate the protagonist's profound affection for her homeland, its natural verdancy, and her mother. She yearns for the return of spring's vitality. Consequently, she will undertake the personal challenge of overcoming her sense of displacement, which is the fundamental reason for the story's concluding sentiment.
950	9815	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative in this manner to underscore the protagonist's determination and to cultivate a sense of anticipation for the reader. This is evident because Saeng is demonstrably resolved to succeed, yet the unresolved ending generates suspense regarding her subsequent actions and ultimate outcome."
951	9816	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's acclimation to her new environment. Toward the text's conclusion, Saeng observes that numerous elements she initially perceived as alien have since become recognizable. The winter hibiscus provided solace, evoking memories of her homeland. Her allusion to ""the spring when the snows melt"" signifies her growing familiarity with ""the quiet repetition of season upon season."" The geese, forming a distinctive V-formation, are also becoming a familiar sight. This final paragraph serves as an effective denouement, demonstrating Saeng's increasing comfort within her new surroundings and her optimistic outlook toward the future."
952	9817	4	1	Upon their return, Saeng resolved inwardly that in the spring, when the snows thaw, the geese reappear, and this hibiscus buds, she would retake the examination. The author's principal objective in these lines was to captivate the reader by crafting a concluding segment that underscores her adaptation to circumstances. Saeng cherishes the singularity of flora, and she likewise derives comfort from recollections of her native land.
953	9818	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to convey her intention to await a brief period, until vegetation is plentiful, so that if she fails again, she will possess something to sustain her. For instance, when Saeng failed the examination, she endeavored to surmount her disappointment by procuring an item reminiscent of her homeland, thereby invoking memories of the past. Another illustration occurs when Saeng experienced ""a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral,"" causing her to disregard all current tribulations, from relocating to failing her test; this sensation focused her entirely on feeling at home once more. In summation, the author's conclusion fosters the conviction that Saeng overcomes her difficulties by recollecting memories, such as the plant that evoked her native country."
954	9819	4	1	It is posited that the author concludes the narrative in this manner to demonstrate that Saeng will persevere into the following year. She remarked that all the unfamiliar elements seemed peculiar upon her initial arrival, yet they have since become second nature. The hibiscus is perceived as a vessel of hope and inspiration for her. She ultimately comprehends that she is in her new location to remain and cannot return to Vietnam. Consequently, she must accept that this is now her home, and it is evident she is progressing toward that acceptance.
955	9820	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because she maintains faith in a new commencement. Saeng draws a parallel between herself and the hibiscus. When the ""hibiscus is budding,"" she will retake the examination, indicating that as the plant recommences its life cycle, so too will she. Saeng perceives that if the hibiscus is ""strong enough to endure the cold winter,"" then she possesses sufficient fortitude to pass her driver's test and reside in a new nation. Winter and cold symbolize demise, while spring signifies renewal or a genesis. Saeng resolves, ""in the spring... I will take the test again,"" which represents a fresh beginning and a newfound hope for her."
956	9821	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the examination in the spring. This resolution demonstrates that despite the protagonist's initial failure, she possesses the resolve to attempt once more. The returning geese and the budding hibiscus symbolize a cyclical renewal, paralleling Saeng's own commitment to begin anew. She reasons that if these natural entities persevere in their endeavors, she can similarly strive and ultimately prevail. Furthermore, this illustrates the inherent determination within all living beings to fulfill their principal objectives. The flower strives to re-bud, the geese endeavor to return each spring, and the protagonist endeavors to pass her assessment. Minfong Ho employs this concluding statement for inspirational purposes, to encourage individuals to persist on life's journey and to reiterate attempts after failure, thereby providing the impetus to continue living with fortitude."
957	9822	4	1	In the story's final paragraph, Saeng pledges to herself that she will retake the driving test in the spring. The author concludes with this passage to illustrate the hope nature instills within her. She depicts serene natural elements, such as the geese and the hibiscus, from which she derives strength because they evoke memories of her homeland. Consequently, she perpetually retains a fragment of her past. Throughout the narrative, Saeng identifies with nature and draws resilience from it. Her mother maintains a garden, and Saeng relates to it through her distinct history, favoring natural foods like bitter melons over processed alternatives. This concluding segment reveals the hope that the beautiful natural world from her native land has provided Saeng, ultimately assisting her adaptation to a new environment.
958	9823	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify Saeng's prospective fortification. This implies she will attain greater comfort within her new surroundings and experience diminished longing for her home. Furthermore, she endeavored throughout the year but ultimately failed her objective, as she did not procure the requested item for her grandmother and expended her resources elsewhere. This contextualizes the author's rationale for incorporating this concluding passage into the story, thereby providing a resolution to Saeng's annual struggle.
959	9824	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the protagonist, Saeng, adapting and exerting her utmost effort within her new lifestyle. For instance, her vow in the final passage—""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again""—implies a redoubled commitment to her endeavors within her unfamiliar environment and circumstances. In conclusion, the author utilizes this paragraph to demonstrate an individual's process of acclimatizing to profound change."
960	9825	4	1	The author incorporates this element to employ metaphors that elucidate Saeng's personal experiences and emotional state.
961	9826	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's profound empathy. She aspires to assist her mother with the garden because she had previously disappointed her. For instance, she experiences remorse for upsetting her mother, and while her mother is gardening, she offers, “Here, let me help, mother,” because her mother’s delicate beauty moved her. When Saeng confessed to failing the driving test, she deliberately avoided her mother's gaze, as stated, “Saeng didn’t dare look her mother in the eye,” demonstrating her concern for her mother’s reaction. Ultimately, however, her mother expressed happiness about the plant, stating, “It’s a beautiful plant, I’m glad you got it,” revealing the close relationship between mother and daughter. This is why Saeng’s sympathy and her resolve for self-improvement are conveyed in the story’s conclusion.
962	9827	4	1	The narrative “Winter Hibiscus” concerns a young girl who prioritizes horticulture over academic pursuits. The provided conclusion posits that when spring arrives and the winter hibiscus has perished, she will pass the school examination she previously failed. Presently, Saeng’s focus rests solely upon the winter hibiscus; for example, the declaration, “I paid over nineteen dollars for it,” indicates she expended all her funds on this plant rather than on sustenance. Furthermore, the statement “I failed the test,” accompanied by Saeng’s tears, suggests her failure resulted from preoccupation with the hibiscus. In summary, during the spring, once the winter hibiscus is absent, Saeng will redirect her attention toward academics rather than gardening, potentially enabling her to pass the examination and subsequently resume her horticultural hobby.
963	9828	4	1	The author possesses a compelling rationale for concluding the narrative in this manner. The protagonist, Saeng, relocates to the United States from Vietnam and subsequently fails her driver's test. Having not yet acclimated to American life, upon encountering a familiar hibiscus plant, she purchases it to evoke memories of Vietnam. The author illustrates that since Saeng planted the hibiscus in winter, its anticipated bloom in spring signifies her readiness to reattempt the driver's test, symbolizing her eventual adaptation to life in the United States. The story’s theme suggests that when moving from one's homeland, retaining objects that evoke that culture provides a comforting connection. Therefore, the author appropriately commences and concludes with the same subject.
964	9829	4	1	The author concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with a statement about retaking the driver’s test in spring to convey themes of adaptation and a determined resolve for success. The protagonist, Saeng, is a recent immigrant. Because America is not her homeland, numerous aspects of life remain unfamiliar, and the narrative depicts her struggle to adapt. For instance, upon seeing the “Madagascar periwinkle” she reflects, “how strange to see it in a pot,” because “Back home it just grows wild.” The story’s final sentence is symbolic; the mention of returning geese signifies adaptation to circumstances, mirroring Saeng’s own efforts, and she recognizes their patterns are becoming familiar. The ultimate line, “I will take that test again,” epitomizes the determination Saeng exhibits throughout the story. She is resolved not only to pass her driver’s test but to surmount other challenges. For example, while planting the hibiscus, Saeng notes “the soil was cold and hard,” complicating her efforts. Despite the difficulty, she successfully “dug out a hole,” recognizing the plant's resilience through winter, just as she will possess the fortitude to overcome obstacles with perseverance. The concluding sentence is profoundly significant, expressing crucial themes and providing valuable insight into Saeng’s character.
965	9830	4	1	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to establish the symbolic theme. In the narrative, the hibiscus represents significant concepts for Saeng—confidence, beauty, and adaptation—qualities she can apply to herself and her memories of her homeland. Having failed her driving test, she purchased the hibiscus to console her homesickness. The hibiscus serves as a metaphor for Saeng herself; it is the same plant, yet growing in a different environment, just as she remains the same individual in a new home. The final paragraph's significance resides in the hibiscus budding. Its blossoming symbolizes her homeland, representing Saeng’s enduring affection for it. When the author wrote “then I will take that test again,” it alludes to the newfound confidence she will possess once the hibiscus blooms, reinforcing the metaphorical connection between the plant and the person.
966	9831	4	1	"The author, @PERSON1, concludes the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng's commencement of a new beginning. In the spring, as the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus commences budding, @CAPS1 to her existence signifies her fresh start. Although she @MONTH1 yearn for her former life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine-toothed comb, she is making a concerted effort and ""take that test again..."" By referencing the examination, she demonstrates her refusal to capitulate to the ""@CAPS2 of loss"" and to her profound sorrow."
967	9832	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's vow, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" because she is affirming that the hibiscus provides her solace and once the plant is thriving, she will feel sufficiently assured to undertake the examination. In reality, deriving comfort from a plant may appear naive; however, her consolation stems not from the plant itself but from its evocation of her homeland, for which she feels profound nostalgia. Once the plant flourishes, reminiscent of her tropical home, she is convinced it will provide sufficient comfort to enable her to pass the test, which explains the author's concluding paragraph."
968	9833	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that as the plant flourishes, so too will Saeng. After failing the driving examination, Saeng visits a greenhouse and discovers a hibiscus, which evokes memories of her authentic home in Vietnam where similar plants grew. The plant subsequently triggers recollections of numerous memories, offering her solace despite her sorrow. She utilizes this plant as an instrument for comfort, assisting her in reflecting upon her origins and positive recollections to elevate her spirits. To bolster her confidence, she resolves to plant it. ""The 'winter hibiscus' was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it."" She then observes geese flying overhead, which serves as a symbol for that day, a memento for the following year. ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" she will retake the test. These elements revive positive memories that fortify her resolve."
969	9834	4	1	Saeng must retake the examination to improve her academic standing. She expresses apprehension regarding the snow, and in the spring, she is concerned about the flower being covered. Saeng's mother permitted her to assist with the peppers and melons and subsequently allowed her to prepare the evening meal.
970	9835	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to convey that Saeng is not relinquishing her pursuit of passing the test. The author intends to inform the readers of her persistent hope, as the statement, ""then I will take that test again,"" unequivocally affirms her enduring determination. The author wishes to emphasize Saeng's resolve to persevere with her test and to discover the appropriate flower, which elucidates the rationale for the story's concluding paragraph."
971	9836	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph because winter represents a period of dormancy preceding spring's resurgence of vitality; consequently, Saeng would feel more motivated to excel on the examination. Saeng is analogous to the plant, enduring and apprehensive throughout the winter before blossoming magnificently in the spring. Furthermore, the memories evoked by the winter hibiscus plant inspired her to cease dwelling upon the past and to progress resolutely toward the future.
972	9837	4	1	He composed this passage because he is addressing meteorological transformations.
973	9838	4	1	The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph because she is essentially drawing a parallel between the plants and herself, signifying that as the plant blooms, she will too by undertaking the test. Her rationale could be that she reluctantly realized many things previously perceived as strange had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. She essentially emulated the geese by lifting her head, observing their distinctive V-formation etched against the evening sky as they faded into the distance. This is why I believe the author included this to conclude the story, because she was comparing herself to the geese and acted accordingly.
974	9839	4	1	The author includes the final quote because he wants her dream to be realized. He describes how she realized that many things she had previously thought strange, through the quiet repetition of the seasons, had become almost familiar to her now. Saeng is from Vietnam, and her family possesses an American dream, so the author desires for her family to adapt to their new life in America.
975	9840	4	1	She articulates this because it is currently winter, a season when flowers struggle to grow due to the cold. Thus, she is implying that when spring returns, she will retake the test, analogous to flowers growing again. In conclusion, this rationale explains the author's stated conclusion at the paragraph's end.
976	9841	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to evoke a sense of hope and determination for the future that resided within Saeng at that moment. Throughout the story, it appeared as though Saeng was succumbing to despair upon reminiscing about her homeland; she was not faring well in her new country, a realization that crystallized when she failed her driving test. However, upon walking past the flower shop and observing the plants that once bloomed so freely and beautifully in her native land confined within tiny pots yet fighting to survive, she saw a reflection of her own struggle in @LOCATION1. As she commenced planting her hibiscus, she again drew a parallel to herself, which is precisely why, when her plant blooms so splendidly in the spring, she will consequently pass that test.
977	9842	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this statement because it conveys a meditation concerning how the hibiscus is already budding in the winter and how all of the geese will ultimately return home to remain there, as they despise the winter season.
978	9843	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several reasons. One rationale pertains to the transformation in Saeng's attitude. At the story's commencement, Saeng is despondent and lacks hope for adapting to her new environment; by incorporating that paragraph at the conclusion, it demonstrates that she now possesses hope and refuses to capitulate. Another reason this paragraph effectively concludes the narrative is to illustrate that life persists even in the most arduous circumstances. The implication that a new season will commence figuratively reveals that Saeng will not perpetually feel this way and that she, too, will undergo change. Thus, the story is concluded with that paragraph for several compelling reasons.
979	9844	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, I believe, because after the girl failed her test, the bud reminds her of her grandmother's long, grey hair, which ostensibly bestows upon her good fortune. Therefore, when the winter concludes and the spring arrives, the buds begin to reemerge, and that is the moment she will retake her test. This is the author's justification for making this statement the final sentence of the story.
980	9845	4	1	I will explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason the author does so is that it conveys Saeng's confidence. It also indicates her refusal to surrender. Furthermore, it demonstrates her readiness to elevate her abilities to a superior level. This is the rationale for the author's concluding the story with the paragraph.
981	9846	4	1	"The author likely intended to illustrate the hopeful resolution of Saeng's complex dilemma. In the phrase, ""when they come back,"" the author presumably refers to the hibiscus flowers, which embody cherished memories of her homeland. The narrative portrays Saeng's struggle to adapt to her new existence through a symbolic ""test"" of planting the buds, reminiscent of her actions with her grandmother. This test signifies the successful assimilation into her new life. Consequently, the author concludes the story with a paragraph indicating Saeng's definitive intention to undertake that test once more."
982	9847	4	1	"The author elected to conclude the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s resolve to acclimate to her new existence. In the third paragraph on the second page, the author notes, “Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile… That at least, she could hold onto.” Following her unsuccessful driver’s test, Saeng felt profoundly alienated and solitary. She desperately regarded the flower as a memento of her native Vietnam. The blossom evoked consoling memories, prompting her to purchase one of the plants and return home. After a conversation with her mother, Saeng comprehends that she must reconcile with her new environment, analogous to the flower adapting to its unfamiliar surroundings. By concluding the story with the stated sentence, the author conveys to the reader that Saeng must ""blossom"" within her new home to prosper, a process requiring time, just as the flower needs time to establish its roots."
983	9848	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph, presumably to convey a sense of conviction that Saeng would willingly repeat the entire process if necessary. For instance, the vow, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" fundamentally signifies her readiness to undertake that pivotal step and seize the opportunity. The author thereby concludes the story with this tone of assurance and fortitude, affirming Saeng's resilient spirit."
984	9849	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” This conclusion provides an optimistic conclusion, anticipating her retaking the examination and succeeding. Furthermore, the author ends in this manner to reflect Saeng’s burgeoning self-belief, as she makes a solemn vow to accomplish a specific goal. This internal commitment will ideally furnish further encouragement and motivation for her forthcoming endeavors.
985	9850	4	1	The author concludes the story with a paragraph that essentially delineates the impending winter, a period when life will diminish only to reemerge the following spring. This reference pertains directly to the plant. The narrative suggests she is preserving the memories it evoked and the reflections prompted by her sensory engagement with the flower. Saeng is eagerly anticipating the flower's budding next spring and the novel experiences she will subsequently encounter, symbolizing her hope for renewal and personal growth.
986	9851	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate her evolving attitude; having gained greater self-awareness, she is now resolved to apply her determination to any necessary task, intending to retake the examination with a sense of pride and renewed effort in the spring following the snow's departure.
987	9852	4	1	"The author selects the concluding paragraph to convey several thematic elements. Primarily, the denouement establishes a tone of optimism. While the preceding narrative was melancholic, the finale introduces a sense of hope. The initial statement, ""a sense of loss so deep,"" contrasts with the final resolution, ""I will take that test again,"" illustrating her transformation from a cynical perspective to a hopeful one. Furthermore, the conclusion demonstrates Saeng's acceptance. The observation that the geese were ""almost familiar to her now"" indicates that despite her sorrow over leaving her homeland, she is adapting effectively. Consequently, the author concludes with an inspiring paragraph to signify a positive transformation."
988	9853	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to signify that when spring arrives, she will undertake the examination once more. This implies she will cultivate the flowers again, striving for their successful growth and hoping to avoid failure. This is exemplified by the statement, ""Mrs. Lambert liked it, this sharp bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue,"" which symbolizes the potential for a rewarding outcome after initial hardship."
989	9854	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to provide a positive resolution and convey an affirmative message: the protagonist will not capitulate simply because she encountered initial failure, demonstrating resilience and a commitment to persevere.
990	9855	4	1	The author included the final paragraph primarily to demonstrate her resilience and refusal to surrender easily. She remains determined to retake the test, perhaps anticipating favorable fortune from the hibiscus. After failing her driver's test, Saeng recognizes a flower during her walk home, purchases it from a florist, and presents it to her mother; they subsequently plant it together. This act may serve to evoke positive memories of her homeland or perhaps function as a token for good fortune, symbolizing hope and continuity.
991	9856	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this passage due to its symbolic resonance. The return of the geese in spring signifies a nascent beginning. As the hibiscus develops buds, it embodies renewed vitality. Concurrently, Saeng will also commence a fresh start. This denouement functions as a cliffhanger, compelling the reader to desire further resolution; aware of her initial failure, one yearns to discover if Saeng will succeed in the spring, thereby inaugurating a new chapter. All entities will experience renewal with the season's commencement; the hibiscus's bloom will symbolize her newfound capacity to surmount challenges, forge connections with her heritage, and discover solace during adversity. The hibiscus epitomizes these multifaceted concepts.
992	9857	4	1	The author culminates the story with this paragraph because it encapsulates the narrative's fundamental theme. Saeng observed the events of winter, and upon its cyclical return, she endeavors to commit its patterns to memory so that she may anticipate future developments with certainty.
993	9858	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate that by the conclusion of winter, she will have acclimated to her unfamiliar society, a process mirrored by the hibiscus's own seasonal adaptation.
994	9859	4	1	"The protagonist Saeng from Minfong Ho's ""The Winter Hibiscus"" has relocated from her native Vietnam to the United States. The young woman hoped to acquire her driver's license but was unsuccessful. The hibiscus she encounters provides comfort, evoking memories of Vietnam. Upon her purchase, her mother expresses concern regarding the cost but, recognizing her daughter's profound homesickness, becomes sympathetic. After planting the hibiscus, she observes the geese and comprehends their annual migratory adaptation. Inspired by both the geese and the hibiscus, Saeng resolves that ""in the spring, when the snow dissipates, the geese return, and this hibiscus buds, then I will retake the examination."""
995	9860	4	1	The author employs this paragraph as it functions perfectly as a conclusion. Herein, Saeng resolves that once the snow vanishes, she will retake the test. A subtextual reading reveals a deeper significance. She possesses a profound affinity for the hibiscus, and its revival in spring will imbue her with renewed fortitude to attempt the test again. Her experience demonstrates the plant's significant influence upon her, as it powerfully recalls her former home. Furthermore, it suggests that all entities merit a second opportunity, exemplified by her test. By spring, she will have resided in her new location for several months and will have adjusted to her novel circumstances. Presently, she is merely nostalgic, despite this new place being her home. Thus, the hibiscus is beneficial, serving as a tangible connection to her past.
996	9861	4	1	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate the surmounting of adversities. The story delineates the numerous difficulties Saeng encounters upon departing her native land and arriving at her new residence. Throughout the described day, she fails a driving examination, forgoes lunch with her companion, and expends all her funds on a plant reminiscent of her homeland. Furthermore, this passage demonstrates how the hibiscus serves as her symbol. The flora is displaced from its native environment and confronts numerous hardships: the cold, its constrictive pot, and even its general surroundings. In every aspect, the plant exists in circumstances identical to the protagonist's, and the final paragraph is employed to connect them.
997	9862	4	1	The author employs this paragraph to convey the sentiment that the snow will dissipate in the springtime, signifying that all challenges are transient.
998	9863	4	1	The final paragraph conveys a singular, profound message: to emulate the hibiscus and retake the examination of life. The protagonist will return in the spring, just as the hibiscus will blossom anew. Thus, the concluding passage possesses a significant and resonant meaning.
999	9864	4	1	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's willingness to adapt and her aspiration to achieve this by spring. She desires to feel settled in her new environment and to reminisce about her former home without succumbing to emotional distress. The author also utilizes the geese as a metaphor because they must depart their home annually and endure the journey, thus providing a model for Saeng to similarly persevere.
1000	9865	4	1	"The author concludes with this statement to underscore that failure necessitates a period for recovery before attempting anew. Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. Subsequently, she visits a greenhouse where she encounters flora from her homeland, prompting her to purchase a hibiscus. This reminded her of how circumstances had altered and how relocation induces change. Initial experiences in a new place can be disagreeable, yet one eventually acclimates, much like her initial perception of the geese's ""V"" formation as peculiar, though now it is familiar. Following her failure, Saeng comprehends that despite unfavorable changes, she must endeavor to try again."
1001	9866	4	1	She concluded the paragraph in that manner to demonstrate her profound commitment to gardening and her refusal to resume the activity until the geese return.
1002	9867	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to illustrate Saeng's profound reverence for nature, which she would never intentionally harm, and to provide a resonant and affirmative closing statement, while also indicating her need to retake the examination.
1003	9868	4	1	The author concludes the narrative to illustrate her resolute determination, signifying that she will persistently endeavor to adapt to her new existence until she fully accepts her unfamiliar environment. It further suggests that, akin to the burgeoning buds, she will experience growth, albeit more psychological than physical. Her decision to retake the examination signifies her self-assurance that she will mature into an individual who, while nostalgic for her homeland, ultimately embraces her new residence, which justifies the author's chosen conclusion.
1004	9869	4	1	She articulates her intention to commence anew with the arrival of spring, striving for improvement and determined to achieve greater success on her subsequent driving examination. The author likely concluded with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's persistent and tenacious character, demonstrating her refusal to capitulate and her commitment to intensified effort.
1005	9870	4	1	A reserved disposition necessitates meticulous and vigilant scrutiny.
1006	9871	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the cold was intolerable, or the author never wished to be present during the cold season. At that time, the temperature was truly frigid.
1007	9872	4	1	I contend that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several reasons. One reason is her intention to evoke sympathy for the hibiscus. Another rationale involves demonstrating Saeng's desire to earn her mother's profound pride, signifying that she refuses to concede defeat. This further supports the notion that Saeng possesses self-confidence and genuinely believes she can pass the examination. Ultimately, this final paragraph illustrates how Saeng wishes to convey that even an object as seemingly insignificant as a plant can enable her to overcome adversity and pursue her aspirations. The author selected this paragraph to conclude the story primarily to affirm that Saeng will persist in believing in herself.
1008	9873	4	1	"The author chooses to conclude the narrative with that sentence because the story principally concerns Saeng's failure of her driving test; however, upon seeing the hibiscus, she was reminded of home and consequently felt comforted. In a preceding paragraph, Saeng observes, ""And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar too,"" remarking on the flower's pleasant aroma and its recognizable quality. Saeng was already distressed from leaving her homeland, and subsequently failing her driving test exacerbated her dismay, yet the flower provided solace through its association with her origins. Therefore, the author employs that quotation to conclude the story, demonstrating that she will possess sufficient resolve to attempt again when the flower blooms."
1009	9874	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to provide emphasis. Saeng vowed that it would demonstrate how all life endures through hope and adaptation. She implies that when nature revives and proves its resilience, she will likewise persevere and subsequently retake the driving examination. The author also aims to establish that individuals must maintain faith in themselves and simply require time to acclimate to their environment. This rationale explains the author's chosen conclusion.
1010	9875	4	1	"In literature, authors conclude their works in various ways to achieve diverse effects. In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with this paragraph because it elicits a poignant effect on the reader and effectively synthesizes the central themes discussed. The initial example, from the conclusion's commencement, states ""Saeng vowed silently to herself."" Within this distinctive quotation, the author utilizes imagery, creating a mental picture of a solitary girl kneeling in the cold garden, whispering a silent promise. This excerpt produces a touching impact on the reader. Another justification for this conclusion is its capacity to encapsulate all the narrative's components. ""When the geese return and the hibiscus buds, I will take that test again."" This statement references the hibiscus, frequently mentioned throughout, the geese from the ending, and the initial test failure. In summary, that is the author's rationale for employing that paragraph as the conclusion for such a poignant story."
1011	9876	4	1	The author concludes that Saeng failed a winter examination, yet due to her affinity for the hibiscus, the spring will facilitate her retaking the test.
1012	9877	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that her failure does not signify the termination of her aspirations; she will recuperate and undertake the same endeavor the following year.
1013	9878	4	1	The author employs this concluding paragraph to demonstrate her intention to reattempt the examination and her acclimatization to unfamiliar surroundings. For instance, the narrative states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had previously considered strange had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This indicates her growing familiarity with her present environment and her willingness to afford it an opportunity, suggesting she no longer perceives it as negatively as she initially did when it was foreign.
1014	9879	4	1	Perhaps the author composed that final sentence because the protagonist, having undertaken an action and failed, now possesses the resolve to attempt it once more.
1015	9880	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with that paragraph because it synthesizes the central themes, illustrating Saeng's determination to surmount obstacles and employing the plant as a metaphor for adaptation. The hibiscus, representing Saeng, ""dies"" in winter, which is equivalent to her failing to acquire her driver's license; however, the plant's return symbolizes resilience and adjustment, clarifying why Saeng resolves to return and pass the test, having now adapted and become determined to overcome this challenge."
1016	9881	4	1	"Upon reading the quotation, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,"" from Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" I believe the author conveys that following the desolation of winter, Saeng will be prepared to confront the challenge anew and restore her self-assurance. She lifted her head and observed their distinctive ""V"" formation etched upon the evening sky, gradually receding into the distance. Upon reflection, I perceive that Saeng interpreted the geese's migration as a tacit affirmation that her resolution was correct and justified."
1017	9882	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate her profound desire and resolve to overcome the anguish of departing her homeland. Within the story, she visits a greenhouse, intending to assess her own resilience. There, she discovers a plant indigenous to her native country, which evokes poignant memories of her grandmother. Encountering additional flora reminiscent of her homeland, she is overwhelmed with emotion and weeps. This suggests she shared an authentic, profound connection with her grandmother; upon leaving their country, she likely mourned for an extended period, as if a fundamental component of her very soul had been lost.
1018	9883	4	1	The author incorporates this paragraph to depict the girl's initial despair following her relocation to the United States, compounded by her failure on a driver's examination and the subsequent discovery that the plant she purchased was artificial. Furthermore, its inclusion demonstrates the subsequent elevation of her self-esteem, revealing her renewed confidence and determination to persevere rather than succumb to resignation. This progression completes a narrative arc from dejection to resilient self-belief.
1019	9884	4	1	The author concludes with those words to present a significant, albeit unfinished, metaphor within the narrative, which is self-explanatory in its comparison of Saeng and her test to the perennial nature of the winter hibiscus. They share a fundamental commonality: both ultimately return. Saeng returns to complete her examination, just as the winter hibiscus returns, buds, and flourishes again. I can personally relate to this concept; I recall entering a triathlon with the objective of securing first place, and I initially placed @NUM1 overall. The subsequent year arrived, I trained diligently for the event's return, and I ultimately placed @NUM2, thereby, akin to the winter hibiscus, I returned and successfully accomplished my goal.
1020	9885	4	1	The author includes that segment in the story because it discusses nature and the inherent beauty found within the natural world. There are the @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, the verdant tall grass, the white @CAPS3 fence, and the narrative itself incorporates those same varieties of natural elements, establishing a cohesive and evocative setting.
1021	9886	4	1	The author perceives the hibiscus as a symbol of a new beginning. For instance, she declares, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Given her initial failure and her acquisition of the plant, she anticipates passing upon her next attempt.
1022	9887	4	1	The author incorporates this paragraph to depict the season of spring, characterized by melting snow and returning geese. The narrative references winter, a period of continuous snowfall that ceases upon spring's arrival, allowing the accumulated snow to dissolve under the emerging sun. A primary reason for this inclusion is to illustrate the transformation in weather accompanying the seasonal shift.
1023	9888	4	1	She felt profound self-reproach for purchasing the mature hibiscus rather than seeds, which precipitated her tears as she recalled the beauty of their former plant. She resolves to retake the examination when the snow melts and flowers commence blooming. The author concluded the paragraph in this manner to signify an impending renewal with the coming year.
1024	9889	4	1	I contend that she included this passage to demonstrate the objective's profound significance to her. Her statement about retaking the test in spring implies a commitment to increased diligence, ensuring she executes everything correctly. This determination allows her to affirm her dedication to fulfilling commitments she deems important, which constitutes my interpretation of the paragraph's inclusion.
1025	9890	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph for several reasons: Saeng failed the examination, a hibiscus requires considerable time to bud, and the conclusion provides a satisfying resolution, particularly since undertaking a test amidst snowfall would be undesirable.
1026	9891	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey to readers the manner in which Saeng reveres the hibiscus. The author likely employs this conclusion to communicate that the hibiscus bestows upon Saeng a sense of fortune, and with this auspicious influence, she will ultimately pass her examination. The story illustrates the depth of Saeng's adoration for the plant; for instance, her approach to the hibiscus is described as reaching out to gently touch a petal, which felt smooth and cool. Consequently, the author utilizes the final paragraph to signify Saeng's veneration and how it instills within her a profound confidence.
1027	9892	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave readers in a state of conjecture regarding subsequent events. This is discernible from the tone of the final passage: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author thereby establishes a distinct tone of suspense, engaging the audience's anticipation for the future.
1028	9893	4	1	"By concluding the narrative in this manner within the short story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author fosters a sympathetic understanding in the reader for Saeng's struggle to adapt to a foreign country and her melancholic longing for her homeland. It appears the author intended to conclude with a powerful emphasis on Saeng's resilient character, thereby compelling the reader to reflect upon the preceding text. For example, the reiterated declaration, “I will take that test again,” provides a clear understanding that Saeng has not surrendered, instead revealing her determination to persevere and live with fortitude."
1029	9894	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng now possesses a definitive objective for which to strive. The author may have also selected this conclusion because she must endure a prolonged interval before she can retake the examination; concurrently, Saeng can anticipate observing the plant mature and become larger and more robust. These constitute the reasons for the author's decision to conclude with this particular paragraph.
1030	9895	4	1	The author concludes the story at this juncture to demonstrate Saeng's resolute refusal to capitulate. She merely established a future occasion to attempt the endeavor once more. Saeng aspires to succeed in this new environment and desires to secure a prosperous life, which motivates her to persistently undertake new challenges and persevere.
1031	9896	4	1	"The narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" chronicles a young immigrant's endeavor to assimilate into @LOCATION1. She possesses a particular affinity for tropical flora. The author's rationale for the concluding paragraph's structure is its provision of a fitting denouement. The departure of the geese and the subsequent floral growth symbolize her forthcoming attempt to integrate during the spring season.  The author likely selected this paragraph for the conclusion because it conveys the profound significance of the garden to Saeng, representing something deeply personal. Furthermore, as the snow dissipates, she intends to undertake the examination with the aspiration of ultimately securing her driver's license, marking a step forward in her new life.  The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to articulate a theme of new beginnings. Specifically, the hibiscus serves as a metaphor for such renewal. Her statement, ""When the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" signifies an impending fresh start. The plant's blossoming brings her joy and evokes memories of her grandmother, implying that by spring's arrival, she will be prepared to confront a new challenge, just as the hibiscus will be.  I believe the author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represents her homeland, yet the sight of geese flying south makes her realize that everyone must eventually leave home. Having come to terms with her circumstances, she will soon attempt her driver's examination again. The re-budding hibiscus will serve as a symbolic indicator of her readiness to endeavor once more.  The author concludes with that paragraph to demonstrate her persistent effort and desire for another opportunity. She has recognized her errors and is prepared to begin anew; although she failed by attempting to cultivate her hibiscus in winter, she will try again when @DATE1 arrives. For instance, the story describes the ""winter hibiscus"" being planted, and as Saeng tamped the soil, a flock of Canada geese flew overhead, their calls faint yet distinctly familiar amidst the snow, thus justifying the paragraph as the story's conclusion."

1036	9901	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because she believes it will bring her fortune on the examination. When she returns to undertake the test, she will possess the solace of her homeland and the hibiscus plant to inspire her success. Upon retaking the test, she will be compelled to pass due to the reassurance of home, and she will be acclimated to the unfamiliar locale. To perform competently, she requires something to bolster her self-assurance. Possessing reminders of her home and current residence can substantially enhance her confidence.
1037	9902	4	1	She stated that she intended to retake the examination to demonstrate to her mother her capability to succeed this time, rather than dwelling upon her previous home.
1038	9903	4	1	"This demonstrates hope because she profoundly missed her homeland and discovered a measure of peace and serenity through the flowers, stating, ""That at least she could hold on to,"" referring to the bud. She was deeply distressed by homesickness, missing her grandmother washing her hair and applying a dok mallk. Since she possessed nothing else reminiscent of her homeland—the text mentions ""the fine-toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, her gentle grandmother""—she missed all these elements. Placing her in this situation has evoked not only a longing for her homeland's people but also its beauty, ensuring she perpetually retains a part of home through the flower."
1039	9904	4	1	"In the final paragraph, the author employs the phrase ""when they come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test"" because Saeng has ultimately discovered solace. After relocating from her homeland, Vietnam, to the United States, she experienced profound homesickness. For instance, she encountered a flower evoking memories of her past life. She recalled her grandmother's scent because of the plant. Consequently, upon arriving home to her mother, she presented the flower, and they planted it together, granting Saeng a sense of relief. Therefore, she vowed to take the test upon spring's arrival, as she now carried an internal sense of home providing encouragement and fortitude. This also illustrates that even in an unfamiliar and challenging environment, something can always trigger memories of one's origins and the time spent there."
1040	9905	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate her resolute determination to pass the examination. It is analogous to the birds migrating south; she too can succeed.
1041	9906	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph to illustrate Saeng's enduring optimism and her conviction in eventual success. This demonstrates her persistent hope and belief in her capacity to rectify her initial failure. Furthermore, it reveals her resolve to adapt to her new environment and cultivate relationships. Saeng's determination to pass the examination upon her next attempt is also emphasized. Ultimately, the conclusion accentuates the central conflict and portrays Saeng's successful resolution of it.
1042	9907	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to underscore the theme of life's continuity. Saeng's vow, linked to the natural cycles of spring, proves her progression forward, a universal experience shared by all living creatures. Moreover, her relocation to a new nation does not preclude her from cherishing elements of her native culture, as evidenced by her culinary preference. The concluding paragraph is thus employed to affirm the persistent endurance of life.
1043	9908	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to indicate that Saeng's immediate concern is not the test's timing but the botanical specimen she discovered. She recognizes the lengthy interim before the next examination affords her ample opportunity for more dedicated study and preparation. The author also employs this conclusion to convey to readers that, following her initial failure, Saeng is resolute in retaking the test, determined that nothing will prevent her from ultimately succeeding.
1044	9909	4	1	The narrative advocates for perseverance, concludes with a structural parallel to its inception, and cautions against excessive attachment to the past; these are the reasons for the author's concluding paragraph. It demonstrates resilience, as the protagonist, despite failing her test, resolves to attempt it again. The cyclical structure, beginning and ending with the test, constitutes an effective literary technique. Finally, it illustrates the danger of clinging to the past, as a single reminder could provoke a collapse, which is why she takes the test to confront a familiar symbol without succumbing to despair.
1045	9910	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to impart a tone that is both uplifting and inspirational. Saeng expresses profound disappointment after failing the examination, indicating its significant importance to her. This conclusion also serves to highlight Saeng's profound dedication to ultimately passing the test. She is characterized as a sentimental yet dependable individual. The test likely involves fiscal prudence, and her objective is to garner her mother's esteem, which explains the paramount importance she places on achieving success. The author selected this conclusion to reinforce these central motivations.
1046	9911	4	1	In the narrative “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with the lines, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author employs these lines to re-establish the plant’s symbolic significance. The text indicates the plant buds in spring, following a period for growth and adaptation to a new environment. Just as the plant required that duration, so too did the protagonist, Saeng. Having recently immigrated from Vietnam and failed her driver’s examination, Saeng feels profoundly uncertain within her new culture. For instance, the text notes her preference for bitter melon, stating, “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac.” She evidently perceives herself as misunderstood and unaccepted; however, just as the plant will acclimate, so shall she.
1047	9912	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative by stating she will retake the examination in the spring, vowing silently until that season because spring evoked memories of home for Saeng. In Vietnam, numerous beautiful wild flowers existed. Saeng visits the floral shop to acquire a fragment of her homeland. The description of the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind"" illustrates its altered state, as it also lacked buds. Having just failed her driving test, she required hope; thus, awaiting spring when the hibiscus will bloom again provides Saeng with a sense of home, which will instill the confidence necessary to succeed on her subsequent driving attempt."
1048	9913	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng's entire world is symbolized by the plants, and since they are dormant, her motivation is similarly absent until their return.
1049	9914	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author’s rationale is that memories from Saeng’s homeland provide profound comfort, so much so that she will pass her test with ease, as her anxiety will be alleviated. “It was like walking into another world,” Saeng remarked upon entering the florist shop after failing her driver’s test. It was as if she momentarily forgot her failure, preoccupied solely by the plants and flowers. The flowers transport her to a serene peace, fostering a sense of being at home and that everything will be satisfactory. This is why the author concludes with such a sentence: to demonstrate to readers that recollections of her homeland will facilitate her success on the driving examination.
1050	9915	4	1	The author may have concluded the story in that manner due to its title and initial narrative elements. Alternatively, the author may have chosen this conclusion to illustrate potential future developments. Ultimately, it constitutes an effective and fitting resolution for the narrative.
1051	9916	4	1	I remain uncertain as to the author’s rationale for concluding the narrative with this particular paragraph, though it is conceivable that its inclusion stems from the initial thematic direction she commenced.
1052	9917	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's profound determination. Having endured considerable hardship and longing for her homeland, she feels profoundly different and displaced, yet her resilience remains intact. Life progresses inexorably, and this passage demonstrates that Saeng will advance with it. The paragraph declares, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring will inevitably arrive, as the passage of time is unstoppable. The snow will thaw due to seasonal shifts, the geese will migrate homeward, and the hibiscus will blossom. Saeng adopts an optimistic perspective and resolves to align herself with these natural cycles. While she failed initially, her fortitude and willingness to reattempt are evident. She will perpetually cherish her memories of home, yet she is prepared to adapt to her new environment. The concluding paragraph ultimately reveals Saeng's resolute determination to succeed and endure in her new world.
1053	9918	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to demonstrate Saeng's self-assurance and her unwavering resolve to retake the examination. She proceeded to a corner of the vegetable patch and commenced digging a hole in the earth.
1054	9919	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to evoke a sense of hope and personal growth. The flower symbolizes Saeng's homeland, providing her with solace. It connects her with her emotions and serves as a reminder of her origins. The growth and flourishing of the hibiscus parallel Saeng's own development. When it blooms, she will possess a tangible connection to home and will feel prepared to retake the examination. The narrative concerns overcoming adversity and adapting to change. The visual, nearly lyrical depiction of the blooming hibiscus renders the reward for one's struggles profoundly more beautiful.
1055	9920	4	1	The author concludes the story on a hopeful note with this sentence. The beginning was decidedly negative, with Saeng failing her driver's test and her mother reprimanding her. However, this final sentence fills the reader with hope for the young protagonist. The author achieves this to illustrate that Saeng will ultimately adapt and persevere, whereas previously she was deeply distressed, as evidenced by her stammering admission, “I-I failed the test.” Saeng's subsequent recovery from this setback provides the reader with optimism, which is the author's intended effect.
1056	9921	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to articulate the theme of a new beginning. Since Saeng failed her examination and the plant will perish in winter, its springtime budding signifies renewal, and she will retake the test, representing a fresh opportunity to commence anew.
1057	9922	4	1	Saeng vowed silently to herself that in the spring, she would remain reserved, as she often preferred solitude. However, the arrival of spring presented a different circumstance entirely. Saeng adored the spring and its subsequent date, engaging in daily outdoor activities throughout the season. She was simply a pleasant individual.
1058	9923	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's resolve to reattempt her previous failure. Since the character is an avid gardener, the resurgence of her favored plant symbolizes her own decision to retry passing the examination.
1059	9924	4	1	The author concludes the story thusly because winter signifies a period of dormancy, where foliage vanishes, geese migrate, and flowers expire. This passage indicates that in spring, with nature's revival, she will recommence her test, analogous to initiating life anew.
1060	9925	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake her test in spring, as the snow melts, geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This ending signifies that after a period of failure and retreat, a time for resurgence and renewal inevitably arrives. Just as flora reemerges, one must persevere and attempt again to ultimately achieve their objective, which is the thematic lesson Minfong Ho intended to convey through this concluding passage."
1061	9926	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that final paragraph to establish the ultimate atmosphere. The author intended to demonstrate that Saeng will persevere and continue to acclimate to her unfamiliar environment. It rendered the story's conclusion heartening and inspirational. The denouement motivates the reader to likewise persist. The concluding section provides a paradigm for how the reader might also pledge self-improvement. The author understood that the final paragraph would serve as an inspiration and potentially assist a reader undergoing a comparable circumstance.
1062	9927	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph because, to her, the plant appears to evoke memories of her homeland, which pacifies her, and its budding imbues her with fortitude. Within the story, Saeng exists as a marginal figure, and upon seeing the plant, she perceives a fragment of her former life. The text indicates she becomes tremulous when attempting to articulate ""at home."" When she states ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" it signifies her readiness to accept this nation as her home, as the flower symbolizes her native land. The story's conclusion describes her growing accustomed to geese flying in a ""V"" formation, indicating her increasing acclimatization, and when prepared, she will retake her examination."
1063	9928	4	1	"The author incorporates the paragraph, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" to illustrate that the hibiscus functions as a symbol of temporal passage. Saeng utilizes the hibiscus to gauge the duration until she retakes her examination. The hibiscus further symbolizes the resilience to endure adversity. Saeng encountered difficulty with her test, yet the hibiscus exists to bolster her perseverance and preparation for the subsequent attempt. The plant also assists Saeng's mother in coping with the distress of witnessing her daughter's disappointment. The hibiscus aids the mother in maintaining optimism and prompts her to act supportively. In the narrative, the mother resolves to plant the hibiscus in the garden to uplift her daughter. The hibiscus exhibits potent symbolism, fortifying both Saeng and her mother throughout their tribulations."
1064	9929	4	1	"This concluding paragraph aligns with a central theme of the story: to persevere and continue striving in order to find comprehension and contentment in this world. Saeng is undertaking this ""test"" to ascertain her readiness to transform and adapt to her new milieu. She failed on this occasion. However, when circumstances are favorable and the hibiscus is prepared, she will endeavor once more to determine her preparedness to relinquish the past and embrace the present."
1065	9930	4	1	"She articulated this because she had failed to fulfill her expected duty, consequently stating she had failed. Her mother was momentarily angered but then desisted, declaring, ""I love it,"" and inquiring if she desired sustenance, so they proceeded inside. However, she interpreted the task as an assessment, thus vowing to perform correctly upon the next attempt."
1066	9931	4	1	"The author likely concluded the narrative with the ""test"" because it constitutes a significant element of Saeng's existence and cultural heritage."
1067	9932	4	1	The author's decision to conclude the narrative with this particular paragraph is multifaceted. Primarily, the ending evokes substantial emotional resonance, thereby ensuring the story remains compelling. Furthermore, it demonstrates a form of fortitude, not of a physical nature, but of psychological resilience. Saeng declares her intention to retake the examination despite her initial failure. This concluding passage also serves to illustrate the imperative of perseverance; it depicts her failure and maternal disappointment, yet emphasizes her resolve to persist and attempt the driving test again. Ultimately, the author employs this paragraph to project a powerful image of continuous effort and unwavering determination.
1068	9933	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with this sentence to underscore the profound dedication both the mother and her child share for horticulture. One may infer the young child's preferred plant is the hibiscus. It seems plausible that gardening constitutes their favored shared activity. This conclusion provides a satisfying resolution to the story. It simultaneously provokes a sense of inquiry for the reader, leaving them intrigued by the author's specific intention. In my estimation, this technique effectively imbues the narrative with a layer of compelling curiosity.
1069	9934	4	1	"The final lines of ""Winter Hibiscus"" are intended to offer a glimpse into the imminent future, demonstrating a shift in Saeng's perspective. Previously, Saeng had been nostalgically lamenting her native land and struggling to adapt to her new environment. The hibiscus serves as an inspiration, revealing that her new country possesses familiar elements from her past. Within this concluding statement, she achieves reconciliation with her current circumstances. The phrase regarding the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus signifies her acceptance of a natural passage of time; by recommitting to her driver's test, she will initiate her new life."
1070	9935	4	1	The author concluded the narrative by stating Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to convey a specific theme. After failing her test, Saeng encountered a familiar flower and ventured into a florist. There, she discovered numerous blossoms reminiscent of her homeland. Purchasing a hibiscus, she returned home and planted it with her mother, realizing the plant could endure the winter. Observing birds overhead, she recognized her own adaptation to life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus instilled in her the determination to persevere, confirming her ability to adapt. The author's central point was that the hibiscus provided the necessary courage and hope to retake the test and continue thriving in @LOCATION1.
1071	9936	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this final paragraph to illustrate Saeng's profound passion for botany and her unwavering annual commitment to this pursuit. Her genuine affection for plants and her anticipation to repeat the ritual are evident. The concluding segment effectively conveys immense dedication, underscoring how deeply she cherishes the spring season and the Hibiscus blossom.
1072	9937	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this line to demonstrate that, analogous to the hibiscus which adapts and struggles to survive in its non-native environment, Saeng will similarly persevere. She will not relinquish her endeavor to pass the examination and integrate into her new nation. This is substantiated earlier when her mother remarks upon the hibiscus, stating, “It’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters” (Ho @NUM1). Here, the author draws a parallel between the plant's endurance through adversity in foreign soil and Saeng's personal challenges. Both must demonstrate resilience to overcome difficult periods where no one, “not even her classmates or friends, or Mrs. Lambert” (Ho @NUM1), comprehended her profound sense of isolation and displacement. Therefore, her vow to retake the test constitutes a promise to herself to endure hardships and grow stronger, just as her winter hibiscus does.
1073	9938	4	1	The fundamental reason for her statement is that she was asserting how time precipitates change. She was essentially conveying that after a period, when circumstances evolve, she is confident her performance could also improve. This is illustrated by her gradually overcoming the nostalgia for her home in Vietnam and its associated memories, demonstrating that temporal progression brings transformation. This constitutes a fundamental logical principle that time inevitably fosters change. While I am confident in my overall interpretation of this concept's intended meaning, I ultimately believe Saeng articulated this because time intrinsically begets change.
1074	9939	4	1	The author's rationale for concluding the story in this manner is to underscore the plant's profound significance to the protagonist. It appears that, being displaced from her native country, she possesses few comforts within her new environment. Discovering a hibiscus in a location where she presumed it could not thrive provides her with the fortitude to confront any challenge. It is plausible that whatever obstacle @MONTH1 presents, the author suggests that the solace derived from the plant furnishes her with the requisite confidence and determination to ultimately accomplish her objective.
1075	9940	4	1	The author concludes the narrative thusly because the hibiscus and Saeng share significant parallels. Furthermore, the narrator draws a comparison between her and the returning geese. The geese symbolize her capacity for renewal, as she begins anew at driving school. The hibiscus signifies her resilience during a figurative winter, and with the ensuing spring, she recuperates and endeavors to take the test again. This symbolic resonance is the reason the narrator elected to conclude the story in this fashion.
1076	9941	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to facilitate a potential continuation. I interpret this conclusion as signifying her intention to renew her efforts with the arrival of spring, thereby granting both her and her plant a new beginning, which constitutes a fitting and resonant denouement.
1077	9942	4	1	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring to underscore several thematic parallels. One rationale is that the hibiscus, adapting to the spring, symbolizes Saeng’s own necessary adaptation to her new environment in the United States. Furthermore, just as the hibiscus begins to bud, Saeng has matured and gained sufficient wisdom to return and hopefully pass her driving examination. Ultimately, the text indicates her growing familiarity with her surroundings through seasonal repetition, mirroring the plant’s effortless acclimatization to its habitat and the changing seasons.
1078	9943	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng’s declaration to retake the test signifies that her initial experience constituted a trial of survival; the narrative's commencement marks the test's inception, while its conclusion finds her departing, yet she desires to return and witness the resulting growth. The author further implies a theme of taking one’s advantages for granted, suggesting a newfound awareness of previously unappreciated blessings.
1079	9944	4	1	"The ""Winter Hibiscus"" was now planted in the ground, and Saeng tamped down the soil surrounding it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks sounding clear and, indeed, comprehensible to Saeng at that moment."
1080	9945	4	1	The author incorporates this paragraph to demonstrate the profound impact of work ethic and the challenges inherent in adapting to a new environment. The phrase “not even @PERSON1 looked at it” reveals a palpable lack of appreciation, which can demotivate a new student and fail to instill a positive work ethic, thereby causing subsequent mental distress. Consequently, the girl feels neither comfortable nor enthusiastic about laboring on a project that would receive no acknowledgment.
1081	9946	4	1	The author concludes with this statement because she is resolute in passing the driving test that she had previously failed. For instance, she writes, “she vowed silently to herself.” When one vows to accomplish something, it typically signifies profound determination. All subsequent assertions confirm her sincere commitment. Consequently, the author employs this concluding sentence to demonstrate her unwavering dedication to the objective.
1082	9947	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with that paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will ultimately begin acclimating to her new environment. She will no longer invest excessive time reminiscing about her past. “And in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” This emotional release was arguably necessary for her to progress with her life."
1083	9948	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to indicate when Saeng will retake the examination; she will do so when the seasons change. Saeng is presumably embarrassed, which explains her desire for a prolonged wait. She took an extended walk home, pausing at a floral shop to distract herself from the failure. Saeng purchased a plant for her mother, who was initially displeased but, recognizing her daughter's distress, altered her disposition.
1084	9949	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story thusly to convey her persistent efforts and refusal to surrender. This interpretation is supported by her recent relocation from Vietnam to America and her consequent difficulty adjusting to the new life. The geese likely symbolize a creature perpetually adapting to new surroundings, suggesting that upon their return, she too will endeavor again to obtain her license.
1085	9950	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because Saeng now possesses a definitive objective. Alternatively, the author may have intended to signify the lengthy interval before she can reattempt the test, a period during which Saeng might wish to observe the plant mature, becoming larger and more resilient. These are the rationales for the author's chosen conclusion.
1086	9951	4	1	Saeng resolves that in spring she will retake the examination, and this constitutes a favorable conclusion to the narrative. It is a positive resolution because the story had illustrated the cessation of malevolence and the arrival of the vernal season, a beautiful period for flora. Spring represents a culmination, as it is a time of proximate endeavor and for undertaking the test again at that juncture, to deem it a satisfactory ending because resilient entities, such as Saeng and the burgeoning plant, persist and prosper. That is why it is a commendable conclusion for the plant that endures.
1087	9952	4	1	The author selects this conclusion due to the hibiscus's significance for Saeng. For her, it embodies resilience and solace. She recognizes that if the hibiscus can endure the snowfall and frigid winter conditions, she too will not succumb. To her, the hibiscus represents her own self; its survival assures her of her own capacity to persevere. She also intends to retake the examination when the hibiscus buds, as it evokes memories of her homeland and provides comfort. Then, even should she fail, she will find contentment because her favored plant is flourishing. Furthermore, the author concludes thus because both the plant and Saeng must surmount challenges: the plant must survive winter and reemerge in spring, while Saeng must pass her driving examination. Ultimately, the author concludes this way based on the plant's symbolic meaning for Saeng; its survival signifies her own perseverance and the continuation of life.
1088	9953	4	1	The author concluded the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring, as it encapsulates the narrative's central theme of adaptation. This resolution demonstrates her commitment to persevere. The hibiscus facilitated her acceptance of life's alterations; for instance, its familiar fragrance evoked poignant memories of her grandmother. The hibiscus, a vestige of her homeland, provided comforting recollections. It inspired her to embrace her new existence and persist in her efforts to improve it, thus affirming the story's overarching message.
1089	9954	4	1	"The author likely concludes the story in this manner because that period evokes the greatest comfort for Saeng. Having moved from Vietnam, where the hibiscus is prevalent, the plant is familiar to her. The author ends the text thus because it reminds Saeng of Vietnam and a season during which she feels more at ease. When she observes, ""And beside it was yet another old friend,"" she perceives the plant as a companion that provides solace. This rationale explains the author's chosen conclusion for the narrative."
1090	9955	4	1	"The author concludes with this statement because it signifies a fresh commencement during the beautiful spring season. The declaration, ""I will plant it right now,"" indicates her desire for another attempt. She seeks a new beginning, and with the arrival of spring, when all her lovely flowers are blossoming and seizing their opportunity, she wants her own chance to succeed optimally."
1091	9956	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph due to her profound regret for her actions. The examination she recounted involved utilizing the allocated twenty dollars to purchase a single, large @CAPS1, upon which she expended the majority of her funds, subsequently acquiring a plant that evoked memories of her homeland. This concluding passage signifies that, given another opportunity to undertake the ""test,"" she will execute the required actions correctly."
1092	9957	4	1	"Upon reading Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" I contend that Ho concluded the narrative with that specific paragraph to reinforce her central theme of surmounting adversity. Initially, after failing her driving examination, Saeng was profoundly disheartened and uncertain of her capacity to ever succeed. However, encountering a hibiscus plant evoked memories of her native Vietnam, thereby inspiring her. Subsequently, her mother expressed mild displeasure at the plant's expense, yet, upon witnessing the joy it brought Saeng, she relented. Ultimately, while excavating a hole for the hibiscus, Saeng resolved to retake the test, having overcome the challenges of acquiring and nurturing the plant, thus illustrating Ho's overarching idea."
1093	9958	4	1	"The final paragraph of the narrative manifests the theme of determination. The hibiscus reminded the protagonist of her former life as ""home,"" yet she misses @CAPS1 within her new existence. From this reminder, she derives a renewed sense of resolve. She subsequently comprehends that she is now home, as elements like the geese's V formation have grown familiar. While she cherished her past, she acknowledged the necessity to progress. The paragraph's significance extends beyond retaking a driving test; it symbolizes the determination to fully embrace her new life and home."
1094	9959	4	1	She will retake that examination. She derives @CAPS1 confidence from the hibiscus and the snow. When the snow ultimately melts and the hibiscus buds emerge, she will proceed again, metaphorically growing alongside the plant; thus, she is ultimately @CAPS2 to possess sufficient confidence for the test.
1095	9960	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to elucidate the story's events and their potential significance. The sentence implies that with the arrival of spring and the melting snow, plants will emerge and bud; similarly, by the next academic term or year, the protagonist will emerge with newfound bravery to retake the test. This is the sentence's meaning and how it can be analogously interpreted in different contexts.
1096	9961	4	1	The concluding paragraph of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho reads: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This passage establishes a parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus, illustrating her resilience, akin to the flower's hardiness, and her determination to retake the examination. The test represents a comforting, familiar objective that evokes her homeland, reinforcing her resolve.
1097	9962	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to compel the reader to contemplate the narrative's future or to illuminate the symbolic parallel between Saeng and the flower. The quotation, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” demonstrates the flower's capacity to endure winter and re-emerge. Similarly, Saeng, having failed the test initially, resolves to attempt it once more, revealing that both possess the motivation and fortitude to persevere and ultimately succeed.
1098	9963	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This conclusion is significant because the hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for Saeng, an opportunity to recommence after her initial failure. Upon seeing the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it provided solace during her disappointment, a connection to her past, and the conviction that she could surmount her challenges. The narrator's statement implies a cyclical renewal, with the hibiscus representing Saeng's own resilience, which justifies the author's choice of this concluding paragraph.
1099	9964	4	1	The final line is incorporated into “Winter Hibiscus” to demonstrate the profound connection between Saeng and the flower. Although Saeng failed her initial driving test, she resolves to retake it in the spring. The hibiscus, much like Saeng, is displaced and must endure the winter to bud again in spring. This illustrates how Saeng, analogous to the flower, will also blossom anew by retaking her test. Furthermore, both Saeng and the plant are unaccustomed to the harsh conditions of their new environment, compelling them to withstand an unfamiliar winter. This reiterates how the concluding line inextricably links the protagonist and the floral symbol, thereby providing a cohesive conclusion to the story.
1100	9965	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this statement to illustrate the protagonist's determination to acclimatize to her new country and surroundings. The narrative portrays her profound homesickness, which is alleviated when she discovers a plant native to her homeland and purchases it, much to her mother's astonishment. She refrains from explaining her precise motivation for the purchase, fearing it would evoke the words ""home"" and precipitate further tears. The final sentence ultimately signifies the character's resolve to adapt and establish herself within her new environment, thus concluding her emotional arc."
1101	9966	4	1	"The author concludes with this paragraph to provide a denouement that encapsulates the narrative's essence. The author characterized the hibiscus within the story as a ""comfort in time of distress,"" a pastime she pursues during her leisure. In summation, the author utilizes that paragraph for the rationales delineated in the @ORGANIZATION1."
1102	9967	4	1	"The author culminates the narrative with the specified paragraph to convey its thematic significance. It accentuates the elements important and familiar to Saeng that provided her solace, employing them to articulate her intent to retake the examination upon recovering her composure. The winter hibiscus was a plant that reminded Saeng of her former existence; consequently, when she encountered it, ""a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" Saeng was initially unable to console her emotions because she apprehended the profundity of her longing for her prior life. The plant is referenced in the final paragraph because its spring blossoming will help ameliorate the emotional void and fortify Saeng's resolve to attempt the test anew. She also mentions the geese for a congruent purpose, albeit through a distinct process. Unlike the hibiscus, the geese required time to become, ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" Saeng references this to signify her acclimatization to the unfamiliar aspects of her life and to reconcile herself with her unsuccessful test. Therefore, by citing these elements in the concluding paragraph, Saeng utilizes familiar objects, both foreign and domestic, to illustrate her process of coming to terms with her failure."
1103	9968	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it articulates the story's fundamental meaning. Life persists irrespective of circumstance; the hibiscus will reemerge in the spring. The hibiscus functions as a symbol for Saeng's existence. The plant typically does not endure the winter months, yet this particular specimen survived. The mother observes, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are analogous to the plant. They possess resilience, and their lives will proceed despite their new environment. The author elected to conclude the story with that paragraph because, although it ostensibly states the hibiscus will return every spring, the underlying significance is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will persevere and continue their lives."
1104	9969	4	1	"The author elects to conclude the story in a profoundly interconnected manner. It concludes upon a motif of rebirth and secondary opportunities, as Saeng vows, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, when the hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again."" The author is associating a sense of a new nation with second chances and renewal. The spring season and melting snow could signify rebirth, while the returning geese might symbolize a renewed opportunity, which correlates to Saeng's second chance. The author further demonstrates that Saeng is acclimating to the new country, thereby conveying a sentiment of hope and indicating potential for her future test success."
1105	9970	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the narrative's moral. This inference is drawn because the text describes how orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vires surrounded her. It discusses how these flowers encircled her to administer a test of her @CAPS1.
1106	9971	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative thusly because it constitutes essential information. The protagonist's motivations are intrinsically linked to her mother, who possesses a profound affinity for gardening and has established a professional career in that field, an aspiration the daughter shares.
1107	9972	4	1	Saeng perceives her failure as a consequence of longing for her grandmother. The hibiscus plant she purchases evokes her grandmother's fragrance, and she expended over @MONEY1 on it to cultivate a sense of belonging. Having departed her homeland abruptly, Saeng believes her grandmother would advocate for resilience over sorrowful reminiscence. She must therefore focus on positive memories and smile upon their recollection. Determined to succeed subsequently, she resolves not to weep when the hibiscus buds again.
1108	9973	4	1	The author's intention, I believe, was to establish the story's temporal setting and atmospheric conditions. This detail further indicates the duration of the protagonist's wait, which will persist until the snow dissipates and the geese repatriate. This contextual framing is the rationale for the author's descriptive inclusion.
1109	9974	4	1	This passage appears to depict a winter hibiscus, tall and lush, bordering their garden with its verdant leaves adorned by vermilion flowers. Upon reaching the hibiscus, she extended her hand and delicately touched a petal.
1110	9975	4	1	The author concluded the story in this manner to leave the reader with a final, resonant thought that also symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng observes the budding hibiscus, she is describing a new beginning with spring's arrival. This leaves the reader contemplating how Saeng has adapted to her new environment. Finally, it consolidates her feelings and experiences since relocating; her declaration to retake the test confirms her continued effort to embrace her new home, demonstrating her perseverance.
1111	9976	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to convey a sense of prospective optimism; observing the hibiscus budding in spring constitutes the event for which Saeng awaits. It instills within her the hope that she will ultimately pass the examination. This is demonstrated when she declares, “…and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Throughout the winter, Saeng aspires to improve, and the hibiscus’s bloom will signify the moment to recommence her efforts. Saeng perceives spring as a symbolic genesis, representing a period to surmount her personal obstacle. This impediment, or test, likely involves restraining her grief when reminiscing about her former life in Vietnam. Achieving this emotional control signifies her personal growth, which parallels the development of the hibiscus.
1112	9977	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph for a singular, principal rationale: to articulate a thematic culmination of resilience and renewal. This literary choice underscores the protagonist's internal resolution and the symbolic significance of the natural world as an emblem of hope and cyclical regeneration, thereby providing a resonant and cohesive denouement to the story's central motifs.
1113	9978	4	1	The author illustrates Saeng's desire to perpetuate her mother's horticultural legacy. This signifies the assumption of an elder's traditions and the continuation of the endeavors her mother initiated, representing a profound intergenerational connection and a commitment to preserving cultural heritage through the act of nurturing and cultivation.
1114	9979	4	1	I posit that the author concluded the narrative with this paragraph to underscore the protagonist's tenacity. This assertion is supported by her initial admission of failing the driving examination while walking home, contrasted with her final resolution to retake the test following winter, coinciding with her hibiscus's bloom. Her persistent nature enables her to endure life's challenges, analogous to a plant persevering through the harsh winter season to eventually flourish anew.
1115	9980	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the protagonist's resolve to succeed in her subsequent attempt. The passage suggests that she possesses the annual opportunity to perfect her skills and thereby honor her mother's expectations. This cyclical endeavor represents a commitment to gradual self-improvement and the fulfillment of familial aspirations, culminating in a poignant reflection on perseverance.
1116	9981	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author most likely concludes with this quotation to demonstrate that Saeng perceives the hibiscus as transcending mere flora; for her, it constitutes a mnemonic device. The Winter Hibiscus functions akin to a literary volume, its fragrance unlocking cherished recollections of moments shared with her ""gentle grandmother"" from her native land. The author employs the flower to illustrate how a mundane object can evoke profound memories and reflections. The final sentence explicitly affirms, supported by textual evidence, that Saeng profoundly values her history, and to assimilate into her contemporary existence, she must preserve her former identity. By cultivating the hibiscus, she retains a poignant emblem of her origins, thereby substantiating the rationale behind the author's concluding paragraph selection."
1117	9982	4	1	"The author culminates the narrative with that specific paragraph for several reasons. It conveys a sentiment of hope, as indicated by the observation, ""this hibiscus is budding,"" signifying a new commencement or a fresh start. This concept appears to be the author's intended message. Evidently, the protagonist encountered considerable difficulty adapting to her unfamiliar nation, exemplified by her disappointment upon discovering the hibiscus differed from her homeland's variety. Despite her nostalgic sentiments, the paragraph assures readers of her willingness to grant her new country an additional opportunity, thereby concluding the story on a note of optimistic resolution."
1118	9983	4	1	"The author selects that particular paragraph to conclude the narrative for multiple reasons. The final segment states, ""when they come back ... I will take the test again,"" (Ho @NUM1). Although distressed by her driving test failure and longing for her native land, the protagonist finds solace in the flower buds, which provide hope and the fortitude to retake the examination. Furthermore, while in the flower shop, upon encountering the blossoms, ""A wave of loss so profound and powerful that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm, moist sanctuary of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept"" (Ho @NUM2). Clearly, these flowers hold immense significance for the protagonist, transporting her to the homeland from which she was abruptly separated, offering hope, and reminding her of cherished figures like her grandmother. Ultimately, the author chooses this concluding paragraph because it encapsulates what is most meaningful to the central character, thereby providing a resonant denouement."
1119	9984	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey her profound affection for the flowers, which hold considerable significance for her. Following her driving test failure, she experienced despondency, yet the flower provided solace and emotional restoration. Now, as snow descends, she anticipates spring's arrival, when the blossoms will reemerge, renewing her faith and motivating her to retake the examination, thereby concluding her arc with a sense of hopeful perseverance.
1120	9985	4	1	The author concluded with this sentence to communicate that Saeng would continue to revisit and nurture the hibiscus, confirming that she had not neglected it, thereby affirming her enduring connection to this emblematic plant and the memories it sustains.
1121	9986	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the adolescent protagonist, Saeng, relocates from Vietnam to the United States. She subsequently undertakes a driver's examination, which she fails to pass; however, she discovers solace through recollections of her native country. The concluding paragraph articulates, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author culminates the story with this paragraph for numerous reasons, including Saeng's profound distress over her failure and the poignant reminders of her homeland and the adaptations necessitated by her relocation. The hibiscus plant instills within Saeng a sense of hope, enabling her to persevere despite formidable challenges. The winter season represents a period of adversity for the plant, mirroring Saeng's own tribulations surrounding her examination failure and displacement. The conclusion of winter affords both the plant and Saeng an opportunity for renewal and a revitalized hope to recommence, suggesting that Saeng will navigate future hardships by continuing to derive comfort from her heritage."
1122	9987	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to provoke readers' contemplation and to demonstrate her resolute determination not to relinquish her aspirations.
1123	9988	4	1	The author Minfong Ho concludes the narrative by addressing Saeng's failed test and her vow to retake it, as the examination symbolized a tentative step forward, representing the commencement of a new existence rather than a life anchored in the past. Initially, Saeng was incapable of this transition, evidenced by her expenditure of all her money on a flower imbued with nostalgic significance. However, as the story progresses, she arrives at the realization that she can integrate her former life with her new one. The story concludes in this manner to underscore her genuine desire to attempt the test again, aspiring to satisfy both her mother and herself, thereby enabling her to progress and initiate her new life.
1124	9989	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng recognizes her requirement for additional time. Should she grant herself an interlude and attend to her necessities, she will subsequently possess the capacity to pass the examination.
1125	9990	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to potentially expand upon the narrative with a sequel detailing Saeng's eventual success. Furthermore, by ending thusly, the author illustrates Saeng's current limitations and her unwavering determination to ultimately complete her test. Saeng encounters difficulties adapting to her new environment, as the familiar flora and previous comforts of her homeland are absent. Her resolve is demonstrated when her mother discovers she spent a significant sum to acquire a similar plant, responding that their entire garden was worth less than that amount, thereby highlighting the depth of Saeng's emotional investment and her steadfast commitment to overcoming adversity.
1126	9991	4	1	This concluding sentence demonstrates how the budding hibiscus and the onset of a new season parallel Saeng’s personal renewal and her readiness to undertake the examination. The imagery of frigid snow, migrating geese, and the potted hibiscus symbolizes Saeng’s own experiences of desolation, transience, and confinement. However, with the new season’s arrival, the geese return and the hibiscus is liberated from its pot, signifying that Saeng, too, will mature and become prepared for her test. The sentence is positioned at the conclusion to underscore Saeng’s potential for growth, which is now intrinsically linked to the flourishing hibiscus.
1127	9992	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the provided sentence to articulate that the conclusion of winter heralds a period for revival, wherein the protagonist can return to her gardening and, symbolically, to the test, accompanied by the plant she had cultivated.
1128	9993	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a paragraph depicting Saeng’s resolve to retake the examination. This concluding segment is employed because Saeng associates her readiness with the snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. She perceives this seasonal transition as the appropriate time to proceed. Essentially, Saeng acknowledges her need for additional preparation before attempting the test again, a rationale that justifies the author’s decision to conclude the story on this note.
1129	9994	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the budding hibiscus provides her with the inspiration to attempt the test once more. To succeed, she needed to cultivate a sense of belonging and draw upon memories of her home for encouragement. Consequently, this rationale underpins the author's decision to conclude the narrative with the final paragraph.
1130	9995	4	1	The author concludes with a paragraph about retaking the test to illustrate that the narrator, while distressed about her new environment, possesses perseverance. Her dismay upon realizing the hibiscus differs from those in her homeland stems from a longing for familiar things. This passage demonstrates the narrator's resilience; she will not relinquish her past but will also endeavor to adapt. The author thereby conveys that one should persistently pursue cherished endeavors. The narrator will renew her efforts with the returning geese and the budding hibiscus, embodying the message to persevere through failure and to establish goals without surrender.
1131	9996	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with this paragraph for a multitude of reasons.
1132	9997	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because he acknowledges his failure on the examination, and he is asserting that when spring returns, he will be prepared to retake it; I recognize the season as spring due to his mention of the melting snow.
1133	9998	4	1	Upon relocating to America, she observed the beautiful spring flowers in bloom and noticed a particular hibiscus blossom that captivated her. She felt it could be acquired, so she visited a florist to inquire about its availability. In her homeland, they grew wild, protruding vibrantly from fissures in concrete walls; the blossom evoked memories of her grandmother, its lengthy, gray filaments reminiscent of her freshly washed hair.
1134	9999	4	1	"In the passage ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the statement, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again,"" symbolizes her new journey within her adopted country. Saeng experiences an internal conflict, longing for her homeland, as indicated by her admission, ""I—failed the test."" This examination represented more than a simple failure; it was an assessment of her capacity to adapt to her new nation, which she did not pass. The aforementioned quote can be interpreted profoundly, with the snow representing her obstacles and the hibiscus signifying her own self; when her challenges dissipate and she blossoms into a more resilient individual, she will undertake the test once more."
1135	10000	4	1	She will ultimately return to her point of origin. This constitutes a cyclical journey, ensuring she will find herself back at her starting place the following year.
1136	10001	4	1	I posit that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” because the flower's budding would instill in her a profound confidence. The rationale for this interpretation is that the hibiscus evokes potent memories of her homeland. Essentially, it constitutes a tangible fragment of her past life integrated into her new environment. An illustrative example is her observation, “Not like the kind we had before,” which indicates the new hibiscus is analogous, yet distinct, from the variety in her homeland, thereby serving as a mnemonic connection. This constitutes the foundation for my belief regarding the author's chosen conclusion.
1137	10002	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resilience rather than resignation. She is determined to surmount her challenges. This conclusion is particularly effective because the story's overarching theme concerns overcoming adversity; had Saeng capitulated, the narrative would have been undermined. However, analogous to her capacity for relocating from her homeland, she will ultimately pass the examination. Her mother similarly surmounted significant obstacles, including the displacement from her native country and the necessity of cultivating unfamiliar flora. Her longing for the original plants is evident from her immediate recognition of the gift, yet she adapts to this loss, a resilience that Saeng will emulate during her subsequent test attempt.
1138	10003	4	1	The narrative signifies an impending transformation. Winter will yield to spring, the snow will recede, the geese will reappear, and the hibiscus will bud; concurrently, Saeng will undergo her own maturation. She parallels the hibiscus plant, which appears displaced on the roadside, just as Saeng feels out of place in a new nation, compelling her to adapt. The plant's appearance in the United States differs from its form in Vietnam because it has matured, a process Saeng must also undergo. For instance, Saeng noted the plant's altered appearance in the shop window compared to her homeland, an observation that mirrors her own perceived differences. The paragraph's placement at the denouement demonstrates her achieved maturity and growth, an effect that would be lost at the beginning. The hibiscus endured the harsh winter, a resilience Saeng shares, as evidenced by her silent vow to retake the test once she has matured alongside her changing environment.
1139	10004	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the specified paragraph for several deliberate reasons. Primarily, it provides a definitive resolution, eliminating reader uncertainty by integrating the geese, the hibiscus, and her driving test into the final thoughts. Furthermore, this concluding section introduces a theme of perseverance, as the protagonist's resolve to retake the test is fueled by memories of her past. Lastly, it enhances her characterization; by vowing to ""take that test again,"" she is portrayed as pragmatic and resilient rather than unrealistically persistent. These are the principal ways in which the final paragraph augments and completes the narrative."
1140	10005	4	1	"The author's decision to conclude with this paragraph is multifaceted. It first provides narrative closure, resolving the reader's speculation by weaving together the symbolic geese, the budding hibiscus, and Saeng's driving test. Subsequently, it reinforces a central theme of perseverance, depicting the protagonist's renewed determination, which is intrinsically linked to her cultural memories. Finally, it culminates in character development; her resolution to ""take that test again"" portrays her as realistically resilient rather than obstinate. These elements collectively demonstrate how the concluding passage enhances the story's overall impact and thematic coherence."
1141	10006	4	1	The author selected this concluding paragraph to illustrate Saeng's nascent adjustment to her new environment and her resolute determination. Her poignant reaction to the hibiscus reveals a persistent longing for her homeland, yet her recognition of the geese and the decision to schedule her driving test retake around their migration signify a growing acclimatization to her new home.
1142	10007	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng was initially unprepared for the test, being unaccustomed to her new surroundings. However, after encountering flora reminiscent of her homeland and realizing that spring promises further blossoming, she resolves to retake the examination with renewed readiness.
1143	10008	4	1	The rationale for this conclusion is to signify the conclusion of the flowering season, which will resume in spring, thereby providing the author with a natural terminus for the narrative and a point from which a new one may commence upon the flowers' return. Ultimately, this strategic placement justifies the selected paragraph as the story's conclusion.
1144	10009	4	1	"The author concludes with Saeng's silent vow: ""when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This declaration demonstrates her resolve to retake the test rather than concede defeat, a determination explicitly conveyed through her assertion, ""then I will take that test again,"" confirming her persistent intention to endeavor once more."
1145	10010	4	1	"The author concludes with this paragraph due to its connection to Saeng's earlier failure on her driving test. However, she remained determined to retake it once she felt adequately prepared, as the paragraph states, ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again."""
1146	10011	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the inclusion of the hibiscus likely serves to provoke continuous inquiry. Given her mother's profound disappointment, the protagonist perhaps seeks to alter circumstances and effect an improvement in her situation."
1147	10012	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng’s vow to retake the examination upon the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding in spring. This deliberate conclusion underscores the story’s emotional transition. Initially, Saeng’s mother observes the tear stains and swollen eyes, indicating her daughter's profound sadness and displacement; however, the story culminates in a mood of optimism and contentment.
1148	10013	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this specific paragraph for several compelling reasons. Primarily, it demonstrates the protagonist's resilience, contrasting her earlier despair and tears with a newfound determination to persevere. Furthermore, the conclusion illustrates her acclimatization to a new environment, merging memories of her homeland with her present reality to forge a sense of hope. The text notes her growing familiarity with once-alien surroundings, indicating her acceptance of her current situation and deriving optimism from this synthesis, thereby imparting a positive resolution to the narrative."
1149	10014	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate a profound appreciation for nature, suggesting the narrative and its characters possess a deep affinity for the natural world and its cyclical transformations, perhaps presenting nature in its most ideal state.
1150	10015	4	1	The author composed the final paragraph to instill hope within both Saeng and the reader. Upon encountering the hibiscus, Saeng is overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss, which brings tears to her eyes. After purchasing the plant and conversing with her mother, the flower not only evokes nostalgia but also provides inspiration, motivating her declaration to pass the test upon the hibiscus's budding.
1151	10016	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph because it corresponds with numerous narrative elements and provides an effective summation. Within the story, the hibiscus holds profound significance for Saeng, as she associates many memories with it. The plant serves as a potent reminder of her homeland and her history, thereby fulfilling a crucial function. When she plants it during winter, the hibiscus has not yet bloomed. Therefore, her statement about retaking the test when it buds equates to her recommitting when the flower re-emerges, with her actions mirroring the plant's cycle and thus demonstrating its symbolic importance. This explains the author's decision to conclude with that paragraph.
1152	10017	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph because it conveys her inability to garden in winter, whereas the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus all signify spring's arrival. Her intention to retake the examination in spring thereby implies she will resume her work in the garden at that time.
1153	10018	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner because the author, Minfong Ho, is indicating what will occur in the spring. I believe this because the text states Saeng vowed silently to herself that in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again. This signifies that in spring the hibiscus will bloom.
1154	10019	4	1	She believes she will perform better in the spring, possibly because her disposition will be improved then and the environment will more closely resemble her native homeland, thereby providing a more favorable context for her efforts.
1155	10020	4	1	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph because it symbolizes Saeng's decision to try again. Natural phenomena are cyclical; seasons change but eventually recur, and geese migrate yet they also return. The author employs this as a parallel to Saeng's resolution to reattempt her license test. Like Saeng, the winter hibiscus was removed from its native environment but was learning to adapt, which inspired Saeng to persist in her efforts despite failure, just as the hibiscus endeavored to survive the winter despite its displacement.
1156	10021	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because, regardless of her actions, she felt compelled to acquire the flower, as it evokes memories of her former residence and its environment, which moved her to tears. The challenge was to refrain from purchasing the flower and to control her emotions; instead, she resolves to cultivate her own flower in the spring. This is my interpretation of the test's significance.
1157	10022	4	1	She will determine if her plant endures the winter season, just as the flora from her homeland did, and she anticipates that circumstances will be identical.
1158	10023	4	1	This signifies the commencement of a new existence. She attends a new school and possesses a new plant, with which she shares a profound connection; as it develops, she likewise grows more resilient and self-assured. Consequently, she declared that upon their return, when the hibiscus begins to bud, she will be prepared for that examination.
1159	10024	4	1	The author concludes in this manner to demonstrate her resilience and her willingness to embrace her new nation. The ending signifies that she will embody the flower's fortitude and remain steadfast regardless of circumstances, committed to being present in that location to witness its regeneration. This is the reasoning behind my interpretation of the conclusion.
1160	10025	4	1	This narrative provides background on a girl who profoundly misses her authentic home. Initially, we encounter young Saeng in a florist shop merely observing flowers; we subsequently learn she is not just looking at flora but at fragments of her home and history, leading her to purchase a hibiscus, a flower indigenous to her Vietnam. After realizing she has failed an examination, it becomes evident that acquiring the flower serves as a mechanism for coping with her new situation and seeking solace in her past. The author concludes with that statement because it conveys progression without clinging to former times; in the spring, Saeng will establish a new home and derive strength from her history, which is the implication I perceive in the final paragraph.
1161	10026	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is resolved to pass the examination. She understands that when spring arrives and the hibiscus buds, she will retake the test; I believe she desires to retake it because the hibiscus evokes memories of her homeland. It instills within her a greater confidence. She is convinced she can pass on her subsequent attempt. The hibiscus elicits both joy and profound emotion. She is determined to retake the test, assured she will perform better next time.
1162	10027	4	1	I posit that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it demonstrates that if such a flower can flourish in unfamiliar environments and endure natural cycles, then she possesses a similar capacity. To me, the flower functions as a symbolic representation for the author, urging her to persevere. It signifies that one must continue striving, even when beginning anew. This time, however, one will possess greater awareness and will have assimilated lessons from prior errors. Just as a flower blooms in spring, perishes in winter, and returns the following spring, so too can Saeng, having failed the test this year, return next time to attempt it again.
1163	10028	4	1	"I surmise that she is implying that once winter has passed, she will prepare for that examination again. I deduce this because they were unprepared for winter's arrival during their planting season. As the text states, ""As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel."" This is the foundation for my belief that they were not prepared for the winter."
1164	10029	4	1	The author concluded the story in this manner so the audience would experience sympathy and comprehension for the struggles Saeng and her family endured during this difficult period. It elicits sympathy for Saeng because her sole consolation is to reminisce about her hometown and the circumstances of her departure.
1165	10030	4	1	He concludes the story because she has another opportunity to retake the test.
1166	10031	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to accentuate a renewed existence and novel opportunities for the protagonist. The futuristic setting of spring signifies rebirth and a fresh commencement following the harsh, cold winter. The author deliberately incorporates additional events that reinforce this symbolic interpretation, employing a structured narrative choice to convey her perspective. For instance, to communicate the theme of rebirth, the author utilizes phrases such as ""the geese return"" and ""take the test again,"" which augment the significance of the domestic setting. Furthermore, the literal action of the ""hibiscus budding"" epitomizes rebirth. During winter, the plant lies dormant and lacks vibrancy, yet in spring it manifests renewal through the emergence of its colorful buds. The author ultimately conveys the theme of rebirth by concluding with this paragraph."
1167	10032	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the narrative recounts a girl who has recently immigrated to a new country and struggles to adapt to the unfamiliar land and its inhabitants. However, the author positions that specific quotation at the conclusion to suggest the imperative of perseverance, the promise of a new beginning, and the assurance of eventual success. This interpretation is supported by Saeng's reflection: ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had previously perceived as strange had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar."" This demonstrates that she has ultimately discovered solace and self-assurance, akin to geese adapting to a new region before returning, and that the winter hibiscus persistently endures, continuing to thrive within the new climatic conditions each season."
1168	10033	4	1	She culminates her reflections in the final paragraph, articulating a comprehensive sentiment that she will revisit the situation once winter has concluded. She will possess the opportunity to retake the examination in the spring, which constituted the central subject of her writing. This final statement effectively consolidates her narrative arc and thematic focus.
1169	10034	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it demonstrates the protagonist's endeavor to acclimatize to her new environment. The hibiscus serves as a memento of her former life, providing her with solace. Consequently, when she retakes her test in the spring, she will experience improved morale and greater comfort, fortified by the memories of her past life within the new locale. The story recounts her initial test failure and subsequent purchase of a plant evocative of her homeland. This plant triggered recollections of her previous existence, which offered her consolation. The spring season itself reminds her of her origins, as garden flowers bloom, geese return, and the snow melts. Saeng perceives that she can assimilate into her new surroundings, supported by the comforting memories of her former life.
1170	10035	4	1	"The author selected this paragraph for its efficacy as a fitting conclusion; it aptly illustrates, for example, the word ""again,"" which implies a prior, concluded action that one wishes to reattempt. Within the paragraph, this concept is applied to nature and the desire to re-evaluate it, thereby reinforcing the theme of cyclical renewal and second chances."
1171	10036	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's unwavering resolve to retake the examination and ultimately succeed. By concluding in this manner, the author cultivates suspense, likely in anticipation of a subsequent installment within the story's continuum.
1172	10037	4	1	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young Vietnamese girl relocates to the United States and fails her driver's examination. After purchasing a winter hibiscus to evoke memories of her homeland, the concluding paragraph—""when Troy returns, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again""—demonstrates a profound emotional connection to nature. She perceives that as the geese prepare to migrate and the hibiscus prepares to blossom, so too will she be ready to attempt the driving test once more."
1173	10038	4	1	"Her references to the flowers, and her mention of a ""test,"" likely signify her self-perception and how she interprets the flora and the recurring snowfall. This suggests the author possesses a deep admiration for flowers, or perhaps specifically for this hibiscus and its budding process. Potentially, she is simply an individual who appreciates observing natural transformations and cyclical change."
1174	10039	4	1	The author incorporates this passage to symbolize determination and resilience. Although Saeng is not native to this country, she exhibits determination and a willingness to endeavor to assimilate into its culture. While the winter proved cold and harsh for her in many respects, the spring will usher in absolution and relief from her struggles. She will endeavor to pass the driving test again to further integrate into American society, while the blossoming hibiscus will provide a connection to her homeland.
1175	10040	4	1	"The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng's realization of the necessity for self-assurance and to provide an optimistic resolution. Furthermore, the author integrates elements familiar to Saeng alongside those native to her new environment within the final passage. Initially, the protagonist appeared profoundly distressed and disoriented in this unfamiliar country, grieving for her home intensely. However, upon returning home and confiding in her mother about her failure, her disposition improves. Subsequently, after planting the hibiscus and observing the geese, she perceives them as ""almost familiar."" The concluding paragraph effectively intertwines her past, her present, and the narrative's central conflict into a cohesive denouement."
1176	10041	4	1	She possessed a profound desire for knowledge and a broader range of experiences. She was captivated by the appearance of the plants at the establishment. Her mother purchased the specimen, returned home, and they commenced its cultivation. The daughter cherished the plant immensely, declaring that the following year she would cultivate a specimen as magnificent as the one her mother was nurturing.
1177	10042	4	1	The author likely concludes this narrative segment to illustrate Saeng's maturation, as she evidently no longer resides with her mother. The author's intention is to underscore for the reader Saeng's newfound independence, given her changed living situation. The recounted events constitute a past chapter that will remain a poignant memory for Saeng.
1178	10043	4	1	"The author employs that passage to conclude the narrative, demonstrating Saeng's resolve to adapt. As Saeng inhales the hibiscus's fragrance, ""the familiar scent filled her lungs,"" and she could almost perceive ""the light sounds of her grandmother's long gray hair."" This indicates Saeng was seeking elements reminiscent of her homeland. Her payment of over nineteen dollars for the plant further signifies the depth of her longing. The statement, ""she had failed the test,"" reveals to the reader her unsuccessful attempt to acclimate, resulting in sorrow and nostalgia. However, her declaration that ""I will take the test again,"" upon seeing the familiar hibiscus and migrating geese—knowing they will return—instills hope. The story's final lines convey the enduring nature of her homeland's memory."
1179	10044	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey Saeng's unwavering determination and refusal to capitulate.
1180	10045	4	1	With the hibiscus nearby, Saeng will possess greater courage and additional time to adapt to her new environment. For Saeng, the hibiscus functions as motivation and a memento of her native land. The author likely chose to conclude the story with this particular remark to illustrate that Saeng ultimately discovered the fortitude necessary to embrace her challenges in this foreign country.
1181	10046	4	1	The narrative concludes with this paragraph because it conveys that transformations in weather and seasons parallel those in one's life. One must occasionally confront life's alterations. The test might serve to ascertain whether she can comprehend her own nature. Weather undergoes constant change, shifting through spring and fall, changes that one must ultimately accept and overcome.
1182	10047	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with a paragraph that provides resolution. One reason for this concluding paragraph is to indicate that Saeng has not relinquished her ambition regarding the driver's test. ""… Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This specifies when she intends to retake the test another year, while also leaving the reader to contemplate the story's subsequent trajectory."
1183	10048	4	1	"I believe the author's decision to conclude the story with Saeng’s vow, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" was exceptionally effective. She perceives the hibiscus's resilience and realizes she can endure any challenge, particularly the test. Furthermore, her mother's astonished reaction, ""You what?"" and her incredulous stare, might have signaled that if her mother could overcome her anger, then Saeng could similarly surmount her own distress regarding the test."
1184	10049	4	1	The author writes this conclusion to the story's end to communicate that the seasons are transforming and the flowers will inevitably perish. He also intends to convey that when the season cycles back, the flower will endeavor to flourish again among the others. This is the author's intended meaning when he references taking the test once more.
1185	10050	4	1	"The hibiscus flower is perceived as a symbol of hope and a memento of their homeland. When Saeng initially observes it in the florist shop, she is overwhelmed by memories of home and the flowers that grew unrestrictedly there. I contend the author intends the new flower to signify an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to similarly thrive in their new location. Planting the flower symbolizes adaptation, following their relocation to a new country. Saeng appears to utilize it as inspiration, stating, ""when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again."" The paragraph offers resolution and an aura of hope, providing an excellent note for conclusion."
1186	10051	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that initial failure is often followed by a second opportunity, analogous to the @CAPS1, which perishes in winter only to be resurrected in the spring.
1187	10052	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative by stating, ""when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This is articulated because the protagonist, Saeng, failed her examination yet discovered a botanical specimen that evoked memories of her homeland. Although the plant was not identical to the one from her home, she ultimately acclimated to its presence. The flower @MONTH1 not be precisely the same, but it is an @CAPS1 flower, and she is gradually adapting to her existence in @LOCATION1. When she returns to retake the examination, she will be prepared, and her plant will be flourishing with vitality."
1188	10053	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner due to Saeng's profound reverence for the plant. She perceives it not merely as a symbol of her homeland but also as an emblem of fortuity. The text indicates she ascribes significant value to it, having expended @NUM1 coins for its acquisition. Therefore, the conclusion symbolizes Saeng's conviction that the most auspicious time to undertake the test coincides with the hibiscus's growth.
1189	10054	4	1	The author incorporates that paragraph at the story's conclusion to connect Saeng symbolically with the geese and the plant. For Saeng, the snow signifies her difficulties adapting to @LOCATION1, while the geese demonstrate her ongoing assimilation into her new homeland when they appear familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was aesthetically pleasing, but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her own journey since arriving in @LOCATION1, has adapted to become more resilient, withstanding the snow that represents her adaptive struggles. The hibiscus's re-budding signifies Saeng's burgeoning strength and her triumph over adversity. She intends to retake the test once she has become more robust, and the author uses this paragraph to link the hibiscus's renewal with Saeng overcoming her challenges.
1190	10055	4	1	"The author elected to conclude the narrative in this fashion to signify that the endeavor is not concluded and that the protagonist intends to retake the examination. In the story, Saeng declares, ""I- I failed the test,"" thereby demonstrating her resolve to return and rectify the outcome when the flower blooms once more."
1191	10056	4	1	The author posits that she intends to retake her driving examination in the spring, coinciding with the blossoming of flowers, as this environment induces a state of relaxation. The floral surroundings cultivate a tranquil mental state, thereby enhancing her capacity for concentration.
1192	10057	4	1	She indicates that once the flora regenerate, she will be prepared to attempt the examination once more.
1193	10058	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with this final sentence to illustrate that the season for plant growth has concluded; however, when the flowers eventually reemerge, the protagonist will resume their care, as they are her cherished focus and current raison d'être. Furthermore, the author likely structured the conclusion to generate reader intrigue and a sense of suspense, leaving the protagonist's return to the plants an open question. An additional interpretation is that, amidst the ongoing snowfall, she maintains concern for the plants but will postpone her attention until the appropriate season returns. Her statement, ""when they come back then I will take the test again,"" demonstrates her refusal to relinquish her passions and her commitment to persevere until she succeeds."
1194	10059	4	1	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author utilizes the final paragraph to convey that while memories of her homeland will persist, she will ultimately acclimatize to her new country, albeit with occasional visits to her origin. For instance, ""when the snow melts and the geese return,"" the subsequent line, ""then I will take the test again,"" signifies that once she is adapted or upon returning to her native land, she will find fulfillment in either location."
1195	10060	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng intends to retake the test once these seasonal events transpire. Saeng reveals her determination and refusal to surrender, indicating she will persist in her efforts. The hibiscus functions as a talisman for her during the examination, motivating her to succeed. Moreover, the author employs this concluding paragraph to illuminate Saeng's personal reflections and her emotional state regarding the test. The spring, marked by melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, signifies the opportune moment to attempt the test anew. Ultimately, the paragraph signifies that Saeng will forever remember this resolve.
1196	10061	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with its final paragraph. Upon their return, Saeng resolved privately that in the spring, as the snow recedes, the geese reappear, and this hibiscus flourishes, she will undertake that examination once more.
1197	10062	4	1	I surmise she perceived it as an effective method to unify everyone.
1198	10063	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" signifying her readiness for spring's arrival and her hibiscus's full bloom. Upon purchasing the hibiscus, Saeng was confident that with winter's passing, retaking the driver's examination would facilitate overcoming her fear and the grief of relocation. This indicates Saeng's capacity to conquer her apprehension of a new environment. Furthermore, she is assured that memories of her homeland will provide support. Ultimately, it is revealed that Saeng has developed resilience and holds substantial hope for achieving success in her new country."
1199	10064	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate her determination. In spring, the hibiscus will struggle to endure because it is a winter variety, yet it too possesses resolve.
1200	10065	4	1	"I believe the author employed that statement to conclude the story because, by the end, Saeng was prepared to confront her challenges anew; it also demonstrates her growing appreciation for her new surroundings. The plant Saeng purchased prompted her mother to remark, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here,"" implying to Saeng that if the plant can survive harsh conditions, then perhaps she can endure life in a new nation. When Saeng recognized the cyclical nature of the seasons, she likely realized that she, too, could persevere and face the driving test again."
1201	10066	4	1	"The author incorporates the concluding paragraph in ""Winter Hibiscus"" to illustrate the protagonist's enduring optimism and resilience toward her new existence. Throughout the narrative, Saeng reflects upon her recent recollections of her native Vietnam upon encountering a specific plant from her homeland. This moment is significant as it underscores Saeng's lingering sorrow regarding her relocation to @LOCATION2, compelling her to weep while returning home with the plant to her mother. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng’s mother comprehended her emotional state and refrained from expressing disappointment over her failed driving examination. By promptly planting the familiar hibiscus in the garden, her mother provided solace. The story’s final passage fosters hope that Saeng will persist in her resolve to adapt to an unfamiliar life in @LOCATION2. “When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This declaration functions as Saeng’s vow that, in time, she will achieve contentment in her new circumstances, transcending the mere act of passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus thus symbolizes Saeng’s fortitude within her new country while simultaneously preserving her memories of Vietnam."
1202	10067	4	1	The author Minfong Ho concludes the narrative with Saeng’s silent vow: in spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she will retake the examination because the plant’s blossoming will instill greater confidence and composure. This progression demonstrates her endeavor to acclimate to unfamiliar surroundings. The hibiscus arguably embodies solace during disappointment and a tangible link to her prior experiences. Since the plant represents comfort in moments of disillusion, it motivated her purchase. Therefore, when spring arrives and the hibiscus flourishes, she will undertake the test again, feeling more assimilated within her environment. This rationale elucidates Minfong Ho’s deliberate conclusion for the story.
1203	10068	4	1	Past experiences frequently exert influence upon our lives, whether consciously acknowledged or not. In this narrative, Saeng endeavors to visit a floral establishment and withstand the temptation of purchasing a particular blossom that evokes memories of her homeland, yet she ultimately succumbs. She struggles to reconcile her displacement, recognizing that familiar foundations have dissolved. However, she is gradually acclimating to novel elements. The author likely concludes with this specific paragraph to convey the perpetual potential for personal evolution. Saeng attempts to relegate evocative memories, and with temporal progression, she may achieve this by the subsequent year, for any objective is attainable with genuine determination. The author illustrates Saeng’s profound desire to surmount her internal trial, thereby facilitating further adaptation to change and earning her mother’s approbation.
1204	10069	4	1	Her statement functioned as a declaration that she had not yet surmounted a particular challenge, affirming her intent to retake the examination the following year, analogous to the hibiscus budding upon the snow’s retreat and the geese’s annual return to @CAPS1.
1205	10070	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey to the reader Saeng’s resolute intention to reattempt the examination.
1206	10071	4	1	When Saeng declared her intention to retake the examination the following year, she was alluding to the complete re-cultivation of the plants. Her statement, “Allow me to assist, mother,” demonstrates her genuine willingness to engage with the horticultural tasks after all.
1207	10072	4	1	The author’s selection of the final paragraph in the short story “Winter Hibiscus” illustrates Saeng’s profound hope for the future. The winter and its cold signify her feelings of displacement and distress following her failure to acquire a driver’s license. In the spring, a fragment of her native land will flourish, and she will experience warmth once more. She will feel prepared to attempt her test again “when they came back,” signifying her adaptation to and acceptance of a new existence distant from her origins and recollections. This concluding passage confirms her resilience in overcoming adversity and progressing forward.
1208	10073	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph because the returning geese and the budding hibiscus serve to bolster her self-assurance. She aspires to cultivate the conviction that she possesses the capability to successfully complete this examination.
1209	10074	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph where Saeng vows silently that she will retake the examination upon the geese's return in spring, as the snow melts and the hibiscus buds. She comprehends that she possesses another opportunity to succeed when spring blossoms again; she will commence gardening with the season's renewal.
1210	10075	4	1	"Saeng discovers solace in reminiscences of her homeland. The test's environment was entirely foreign, resulting in her failure, yet during her return, she encountered something familiar: indigenous plants from her home. “There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single bloodred blossom,” “floating in the bucket.” Saeng requires familiar elements for consolation. The sight of the geese symbolizes transformation. “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched.” Spring represents a period for new beginnings, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" When the familiar object is at its peak, she will be at her best, equipped to confront any challenge, with winter serving as a preparatory stage."
1211	10076	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow to retake the examination in the spring, once the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This decision stems from her acquisition of the plant following her initial failure; thus, its subsequent blooming will signify the moment for her to attempt the test again."
1212	10077	4	1	I believe the author intended to convey that upon the snow's melting, perhaps in a specific month, she will return. The author likely chose the spring season as a symbolic time within the narrative for a new beginning.
1213	10078	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" employs this concluding paragraph as a symbol of Saeng's future. The winter hibiscus represents Saeng for several reasons; both originate from Vietnam and struggle to survive and flourish within their new environment. Saeng pledges that when the plant thrives in spring, she will likewise prosper by retaking her driver's examination. This symbol of prospective success is crucial to the narrative's vitality, which is why the author, Mingfong Ho, selected it for the denouement."
1214	10079	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph wherein Saeng vows to herself that in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she will retake the test. The author likely selected this as the final paragraph to elucidate the story's central message: regardless of the obstacles one encounters, perseverance is essential. The author positions this paragraph last to provoke contemplation and reflection in the reader."
1215	10080	4	1	"The author concluded with this paragraph for a specific reason: Saeng attributes her failure to having purchased an artificial plant rather than a living one, which left her profoundly disappointed. This is evidenced by her declaration, ""I failed,"" in reference to the plant, and her lament, ""it's not like the one at home,"" comparing her present circumstances to her former life. This rationale underpins the author's decision for the conclusion."
1216	10081	4	1	When they return, Saeng resolved internally, in the spring once the snow dissipates, the geese reappear, and this hibiscus begins to bud, then she would retake the examination. The significance of this statement within the narrative is its connection to her affinity for the garden, which remains inaccessible during snowfall. Furthermore, her profound appreciation for botany and related flora explains the author's decision to conclude the paragraph, as Saeng intends to acquire plants and flowers upon spring's arrival. Ultimately, after encountering a recognizable plant, Saeng visits a florist to inquire about its purchase and becomes profoundly distressed when an issue arises concerning them.
1217	10082	4	1	"In the narrative, the mother's assertion, ""Its flowers are not as beautiful, but it possesses sufficient resilience to endure the cold season here, this winter hibiscus. That is what matters,"" illustrates that Saeng resembles the flower. Its capacity to survive the winter signifies an inherent strength, which manifests as beauty and vigor in the spring. This underscores Saeng's anticipated fortitude and heightened self-assurance with the arrival of spring, justifying the author's placement of this insight at the conclusion, reflecting the flower's own cycle of resilience and splendor."
1218	10083	4	1	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author incorporates a concluding paragraph stating the protagonist, Saeng, will retake her driving examination. Ho includes this to demonstrate Saeng's resolve to acclimatize. Saeng, newly arrived in the United States from Vietnam, reminisces throughout the story about her former life, her grandmother, and the flora there. ""Where was her...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?"" Discovering a hibiscus at a florist, a species also native to Vietnam, she observes its adaptation for winter survival. While planting it, she vows to pass her driving test the following spring, aspiring to similarly adapt to her new environment and establish a life mitigated by less longing for home. This pledge, presented in the final paragraph, signifies Saeng's determination to adjust to her surroundings and ultimately succeed."
1219	10084	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to elucidate the hibiscus's profound significance. The hibiscus serves as a multifaceted symbol for Saeng, most importantly representing transformation, development, and the capacity to surmount adversity. Its sight evokes potent childhood nostalgia, yet she recognizes the necessity of adapting to her new surroundings for personal growth. She will persevere here, just as the hibiscus endures the winter. Moreover, Saeng vows that ""in the spring"" when ""this hibiscus is budding,"" she will retake the test, demonstrating her resolve. The hibiscus epitomizes triumph over hardship, symbolizing survival and perseverance through life's tribulations, from failing an examination to beginning anew in an unfamiliar nation. The author's concluding choice thus showcases Saeng's ultimate recognition of her own strength through this emblem."
1220	10085	4	1	"The author concludes the paragraph in this manner to convey a significant message to the audience. The intended communication is that despite her initial failure, she remains committed to attempting the test again the following year. Evidence for this is provided by the direct quotation: ""in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This clarifies the rationale behind the author's chosen conclusion for the story."
1221	10086	4	1	The author incorporates this narrative segment because Saeng's initial failure on her driving test coincides with the hibiscus beginning to bud, symbolizing an impending transformation in her life. Furthermore, Saeng previously cultivated hibiscus flowers at her former residence in Vietnam; thus, the flower's budding potentially signifies her establishment of a new home.
1222	10087	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng’s vow to retake the examination in the spring, as the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This resolution is significant because it is crucial for Saeng to attain a sense of belonging. The budding hibiscus will evoke memories of her homeland, providing solace; when she feels tranquil and settled, her performance on the test will consequently improve.
1223	10088	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate her perseverance in embracing her new home while preserving the memory of her former one. Her determination is evident when she brings the hibiscus home for planting, an act which simultaneously demonstrates her refusal to forget her past. This resolve is further emphasized by her silent vow to retake the test in the spring, signaling her commitment to giving her new life a genuine opportunity. Moreover, her realization that previously strange elements have become familiar through seasonal repetition indicates her acceptance of change and her willingness to grant her new environment another chance, thereby confirming her resilience.
1224	10089	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is prepared to undertake the same endeavor the following year. She enjoys the time spent with her mother, possesses an affinity for plants, and finds pleasure in these shared activities with her parent. These constitute the principal reasons for the selected conclusion.
1225	10090	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus offers profound comfort. Having failed her driving test and being new to the location, Saeng was frustrated and longed for her home in Vietnam. The hibiscus evoked the memory of her grandmother. After smelling the flower, she closed her eyes and inhaled its fragrance, which reminded her of combing her grandmother’s freshly washed hair, thus providing solace during a period of disappointment. In the absence of her grandmother, the flower consoled her. Although disappointed, she found the hibiscus exquisite, and as she articulated the word for it, she savored the feel of the term on her tongue. This joy and comfort are what the flower provides Saeng, prompting her to retake the test in the spring when the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, thereby conveying its associated joy, love, and comfort to the reader.
1226	10091	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to articulate the symbolic resonance of the hibiscus with Saeng’s circumstances in a foreign nation. It illustrates how Saeng draws inspiration from the plant’s capacity for adaptation. Throughout the story, Saeng recalls the hibiscus from her native land. Her mother observes that the purchased hibiscus differs slightly from their homeland’s variety, attributing this divergence to its resilience in acclimating to the harsh winter climate of the United States. This botanical perseverance serves as Saeng’s inspiration. Although she failed her licensing examination, she emulates the hibiscus by establishing a personal objective. The plant will endure a frigid, snowy winter yet will ultimately flourish in the spring. Saeng will utilize this interim for diligent study and preparation, thereby approaching her subsequent test with assured confidence. The concluding paragraph effectively demonstrates the parallel Saeng discerns between her own predicament and that of the plant.
1227	10092	4	1	"The adage, ""If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again,"" is frequently invoked by parents encouraging their children or by coaches motivating their teams. This maxim is equally applicable to Saeng’s situation in the short story ""Winter Hibiscus."" After failing her driver’s test, Saeng, while walking home, notices a hibiscus flower that evokes memories of her homeland. Melancholy envelops her, and she procures the plant to assuage her sorrow. Initially reprimanded by her mother, she is subsequently thanked for the purchase. While planting the hibiscus, Saeng hears the honk of Canada geese, a sound that had grown familiar. The text states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This observation signifies the adaptation necessitated by her relocation. The author’s concluding paragraph reveals that, akin to the hibiscus, she will adapt to the environmental challenges of her new home, drawing from the plant’s example the resolve to persevere and retake her licensing examination."
1228	10093	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to underscore the solace Saeng derives from the hibiscus. The flower evokes poignant memories of her homeland and her grandmother. According to the story, “the familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair.” This indicates her enduring connection to her native country, which she carries in her heart. The text further describes it as “yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers,” revealing her profound affinity for nature and its comforting attributes. Following her test failure, she purchases the hibiscus plant as a source of consolation. As they plant it together in their garden, Saeng experiences a significant resurgence of confidence, motivating her to retake the examination.
1229	10094	4	1	She draws a parallel between the paragraph and the narrative to equate it with her academic challenges. The test symbolizes the difficulties of forging new friendships and achieving success in her classes. The declaration in the paragraph, “Then I will take that test again,” substantiates the reason for this comparison, illustrating her resolve to overcome these intertwined obstacles within the school environment.
1230	10095	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's determination to surmount the obstacles stemming from her past experiences. The narrative commences with Saeng undertaking a test; while reminiscing in the greenhouse, she becomes emotionally overwhelmed. “A wave of loss so deep and sharp it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her.” She subsequently purchases the plant, brings it home to her mother, and confesses her failure. Her mother then responds with understanding and supports Saeng’s resolution to retake the examination. The narrator thereby emphasizes Saeng’s resolute commitment to transcending her past tribulations and progressing toward the future.
1231	10096	4	1	Her academic obligations constituted the entire rationale for her botanical studies within the verdant garden. Evidently, she failed the examination; consequently, with the advent of spring, she will retake it, as the blossoming flora will facilitate further study, enabling her to pass and avoid subsequent attempts. Nevertheless, one senses she also anticipates the vernal season's return, permitting her to appreciate the flowers and the presence of growth and scholarly pursuit.
1232	10097	4	1	The author likely concluded the narrative with that specific paragraph to illustrate that Saeng was not resigning herself to defeat. Originally from Vietnam, Saeng had relocated to the United States and profoundly missed her homeland, where nothing remained familiar. “It’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled, “I mean, not like the kind we had at—at home.” She discovered she was still too emotionally unsettled to utter the word ‘home.’ However, once Saeng ultimately recognized she was beginning to adapt to American life, she resolved to attempt the driving examination once more. “When they return in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take that test again.”
1233	10098	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the character's burgeoning comfort after observing the geese and successfully nurturing the hibiscus through the winter. The narrative states, “… their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now,” which elucidates her emotional state upon seeing the geese overhead, a sight reminiscent of Vietnam. Furthermore, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” she acquires greater confidence, experiencing a sensation of being back in her native country. Ultimately, this rationale explains the author's decision to conclude the narrative with that particular paragraph.
1234	10099	4	1	The author likely concludes the story with this paragraph to enable the reader to envision subsequent events once spring arrives for Saeng. This approach permits the reader to employ their imagination for a deeper connection with the narrative. An additional reason for this concluding paragraph is to instill hope within the reader regarding her potential to pass the examination on her subsequent attempt. It also functioned as a method to conclude the story on a positive and optimistic note.
1235	10100	4	1	The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because, akin to the geese, she will return to attempt again. It seems she was unable to complete nearly everything she intended, and the author wished the reader to recognize the character's profound determination and ambition. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the character's resolve could not be defeated by a single winter and that she will persist relentlessly until she accomplishes her essential objectives.
1236	10101	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” likely concludes with Saeng’s vow to retake the test to demonstrate that adversity and unfamiliar circumstances cannot justify succumbing to despair, and that solace persists. Within the narrative, fleeting glimpses of her former home emerge through memories, enabling the reader to comprehend the profundity of Saeng’s difficult day. The author juxtaposes these warm, comforting recollections against the cold bitterness of her present reality. “She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.” Here, Saeng recalls her grandmother, a memory that evokes sorrow for her lost home. The author constructs this despair to amplify the final paragraph’s significance, which ultimately conveys hope. As Saeng declares, “then I will take that test again,” her resolve is palpable. Furthermore, the author expresses the enduring presence of structure and stability within a changing world, where simple things provide assurance. Saeng’s observation that “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” illustrates reliable constants that offer security amidst perceived desolation. The concluding paragraph thus counterbalances the narrative’s despair, emphasizing the necessity of hope and the perpetual availability of comfort.
1237	10102	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide a definitive resolution. The final sentences depict Saeng channeling her concentration and resolve toward the hibiscus, thereby demonstrating her profound appreciation for the plant. The author sought to furnish conclusive evidence for the narrative’s thematic arc. For instance, the statement, “in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” incorporates the plant’s winter dormancy. The subsequent spring signifies the plant’s revival, paralleling the character Saeng’s own resurgence and her anticipated return to visit it.
1238	10103	4	1	The author created the impression of initial aversion, though he possessed a deep affection for flowers and enjoyed laboring in the greenhouse alongside others. His mother was a horticulturalist, and he appreciated witnessing people return to the establishment because they held an affinity for the location, which contributed to his personal contentment.
1239	10104	4	1	The author includes this conclusion to illustrate her profound connection to the plant, which simultaneously evokes memories of her childhood. An example of her affection is her reaction to its “rich scent” (Minfong Ho). Another instance is the tactile description, “It felt smooth and cool” (Minfong Ho). An illustration of its link to her past is the realization of knowledge she possessed but had forgotten, which she subsequently recalled. For these reasons, one can deduce why the author appended this segment at the end.
1240	10105	4	1	I contend the author positioned this as the final statement to leave the reader with a resonant message. The protagonist has relocated to an entirely unfamiliar environment and culture, where the sole familiar element was a flower indigenous to her homeland. This personal vow serves as an admonition against surrender. It advocates perseverance and suggests that embracing new experiences can yield unforeseen knowledge and growth. Consequently, the girl did not capitulate. Her plant symbolized a new commencement; its renewal heralded her own. It also represents her life’s journey, signifying a new beginning as indicated by the textual reference to cyclical return.
1241	10106	4	1	I surmise the author composed that passage because perhaps she perceives winter as a season wherein she can genuinely reveal her identity, yet when spring emerges, she resembles a flower that has remained dormant throughout the winter.
1242	10107	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the preceding section discusses the ""winter hibiscus"" and the geese. Consequently, the author composes a concluding paragraph that effectively encapsulates the story, leaving the reader with a sense of contentment."
1243	10108	4	1	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrative delineates the obstacles Saeng encountered upon arriving in a foreign country. Having just failed her driving test, Saeng is reminded of her homeland through encountering tropical flowers. The author concludes by referencing geese: ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This segment is profoundly significant as it examines her personal growth and hope for transformation, analogous to the geese's return and the hibiscus evolving into a beautiful blossom. It communicates her determination to persevere and adapt to her environment, just as the plant survives and the geese return to a changed landscape, thereby concluding Saeng's reflections and aspirations for the future while acclimating to her new surroundings."
1244	10109	4	1	The author likely concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. Perhaps the author intended to present a compelling fact concerning the hibiscus's response to snowfall; for instance, the text explains the plant's growth requirements, such as sunlight, water, soil, and the removal of its waste. The author may have reasoned that illustrating how the process recommences with the snow provides a fitting conclusion to the narrative.
1245	10110	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng stated she failed the test and would retake it upon spring's return. The final paragraph states, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" yet it deliberately omits specifying the exact nature of the test she intends to undertake."
1246	10111	4	1	The rationale for postponing the examination until spring is to determine whether her preference for bitter melon over a Big Mac remains unchanged.
1247	10112	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify the necessity of retaking the examination. This implies she must undertake the same endeavor the following year, adapting to life much like the hibiscus. Furthermore, she advocates for striving toward one's utmost potential, as fulfillment is achieved by living completely, rendering this a fitting conclusion for the story.
1248	10113	4	1	The author's rationale for concluding the story in this manner is to provide a resolution while simultaneously suggesting the potential for future narrative development.
1249	10114	4	1	The author concludes that the spring season, with its melting snow and returning flowers, evokes the essence of spring at home, which induces a state of relaxation. Furthermore, spring is aesthetically superior as the blossoms emerge, and the particular flower serves as a reminder of her domestic blessings.
1250	10115	4	1	Saeng resolved that in spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she would retake the examination. She will postpone the test until she is confident of passing to obtain her license. Securing her license would grant her the autonomy to drive anywhere, eliminating the need for her mother's transportation and enabling independent travel, though she must await the thaw before attempting the test again.
1251	10116	4	1	"The passage reveals Saeng's profound affection for her flora, demonstrating her genuine pleasure in cultivating and dedicating time to them. She conveys within the final sentences an eager anticipation for winter's conclusion, heralding the budding of her plants and the subsequent enjoyment they will provide.  The author employs the concluding paragraph to synthesize the narrative's elements cohesively. It further suggests her anticipated success on the examination with the arrival of spring. The evocative phrase, ""in the spring, when the snows melt,"" is particularly compelling for its articulation of her aspirations and resolute determination to achieve them.  The author likely utilizes this paragraph to illustrate her establishment of a goal, marking the commencement of a renewed cycle. The geese function as a symbol for spring, the period when she would resume preparations for this ""test."" The budding hibiscus signifies hope, representing both a new beginning and an object of reminiscence within the narrative. Ultimately, this concluding segment employs various symbols and literary devices to communicate themes of hope, fond memories, and a fresh commencement.  She would cultivate various blossoms, irrigate them, and witness the geese returning to her pond, thereby completing the seasonal cycle.  The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph for several significant reasons. One purpose is to underscore the profound symbolism of the flower. Another is to articulate the central theme. For instance, the concluding sentence, ""Then I will take that test again,"" connects the specific incident of the driving test to the broader motif of the flower. This, in turn, relates to the overarching theme of adaptation and persistent effort until one successfully adjusts. That final paragraph was therefore essential to the story's thematic depth and ultimate significance."

1256	10121	4	1	The author concludes Minfong Ho’s story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in spring, intending to demonstrate how recollections of the past can be transmuted into future resolve. Following her failed driving test, Saeng discovers the hibiscus, which evokes potent memories of her homeland and grandmother. She purchases the plant and situates it within her garden. After planting it, she observes a flock of Canada geese overhead. By integrating her memories of her former home and family with her new environment, Saeng determines to attempt the examination once more. The author employs this concluding paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s unwavering perseverance.
1257	10122	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative to illustrate Saeng’s readiness to embrace her new existence. The return of the geese and the budding hibiscus evoke a sense of belonging. She will be prepared to retake the examination once this feeling of being at home is firmly established. The text explicitly states, “when the geese return"" and ""this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Evidently, these elements symbolize her homeland, and achieving this comfort is the precise reason for the passage’s concluding significance."
1258	10123	4	1	The author selected this paragraph for the conclusion because it effectively reiterates the narrative’s central theme, thereby ensuring the reader comprehends the story’s fundamental message. This deliberate restatement of the primary idea provides a definitive resolution, which clarifies the author's rationale for concluding the story in this particular manner.
1259	10124	4	1	The narrative establishes that she has failed her examination. During the winter, while the hibiscus is still striving to regenerate its lovely petals, she informs her mother that she will not retake the test until the hibiscus begins to bud and the spring season returns, thereby linking her personal resolve to a natural cycle of renewal and growth.
1260	10125	4	1	This passage effectively concludes the story, as following the preceding events and her acquired horticultural knowledge from her mother, she recalls the significance of the hibiscus and its budding process. Her concluding statement signifies her intention to retake the test with the arrival of spring. This examination will ultimately assess the extent of the gardening expertise she has assimilated from her mother throughout the preceding period.
1261	10126	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to suggest that her grandmother's passing coincided with the geese's migration, or perhaps with the commencement of the floral bloom.
1262	10127	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" incorporates the final paragraph to convey the protagonist's progression toward moving forward while retaining memories of her homeland. Initially, Saeng experienced profound longing for her native country. Her emotional fragility is evident when she struggles to articulate her thoughts, subsequently bursting into tears, indicating her inability to reconcile with her new environment. The hibiscus flower evokes potent memories of her past, initially complicating her adaptation. Upon discovering a fallen blossom, Saeng retrieves it, and its scent triggers a sensory recollection of her grandmother's hair. This object provides a tangible connection to her home. By clasping it firmly, she secures a memento to anchor her memories. This act signifies the initial step toward acceptance, though she requires further time for adjustment. The narrative indicates that many once-alien elements have grown increasingly familiar. Saeng resolves that the hibiscus's dormancy period will afford her sufficient time to acclimatize, and by undertaking the test, she will finalize her acceptance of her new country, perpetually remembering her origins through the winter hibiscus."
1263	10128	4	1	The narrative incorporates this paragraph because it establishes a crucial narrative arc. Initially, the protagonist fails an important examination and perceives her mother's disappointment. Following the planting of the hibiscus, she resolves to retake the test, anticipating her mother's approval. This inclusion is structurally vital, as the story commences with the failure; omitting this resolution would leave the reader questioning the mother's response and the protagonist's subsequent motivation. Furthermore, it satisfies the narrative tension created by the initial failure, addressing the reader's inherent curiosity regarding whether she would attempt the test again and her reasons for doing so.
1264	10129	4	1	The author deliberately concluded the story with an ambiguous resolution. This narrative strategy sustains reader engagement and fosters interest in the author's subsequent literary works. Furthermore, such an open-ended conclusion creates potential for future development, effectively laying the groundwork for a sequel and leaving specific narrative possibilities intentionally unexplored.
1265	10130	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's unwavering determination to fulfill the task her mother set, despite her initial failure. Saeng fails because the plant she purchases, though beautiful, is deemed excessively costly, inciting her mother's rebuke. Distraught by this failure, Saeng nevertheless proceeds to plant the winter hibiscus with care. This action demonstrates her refusal to abandon the plant, which serves as a profound symbol of her homeland and holds significant personal meaning for her.
1266	10131	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph because she intends to...
1267	10132	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's incipient adaptation to her new country. Initially, the character, Saeng, experiences profound homesickness and a failure to acclimate. While returning from an unsuccessful driver's examination, she discovers a hibiscus in a florist shop. This flower holds particular significance, evoking memories of her native Vietnam. For Saeng, the hibiscus symbolizes solace during disappointment, a connection to her past, and the capacity to surmount obstacles. Her initial inability to adjust to life's changes adversely affected her. The author employs this concluding paragraph to convey that life invariably presents changes and challenges, yet there will always be a source of support to overcome them, exemplified by Saeng perceiving the hibiscus as her means of perseverance, with the intention to retake her driving test once fully adjusted.
1268	10133	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to articulate that following the conclusion of winter and spring, when the hibiscus begins to bud, the protagonist will commence anew and endeavor once more. The author suggests that Saeng anticipates the arrival of spring to cultivate her own garden. This symbolic anticipation provides the rationale for the author's decision to conclude the story with this particular paragraph.
1269	10134	4	1	"This paragraph signifies an undertaking Saeng will pursue over the course of a year. She intends to develop and transform in preparation for retaking the examination, representing a form of rebirth. The protagonist aspires to become an entirely new individual by the time the test recurs. Her mother appears perturbed by her daughter's every action and decision. The daughter experiences a sudden realization regarding the hibiscus and its demise, contemplating ""the quiet repetition of season upon season."" She draws a parallel between herself, the flower, and the migrating geese. Throughout the year, the flower undergoes cycles of death and revival. Saeng desires to improve after navigating a similar phase, ultimately blossoming into beauty once again."
1270	10135	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because, upon returning from her driver's test, Saeng encountered a beautiful winter hibiscus. She subsequently purchased the expensive flower from a store. When she arrived home, her mother, who was planting vegetables, inquired about it. Upon learning the truth and the flower's considerable cost, she became furious at the perceived extravagance. Saeng then made a significant decision to attend the event despite her mother's anger, likely because the flower reminded her of Vietnam. The author included this paragraph, I believe, to signify that with the return of the geese and the blossoming of the flowers, Saeng will retake the test. Just as the flowers were not in bloom when she initially failed, their subsequent growth signals the appropriate time to try again. In my opinion, this constitutes a fitting conclusion and also poses an excellent question.
1271	10136	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow to provide the reader with a definitive resolution. This passage signifies Saeng's intention to reattempt her driving examination after acclimating to her new existence in a foreign nation. Once she discovers familiarity within her environment, she will experience a greater sense of belonging. Throughout the story, her disconnection from Vietnam induces profound isolation. The hibiscus plant initially provides a semblance of solace, as its texture felt ""smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The final paragraph indicates that Saeng will discover more profound comforts in her new locale than merely a plant and several geese."
1272	10137	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the melting snow and returning geese signal the commencement of the planting season and intensified horticultural labor. Snow cover prevents cultivation, whereas the geese's return heralds the appropriate period for sowing seeds and managing the expanding garden. The test serves to determine if she can achieve a superior result compared to her previous attempts in prior years.
1273	10138	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with that particular paragraph because it provides the most fitting and artistically coherent resolution, thereby justifying its selection as the story's denouement.
1274	10139	4	1	The author concludes the story with Saeng's resolution to retake the test in the spring to illustrate her adaptation and capacity for decision-making within her new country, mirroring her former life in Vietnam. There, she participated in traditions such as arranging her grandmother's hair into a bun adorned with a hibiscus. Furthermore, retrieving water from the well sometimes yielded a hibiscus blossom, establishing the flower as an object of profound comfort. Now residing in the United States, she seeks to utilize this symbol while simultaneously observing the cyclical patterns of her new environment, such as the migratory return of geese and the springtime blossoming of flora. Her decision to retake the test in spring symbolizes her readiness for a new beginning, analogous to the budding hibiscus. Both the plant's placement in her garden and Saeng's relocation represent significant change, yet they maintain a connection to tradition while creating space for new experiences.
1275	10140	4	1	The author incorporated that sentence to suggest that the intervening period will afford her sufficient opportunity to prepare for the test successfully, and also due to her appreciation for the geese.
1276	10141	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate the ultimate resolve and fortitude bestowed upon Saeng. It is as though the plant's presence was necessary to reveal her capacity to persevere and ultimately pass the examination. The plant becomes a consoling object that evokes memories of her homeland. She brought the plant to show her mother but discovered herself too emotionally overwhelmed to even utter the phrase ""at home,"" which reveals the depth of her longing. However, she ultimately comprehends that this is her new home and her surroundings are growing increasingly familiar."
1277	10142	4	1	"The author concludes with this sentence because it signifies a genesis of new life. Just as the winter, which terminated the plants, concludes life, the spring will arrive and commence anew. This mirrors Saeng's sentiment; having left her nation and all its memories, she feels displaced, akin to the winter hibiscus. Yet, with the spring's arrival, she will feel revitalized, prepared and capable of confronting challenges, as she expressed: ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" She illustrates that with each new season comes transformation, and through these changes, she will proceed to retake the driver's examination."
1278	10143	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph for several purposes. One is to illustrate that although she has presently failed, subsequent opportunities will arise. Furthermore, it demonstrates that despite current adversities, more favorable circumstances will eventually ensue. For these reasons, it constituted a powerfully efficient method to conclude the narrative.
1279	10144	4	1	The author employs symbolism to convey a deeper message. Saeng stated that in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, she will take the test again. The author utilizes the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng's own maturation; as the plant develops, she too will become prepared to retake the examination. This use of symbolism allows the author to convey a more profound dimension of the story.
1280	10146	4	1	She composed that statement to communicate her conviction that she will be prepared by the time spring arrives, at which point she will take the test and succeed.
1281	10147	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's profound desire to resume cultivation. This is evident as Saeng's existence is fundamentally connected to horticulture and the seasonal cycle. She and her mother derive their sustenance from their cultivated produce. Consequently, throughout the year, they dedicate the majority of their time to their garden, nurturing crops for both commercial purposes and personal provision. They preserve food for winter and sell the surplus to procure the necessary equipment for continuing their agricultural endeavors. The segment referencing ""when they come back"" alludes to the geese. She finds great solace in observing the geese in flight overhead and their subsequent landings in the yard during a pleasant day in the season. Following the snow's thaw, she is eager to return to working the soil with her hands and knees, recommencing the planting process. The budding of the hibiscus signals the commencement of growth for all other flora. Saeng's life is intrinsically oriented around the annual rhythm of planting. The author incorporates this paragraph to underscore that this activity constitutes Saeng's ultimate aspiration."
1282	10148	4	1	"In the conclusion of ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng resolves to retake her driving examination in the spring, coinciding with the snow's thaw and the geese's return. Spring is the season when these occurrences transpire, along with the perennial budding of the winter hibiscus. Her family had relocated from Vietnam to a new locale, and she had purchased a winter hibiscus plant to serve as a memento of her youth. Its blossoming will prompt her to retake the test, as the phenomenon will instill in her the hope for a fresh commencement in her life and her integration as a citizen within her new community."
1283	10149	4	1	"The short story ""The Winter Hibiscus"" chronicles the experience of a young girl, Saeng, who relocates from her homeland. This narrative fundamentally explores the protagonist's endeavor to acclimatize to an unfamiliar lifestyle and the accompanying transformations she must navigate and ultimately embrace."
1284	10150	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng possesses an unwavering determination to pass her driving test, analogous to the geese's relentless migration south for the winter. The author aims to illuminate the profound beauty inherent in persevering through adversity and persistently striving toward one's ultimate objective despite the obstacles encountered.
1285	10151	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a potent resolution. The final statement is: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will try the test again."" Essentially, the author selected this conclusion to highlight Saeng's resilience; it demonstrates her strength, her willingness to endeavor toward self-improvement, and her commitment to persevere. Textual evidence supporting this includes the vow ""then I will try the test again,"" the observation ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become familiar,"" and the description ""There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply."" These statements collectively substantiate the rationale for the author's powerful concluding paragraph."
1286	10152	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the final paragraph to illustrate how frequently Saeng is assailed by her recollections. Saeng had previously been ""tested"" while visiting a florist, where memories inundated her. She attempted to recapture the sensations from her past when her grandmother was present, yet she comprehended that those elements from her memory were irrevocably lost, which provoked her tears. Saeng informed her mother of her failure on the test and purchased the plant for consolation. Her mother responded with profound understanding and acceptance. After planting the hibiscus, Saeng ultimately declares that ""In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She recognizes that the flower's resurgence will evoke tears and resurrect her memories, thereby subjecting her to another trial."
1287	10154	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a girl named Saeng, having failed her driving test that day, resolves to retake it in the spring. She concludes with this assertion to signify a new season and a fresh commencement in her life. This archetype of transition from a harsh, cold winter to a pleasant, warm spring indicates that the difficulties faced by Saeng and her mother will ameliorate. As the arduous winter departs, a tranquil and promising beginning arrives with spring. Saeng acknowledges this transformation and is confident in her impending success."
1288	10155	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative for several significant reasons. The entire passage, for instance, discusses how the hibiscus flower equips Saeng with the capacity to surmount obstacles and consoles her during a period of disappointment. This concluding paragraph indicates that ""in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding,"" and the world is restored to beauty, Saeng will retake her examination. She is assured that, aided by the hibiscus, she will succeed. It demonstrates that her hope and conviction for passing the test are derived from the flower. The plant, with its ""waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers,"" will furnish her with the strength, determination, courage, and resolve necessary to pass in the spring."
1289	10156	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's declaration, ""...then I’ll take the test again."" This illustrates Saeng's willingness to endeavor to adapt to her new environment, which is what she signifies by ""test."" For example, she previously stated, ""I-I failed the test,"" when her mother inquired what was wrong. She invested considerable money in the plant, hoping to mentally remain in her homeland, a sentiment she found overwhelming. She ends with an optimistic statement because it conveys her anticipation of a promising future within her new home."
1290	10157	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with that paragraph for numerous reasons, incorporating examples from the narrative that illuminate these motives. One reason is to demonstrate her perseverance, as indicated by her statement, ""Then I will take the test again,"" revealing her determination to persist. Another reason is to convey that the hibiscus possesses a future; its budding signifies its potential to adapt to its environment, paralleling the girl's own impending adjustment. A final reason is that it communicates her ongoing and future efforts to excel. Her realization that many once-strange things now seem ""almost familiar"" shows her growing acclimatization and comprehension of her capability to adapt. The story provides ample justification for this concluding paragraph, with its embedded examples yielding multiple interpretations."
1291	10158	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative resolved to retake the examination after the winter concludes and the flower commences budding. This illustrates the parallel between the plant and the narrator and their respective adversities. The winter symbolizes a tribulation for the hibiscus, yet it will endure this period to flourish in the spring. This instills within the author the conviction that she, too, can persevere through her struggles to ultimately thrive. Another challenge that both she and the hibiscus confront is being ""root bound."" The author profoundly misses her native Vietnam. Nevertheless, both must and will acclimate to their unfamiliar surroundings."
1292	10159	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to demonstrate how her profound homesickness adversely impacted her driving test. In her homeland, the climate was perpetually warm and imbued with cherished familial memories. In her new country, the environment is frigid and snowy, conditions to which she is completely unaccustomed. The text indicates she will retake the test once these seasonal changes occur because the environment will then resemble her native country, allowing her to concentrate more effectively on the examination rather than her longing.
1293	10160	4	1	"The author Minfong Ho concluded the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that particular paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve not to surrender, demonstrating her determination to pass the driving test and, simultaneously, to acclimatize to her new home. It functions as a form of motivation: ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The hibiscus itself serves as this motivation, evoking positive memories of individuals who fostered her happiness and self-belief. Minfong also concluded the narrative in this manner to signify that, by the following year, Saeng will commence anew. She will learn to find contentment in her new existence without fixating on her past. Saeng's reference to ""… in the spring…"" symbolizes the commencement of a new year, an opportunity for renewal and optimism. This constituted an exceptionally effective conclusion, as it establishes a positive tone. It informs the reader that Saeng possesses the fortitude to honor her past while progressing toward a new future, and the author likely intends to suggest that everyone should cultivate such resilience."
1294	10161	4	1	"She concluded with that paragraph to substantiate that, despite her profound longing for the ""old country,"" she possesses the resilience to adapt and ultimately prosper in her new environment."
1295	10162	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it evokes a sense of hope. She was struggling to adapt to her new home, which generated feelings of despair. Failing her driving test exacerbated her situation. To ameliorate her distress, she purchased a hibiscus, which vividly reminded her of her former home. She found the plant profoundly comforting, and it assisted her in navigating those difficult times. In the final paragraph, Saeng anticipates the spring, when she can retake the test with the aspiration of succeeding. The paragraph provides a definitive feeling of hopefulness, which is why the author selected this conclusion.
1296	10163	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng possesses an indomitable spirit, thereby affirming the persistence of hope. It further serves to instruct the reader in cultivating hope and patience, coupled with the understanding that meaningful progress requires time. Saeng ultimately passed the test of not succumbing to the sorrow and misery of longing for her homeland. Her reflection, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” signifies her gradual adaptation. Therefore, by concluding with this realization and drawing a parallel to the geese, the narrative demonstrates her burgeoning resilience and her resolve to retake the examination, underscoring her unwavering determination.
1297	10164	4	1	"From interpreting the story ""Winter,"" the author incorporates the phrase, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” because this passage directly corresponds to the story’s title. The seasonal imagery of winter and the promised renewal of spring are intrinsically linked, establishing a thematic cohesion that reinforces the central motif of cyclical endurance and the anticipation of new beginnings, which the title encapsulates."
1298	10165	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to convey that, despite Saeng's initial failure on her examination, her resolve remains unshaken, compelling her to return and attempt it once more until she succeeds. This literary choice effectively illustrates Saeng's profound determination to ultimately pass the assessment and improve her performance, thereby concluding the story on a note of resilient perseverance rather than defeat, which solidifies her character's tenacious spirit.
1299	10166	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it highlights the plant, which symbolizes numerous positive attributes for the protagonist who failed a dearly desired examination. Both the character and the plant exemplify perseverance, and the author intends to convey a message to the reader to never relinquish pursuit of a cherished goal. The plant serves as an emblem of tenacity, as it endures the harsh winter season. Similarly, the main character refuses to abandon her ambition to pass the test, thereby communicating a powerful theme of persistent resolve.
1300	10167	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the statement, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This resolution is employed because the character believed she had not performed to her capacity after failing; thus, with the spring's return, she is determined to reattempt the endeavor with the aspiration of achieving success on this subsequent occasion, thereby concluding her arc with a pledge of renewed effort.
1301	10168	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify her intention to return and undertake the olfactory examination once more, following the thawing of the snow and the geese's return.
1302	10169	4	1	The narrative concerns a teenage girl named Saeng, whose family has recently relocated to the United States from Vietnam. After failing her driving examination, Saeng discovers a hibiscus plant during her walk home, with which she becomes enamored. Saeng's mother maintains a garden, consistently cultivating plants and vegetables which she utilizes for meals. The author concludes with a paragraph indicating that Saeng will retake the test in the spring, when the hibiscus buds emerge, ostensibly because she believes the plant's beauty will facilitate her success.
1303	10170	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to convey the protagonist's self-affirmation of hope for passing her examination. The sprouting hibiscus will provide her with the fortitude to retake the test and, optimistically, to pass it, as the winter hibiscus evoked memories of her homeland.
1304	10171	4	1	The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, because this passage demonstrates that the hibiscus motivates her renewed attempt. As the hibiscus grows strong after winter, she resolves to emulate its resilience and persevere with her test.
1305	10172	4	1	"The author concludes with this to illustrate Saeng's resilience and capacity to adapt and appreciate her environment. Her difficulty stating ""I failed the test"" and ""at home"" reveals her insecurity and loneliness within her new surroundings; her declaration to try again in spring provides hopeful expectation for her adaptation. Her experience of comparing her former life with her current one, noting their similarities, signifies her decision to grant this new place an opportunity."
1306	10173	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to articulate her declaration, ""Then I will take that test again,"" affirming her faith in the Flowers. She and the Flowers both adapt to their respective circumstances, each demonstrating a determined resolve to @CAPS1 within @CAPS2 environments. They each surmount significant obstacles, and perhaps she wishes to envision what lies ahead. She likely hopes her belief about the Flowers is correct, and she appreciates the promise of spring."
1307	10174	4	1	I genuinely appreciate the author's method of concluding the narrative with this paragraph. It effectively encapsulates the story's essence, distilling it into a concise statement that provokes curiosity regarding subsequent events and the potential for a sequel. This is a profoundly compelling narrative to which I find myself able to relate on multiple personal levels.
1308	10175	4	1	The author concludes with this particular scenario because the individual possesses a challenge to overcome or a personal situation involving a son. However, if one interprets it correctly, one will recognize that it is their moment to excel; they should seize the opportunity before it is lost, as they have only a single day to demonstrate their worth to others.
1309	10176	4	1	The author concludes with this sentence to demonstrate the girl's burgeoning self-confidence. It additionally affords her sufficient opportunity to prepare for the subsequent examination. Furthermore, she is assured that she will be prepared when her flower commences to bloom.
1310	10177	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to facilitate a subsequent narrative building upon a vow made silently; he will compose the story in the spring, upon their return.
1311	10178	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to articulate that if seemingly impossible events can occur, then she should equally be capable of passing the examination. She was juxtaposing inherently incompatible concepts, such as the spring thaw, the geese's return, and the hibiscus budding, as conditions for retaking the test. Her implication was that if her most cherished entity could surmount its impediments, she would willingly revisit her most painful experience. She remains uncertain of success but is resolved to persist relentlessly until she achieves it. Within the story, she struggles with assimilation, possessing only the knowledge from her homeland. Her sole recourse is to intensify her efforts, which may ultimately enable her to pass the assessment.
1312	10179	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with this paragraph because, although she was ostensibly weeping over failing her examination, the underlying cause was more profound. Her profound homesickness impeded her concentration, and she required an emotional outlet that would conceal from her mother the true depth of her longing for home.
1313	10180	4	1	Upon their return, Saeng made a silent vow to herself that in the spring, following the snow's thaw, the geese's return, and the budding of the hibiscus, she would retake the examination. The author concludes the story by depicting her mother, seemingly impervious to the cold, still working in the vegetable garden to unearth the final onions with a rusted trowel.
1314	10181	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that the hibiscus provides inspiration and solace beyond human capacity. For instance, after Saeng failed her driving examination, she encountered a hibiscus, sought it at a florist, and clasped a petal while closing her eyes. The plant vividly recalled her beloved native Vietnam, offering comfort distinct from the variety at home. By concluding with Saeng's resolution to retake the test upon the hibiscus budding, the narrative illustrates how the flower empowers her to overcome life's obstacles and endure personal hardships.
1315	10182	4	1	Saeng's concluding statement signifies that she will retake the examination when the season is appropriate for those plants. The test pertains to appreciating the narrative's plot, along with the characteristics, personages, and historical context associated with these particular plants.
1316	10183	4	1	She resolved to forgo retaking the examination unless the winter hibiscus revived, deeply distressed by her initial failure. She devoted much of her day to observing the hibiscus, yet remained disconsolate that they were not the authentic specimens from her homeland. Her mother asserted they were sufficiently resilient to endure the winter. Upon their return, Saeng made a silent vow to herself that in the spring, when the snow dissipates, the geese reappear, and this hibiscus begins to bud, she would indeed attempt the test once more.
1317	10184	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for its symbolic representation of hopeful prospects. This denouement embodies optimism, as the flower metaphorically parallels the girl's own resilience; her assertion that if the blossom can endure the season, so can she, signifies this hope. This symbolizes her realization that adapting to her new nation will require a considerable duration, yet she will ultimately succeed. This is profoundly meaningful because the girl regarded her day as dreadful, and this resolution concludes it on a positive note. She spent the entire day longing for her native country and mourning her grandmother and friends. However, this paragraph constitutes her solemn pledge to persevere through the winter until spring, when circumstances will improve, allowing her to retake the examination. The entire story culminates in this pivotal moment of Saeng's recognition that she will overcome her tribulations, just as the flower will survive the winter, acknowledging the necessary time to acclimate to this unfamiliar country and its requisite lifestyle.
1318	10185	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this sentence because it conveys a sense of optimism for the future. This statement informs readers that while the present is arduous, circumstances will eventually ameliorate. Although Saeng failed this particular examination, she refuses to relinquish hope for ultimately passing it. She is confident she will succeed in the spring, when conditions are more favorable. While Saeng undoubtedly misses her homeland, she will not permit this to impede her future prospects. This is the rationale for the author's concluding the narrative with the vow, ""when they come back, Saeng pledged silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""
1319	10186	4	1	The author's intent is to describe the snow melting and the arrival of spring. The implication is that the flora, including flowers, trees, and grass, are regaining their beauty. Furthermore, the author indicates that spring has commenced and winter has concluded. This explains why she initiates planting during the winter, so the vegetation may emerge as pleasant and aesthetically pleasing by spring. This is my interpretation of the author's meaning, which also justifies its inclusion in the paragraph. The author could have elaborated further on how the plants were growing so magnificently. Additional descriptive details would have enhanced the reader's comprehension of the paragraph's subject matter.
1320	10187	4	1	"The author elected to conclude the story in this manner because it effectively integrates the narrative's various facets and underlying themes. For instance, this final sentence incorporates both the geese and the hibiscus, symbolizing her new and former homes existing in harmony. It also declares that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which correlates with the determination of the hibiscus flower as it tenaciously endures the winter. Considerable wisdom can be derived from the symbolic messages embedded within that concluding statement. It suggests that although the past may be behind you, it remains within your heart as you confront new challenges, and with sufficient resolve, those obstacles can be surmounted."
1321	10188	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's profound determination and her ultimate triumph over the adversities of adapting to a new country. Despite the considerable doubts she harbored immediately following her examination, her resolution to retake it demonstrates significant fortitude, as evidenced by her declaration, “Here, let me help you, mother,” she offered. Her mother’s subsequent consolation, assuring her it is acceptable, provides Saeng with the necessary encouragement to assist her mother and internally resolve that she must not permit a single setback to impede her progress. With such support, Saeng will undoubtedly pass the examination upon her next attempt.
1322	10189	4	1	"In the story “The Winter Hibiscus,” author Minfong Ho concludes with Saeng’s silent vow: “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion effectively conveys her determination to prosper in her new country and illustrates how memories of her grandmother inspire her to pursue excellence in her new home. Initially, Saeng encounters a flower shop where she observes flora from her homeland cultivated in pots. The sight of these flowers triggers a flood of nostalgic memories, evoking both joy and sorrow. Upon returning home, she confesses to her mother, “I-I failed the test,” her disappointment palpable through her actions as she “did not dare look her mother in the eye” and “nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.” Later, she plants the hibiscus in the garden. This act of purchasing and planting the flower symbolizes Saeng’s desire to commemorate her grandmother and her origins. Reminiscing about her grandmother furnishes her with the resilience to aspire for a better future and to achieve success in her new environment, as these memories, while bittersweet, ultimately foster happiness and motivation."
1323	10190	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a quotation affirming the protagonist's intent to pursue another attempt. Authors frequently employ divergent conclusions to provoke reader anticipation for a sequel or subsequent narrative, thereby introducing a compelling twist. Furthermore, such an ending serves to engage the reader's imagination, compelling them to envision subsequent events. This technique proves effective because, while the established events are clear, it incites speculation regarding her ultimate success or failure in the subsequent endeavor, thereby sustaining narrative engagement.
1324	10191	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's willingness to persevere. Although it may not occur immediately, Saeng aspires to revisit the flowers evocative of her homeland without succumbing to emotional distress. She perceives her mother's understanding yet simultaneously feels she has disappointed her. “But how could you? You know how much we—what happened?” This maternal query reinforces Saeng's sense of having failed her mother. However, Mrs. Panouvong subsequently expresses relief that Saeng attempted the test, despite her failure. Detecting this faint disappointment, Saeng becomes resolute to try again.
1325	10192	4	1	The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph to underscore Saeng's determined character. The author intended to reveal to readers that Saeng possesses considerable strength, as her persistent efforts to pass the examination initially were evident throughout the narrative. Her subsequent failure serves not as a defeat but to highlight her resilience; she refuses to relinquish hope and is resolved to undertake the test again.
1326	10193	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to elucidate her perspective and foster comprehension of her formative circumstances, as exemplified by her statements regarding her upbringing.
1327	10194	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the sentence concerning Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in spring to articulate a point about immigration. The author's contention is that immigrants were instructed to forsake their origins upon arrival in @CAPS1. Within the story, the ""test"" signifies the process of assimilating into @LOCATION1 and erasing her homeland's memory. Saeng utters these words following her failure of this test and her acquisition of an item evocative of her native country. Ultimately, the author depicts the treatment of immigrants, who were commanded to discard their former identities upon their arrival in @LOCATION1."
1328	10195	4	1	"In the story ""Winter @CAPS1,"" the author conveys that Saeng originated from a location distinct from her current residence. The text states, ""It was like walking into another world,"" indicating her perception of being an unknown entity, recognized solely by herself in this unfamiliar environment."
1329	10196	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it signifies hope and the certainty of spring's return. This assures the family that their situation will improve and that circumstances will become favorable for them as well. The girl will also establish friendships when the spring season arrives.
1330	10197	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng failed her driver's test and intends to attempt it again in the spring. The narrative concludes thus because the hibiscus plant she and her mother cultivated will then be growing and blooming, while the returning geese will enhance her sense of belonging. This comfort, derived from memories of her homeland, will subsequently enable her to pass the examination."
1331	10198	4	1	Ultimately, the narrative concludes by indicating her intention to retake the examination in the spring, coinciding with the geese's return from their winter migration. This declaration signifies her commitment to a new beginning with the spring season and the geese's arrival, representing a complete renewal for the upcoming year and a fresh opportunity to prepare for the significant test. It is a chance to recover from her previous failure, allowing her to commence anew with a different prospect to reattempt the endeavor. Her mother expressed profound disbelief upon learning of the failure, yet assured her that the situation would be acceptable and that she could retake the assessment in the forthcoming season.
1332	10199	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this specific paragraph to articulate the protagonist's contemplation of future events. Saeng declared privately to herself, ""when they return, I vow, in the spring, once the snow dissipates and the geese come back and this hibiscus begins to bud, then I shall attempt the examination once more."""
1333	10200	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to provide an optimistic resolution and illustrate hope for the future. Initially, throughout the story, Saeng experienced profound loneliness and despondency due to her longing for her native Vietnam. Amidst this melancholy, she encountered the winter hibiscus, which evoked memories from her childhood, instilling a measure of hope for adapting to her unfamiliar surroundings and existence. The flower symbolized illumination and future prospects. Subsequently, the narrative demonstrates a theme of perseverance; after failing her driving examination, Saeng returned home feeling unsuccessful. Her declaration to retake the test in the spring, when the hibiscus flowers, exemplifies her determination and refusal to surrender. Ultimately, the author selected this concluding paragraph to end positively and present an affirmative perspective on life, conveying that regardless of origin, one can surmount any obstacle through love and perseverance, achieving any goal concerning school, tests, or home with diligence and faith.
1334	10201	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to demonstrate that she will undertake this action once she has acclimated to the transformations within her new country. Her statement, “When the geese return,” references their faint honks and flight patterns, which have become familiar through successive seasons. Similarly, the budding hibiscus will remind her of her home in Vietnam; observing the flower and hearing the geese will provide the necessary confidence and encouragement for her to retake the driving examination.
1335	10202	4	1	Saeng vowed silently to herself due to the difficulty she encountered in forming new friendships. She enjoys cultivating plants around her, as she perceives them as companions. Taking the shovel, Saeng completed the planting task for her mother, an action which significantly improved her self-perception and emotional state.
1336	10203	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” chose to conclude the narrative with this paragraph because it signifies a new beginning for Saeng. After relocating and failing her examination, the winter hibiscus provides solace, connecting her to memories of her former home. It instills hope, despite its winter appearance being less vibrant than its spring manifestation. Spring inherently symbolizes renewal, as the dormant winter landscape is revitalized. Saeng perceives the test as a personal commencement. From personal experience, I undertake spring cleaning to initiate a fresh start. The season’s invigorating atmosphere also provides inspiration for improvement. This likely explains Saeng's resolve to retake the test in spring. Therefore, the author concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s aspiration for a new beginning.
1337	10204	4	1	Authors occasionally conclude a narrative with a paragraph depicting a future action. In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes by stating, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” A primary reason for this conclusion is to illustrate the transformation that spring facilitates. For instance, the girl’s admission, “I-I failed the test,” establishes a foundation for future improvement; by spring, she can progress and ultimately pass. Furthermore, the statement, “The ‘winter hibiscus’ was in the ground now, and she tamped down the soil around it,” indicates the plant’s current state, anticipating its future blossoming and color change in spring. In conclusion, authors employ such concluding paragraphs to foreshadow potential future developments and character growth.
1338	10205	4	1	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with this specific paragraph for several significant reasons. The “budding hibiscus” serves as a symbol of comfort for the protagonist. Having moved to a new location, she could not transport all her friends or possessions, but she retained her memories. The flower evokes recollections of her homeland, offering consolation following her failure on the driver's test. Additionally, the “geese returning” symbolize a new beginning. Their arrival heralds spring, a period for starting anew after a bleak winter. Finally, her resolution, “then I will take that test again,” demonstrates the importance of perseverance. Despite the challenges of adapting to a new country, she forged friendships and sampled unfamiliar foods. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey themes of comfort, renewal, and resilience.
1339	10206	4	1	The author included the final paragraph to sustain the reader's engagement with the narrative's conclusion. A further reason for its inclusion is to convey the idea that the plant embodies a spirit of perseverance and resilience, a message intended for the reader's interpretation. The author thereby communicates a theme of enduring hope through the symbolic hibiscus.
1340	10207	4	1	The author concludes with the protagonist's vow, “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to demonstrate how memories of her homeland provide encouragement. For example, the narrative indicates her gradual discovery of similarities between her new environment and her native land across the seasons. The springtime specifically reminded Saeng of her home, thereby supplying the motivation she requires to retake the examination. In conclusion, the author incorporated this quotation to reveal how the character is inspired by nostalgic connections to her homeland.
1341	10208	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the protagonist’s vow to retake the driving examination, symbolizing her progression. Saeng experienced a shock of recognition so profound it was almost visceral. Upon stumbling into a florist, the protagonist encounters a flower reminiscent of her native Vietnam. Assisting her mother with planting the procured seed, she initiates her maturation. After contemplating her past and achieving reconciliation, no impediments remained to hinder her advancement. Witnessing geese migrating southward in a v-formation, she establishes a personal objective, utilizing it as an instrument for growth and forward momentum in her new nation. The protagonist’s vow in ""Winter Hibiscus"" symbolizes her resolute advancement."
1342	10209	4	1	This episode demonstrates that during a period of uncertainty, she will ultimately prevail. Within the narrative, the plant represented hope, and through this representation, it instilled hope within her. Initially, the recollections she summoned evoked sorrow, yet they ultimately furnished her with a sense of hopeful expectation.
1343	10210	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with that particular statement to convey a specific message and engage the reader's consideration. Alternatively, the author may have concluded in that manner simply from a sense of narrative necessity, without a predetermined or particular rationale for the decision. The conclusion stands as a deliberate authorial choice.
1344	10211	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with the paragraph detailing Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in spring, symbolizing her capacity to overcome sorrow and attempt the examination anew. This is symbolized by her reference to the returning geese and the budding hibiscus. Following her initial failure, she had not contemplated retaking the test, instead yearning for her former home. However, akin to the geese that endure and adapt by migrating, she resolves to return and try again when conditions are favorable. The hibiscus budding symbolizes her fortitude and resolve; just as the plant survives winter to bloom in spring, she must persevere through difficulty to succeed subsequently. The author employs this conclusion to illustrate her resilience and determined intention to pass the examination."
1345	10212	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph to illustrate the narrator's resolve to retake the test at a more opportune time. It demonstrates her perseverance and refusal to relinquish her goal of passing. She comprehends the transience of existence and recognizes the necessity of appreciating its fleeting nature.
1346	10213	4	1	"The author concluded the final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" to convey that the protagonist, Saeng, remains resolute and has not relinquished her pursuit of passing the driving examination."
1347	10214	4	1	"In the concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author synthesizes numerous narrative elements, illustrating Saeng's determination to retake her driving examination and her receptiveness to a new commencement. The author employs these final sentiments to articulate Saeng's hopeful anticipation for an improved beginning and to underscore her resolve to succeed. Symbolic objects within the narrative are utilized to represent this determination and nascent start; for instance, the hibiscus evokes memories of her homeland, spring signifies the season of renewal she selects, and the returning geese embody her steadfast resolve to transform and improve."
1348	10215	4	1	The author, MinFong, concludes the narrative with this paragraph to evoke hope within the reader for the characters. A paramount lesson one can learn is to perpetually maintain hope, as circumstances will ameliorate through persistent effort. Although Saeng was disheartened by her failed driving test and profoundly missed her homeland, the story’s conclusion establishes the principle that perseverance is essential, a conviction hopefully embodied by the character's vow. This principle conveys the notion that individuals can surmount adversity regardless of their specific challenges. Ultimately, hope is instilled in the reader through the final paragraph, thereby reinforcing the story's overarching theme: the critical importance of resilience and hope during difficult periods.
1349	10216	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to enhance its literary quality and provide a more resonant finale. Omitting this concluding segment would have diminished the story's engagement and overall impact, rendering it less compelling. Furthermore, the author intends to offer the reader a comprehensive understanding of the story's resolution and its inception simultaneously. For example, a deficient conclusion would dissuade readership entirely, thus validating the author's decision to incorporate a stable and effective closing paragraph. This final passage was exceptionally suitable, as it harmonized perfectly with the narrative and substantially augmented its comprehensibility, culminating in an ideal denouement for the story.
1350	10217	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to elucidate the symbolic significance of the plant as an omen of favorable fortune. The snow will thaw, the geese will reappear, and the hibiscus will commence budding, representing a fresh start and a new beginning. Having failed her driving test, she will recommence her efforts in the spring. In summation, this interpretation explains the rationale behind the author's concluding paragraph.
1351	10218	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that Saeng will commence anew with the spring, just as the plant does. The story establishes this significance by illustrating Saeng's arduous winter and her struggles to adapt, yet with the spring's arrival, she can embark on a fresh start, paralleling the hibiscus's renewal.
1352	10219	4	1	The author incorporates this concluding paragraph for several significant reasons. Initially, the narrative commences with Saeng failing her driving examination and subsequently experiencing profound dejection. It subsequently transitions to the hibiscus, which evokes potent memories of her homeland and past felicity. This paragraph synthesizes these elements, as Saeng resolves not to reattempt the test until the hibiscus, the source of her confidence, begins to blossom, thereby connecting the story's commencement to its resolution.
1353	10220	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to signify that the character will feel sufficiently prepared to retake the examination upon the plant's return, marking a pivotal moment of personal readiness and renewal.
1354	10221	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the theme that adapting to life's changes is profoundly challenging. Having relocated to @LOCATION1, Saeng yearns for her homeland. The greenhouse flowers vividly remind her of her upbringing and her grandmother, provoking ""a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes."" Although she informs her mother of her failure, she internally vows to succeed by spring. This conclusion provides crucial insight into Saeng's character, revealing that despite her difficulty in relinquishing the past, she possesses the fortitude to prosper in a new environment."
1355	10222	4	1	The author concluded with this paragraph to illustrate that her engagement with nature remains ongoing; upon its cyclical return, she will resume her previous activities. This entails cultivating her plants, nurturing them, harvesting them for an evening meal, and persisting in this practice for as long as she is able.
1356	10223	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to illustrate her heightened sense of comfort associated with her former residence. The winter hibiscus pertains to her new environment, yet when the season passes and new hibiscus emerge, they become affiliated with her new home. The hibiscus from her native land provides her with a profound sense of solace. Consequently, upon re-experiencing that comfort, she will find the courage to undertake the examination. The author concluded the story thusly to demonstrate that Saeng continues to resist the change and harbors a desire to return to her original home.
1357	10224	4	1	"The author incorporates this paragraph to signify Saeng's commencement of a new life in a foreign nation, where she profoundly misses her homeland, and the hibiscus serves as a poignant reminder. Saeng failed an examination, analogous to flowers succumbing in winter only to flourish again in spring. When the hibiscus blossoms, Saeng will similarly ""bloom"" and endeavor to retake the test. Relocation presents a significant hardship, particularly to an entirely unfamiliar locale, prompting individuals to devise personal assurances and mementos of their former homes."
1358	10225	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this spring she committed an error, such as purchasing plants exceeding one dollar, which disappointed her mother. Consequently, she reasons that upon the return of spring, she will receive another opportunity to exert her utmost effort and achieve success. Furthermore, this will ensure she does not remain a source of disappointment to her mother.
1359	10226	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because she indicated that the flower facilitates her adjustment to moving and serves as a reminder of her hometown, signifying that upon the return of the geese and the blossoming of the flower, she will possess the confidence to pass the test. Although disheartened by her failure, the number of attempts is inconsequential, as perseverance will ultimately lead to success. She must attain a state of composure to retake the examination when spring arrives.
1360	10227	4	1	"I contend that the author concluded the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that specific paragraph to imply Saeng's persistent resolve. Revealing that Saeng was deeply saddened by her test failure yet intends to retake it infers a fundamentally determined character. It is my conviction that the concluding paragraph was included to communicate the sentiment that Saeng remained resolute in the face of adversity."
1361	10228	4	1	"In Mingfong Ho's narrative, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the examination in the spring, a season symbolizing renewal as the snow recedes and the hibiscus buds, for the plant embodies hope and adaptation. Saeng endeavors to acclimate to her new existence, yet her efforts prove futile. The narrator observes, ""She found that she was still too unsteady to articulate the words at home, fearing she would succumb to tears once more."" The hibiscus facilitates her adjustment by evoking memories of her native land, thereby instilling optimism. Its root-bound condition metaphorically reflects Saeng's own state within her new country—initially resistant and apprehensive. However, upon transplanting the hibiscus with her mother, Saeng comprehends that this act signifies her commitment to embracing her life in America, and she will commence her acceptance when both she and the flower are poised to flourish in the spring."
1362	10229	4	1	"Mingfong Ho concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's considerable personal growth and her resolute determination to persevere. The narrator states, ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance."" This moment captures Saeng's emotional recuperation; despite her profound longing for her homeland, she resolves to adapt and prosper in her present environment. The narrator further notes, ""she found that she was still too tremulous to utter the words at home, lest she be overwhelmed by tears again."" This profound separation from her native country renders Saeng intensely disconsolate and emotionally fragile, underscoring the challenges of her transition."
1363	10230	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that the plant represents a symbolic harbinger of fortune for the characters. Saeng perceives that the hibiscus provides a profound sense of solace and emotional consolation, serving as a tangible connection to a more familiar and comforting past, which alleviates her profound sense of displacement and anxiety in the unfamiliar environment.
1364	10231	4	1	"The author likely concluded the story with this paragraph to emphasize the thematic significance of cyclical renewal. The text references ""the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" implying that while seasons will perpetually transition, Saeng will remain steadfast, perpetually prepared to undertake her challenge again, symbolizing enduring resilience and the perpetual opportunity for a new beginning inherent in the natural world's rhythm."
1365	10232	4	1	The author's intent is likely to articulate that in the spring, a time of seasonal transformation marked by the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding, Saeng will be psychologically prepared to attempt the examination once more, symbolizing a personal rebirth aligned with the natural world's cycle and her own burgeoning resolve to succeed.
1366	10233	4	1	The author concludes that failing the examination is not a catastrophic outcome. She recognizes the transience of circumstances and the perpetual availability of future opportunities, a concept elucidated in the final paragraph which states that once the hibiscus buds emerge, she will retake the examination.
1367	10234	4	1	The author concludes the narrative by declaring that in the spring, as the snow recedes, the geese reappear, and the hibiscus initiates budding, she will undertake the examination once more, signifying her resolve not to capitulate abruptly.
1368	10235	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it conveys substantial meaning about her character within a single, concise statement. Her declaration to ""take that test again"" demonstrates a willingness to recommence the endeavor, indicating her profound dedication. Furthermore, her reference to ""spring; when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" serves as a mnemonic for the cyclical renewal she anticipates, which justifies the author's decision to conclude with this paragraph."
1369	10236	4	1	This narrative concerns self-belief and relentless perseverance; it is a chronicle of determination. Saeng possessed genuine conviction in her ability to pass the driver's examination, and although the outcome disappointed her, she discovered a method to manage her setback. The hibiscus flower holds profound significance for her, as it connects her to her homeland and represents an object of beauty, something she desperately required during a period of personal turmoil. Adapting to a new country within a brief timeframe is invariably challenging. I understand how a minor mishap can provoke a disproportionate reaction, making one feel utterly helpless and isolated, akin to the hibiscus flourishing beside the highway in the photograph. Saeng pledged to retake her driver’s test upon the hibiscus's spring bloom, a detail which suggests the flower symbolizes Saeng herself.
1370	10237	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several reasons. Saeng experienced disappointment after failing her driving examination, yet she subsequently discovered solace in nature upon purchasing a plant. Saeng evidently believes that the departure of the geese and the hibiscus's dormant state are inauspicious for attempting the test. She derives comfort from the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding, implying that nature provides her with consolation. The author selected this conclusion to illustrate that Saeng's disappointment has subsided, as she recognizes another opportunity will arise with the geese's return and the hibiscus's bloom. With nature's reassurance, she feels confident about passing the examination the following year.
1371	10238	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to provide the reader with a resonant point for contemplation upon finishing the story. For instance, it conveys that the individual will resume cultivating plants once the winter season concludes.
1372	10239	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's determination. Saeng struggles with adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life, exemplified when she returns home with the flower, feeling too emotionally fragile to speak lest she succumb to tears. She purchased the hibiscus because it provided a sense of security; it was a familiar element from her homeland. The paragraph is included to signify that the following year, she will possess that same sense of security and familiarity when retaking the test, as she intends to replicate the experience.
1373	10240	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s resilience and refusal to capitulate. Furthermore, the conclusion serves to communicate a universal message about perseverance and the necessity of persistent effort, even if one must temporarily pause to study or reconsider a strategy.
1374	10241	4	1	Upon returning home, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, she would take the test again. The author included this paragraph in the story to illustrate the girl’s resolution to improve her academic performance.
1375	10242	4	1	The author concludes the paragraph with this statement to signify a preference for retaking the test during a more aesthetically pleasing season. In conclusion, this rationale explains why the author selected this particular sentence to conclude the narrative.
1376	10243	4	1	At the conclusion of the short story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author Minfong Ho incorporates a notably inspirational final sentence: “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” This sentence was presumably appended to evoke a sense of future hope, which contrasts starkly with the narrative’s pervasive melancholy, thereby furnishing a felicitous denouement. Throughout the narrative, Saeng is despondent over her abrupt departure from her homeland, which resulted in the loss of her childhood and her cherished grandmother; “A blink, a chanced switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone,” as she recounts with profound depth. The pervasive sorrow is further amplified by Saeng’s frequent weeping, recollecting her tragic history both within the greenhouse—remembering her grandmother, “Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it”—and in the garden, conversing with her mother and planting the flower. Following this profound grief, the author’s inclusion of an optimistic resolution successfully imparts a sense of prospective hope.
1377	10244	4	1	She resolves to retake the examination in the spring because she recognizes that another failure would disappoint her mother, who might perceive insufficient effort or a permanent estrangement. Her mother attributes the repeated failures to Saeng's lingering attachment to her past experiences and her affection for her new country, alongside her capacity to surmount challenges. Ultimately, it appears she finds solace in memories of her homeland, which fortify her resolve to persevere and achieve success.
1378	10245	4	1	The author employs that concluding quotation principally to illustrate the protagonist's enduring hope. In literary narrative, hope constitutes one of a character's most admirable attributes, as it sustains reader engagement and imparts a resonant moral to the story. This strategic inclusion of an optimistic resolution is what renders the final quote so thematically potent and structurally essential.
1379	10246	4	1	The author constructed the final paragraph to provide a resonant conclusion for the story. It emphasizes the principle of perseverance and repeated endeavor. The declaration, “I will take the test again,” follows Saeng’s earlier admission, “I failed the test,” demonstrating her newfound resilience. This concluding segment is profoundly meaningful and necessary for the narrative’s completeness. Thus, akin to others who persevere in their respective endeavors, Saeng emulates this tenacity by deciding to retake the examination.
1380	10247	4	1	The author concludes with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to convey to readers her resolute determination to accomplish what she previously failed. Having failed the test initially, she now seeks to overcome that failure and ultimately succeed; the author thus portrays her with a definitive sense of resolve at the story's conclusion.
1381	10248	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to extend its length and provide a satisfactory resolution; however, the meaning remains ambiguous to me, so the author, not I, should elucidate its significance.
1382	10249	4	1	The plant held significance for Saeng because it originated from her homeland. She resolved to retake her driving examination when the plant bloomed. The plant served as a reminder of her origins and heritage. For Saeng, the plant represented a source of confidence. Having endured hardships, she felt a profound connection to the plant due to its native provenance.
1383	10250	4	1	"I contend the author concluded the narrative with that paragraph to evoke a sense of wonder. This interpretation is supported by the contextual ambiguity of the word ""test,"" which could denote multiple challenges. For instance, it might signify the ordeal of overcoming her situational sorrow, or alternatively, the trial of adapting to her new environment with the arrival of spring. Consequently, I maintain the author intended to cultivate a sense of wonder with the final paragraph."
1384	10251	4	1	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho concerns overcoming adversity. The author concludes by writing, ""when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test."" The protagonist, Saeng, encountered difficulties at school and, on her journey home, observed various flowers indigenous to her homeland. ""Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost visceral."" The sight of those flowers, particularly the hibiscus, evoked memories of her loss while providing solace. The winter hibiscus demonstrated resilience despite being displaced from its native soil. Her mother remarks, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty but it's strong enough. That's what matters."" Upon hearing this, Saeng determines that she, too, can exhibit strength and strive for academic improvement, resolving to adapt like the winter hibiscus."
1385	10252	4	1	She expressed that sentiment because her interest in flowers surpassed her concern for an examination.
1386	10253	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to signify the termination of one phase and the inception of another. Following her distress and reflection upon home, she comprehends that a novel development is occurring and she must embrace it. Consequently, in the spring, she will commence anew, analogous to a blossoming flower.
1387	10254	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey the character's aversion to hastiness; she intends to execute matters correctly rather than pursuing an expedient resolution.
1388	10255	4	1	It underscores the hibiscus's significance to Saeng and her profound dedication to the flower. It further indicates that she will await the subsequent spring to admire the blossom once more.
1389	10256	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to elucidate her rationale for undertaking the examination. She articulates that the following year will determine whether the environment evokes a sense of belonging for her.
1390	10257	4	1	The author’s concluding paragraph, wherein Saeng vows to retake the test upon the return of spring, the melting snow, the geese, and the budding hibiscus, demonstrates her capacity to overcome adversity, to seek solace amidst disappointment, and her connection to prior experiences. Firstly, it illustrates overcoming obstacles, which are ubiquitous and infinite, compelling one to conquer them. The hibiscus symbolizes these challenges, while the weather signifies time, as it impedes the flower's bloom. Secondly, it represents discovering comfort during disappointment, an inevitable consequence of confronting obstacles. However, she possesses the foresight that the hibiscus will return, acknowledging the perpetual nature of challenges. Finally, it affirms her connection to her past, as she is confined within an unfamiliar world, rendering her an alien. She encapsulates this sense of displacement; the hibiscus serves as her metaphor, being unique and distinct within her new environment, just as she must adapt her lifestyle and endure, reminiscent of her existence in her native country.
1391	10258	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it encapsulates Saeng's determination and her current circumstances. Having recently arrived in a foreign nation, she has not yet acclimated to her new environment. She experienced profound disappointment, akin to ""a shaft of the war afternoon starlight,"" where ""war"" signifies her intense distress. Upon encountering the flower, she reminisced about her native country, longing for her homeland. She subsequently perceived life as replete with hope once more. Although she recognized the necessity of adapting to her new situation, she remained too emotionally fragile to articulate her feelings at home, ultimately succumbing to tears again. The ""snow"" symbolized her present adversities, yet she maintained faith in her ability to surmount them, viewing life as hopeful. ""Spring"" represented the prospect of a renewed existence; Saeng anticipated improvement and success with the coming season. Her resolute determination to succeed is why the author employs this paragraph as the conclusion, symbolizing hope."
1392	10259	4	1	"The author incorporated this passage because she believed that, given Saeng's diligent efforts prior to failing the examination, she perhaps warranted a second opportunity. Saeng's statement, ""Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it,"" distressed her mother, who was perturbed by the significant expenditure on a single plant, purchased solely to evoke a sense of belonging reminiscent of their previous home. Ultimately, the mother consoles her daughter by remarking, ""It’s a beautiful plant,"" to ameliorate the situation, regretting her initial reaction. The inclusion of the final passage by the author is justified by the cumulative challenges Saeng has endured."
1393	10260	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that Saeng possesses an indefatigable spirit; she will persist in her attempts to pass the examination relentlessly, refusing to capitulate. This assertion is substantiated by the narrative's preceding events, to which the conclusion directly refers.
1394	10261	4	1	The author's purpose in this conclusion is to illustrate that annually, with the thawing of snow and the geese's return, Saeng will reassume the responsibility of nurturing the plant. This duty clearly parallels the significant obligation of retaking the test, thereby representing a formidable undertaking. This symbolic correlation constitutes the intended meaning of the concluding sentence.
1395	10262	4	1	Cultivating flowers and expending effort on the garden constitutes her principal avocation. Without this creative outlet, she finds herself unable to think with clarity or engage in invention. Consequently, awaiting the return of spring will elevate her spirits and, in turn, facilitate her capacity to perform her work effectively.
1396	10263	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several reasons. Primarily, it conveys her resolution to retake the examination only after circumstances have normalized. Secondly, the narrative would lack a suitable denouement if her conditions were not met. For instance, if one were constructing a residence and a blizzard occurred, work would cease, with a vow to resume only upon the return of favorable weather. In summation, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for multiple justifications.
1397	10264	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho, concluded the narrative in this manner to underscore the theme of renewal. The mother contributes to this theme by stating, ""Its flowers are not as pretty, but it is strong enough to survive the winter. That is what matters."" Her declaration serves as a metaphor for the family recommencing their lives in @LOCATION1; that @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 may not be as beautiful, but they will endure, which is paramount. Her words alleviate her daughter's anxieties about beginning anew. Furthermore, the budding hibiscus symbolizes rebirth, as it undergoes seasonal cycles of dying and regrowth. The family is effectively concluding its existence as a @CAPS1 family and becoming a @CAPS2 family. However, despite ""dying"" as a @CAPS1 family, they have not relinquished their heritage, which is why the author concludes by referencing a flower that embodies both @CAPS1 and @CAPS3 characteristics, much like Saeng."
1398	10265	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will persevere through the winter and endeavor to adapt to her new lifestyle. Relocating to a new country and culture is profoundly challenging, and Saeng is struggling, yet she refuses to abandon her efforts to establish a new existence in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,"" embodies determination and hope. Throughout the narrative, Saeng grappled with adaptation, and her memories of her homeland provided a sense of security. This sentence culminates her emotional journey and demonstrates her resilience; a @CAPS1 individual might easily forfeit the driving test, but she will not. It constitutes a hopeful conclusion for an otherwise somber tale. The sentence further underscores Saeng's connection to her plant. This hibiscus will survive, and so will Saeng; when it blooms in the spring, she will too. She will exert maximum effort to assimilate and appreciate her new life. The plant will assist her by serving as a memento of Vietnam and a companion throughout the winter. The author could not have selected a more fitting conclusion for this story. The conclusion provides a renewed hope to persevere and succeed. Consequently, the reader is left with a sense of satisfaction and a favorable impression of the narrative. This conclusion demonstrates how Saeng is adapting to changes and aspiring to enjoy her new life in @LOCATION1."
1399	10266	4	1	"The narrative concerned a girl returning home after failing her driving test and emotionally collapsing over her former ""home"" in Vietnam. After her breakdown, purchasing the plant, and learning to accept that she no longer resided in Vietnam and that she had failed her test, she realized she must simply learn to appreciate her new circumstances. She also recognized that her opportunity would arrive and she would eventually drive. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it represents the story's resolution, the moment where one comprehends the essential truths."
1400	10267	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes with a silent vow made by Saeng. She declares she will retake the test, alluding to the driver's examination. Observing the geese flying in a ""V"" formation and seeing the hibiscus evoked a sense of nostalgia for her homeland, which Saeng profoundly misses. The author intended to convey to the @CAPS1 that Saeng is beginning to feel settled once more. The hibiscus functions as a symbol for Saeng, signifying that everything will be @CAPS2, and that it is acceptable to miss Vietnam while also embracing a new life. Thus, Saeng, in the spring, will retake her driving test with a transformed perspective and will ultimately pass."
1401	10268	4	1	The author employed that paragraph to generate vivid imagery, intending for the reader to visualize the narrative. Furthermore, the paragraph serves to articulate the author's own emotional state.
1402	10269	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to indicate Saeng's intention to retake the examination and to foreshadow her reunion with the plant. This concluding segment provides future insight, which constitutes the author's rationale for its inclusion.
1403	10270	4	1	The author concludes with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring to establish a thematic parallel. The plant, reminding her of home, will bolster her confidence upon budding. Her action of closing her palm around a petal signifies her profound homesickness and prior lack of assurance. The hibiscus provides the essential confidence to feel settled and succeed. Feeling displaced, Saeng draws motivation from the flower, a connection to her former home. Its familiar scent underscores its sentimental significance, illustrating why the author used this paragraph to highlight the comparison and the flower's role in her adaptation.
1404	10271	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus,” Minfong Ho concludes the story in this manner to signify hope. Saeng will recommence her efforts when the world renews itself. Spring represents a period of resurgence, when animals emerge, trees blossom, and snow melts. Saeng’s silent vow to try again coincides with this season. She acquires the hibiscus as a memento of her homeland and a gauge for renewal, as its budding and blooming signal the appropriate time to endeavor once more. Ho’s conclusion embodies the hope for a new beginning, with Saeng’s resolve to retake “that test” reflecting her transformed attitude and determination.
1405	10272	4	1	The paragraph demonstrates her profound sense of absence without them, evident in her reference to their return. Her mention of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding conveys her current desolation and anticipated solace upon their return, illustrating her commitment to resume where they previously concluded, as indicated by her declaration to retake the examination.
1406	10273	4	1	The narrative by Minfong Ho is sufficiently commendable. Throughout the story, one experiences a blend of contentment and melancholy, yet the prevailing sentiment remains tranquil. A sense of contentment arises during descriptions of the various plants and when her mother ultimately accepts the purchased flora. Initially, one anticipates the mother reprimanding her for the purchase following her examination failure. One feels sympathy for her, yet the calm atmosphere persists, illustrating the girl's reluctance to surrender, instead opting for a period of reflection.
1407	10274	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the paragraph stating her intention to retake the examination, thereby demonstrating her resolve to succeed and avoid a recurrence of her previous disappointment. This is conveyed through the imagery of ""spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" as this signifies the period during which she will undertake the test again, symbolizing renewal and determination."
1408	10275	4	1	"Saeng vowed silently to herself and to her mother. She resolved to confess her failure on the examination, anticipating her mother's initial displeasure before a subsequent conversation ensued. Her mother inquired about the plant she possessed, and Saeng revealed she had purchased it with her own funds. Her despondency over failing the test was somewhat alleviated by acquiring the plant. The author likely concludes with this paragraph to instill a sense of hope, suggesting she will ultimately pass. Her declaration, ""then I will take that test again,"" signifies her decision to retake it, a resolve potentially inspired by the plant."
1409	10276	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination to eventually pass her driver's license examination. This demonstrates her resolve following the winter season. For instance, Saeng initially failed her test and was disheartened. Subsequently, upon discovering the flower, she realizes she will attempt it again. This indicates the flower provided solace and reinforced her perseverance. The initial example reveals her sadness over the failure, while the concluding statement assures the reader of her future success.
1410	10277	4	1	"In the story *Winter Hibiscus* by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with Saeng's declaration: ""when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion provides a positive resolution to a narrative otherwise tinged with sadness, as Saeng longs for her former home in Vietnam. She states, ""It's — it's not a real one. I mean, it's not like the kind we had at — at —"" finding herself too emotional to utter the words ""at home."" The ending conveys that despite circumstances being different, she will persist in forging a satisfactory life in the United States without succumbing to despair."
1411	10278	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that Saeng will reclaim her self-assurance once the ""hibiscus is budding"" and undertake the driving examination anew. He avoids leaving the audience with a desolate image of the girl observing the geese recede into the distance. Her profound disappointment following the test failure evokes reader empathy, so the author employs this optimistic conclusion to elevate the reader's spirits. Saeng associates the return of confidence with the natural cycle, as evoked by the geese returning and the hibiscus budding, thereby concluding the story with her renewed determination and the reader's resultant satisfaction."
1412	10279	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative in this manner to underscore the protagonist's resolve to succeed in her new environment. She experiences profound nostalgia for her homeland and its familiar elements: the gardens and her grandparents, for instance. Upon entering the florist, the floral scents instantly transport her to memories of home. A specific blossom's fragrance vividly recalled her grandmother's ""long gray hair, freshly washed..."" This sensory recollection culminates in her resolution to retake the previously failed test when the hibiscus blooms the following winter."
1413	10280	4	1	"The author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the examination in spring, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" to emphasize her resilience and refusal to capitulate. Her distress is compounded by the artificiality of the flower compared to her mother's authentic blooms, causing her to tremble with the fear of maternal disapproval. Her mother's quiet acknowledgment and observation of similar flowers blooming locally mitigates the tension. Ultimately, the author illustrates the protagonist's commitment to persevere and attempt the challenge again."
1414	10281	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to communicate Saeng's perseverance. Having relocated from Vietnam, Saeng has struggled to adapt to numerous changes. She longs for her native land and the botanical life she knew there. Noting the winter hibiscus differs from its Vietnamese counterpart, she cultivates this local variety and resolves to retake her driving test in spring. This signifies her intention to metaphorically plant her current difficulties and revisit them in spring's more congenial atmosphere. She is not surrendering but rather postponing confrontation with these challenges, which justifies the author's concluding choice."
1415	10282	4	1	I believe the phrase is employed to express her aspiration to obtain another plant next year, thereby experiencing the profound satisfaction of cherishing something deeply and nurturing it over time. This interpretation explains why the narrator selected that particular phrase for the story's conclusion.
1416	10283	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this specific paragraph to illustrate Saeng's adaptation to her ongoing transition. The winter hibiscus assisted her in coping with her initial driving test failure; consequently, Saeng deduces it will provide fortuity upon her subsequent attempt. Furthermore, the hibiscus will endure, and as she pursues her objective, it will progressively develop. Once the flower blossoms, it will epitomize resilience, thereby assisting Saeng in overcoming this impediment. Her mother remarked the flower was less aesthetically pleasing yet would survive, signifying that the new environment may not equal Vietnam's splendor, but Saeng will persevere with strength.
1417	10284	4	1	The author's rationale for the conclusion is to demonstrate how the hibiscus provides Saeng with a profound sense of solace, contrasting sharply with her disposition at the story's commencement. Initially, she possessed minimal confidence and was compelled to regard this unfamiliar locale as home, which depleted her motivation to strive until she encountered a distinctly familiar visage that revived memories of her happiest epoch. Possessing a constant reminder of something personally significant can foster a sense of belonging or a semblance of her former life; she discovered her comfort within the hibiscus. Therefore, with it now residing in her garden, perpetually growing through every season, she too will persist, fortified by this memento of her native home and its associated felicity, albeit now complemented by new memories.
1418	10285	4	1	The individual proceeded to the summit and subsequently descended the opposing incline.
1419	10286	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several distinct reasons. Principally, the author aims to demonstrate that the budding of the hibiscus plant possesses profound symbolic significance. Ho states, “Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.” This conveys meaning because it represents a juncture where Saeng must surmount adverse circumstances, with the plant's deceased state symbolizing her current struggles. Later, Saeng comprehends the deeper meaning of the seasonal cycle; Ho notes, “Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She realizes that come spring, when the plant rejuvenates and buds, she will similarly attain success and a form of personal renewal.
1420	10287	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to elucidate Saeng's internal state for the audience. This final passage indicates that Saeng will persistently endeavor each spring to cultivate her flowers anew, thereby demonstrating her considerable potential to fulfill her vow and achieve success.
1421	10288	4	1	This narrative fundamentally concerns the transcendence of adversity and disillusionment, as well as the acceptance and adaptation to life's vicissitudes; thus, it is fitting that the account concludes with a definitive objective and a resolute disposition. Throughout the entire reading, Saeng sought solace in the most familiar elements, such as flowers and the taste of bitter melon. She was wounded and disheartened, and these entities alone provided her with tranquility. It was precisely these comforts that furnished her with the requisite fortitude to retake her driver’s test in the spring, rendering the mention of the hibiscus a particularly apt conclusion. The final paragraph further illustrates Saeng’s successful adaptation to her new nation. She states, “when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...” Initially, the sounds of geese were foreign to her, yet she has now accepted their honking as a customary noise, signifying her acclimatization and providing a perfect denouement for the story.
1422	10289	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner because during the winter she will be unable to see the hibiscus. She is accustomed to venturing into the garden and observing her beautiful plant. In summation, the author selected this conclusion precisely because in the winter she will not see her plant, thereby emphasizing its seasonal absence and symbolic significance.
1423	10290	4	1	Within the narrative, Saeng is endeavoring to reconcile herself with her new environment. The author likely incorporated this element to demonstrate her persistent resolve, indicating that she has not surrendered. She intends to continue striving to acclimatize to her new homeland. Although Saeng desires to adjust, she is simultaneously burdened by profound nostalgia for her native country, which explains her decision to wait until spring to attempt once more.
1424	10291	4	1	"The author concludes the story with that specific line to provoke reader speculation. The pronoun ""she"" signifies her determination to honor her history and overcome its challenges. This paragraph invites the reader to contemplate whether she succeeded the subsequent year. The description of the thawing snow and returning geese symbolizes transformation, which is precisely what she aspires to accomplish. The author aimed to illustrate her capacity for change and growth, analogous to her plant."
1425	10292	4	1	The author concludes with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is written because the budding of her flower signifies the moment she will be prepared to take the test, as she herself is akin to a flower. The author employs this conclusion because the budding flower and returning geese will evoke a sense of being home again. This rationale explains the author's chosen conclusion.
1426	10293	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the adolescent Saeng fails her driving examination and subsequently encounters a winter hibiscus, which evokes profound memories. The narrative concludes with her resolve to retake the test upon the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding, symbolizing solace and familiarity. The protagonist's realization that ""almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become"" illustrates her reconnection with nature's essence, which will ultimately enable her success. The author cultivates an impatient tone, as this discovery occurs in winter—a belated season when geese have departed and blossoms have closed; thus, spring heralds new prospects, and she will embrace them alongside her renewed familiarity."
1427	10294	4	1	The author concludes with this assertion because, although uncertain of passing, the protagonist remains resolute and intends to retake the examination upon the flower's resurgence. Presently disheartened, the plant provided consolation, so its reappearance next year will motivate her to attempt the test again, serving as an auspicious emblem. This paragraph ultimately conveys the imperative to persevere through adversity and persist in one's endeavors despite challenges.
1428	10295	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for several purposes. One objective is to allow the reader to envision the story's potential continuation, exemplified by the declaration, ""then I will take that test again."" Another rationale is to leave the audience with a final, positive impression that alters their perception of the events, as seen in the imagery of ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" These constitute the principal reasons for the author's concluding choice."
1429	10296	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to synchronize the protagonist's retaking of the test with the melting snow, the budding plant, and the geese's return. This timing provides a definitive framework for her to contemplate precisely when she will resume this endeavor. As these natural elements reemerge, so too shall she return to undertake the examination once more, completing the narrative's cyclical structure.
1430	10297	4	1	In the narrative, Saeng vowed silently to herself that she would retake the test when the snow melted, the geese returned, and the hibiscus began budding. For some reason, I believe that this constitutes a profoundly fitting resolution for Saeng's character arc and personal commitment.
1431	10298	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" likely concluded the narrative in this manner to impart a sense of hope. Furthermore, it illustrates Saeng's adaptation to her environment, paralleling the winter hibiscus. In the penultimate paragraph, Saeng hears the honks of geese, and their sound is noted as having grown familiar over time. Saeng probably resolved to retake the test upon the geese's return because the interim would permit further growth and adaptation. The hibiscus would then be budding, a signal that it surmounted its challenges and succeeded in adapting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could as well, drawing inspiration from the plant. This sentiment of hope for Saeng and her future is established in the final paragraph, justifying the story's conclusion."
1432	10299	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because seasons change, and plants typically do not flourish during winter. One learns a lesson, accepts the circumstances, and awaits the next opportunity to learn a fundamentally similar lesson when the appropriate time arrives.
1433	10300	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author included the final paragraph because the central theme involves perseverance, which is why the conclusion states, ""I will take the test again."" This illustrates that one should not remain defeated but rather work diligently to recover and attempt once more."
1434	10301	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey its overarching significance. Additionally, the author likely intends this paragraph to serve as the story's moral, providing insights or elucidating certain events that were previously ambiguous.
1435	10302	4	1	The story possesses a melancholic tone, as the girl grieves for her homeland and is disheartened by her failed driving test. The author concludes with her resolution to retake the test, demonstrating that despite her sorrows, she will not capitulate. Failing a test, particularly a driving test, is profoundly disappointing, generating initial excitement that is subsequently unmet. Thus, the author illustrates that the girl will persist despite her sadness, continuing her efforts until she ultimately succeeds. Furthermore, the author likely aimed to conclude on a more optimistic note, as stories are seldom left entirely desolate without resolution. Her declaration to retry the test serves this purpose, representing one of the more evident reasons for the story's conclusion.
1436	10303	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding phrase illustrates Saeng's definitive objectives. Primarily, she intends to acclimate to this unfamiliar territory. This is evident from her allusion to their return in the spring, signifying her refusal to capitulate and her commitment to adapting. Furthermore, it reveals her resolve; she will persist in attempting to acquire her license, declaring, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This statement confirms her determination to reattempt the examination. Moreover, it conveys that she will summon the fortitude to persevere and not surrender."
1437	10304	4	1	Saeng anticipated the spring season, at which time she intended to retake the examination. It is plausible she contemplated this prospect during spring, as she observed the geese flying in a V formation and monitored the plant's development, though the snow had not yet melted. She engaged in internal reflection regarding the matter, yet she aspired to undertake the test in the spring. She was apprehensive about passing it again, as she disdained the prospect of repeated attempts. This occurs when individuals proceed to different endeavors after the test concludes.
1438	10305	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the protagonist Saeng, who relocated with her family from Vietnam, has just returned home after failing her driver's test. For Saeng, this failure signifies an inability to adapt to her family's new lifestyle. Consequently, she believes she has disappointed both her mother and herself. While returning home, she purchased a flavor reminiscent of their life in Vietnam to console her mother. As her mother plants the flower, a winter hibiscus, Saeng perceives this as an act of forgiveness for her failure. She then comprehends that she has acclimated to her environment, much like she trusts the flower will, which inspires her pledge to retake the driver's test in spring. By concluding with Saeng's promise, the author ensures the reader's final impression is of her resilience; she vowed to endeavor again and adapt to her surroundings, distinct from others' adaptations. Her promise exemplifies courage and perseverance."
1439	10306	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to emphasize her refusal to capitulate; she will retake the examination, and the plant will flourish again in the spring.
1440	10307	4	1	The author concludes with that paragraph because Saeng articulates her process of learning to adapt to this nation. Earlier, she laments failing the test and consequently disappointing her mother. Both Saeng and her mother, accustomed to life in Vietnam, are endeavoring to adjust. Saeng perceived the hibiscus she obtained as identical to the one from her homeland. Ultimately, she realizes that with faith, everything will be satisfactory and reminiscent of home. She references spring because by then her hibiscus will have fully matured, and she will retake the test, observing if the hibiscus matches her mother's expectations. Saeng is thereby learning to assimilate into her new country, the United States.
1441	10308	4	1	"The author concludes with that paragraph because it articulates and perpetuates the theme of perseverance and adaptation to change. The conclusion reiterates the concept of the ""test."" From the narrative, one can deduce that this test signifies Saeng's confrontation with memories of her homeland without succumbing to the anguish of loss. Saeng previously stated that she ""failed the test,"" having been overwhelmed with sorrow upon encountering familiar plants reminiscent of her past home. By concluding with this paragraph, which declares her intent to retake the test, it demonstrates Saeng's resolve to persist in adapting to her new environment and achieving tranquility there, rather than being consumed by profound grief for her former life. It underscores the theme of perseverance through her commitment to reattempt the test and conquer her sorrow."
1442	10309	4	1	"The girl is determined to succeed. She undertook a floral examination which she did not pass, returning home disheartened and emotionally distressed. She informed her grandmother that the flowers were dissimilar to those from—she could not utter ""home"" due to the overwhelming anguish it provoked—and her grandmother affirmed they were not equivalent to the authentic specimens."
1443	10310	4	1	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow: ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Initially, she lacked confidence and consequently failed the test. However, this single flower instilled hope, suggesting that upon her next attempt she will be better equipped to succeed."
1444	10311	4	1	"The author likely concluded the essay in this manner to effectively unify the various thematic strands. For instance, one character declares, ""she silently vowed to herself that in the spring, after the snow melts, she would retake that test,"" thereby providing a cohesive resolution."
1445	10312	4	1	The author likely concluded the story with that sentence to symbolize the cyclical nature of seasons, wherein most plants perish during winter, only to commence regrowth anew with the arrival of spring.
1446	10313	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to demonstrate that Saeng will commit herself to cultivating hibiscus, and upon proving her dedication, she will have surmounted the challenge. This also signifies her desire to integrate her heritage profoundly into her life by nurturing her nation's floral emblem.
1447	10314	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this particular statement to illustrate Saeng's profound determination to pass her driving examination. For instance, in the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" after failing her test, Saeng dismisses the notion of fate, insisting, ""Let's plant, right now."" She articulates this to divert her attention from the failure and concentrate on a constructive activity, thereby concluding the author's rationale for the final quote and exemplifying Saeng's resolute focus."
1448	10315	4	1	The author concluded the narrative in this manner to convey a sense of hope. Saeng had experienced hurt and disappointment, yet the conclusion demonstrated her resilience. Having failed her driving test, she was profoundly disappointed. Ultimately, the ending revealed her refusal to capitulate in her new country; she resolved to persevere and optimize her circumstances.
1449	10316	4	1	I believe the author concludes with this paragraph to underscore her determination to ultimately complete and pass the examination. The primary reason is that, having failed this year, she aspires to succeed in the subsequent attempt. Furthermore, she draws a parallel between the hibiscus and her own potential for passing and prevailing on the test, which justifies the author's concluding paragraph.
1450	10317	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify Saeng's resolve to preserve her next plant. The rationale for her decision to retake the test stems from having sold the previous plant. Saeng had encountered the plant during her childhood, which explains her profound attachment to it. In summation, the author employs this concluding paragraph to affirm Saeng's intention to safeguard her subsequent plant.
1451	10318	4	1	The author concludes the final paragraph to illustrate that after a certain duration, one can return and attempt something anew. Perhaps when the seasons change, the circumstances will differ for Saeng. She may be drawing a parallel between herself and the plant, suggesting that with the arrival of spring, the flower will gain strength, and she feels she will pass the examination on her second attempt when the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud. This also demonstrates her appreciation for nature, for why else would she await the spring and the melting snow? The story's conclusion affirms her affinity for nature, as evidenced by her discourse concerning the hibiscus.
1452	10319	4	1	"In Minfong Ho's story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a girl named Saeng attempts to adapt to life in a new location after emigrating from Vietnam. She experiences sorrow and nostalgia for her homeland, particularly following her failure of a driver's examination. While walking, she passes a store and identifies a plant native to her home country. She purchases the hibiscus and transports it home in a pot. She reflects upon her home and the cherished memories associated with the plant. Her mother subsequently joins her, and they share the moment together, which elevates Saeng's spirits. The author's concluding sentence, wherein Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, signifies that the flower has instilled in her the confidence to succeed. This illustrates her profound connection to her homeland and its flora, demonstrating her desire to overcome melancholy and progress forward without abandoning her memories, but rather her pain."
1453	10320	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author selected this particular conclusion to highlight the solace the hibiscus offered, enabling Saeng to progress. The greenhouse afforded a space for her to express her sentiments of homesickness, as indicated by the line stating she broke down and wept within its warm, moist shelter. Returning home confronted her once more with the reality of her test failure. This failure likely evoked feelings of inadequacy in adjusting to her new environment. However, the author concludes the narrative with the geese' flight to symbolize Saeng's personal growth from this experience. Her silent vow to retake the test in the spring, as the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, suggests the author's intent to show that through these events, Saeng ultimately surmounted her emotional struggles regarding her new home."
1454	10321	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with this statement because it signifies a new beginning for the protagonist with the arrival of spring. She articulates that she will retake the examination once the hibiscus begins to bud, the snow dissipates, and the season turns. This parallels the hibiscus's resurgence, symbolizing a second chance, which she also merits. When the environment becomes brighter and prospects appear more favorable, she will feel sufficiently confident to attempt the test again. The ending is effective, though it requires a deeper interpretation to grasp her underlying meaning. Essentially, she asserts that once everything is revitalized, she will feel prepared and capable of passing on her subsequent attempt.
1455	10322	4	1	There are several reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. One reason is her evident fondness for the hibiscus flower, discernible when she reaches out to gently touch a petal upon encountering it. Another reason is their aesthetic appeal, suggested by her description of the environment as resembling another world. A final reason is her appreciation for their presence, indicated by her detailed observation of the huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns, and fronds of various shades and shapes growing in seemingly random profusion. These points substantiate the rationale for the author's concluding paragraph.
1456	10323	4	1	"The author of this narrative was astute to conclude by stating she will retake the examination in the spring, when everything blooms. This young woman, having just failed her driving test, lacks the immediate desire to repeat it. The blossoming of the hibiscus symbolizes both her former existence at her previous home and also represents a new commencement upon its flowering. This will provide her with the confidence to pass her driving test and generate excitement for a fresh start to the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return"". This quotation from the paragraph indicates that the snow will dissipate and the geese will come back, just as she yearns to return home and experience comfort, for one is most comfortable at home. The author concluded this girl Saeng's story with hope and determination to pursue her aspirations. This rationale demonstrates why it was intelligent to end the narrative in this manner."
1457	10324	4	1	The hibiscus, as the author has revealed, is a beautiful flower that within the narrative embodies the memories of a young girl who failed her test, knowing she was too despondent from her failure. The flower functions as a symbol of encouragement for the disheartened girl during her most distressing event, illustrating how a simple blossom provides solace. The girl, Saeng, vowed to demonstrate that upon overcoming her sorrowful memories, she will possess the capability to prove she can pass, after she reconciles with the circumstances she is experiencing within her disrupted life after relocating to a foreign country, which demands a significant capacity for adaptation; logically, her adjustment will not be instantaneous. Essentially, the author's message aims to motivate individuals confronting difficulties, conveying that life necessitates perseverance rather than surrender. Instead, one should persist diligently until achieving success. In conclusion, diligent effort and a refusal to capitulate constitute fundamental aspects of life, and overcoming failure ultimately depends upon ourselves.
1458	10325	4	1	"In the story, the author concludes with the sentence, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I believe he concludes in this manner because she has accepted her failure or loss yet remains willing to attempt once more to accomplish her objective and ""take that test again"". Furthermore, she is establishing a promise, or a vow, to herself to not relinquish her ambition."
1459	10326	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the two elements correspond; both concern departure and return, and the changing of seasons. It reflects an initial reluctance to release the past, coupled with the knowledge that it will eventually be restored. This reasoning explains why the author integrated the story's conclusion with this specific paragraph.
1460	10327	4	1	"The author expresses hope for the future in her concluding paragraph. Although having just failed her driver's test and adjusting to a new environment, Saeng finds solace in a hibiscus. ""It felt smooth and cool with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel."" This indicates that the remembrance of ""an old friend"" could elevate her mood following a prior disappointment. It was evident Saeng felt uncomfortable in her surroundings, which her mother perceived upon her arrival home. ""She paused as she noticed the tear stains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes."" Her daughter was not acclimating to her new atmosphere, and despite having expended considerable money on a single flower, her mother understood. Amidst the pervasive negative attitude throughout the story, once Saeng observed the geese and planted her ""winter"" hibiscus, she recognized that what was formerly strange had become familiar. Saeng ultimately realizes that with a memory of home, her goals are attainable and life can achieve stability elsewhere. She illustrates that from failure emerges success."
1461	10328	4	1	The author concluded the narrative in the paragraph, indicating that Saeng desires the entire room for herself to ensure a quiet environment while taking the examination.
1462	10329	4	1	She asserts that the present moment is inopportune to undertake the test, declaring her intention to postpone the endeavor until spring, when the flowers are in bloom. She exhibits a particular eccentricity regarding the exotic blossoms, finding the current circumstances intolerable and thus resolving to wait for a more suitable occasion.
1463	10330	4	1	Saeng intends to undertake the examination in the spring, when the climate is more temperate. She appreciates the period when the hibiscus buds, as their fragrance is particularly pleasing. This aroma vividly evokes memories of her native country. Saeng favors fried melon, which imparts a golden aftertaste, a flavor she would prefer over a Big Mac.
1464	10331	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for a multitude of reasons, thereby providing a comprehensive resolution to the story's thematic elements.
1465	10332	4	1	"The author incorporated that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus represents Saeng's ""comfort in her time of discomfort."" She likely feels more at ease when the hibiscus is budding, as she misses her homeland and the flower serves as a poignant reminder. She failed the initial test due to her unfamiliarity with the new environment, but with spring's arrival, she will feel more confident and comfortable amidst the budding hibiscus."
1466	10333	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because Saeng previously articulated her failure on the examination, which she aspired to retake. Consequently, Saeng resolved that the following year, upon the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding, she would undertake the test once more.
1467	10334	4	1	"The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve to await the plants' regeneration and to reattempt her examination. The hibiscus holds profound significance for her, and she will persist in her efforts to avoid disappointing her mother again. An instance of Saeng's shame is evident when ""her mother stared at her incredulously,"" questioning her failure. Saeng desires to avoid failing herself or her mother, vowing silently to pass the test and to honor both nature and her elders."
1468	10335	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative with the paragraph: “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the story in this manner because it functions as a narrative cliffhanger. Within the story, Saeng is distressed over failing her driving test; having recently relocated from Vietnam to the United States, she experiences homesickness. Encountering a familiar plant, she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it elevates her spirits by evoking memories of Vietnam. By concluding thusly, the reader understands Saeng has not surrendered and intends to retake her driver's examination, yet the final outcome remains uncertain, thereby creating a cliffhanger. This rationale explains the author's chosen conclusion.
1469	10336	4	1	Saeng has endured a tragic familial loss and a relocation to an entirely different world. The paragraph symbolizes turning over a new leaf and embarking anew. The “snows melting” and “hibiscus budding” both signify new life. Saeng will adopt a renewed outlook on life, accepting her circumstances to optimize her situation. Furthermore, the author’s statement that “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now” parallels Saeng’s newly planted perspective on life. Akin to the flower, a seed of hope was planted within Saeng, and she is now prepared to blossom fully.
1470	10337	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author exhibits profound sentimentality toward the hibiscus plant, as it strongly reminds her of her homeland. The rationale for concluding the narrative with that particular statement is that it provided her with a definitive objective. Having previously failed to secure employment, she perceives the hibiscus as an auspicious symbol, thus establishing a goal for when to reattempt her job search. Upon seeing the plant, she recalled felicitous memories. In conclusion, certain objects can trigger recollections, but it is the positive memories that render life's prospects worthy of anticipation and hope.
1471	10338	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative in this manner for several reasons. Primarily, it illustrates her burgeoning appreciation for this new existence. Furthermore, it provides an open-ended resolution. Her growing fondness for this life is demonstrated through several factors. The realization that ""many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now"" signifies her dawning acceptance that her new life in @LOCATION1 is not so disagreeable. This sentiment, initially concerning the geese, is later echoed in her vow to retake the examination. It also reveals the immediate significance the newly planted hibiscus has attained for her. Secondly, the conclusion alludes to potential future outcomes. While the reader remains uncertain of her success upon retaking the test, her resolute vow strongly implies an affirmative result. This deliberate ambiguity allows the author to convey her emotional state while permitting readers to infer their own conclusions."
1472	10339	4	1	The author structures the conclusion around her failure on the driving test, thereby introducing her intention to retake it. The plant may subsequently function as a token of good fortune, with the narrative suggesting a fresh commencement following the snow's thaw and the geese's return. This new beginning would be particularly fitting after her discovery of the plant, symbolizing hope and renewal.
1473	10340	4	1	The author concludes with this particular paragraph to underscore her determination to attempt the endeavor once more. It conveys that the hibiscus planted previously on @DATE1 did not flourish, prompting a renewed effort to cultivate one this @DATE1. Her ultimate success on the test is implicitly linked to her botanical success in the spring, which is the fundamental reason for the paragraph's concluding position.
1474	10341	4	1	He resolves to retake the examination in the spring, thereby affording her another opportunity to succeed. This subsequent chance will enable her to achieve what is correct and fulfill the necessary requirements.
1475	10342	4	1	She intends to retake the test @CAPS1 because she feels compelled to do so, and her statement @CAPS2 that she will do it when the snow melts and the geese return indicates her plan to attempt it during the spring season.
1476	10343	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding sentence is, ""When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I believe the recollection of her homeland will assist her in retaking the examination. She employs the geese and the plant as mnemonic devices for her home, and these familiar elements within her environment provide her with a sense of comfort and assurance."
1477	10344	4	1	"Analogous to the hibiscus flower's endurance throughout the winter, Saeng aspires to demonstrate similar resilience. Her failure on an examination induces a feeling of inadequacy. Saeng desires to persevere and overcome the adversity she is currently confronting, yet the challenging circumstances render this exceedingly difficult. Her statement, ""I – I failed the test,"" conveys profound disappointment, an outcome she did not anticipate given her tenacious character. Consequently, the author concludes the passage with Saeng's declaration, ""When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to underscore her resolute determination to thrive under arduous conditions."
1478	10345	4	1	The author positions this paragraph at the conclusion to illustrate that Saeng is acquiring a renewed perspective on her life. She now possesses a symbolic anchor to sustain her throughout the impending year; she will await the return of winter to witness the hibiscus bloom once more, anticipating its cyclical reappearance and the many subsequent blossoms that will follow in the future.
1479	10346	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I posit she concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate that despite Saeng's failure on the test, she intends to attempt it again in the future, a timeframe symbolized by the geese's return. Saeng experiences sorrow due to her longing for her homeland, and encountering flora that evokes memories prompts her to purchase a winter hibiscus to alleviate her distress and provide solace through its connection to her home."
1480	10347	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph due to the protagonist's profound affection for her garden. This conclusion is fitting as the narrative centers upon the characters and their garden, which eventually succumbs to the cold, leaving them in a state of dormancy until spring. It implies they possess deep sentiments for their horticultural pursuits, as indicated by the line, ""in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus [is] budding,"" wherein she resolves to take the test to surmount her challenges and demonstrate her capability to nurture her garden."
1481	10348	4	1	At that moment, she resolved to retake the examination, recognizing that while flowers perpetually bloom and fade, her academic record remains a singular, enduring testament to her scholarly efforts. Consequently, she preferred gardening over attending to her schoolwork.
1482	10349	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus provided her with a sense of hope. Furthermore, her mother demonstrated understanding regarding her failure on the examination. This rationale explains the author's decision to conclude the story with the paragraph.
1483	10350	4	1	The author concludes the story with optimism and hope for the future. She finishes her narrative with Saeng’s silent vow to retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This conclusion demonstrates the hope the hibiscus instilled in her after failing her driver’s test, bringing Saeng closer to adapting to her new home. The story states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, had become almost familiar to her now.” In this manner, the author’s ending provides inspiration for a new beginning and a new season.
1484	10351	4	1	In the story by Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng attempts to adjust to a new country, yet finds it nearly impossible. She is distressed about failing the driver’s test and realizes that nothing is the same, with the exception of one item she immediately recognized: a plant called the “Winter Hibiscus.” It evoked memories of her former life in Vietnam, assisting her in persevering through difficult times so she would not relinquish her endeavors. This is precisely why Minfong Ho concludes the final paragraph by stating that Saeng will retry the driving test when the hibiscus is budding. The flower evokes thoughts of her home in Vietnam, motivating her to persist. Additionally, the author ends the story in this manner to articulate a theme, which is that no matter how arduous a situation may be, one can endure it by discovering a method that proves most beneficial.
1485	10352	4	1	The author returns to that paragraph because in the narrative, Saeng deeply regrets not passing the test. Now Saeng is determined to compensate for her failure, having vowed to herself that she will pass that examination. For instance, when one commits to accomplishing a task, one must undertake whatever is necessary to achieve it and not surrender when circumstances become challenging. Ultimately, this final sentence encapsulates the story's central idea: to retake that test and pass it, thereby completing what is required.
1486	10353	4	1	The author incorporates this narrative within the paragraph because it continues the thematic exploration of Saeng’s character, illustrating her mind as a previously confined butterfly now emancipated, which parallels the emotional aperture emerging between Saeng and her mother, a dynamic with which fellow adolescents can readily identify.
1487	10354	4	1	In Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the concluding paragraph functions to demonstrate Saeng’s persistent resolve. Her declaration, “When they come back…then I will take that test again,” referencing the hibiscus and geese—symbols of her homeland—implies that these familiar comforts will fortify her spirit. This indicates that despite her initial failure, she possesses the determination to persevere and attempt the examination once more, which constitutes the paragraph’s fundamental purpose.
1488	10355	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to convey to the reader that following the snow’s departure, the protagonist intends to commence cultivating additional flora. The subsequent test serves to ensure the survival of his plants during the approaching winter season, thereby securing their longevity.
1489	10356	4	1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author conveys that Saeng experiences profound contentment and tranquility in the presence of the plant, as it evokes poignant childhood recollections. For instance, “And that rich, sweet scent, that was familiar too,” signifies her affection for the sensations it elicits. Inhaling the fragrance from a fallen leaf reminded her of her grandmother, an experience Ho may have personally encountered. The author likely composed this narrative to resonate with individuals who have relocated and possess an object that triggers nostalgic memories, much like a specific scent or texture can instantly recall a beloved relative.
1490	10357	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate how certain individuals pledge vows silently, preferring not to articulate their thoughts, perhaps due to a lack of trust in others or even themselves. I once exhibited similar behavior, withdrawing from communication to sequester myself in my room, contemplating existential questions about life after death and the transmigration of souls. However, I eventually recognized my youth and the promising future that lies ahead, deciding to defer such profound reflections until a more appropriate time, which prompted my reengagement with the world.
1491	10358	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this statement to evoke a sense of the protagonist's determination. The author endeavors to convey a message of perseverance, advocating to endure hardship before attempting once more. The character refuses to capitulate and will ultimately surmount the challenging examination.
1492	10359	4	1	The author discusses gardening and her aspiration to enhance her proficiency in the spring. She likely perceives her own gardening skills as deficient because her mother is exceptionally adept, and she desires to achieve a comparable level of expertise in horticulture.
1493	10360	4	1	The purpose is to evoke the reader's empathy for Saeng's perspective on gardening. She anticipates the arrival of spring so she may recommence her efforts. She derives satisfaction from observing plants mature into edible produce. This rationale explains the author's decision to conclude the narrative with this paragraph.
1494	10361	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate themes of determination and hope. The geese and the hibiscus symbolize Saeng’s resolve, as they consistently return regardless of circumstances. Saeng will return to undertake the test, analogous to the geese's return. The hibiscus also represents her because it has confronted adversity. It has been relocated to new environments, similar to Saeng, and faces an impending harsh winter. Nevertheless, it invariably finds a method to return and blossom in the spring, which is what Saeng aspires to accomplish by retaking the driver's test. The author incorporated the final paragraph to demonstrate the symbolism connecting Saeng, the geese, and the hibiscus, which is the reason for the story's concluding paragraph.
1495	10362	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to fundamentally suggest that all events occur for a purpose, a purpose potentially linked to seasonal cycles. She believes she would perform better on her test in the spring, simply because everything flourishes during that season.
1496	10363	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate her capacity to surmount adversities despite having relocated from her homeland. Furthermore, it demonstrates her augmented self-assurance, which substantiates the author's rationale for concluding the story with that particular passage.
1497	10364	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify Saeng's internal vow to retake the examination, connecting this resolve to her life's circumstances. The preceding detail concerning a fallen blossom, which Saeng carefully retrieves and smells, symbolizes her nurturing of the garden and her endeavor to sustain life through the winter. This imagery culminates in the final paragraph's declaration of her renewed determination to attempt the test again with the arrival of spring.
1498	10365	4	1	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it effectively encapsulates the narrative's central theme. The phrase ""When the snow melts and the geese return"" creates a cyclical structure, hearkening back to the story's commencement where Saeng initiated her planting. This deliberate parallel provides the narrative with a cohesive and resonant conclusion."
1499	10366	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. Primarily, the test holds significant importance for Saeng as a means of proving her own capability to herself. This conclusion also generates suspense for the reader regarding Saeng's decision to retake the test and its potential outcome. Ultimately, the paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's defining character traits, illustrating her persistence, determination, and resolute strength of will.
1500	10367	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, a declaration intended to convey to readers the importance of resilience and perseverance. The narrative illustrates that initial failure is not detrimental and that one should endeavor to try again. Following her failed driver's test, Saeng purchases a flower reminiscent of Vietnam, plants it, and receives her mother's understanding. The author thus employs the final paragraph as a moral imperative to persist in one's efforts until one's life goals are ultimately achieved."
1501	10368	4	1	The author deliberately concludes the narrative in such a manner to sustain the audience's intrigue. I posit she elected this denouement to signify her eventual return, at which time she will be thoroughly prepared for all ensuing challenges, including that particular examination. She cultivates a state of suspense so that, upon her return, readers will be compelled to discover the subsequent events and the outcome when she ultimately undertakes the test. She pledged this vow solely to herself, as divulging it to others would risk profound disappointment in the event of failure. This strategic ambiguity is the precise reason for the story’s concluding tone.
1502	10369	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this fashion to articulate her intention to return the following year to retake the examination. She expresses a profound desire to witness the subsequent growth of the plants, with a particular emphasis on observing the hibiscus flourish. Owing to her deep appreciation and affinity for the natural world, she is determined to be present once more to observe their development.
1503	10370	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this final paragraph to underscore the profound sentimental value and significance the plant holds for Saeng. She resolves to retake the examination after winter concludes, as the harsh cold is unsuitable for a delicate hibiscus to endure. A winter-hardy variety is necessary, “not like the kind we had before.” This highlights the critical importance of her discovering a hibiscus reminiscent of those from her homeland. The passage illustrates her initial self-disappointment, which transforms into resolute courage and formidable determination by the concluding paragraph.
1504	10371	4	1	Upon their return, Saeng silently vowed to herself that in the spring, as the snow melts, the geese return, and this hibiscus buds, she would undertake that test again. The author concluded the story in a manner that prompts reader inquiry, reminiscent of the modernist approach in certain literature where interpretation is derived from posing questions rather than a definitive moral. For instance, in a referenced work, the main character’s departure is marked merely by a slamming door. Similarly, this narrative contains a twist, leaving one to ponder the nature of the test. Is it an endeavor to forge new friendships? Is it a personal resolution? This ambiguity ensures the reader desires further narrative, potentially compelling them to revisit the story.
1505	10372	4	1	“The Winter Hibiscus” is a poignant yet hopeful narrative rich with symbolism. The author concluded the story with a resolute ending that provides reader satisfaction. Two primary reasons for this concluding paragraph are to instill a hopeful tone and to connect the objects she observes with the concept of spring. The story culminates with an optimistic tone due to the determined vow Saeng makes internally. Following a difficult day, the author ensured she possessed a tangible objective. It further reveals Saeng's considerable inner strength. This conclusion leaves the reader with a confident and hopeful sentiment. The second reason involves linking symbolic elements to spring; the geese symbolize her new environment, while the hibiscus represents her native home. This paragraph masterfully intertwines these symbols, allowing the reader to associate them with spring’s renewal. The author’s conclusion is brilliantly executed, representing hope through symbolism and culminating in a confident, satisfying resolution for the reader.
1506	10373	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to convey a theme of perseverance. For instance, he intends to demonstrate that one must persist in any endeavor despite potential failure. Consequently, this rationale underpins his chosen conclusion.
1507	10374	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to articulate her central thesis and to foster a comprehension of the passage's complexities. She sought to immerse the reader in her message, evoking a sense of direct witness to the events described.
1508	10375	4	1	"The author concluded the story with this sentence to illustrate that Saeng's discovery of the flower instilled new hope and a rationale for passing her test. The flower provided inspiration by evoking memories of her home in Vietnam, though she was still too unsettled to articulate the word ""home."" By transplanting it into her garden, she integrated a fragment of Vietnam into her new environment, which comforted her. This overall inspiration and the flower's associated memories improved her outlook on her new home and furnished a reason to commence anew with her driving test."
1509	10376	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that with the flowers' return in spring, the geese's arrival, and the hibiscus budding after winter, she will resume her gardening activities.
1510	10377	4	1	"The author of ""The Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with Saeng's declaration: ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This conclusion establishes a mood of acceptance toward change. Similar to nature's adaptation to climatic and geographical shifts, Saeng appears to reconcile with her circumstances, choosing to frame them positively. Through the protagonist, the author demonstrates the value of perseverance when encountering difficulty."
1511	10378	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for a multitude of reasons. One rationale is her potential resolve to attempt the endeavor anew. A secondary motivation could be a profound desire to elicit maternal pride. A third justification likely stems from an acute sense of personal disappointment. Ultimately, the passage conveys that failure in an undertaking should be met with renewed effort, as subsequent attempts may yield significantly improved outcomes.
1512	10379	4	1	Minfong Ho concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring to underscore the perennial promise of hope. Saeng’s sorrow originated from nostalgic recollections of her native Vietnam, as the longing for her homeland and its familiarity caused her profound anguish. Nevertheless, the narrative intimates that she would gradually accept her new environment and rediscover childhood memories there as well. The honking of Canada geese, now discernible and familiar, signifies her growing acclimatization. The hibiscus serves to preserve her Laotian culture and memories, while the geese facilitate her contentment and adjustment in the United States. By sustaining her Laotian heritage through remembrance, she would forge a successful life and ultimately pass her examination, which is the fundamental reason for the story’s concluding paragraph.
1513	10380	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a paragraph that is thematically resonant. The concluding sentence, in which Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, integrates a component of the story's title, thereby providing a comprehensive resolution for the narrative's overarching themes as well as the protagonist's personal arc."
1514	10381	4	1	The author concludes the story with that specific paragraph to illustrate the narrator's renewed preparedness. Having initially attempted and failed the test, she purchased a flower for consolation. Following a conversation with her mother, her spirits were lifted, instilling a determined resolve to pass the driving test, mirroring the flower's own tenacious will to survive.
1515	10382	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph for its potent symbolism of Saeng's transformation and cyclical renewal. The snow melts, geese return, and the hibiscus buds with the changing seasons; similarly, Saeng will try again, albeit as an evolved individual. Recognizing that external circumstances change while intrinsic essence persists, Saeng resolves to do likewise, having cultivated a deeper appreciation for her Laotian heritage through the hibiscus and her recollections.
1516	10383	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph wherein Saeng vows to herself that upon the return of spring, with the thawing snow, the geese's arrival, and the hibiscus budding, she will retake the examination. The author thereby conveys Saeng's resolution to be prepared and ultimately succeed. Furthermore, the author employs this paragraph as the denouement to illustrate the story's conclusion on a note of faith, affirming Saeng's determination to retake the test and fulfill her aspiration to make her mother proud through her success.
1517	10384	4	1	The author likely concludes the story with this paragraph because spring's warmer climate and pleasant atmosphere, combined with the winter season affording her ample time for study, create optimal conditions. Moreover, her newfound comprehension of her circumstances aligns thematically with the cyclical return of the geese, thereby integrating her personal resolution with the natural imagery for a cohesive conclusion.
1518	10385	4	1	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph because it represents the solemn vow she made to herself, thereby providing a resonant and definitive closure to her internal commitment and character arc.
1519	10386	4	1	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding with Saeng’s vow was to illustrate how the hibiscus and other flora in the store functioned as symbols for her. Upon entering, Saeng becomes overwhelmed by recollections of Vietnam she had forgotten. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is where Saeng connects her identity and past with these plants. Observing a familiar plant confined to a pot, she reflects, “How strange to see it in a pot; back home it just grew wild, jutting out from cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs.” This symbolizes her own condition, as outside her homeland she feels similarly constrained and alien, whereas in Vietnam she was far more liberated. The hibiscus, which her mother describes as strong enough to endure the cold months, becomes a direct parallel. Saeng identifies with this resilience, deciding that once the hibiscus has weathered its hardship and begun to bud, she too will have emerged from her struggles, ready to achieve her objective.
1520	10387	4	1	The author concluded the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, paralleling the thawing snow, the geese's return, and the hibiscus budding. Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can endure difficult conditions and adapt, she possesses the same capacity for resilience. She concludes that despite relocating to the unfamiliar United States, she is sufficiently robust to persevere. Failing her driver's test does not signify inherent incapability but rather an opportunity to recommence her efforts, mirroring the hibiscus's fresh start.
1521	10388	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's persistent resolve. Earlier, Saeng visits the greenhouse and succumbs to tears. Upon returning home, she confesses to her mother, ""I-I failed the test."" Despite this setback, Saeng's intention was to return and attempt the examination once more, which justifies the author's concluding choice."
1522	10389	4	1	The final paragraph was incorporated to illustrate the determination and capacity for adaptation inherent in Saeng and her family. Initially, Saeng harbored resentment following her examination failure. However, upon recollecting her homeland through the flower, she achieves acceptance. Just as the plant will blossom, she will be renewed and consequently succeed. Her resolve is exemplified by her efforts to forge friendships; although her offered food was declined, she did not capitulate. Her emotional nadir occurred upon discovering the flower, but after arriving home, her distress concluded as she again embraced the transformation.
1523	10390	4	1	The author includes the final paragraph to signify that Saeng will not capitulate and intends to persevere. Saeng likely purchased the flower because it was indigenous to her homeland, thus providing solace. For instance, Saeng began to cry due to her profound longing for her native country, which the flower evoked.
1524	10391	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he posits that when the flowers return, the circumstances will be more favorable. It is implied that he believes a subsequent test attempt will yield a better outcome, reflecting a theme of hopeful renewal.
1525	10392	4	1	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to perpetuate the theme of adapting to life's alterations. In the narrative, Saeng has relocated to the United States from Vietnam, a significant transition mirrored by the changed flora. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, yet it is distinct; her mother observes, ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to survive the cold winter months here."" This resilience directly correlates with the theme. The final paragraph describes snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding—all transformations the author employs to reinforce the central message, thereby deepening the story's significance. Furthermore, the paragraph's hopeful tone provides the reader with an affirmative sentiment, enhancing the thematic impact."
1526	10393	4	1	The narrative concerns her failure of the examination, and she declares her intention to attempt it again the following year upon the geese's return.
1527	10394	4	1	I believe he signifies that seasons transform and that winter will inevitably recur, which constitutes the fundamental trial.
1528	10395	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with the provided paragraph to illustrate her similarity to the hibiscus and geese. Both the geese and the hibiscus possess an objective: to endure the winter. Geese migrate southward to remain warm, analogous to Saeng, as both relocated to a different environment requiring adaptation. Furthermore, Saeng must experience winter alongside the hibiscus. The hibiscus must demonstrate strength to overcome its trial, winter; this reveals Saeng's resemblance to her plant, as she must also be resilient to surmount her examination. If her hibiscus can survive its challenge, then she too can persevere to conquer her own.
1529	10396	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" includes the phrase ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" to demonstrate her capacity to adapt to change while retaining connections to her native country. An instance of preserving her heritage is illustrated by the statement, ""But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac."" This indicates she can continue consuming traditional foods while experimenting with new cuisine. Ultimately, the excerpt reveals the author's ability to harmoniously integrate both cultures and achieve contentment."
1530	10397	4	1	Numerous reasons could explain the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph, as it possesses multiple potential meanings of significance. I contend the author includes this to indicate that with spring's arrival, she will possess greater motivation to retake the driving examination. This passage can be interpreted in various ways; my interpretation is that the returning spring signifies a new beginning for her. The melting snow symbolizes the hardships of the preceding year, while the geese returning and the hibiscus budding signify their own renewal, preparing to commence their new cycle. Its placement at the conclusion demonstrates Saeng's endeavor to overcome her failure, utilizing this period to prepare for her next attempt. She believes that once the difficulties of the past year are forgotten, she can progress and ultimately pass the test. The author ended the story thusly to illustrate Saeng's proposed resolution to her challenges. One's interpretation yields different insights, and I perceive it as illustrating the new beginning she must inevitably undergo the following year.
1531	10398	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow to retake the examination upon the return of spring, the melting snow, the geese, and the budding hibiscus, thereby indicating her preparedness for their subsequent arrival.
1532	10399	4	1	"The author concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's resolution to retake the test, a deliberate choice to illuminate the story's central themes. A primary theme is perseverance; the hibiscus endures the protracted winter and ultimately survives, inspiring Saeng to persist. Another theme concerns overcoming adversity; the flower confronts numerous perils yet still blossoms, mirroring Saeng's aspiration to conquer her own challenges and succeed on the examination. Consequently, the story's finale effectively conveys these thematic elements."
1533	10400	4	1	The author selected this conclusion to render the narrative more distinctive. For instance, Saeng's declaration pertained to the plants' return. This provided the denouement with a specific focal point, thereby preventing a digression about geese or other elements from diverting the reader. Ultimately, her vow was also contingent upon the geese's return.
1534	10401	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner because the girl perceives the plant as a symbol of resilience and faith; she will therefore retake the test upon its return the following year. She holds a genuine affection for the plant and anticipates that it will restore her fortune.
1535	10402	4	1	The author concluded with that phrase to illustrate her unwavering determination; regardless of difficulty, she persists in her efforts. The girl acknowledges failing the test but subsequently declares she will retake it, demonstrating an unwillingness to accept permanent defeat. Furthermore, the author likely ended the story with that paragraph to provoke speculation regarding her ultimate success.
1536	10403	4	1	I believe the author writes this because she was previously unprepared for the examination, but upon the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, she will be ready. Perhaps she lacked mental preparation initially. In conclusion, when she references the geese and hibiscus returning, she intends to take the test, implying she was not previously prepared for it physically or mentally.
1537	10404	4	1	"Authors meticulously select their concluding paragraphs. The author chose this specific ending because every element within the final paragraph holds particular significance for the character. There are deliberate reasons for concluding the narrative in this manner. The selection of the final paragraph is profoundly important. The character's statement, ""this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" employs the hibiscus as a symbol for overcoming adversity. The narrative concerns the girl confronting her failed test and resolving to retake it, which is why the author concludes thusly. The author additionally writes, ""when the snow melts and the geese return,"" which, for the character, signifies new beginnings and opportunities. This instills in the character the conviction that she will succeed upon her next attempt. The author incorporates this paragraph to symbolize new beginnings, opportunities, and the capacity to overcome obstacles. Authors choose their final paragraphs for specific purposes, and this author did so to symbolize these concepts."
1538	10405	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate a contrast: during the cold, silent period, she is isolated and introspective, but upon the snow's melting and spring's arrival, she becomes more expressive and engages in numerous enjoyable activities, signifying a personal renewal.
1539	10406	4	1	"I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese, which migrate south in a beautiful V formation, return every season. Consequently, she resolves that she will retake the test upon their return and the budding of the hibiscus plant. For instance, she reflects, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" Observing the geese, she is reminded of a somewhat analogous experience from her past, reinforcing her determination."
1540	10407	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph wherein Saeng vows to retake the test upon the return of spring, the geese, and the budding hibiscus, to emphasize that one can overcome defeat by awaiting a new opportunity or season to re-endure the challenge. The hibiscus, significant to the narrator and her mother, was dying until they replanted it; its subsequent growth symbolizes survival and improvement. Saeng's association with the test represents her forthcoming opportunity to pass. This concluding paragraph symbolizes an imminent new beginning, indicating a recurring situation that allows one to achieve what was previously missed. The story and its final paragraph underscore life's cyclical nature, which is perpetually on the verge of blossoming anew.
1541	10408	4	1	She eagerly anticipates the floral resurgence following the snow's thaw, when the climate becomes temperate enough for their growth; she will also retake the examination she previously failed upon the return of migratory geese and blossoms.
1542	10409	4	1	"The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng, akin to the geese and the hibiscus, will reemerge with renewed hope. Saeng experiences despondency within the narrative due to her recent relocation and her driving test failure. The hibiscus plant in the florist evokes poignant memories, yet simultaneously offers profound solace. Later, she transplants the hibiscus outdoors with her mother. As her mother departs, Saeng observes the geese in flight. ""Almost reluctantly,"" she acknowledges that numerous elements once deemed foreign have become, through the silent cycle of seasons, nearly familiar, like the geese. Saeng understood the geese would return in spring, just as she would reattempt her driving test, and the hibiscus would bloom again to provide her with hope, which constitutes the meaning of the final paragraph in ""The Winter Hibiscus."""
1543	10410	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's enduring resolve. This concept of her determination to succeed parallels the plant she acquires. She recognized the plant as one that grew wild in her native habitat, yet she discovered it confined to a pot within the United States, thereby restricting its growth, mirroring how Saeng perceives her new country as unfamiliar and feels displaced.
1544	10411	4	1	"The author concludes the story with Saeng resolving to retake the test because it synthesizes the central theme and primary narrative actions. The story's theme concerns acclimating to a novel environment by discovering its beauty and parallels to one's homeland. Saeng reflects that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese."" Furthermore, the plants in the greenhouse transport her back to memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng struggled to adjust after moving, yet she remained determined to overcome these challenges, just as she reconciled the differences between her new location and Vietnam. The author's conclusion, referencing the geese, the hibiscus, and retaking the test, demonstrates Saeng's adaptation and conveys to both her and the reader her capacity to surmount new obstacles, thereby foreshadowing her future success and assimilation."
1545	10412	4	1	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph because it signifies both an ending and the commencement of a new beginning. The author employs seasonal symbolism throughout the narrative. Winter represents the current season, while spring is imminent. Although Saeng failed her test during winter, a time of dormancy, she anticipates spring to recommence her efforts. The returning geese and budding hibiscus will herald spring's arrival and renewed life. Saeng, too, will experience revitalization in her test, enabling her to pass and drive, as the spring season arrives to bestow new life upon all.
1546	10413	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it effectively encapsulates the story's essence in a condensed and succinct manner.  This paragraph constitutes an effective conclusion for the story due to its thematic connection to the examination, as the narrator resolves to attempt it again during the spring.  I contend that the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it encapsulates the story's fundamental theme, elucidating the final outcome as though the preceding narrative chronicled the growth and existence of a flower.  In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with a seemingly unresolved paragraph. The protagonist, Saeng, vows to retake her driving test when spring arrives. As Saeng held the plant, she experienced a sensation of cold and helplessness, mirroring the plant's state. The description of ""the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind"" reinforces this parallel. Her mother's reassurance, ""I'm glad you got it,"" facilitated Saeng's personal growth. The mother's observation, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing,"" metaphorically describes Saeng's own clinging connection to her homeland. The mother's subsequent affirmation that the plant will now survive signifies that both the plant and Saeng will emerge strengthened by spring, justifying the author's chosen endpoint.  The author concludes the narrative by illustrating the girl's connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese; the winter hibiscus represents her link to her homeland. She declared she would retake her driving test once her plant buds and demonstrates resilience, paralleling her own intended action. The geese flying south symbolize her personal journey, as she will undertake the test upon their return, mirroring the completion of her own transformative passage."
1547	10414	4	1
1548	10415	4	1
1549	10416	4	1
1550	10417	4	1
1551	10418	4	1	The author crafted the concluding paragraph with deliberate intent for several reasons. Principally, she sought to conclude the narrative on an optimistic note. A pervasive melancholic nostalgia throughout the story elicited a profound yearning for the past within the reader. The author intended to emphasize resilience despite potentially finding one's present circumstances disagreeable. Furthermore, she aimed to illuminate the fortitude of the protagonist, Saeng. Despite failing an assessment in an unfamiliar environment, she resolves to persevere. This imbues the character with greater dimension, rendering her dynamic rather than static. This narrative is particularly commendable for those experiencing homesickness and requiring motivation to advance.
1552	10420	4	1	The author concludes with that particular statement to illustrate her requirement for a period of adjustment. She necessitates time to acclimate to her new environment, analogous to a hibiscus establishing its roots within unfamiliar soil. While at the orchard, encountering the hibiscus evokes memories of her former home, provoking tears yet simultaneously evoking a sense of solace, thereby creating a poignant emotional duality.
1553	10421	4	1	The author concludes the passage to demonstrate the virtue of patience. Saeng must await the spring, anticipating that the season may evoke sensations reminiscent of her homeland. She holds a distinct preference for spring over winter, largely due to the return of migratory birds, such as geese, which depart during the colder months. This seasonal symbolism is the foundational reason for the author's concluding thematic choice.
1554	10422	4	1	“When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author has departed her homeland for an unfamiliar nation. Her current surroundings are novel and largely unknown. This concluding quotation suggests the author retains hope for adapting to her new home. She abandoned not merely a structure, but her home, cherished individuals, and innumerable memories. She likely felt displaced, having been extracted from her comfort zone into an entirely new world. The exotic hibiscus transported her nostalgically to her past affections, before reality reasserted itself, causing her emotional distress and perceived failure. The final sentence demonstrates her willingness to endure and her determined resolve to ultimately pass her personal test of adaptation.
1555	10423	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to signify her intent to retake the examination, aspiring to succeed to fulfill her mother's expectations and provide support. She selected spring because it symbolizes nature's rebirth, and Saeng desires to approach the test with a refreshed and unburdened mindset. This reasoning underpins the author's decision to position the paragraph as the story's conclusion."
1556	10424	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story, Saeng contends with her history and the challenge of transcending it. The paragraph provides a sense of resolution to the narrative. Upon returning home with the hibiscus, she informs her mother she was incapable of resisting it and could not surmount her past. Saeng states, “I-I failed the test.” Her reference to “the test” signifies her capacity to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and to ultimately prevail. In the concluding paragraph, Saeng declares she will retake the examination, stating, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Ultimately, the author employs the final paragraph to furnish closure for both the story and the emotional tribulations Saeng confronts.
1557	10425	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to imbue the ending with a sense of hope. For instance, since relocating to the United States, the protagonist has experienced profound homesickness. Compounding this distress, she failed her driver’s examination. The narrator observes, “She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” This quotation accentuates the character’s profound longing for home. The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate that with the arrival of spring, the protagonist will commence anew and revitalize her existence in her new environment.
1558	10426	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with this paragraph because Saeng is conveying to the readers her resolve to retake the examination when circumstances become more favorable. She intends to attempt the test again once conditions appear to be improving. This rationale underpins the author's decision to utilize this particular paragraph for the story’s conclusion, thereby affirming the protagonist's commitment to future perseverance.
1559	10427	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrator visits a greenhouse containing numerous flowers, but one in particular captivates her: a winter hibiscus plant. This plant evokes memories of her homeland and the events that transpired there; it also reminds her of her grandmother's long, silky gray hair, and how she would observe her drying it in the sun before assisting her in knotting it into a bun adorned with a bud of this same plant. The author concludes the story with this passage because it counterbalances her earlier declaration, ""I-I failed the test,"" with the concluding statement, ""..., then I will take the test again,"" establishing a narrative of resilience."
1560	10428	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist Saeng fails her driver's test, lamenting, ""I-I failed the test."" She purchases a hibiscus because the flower evokes memories of her homeland and the hibiscus plants from her former residence. Ultimately, she declares she will retake the test upon the geese's return, the snow's melting, and the hibiscus's budding. She does this, presumably, because she requires time to contemplate her circumstances, reminisce about home, and perhaps cultivate a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus within the narrative functions as a parallel to Saeng; both have encountered a setback or a failure—Saeng with her test and the hibiscus confined to a pot. However, each possesses the potential to transform their unfavorable situation."
1561	10429	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in such a manner to convey the resolve and newfound motivation Saeng discovered upon acquiring the familiar plant. Although she failed her examination, encountering a plant reminiscent of her homeland and her grandmother instilled within her the impetus to retake the test; she aspired to ensure her new home in a foreign country would improve, irrespective of obstacles. ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky..."" the author incorporated details concerning the geese to symbolize progression. The geese will depart and subsequently return, analogous to Saeng's own journey. She initially failed the test, but procuring the plant and observing the birds inspired her to attempt once more. ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become...familiar to her."" The geese were among the elements cited that had grown familiar within her new environment. Concluding the narrative with a reference to the geese communicates to the reader her gradual but certain adaptation to her unfamiliar surroundings. Discovering the plant provided solace, as it was already known to her. ""Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. 'Hibiscus,' Saeng said."" Following her unsuccessful driver's test, entering the florist's shop and finding that plant consoled her, rendering the new locale more akin to home than it initially seemed. The geese had become familiar over time, and locating the plant was fundamentally reassuring. Concluding the story thus demonstrated to the reader her adaptation and capacity to manage a difficult circumstance in a comforting manner."
1562	10430	4	1	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow: ""when they come back, I will take that test again... in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" The author selected this conclusion to articulate that as the annual cycle recommences with a new beginning, Saeng, too, will start anew. She implies that the geese's return, the melting snow, and the hibiscus's budding all signify renewal and a fresh commencement. Consequently, her decision to retake the test aligns with this period of rejuvenation and represents a personal new year."
1563	10431	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concluded her narrative with a passage referencing the season following Saeng's failure of her driving test. Saeng experienced an emotional release upon recognizing her past through a flower, and her subsequent purchase of dok malik seeds indicates the story ended as it did to signify a forthcoming cycle. The implication is that her resolve to try again will blossom with the next season, symbolizing hope and renewal after a period of defeat."
1564	10432	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination. Her declaration that she will retake the test demonstrates her resolute character. Despite having failed her driver's examination, Saeng refuses to capitulate, revealing a steadfast commitment to persevere and ultimately succeed in her new environment.
1565	10433	4	1	The author employed that sentence to evoke the imagery of the melting snow and the returning geese. Concurrently, the flowers were beginning to bud, symbolizing renewal, which substantiates the rationale for the author's lexical choice. This confluence of natural events serves as a metaphor for the protagonist's own cycle of resilience and new beginnings.
1566	10434	4	1	"This conclusion serves as a fitting resolution to the narrative. Saeng's statement, ""When they come back,"" refers to the flowers returning to life. ""In the spring"" specifies the season of their resurgence. Her subsequent phrases, ""When the snows melt and the geese return,"" delineate the post-winter period and the spring migration. ""And this Hibiscus is budding"" indicates the floral reblooming in spring. ""Then I will take the test again,"" signifies her intention to retake the examination following these natural events. This illustrates that Saeng will observe these seasonal transitions, anticipating spring's arrival for her test retake. She is prepared for spring to commence, enabling her to study, succeed on the test, and secure employment at the flower @CAPS1. This objective will constitute her primary focus throughout the winter until spring arrives."
1567	10435	4	1	The author selected this conclusion because spring symbolizes a period of renewal and blossoming. During winter, she could not concentrate effectively, but the hibiscus budding signifies the precise moment she will be mentally prepared to retake her examination. The author likely wrote this conclusion because the seasonal cycle holds profound personal significance for the character.
1568	10436	4	1	"This story's conclusion instills a profound sense of hope for the future. Although the girl is disheartened by her failure, she retains optimism for subsequent endeavors. The narrator's observation, ""She lifted her head,"" demonstrates her resolve to persevere rather than capitulate. This ending prompts readers to contemplate whether she will intensify her efforts and pass on her second attempt. Her statement, ""when the snow melts and the geese return,"" creates a parallel between her journey and the geese's arduous migration. Furthermore, her remark, ""and this hibiscus budding,"" signifies that she will undertake the test when nature revitalizes and her confidence peaks. The author concludes the narrative to emphasize future prospects and her unwavering determination. Despite her initial disappointment, she will undoubtedly prepare to pass the examination in the spring."
1569	10437	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this particular paragraph for several distinct reasons.
1570	10438	4	1	Saeng is @CAPS1 that a considerable duration will elapse before she must concern herself with academic responsibilities again, which is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
1571	10439	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to emphasize that the girl is not entirely discontent with departing from her home. He concluded in this manner to illustrate that there remains hope for her to cultivate affection for her new residence.
1572	10440	4	1	The author concludes the story with this sentence because Saeng requires a respite before she attempts the examination again. Saeng is drawing a comparison between two disparate entities: flowers and undertaking a test. This parallel is significant, which is why the author chooses to end the narrative with this particular sentence.
1573	10441	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that the girl will emulate the hibiscus. When it blooms subsequently, the girl will be prepared for the examination, will retake it, and will succeed. The author aims to demonstrate that the girl will persevere and endeavor once more to ensure she passes. The author incorporates the hibiscus to show that the girl will bloom concurrently with the flower and will consequently pass the test.
1574	10442	4	1	I believe the author concludes the story with that sentence because Saeng favors the spring season and can concentrate more effectively with her preferred flower, which she perceives as having relevance to her own life.
1575	10443	4	1	"The author concludes the story in that manner to underscore the theme of diligent effort. Other instances of this perseverance are exemplified by the ""winter hibiscus."" A further example is her resolution to pass the examination, which justifies the author's chosen conclusion."
1576	10444	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that particular paragraph to establish a structural parallel with the story's introduction. The opening depicts Saeng failing her driver's examination and subsequently encountering a familiar plant she desires to purchase. The central narrative then explores her profound difficulties adapting to her new environment. Consequently, the conclusion presents Saeng's resolution to retake the test upon the blossoming of flowers and the return of geese, symbols that evoke her homeland and provide the solace and fortitude necessary to surmount her challenges.
1577	10445	4	1	Authors employ numerous literary techniques to enhance their narratives, without which a story may appear mundane and unengaging. Author Minfong Ho conveys Saeng's intention to retake the examination not through a simple declaration, but by having her pledge upon the geese that she will do so. The author selected this conclusion to illustrate the profound significance she attached to the test.
1578	10446	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to connect the hibiscus to Saeng's trials and triumphs. Just as Saeng cannot surrender and must return to retake the examination, the winter hibiscus must endure the harsh, severe season and reemerge resilient. The hibiscus functions as a symbol of hope, which Saeng perceives as her own. Throughout the story, the plant provides solace by reminding her of her homeland. The author incorporates this element because many individuals can relate to discovering hope in symbolic objects. For Saeng, the annual return of the hibiscus under such arduous conditions reassures her that she, too, will ultimately thrive in her new surroundings.
1579	10447	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to signify a new beginning. The geese are returning to recommence their life cycle, the hibiscus will bloom, and she will retake the examination. Initially, Saeng was despondent over leaving her native country and her grandmother, experiencing a wave of loss so profound it brought tears to her eyes. She recalled how such plants grew wild in the landscape of her past. Saeng's statement in the final paragraph demonstrates that she has discovered comfort and confidence through the hibiscus. Memories of her former life have guided her, and she now prepares to retake her driver's test.
1580	10448	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this final paragraph because the story fundamentally concerns how she finds solace in the plants and wishes to postpone retaking her test until the weather changes and the geese return. She likely desires to wait so that she will feel more acclimated to her environment, thereby allowing her to clarify her thoughts and perform optimally on the examination.
1581	10449	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve to retake the examination, contingent upon the return of favorable and joyful circumstances, symbolized by the plant and the geese. This assertion is substantiated by Saeng's declaration: ""When they return... and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This demonstrates her maturation and optimism. She intends to undertake a challenging and potentially unpleasant endeavor only when her environment is restored to happiness. Just as her arrival was marked by sorrow, the return of the geese and the budding plant inspires her to assist them through their cycle, thereby fostering a collective state of contentment."
1582	10450	4	1	"Minfong Ho's short story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" concludes with the protagonist, Saeng, resolving to retake her failed driver's examination in the spring, coinciding with the geese's return and the winter hibiscus's budding. The author employs profound imagery and symbolism; the hibiscus discovered in the floral shop signifies Saeng's connection to her homeland, while the bitter melon, which she cherishes but others find unpalatable, represents her difficulty assimilating. For Saeng, the budding hibiscus and migrating geese symbolize a renewed opportunity to pass her test and better adapt to her new life."
1583	10451	4	1	The author selected this concluding paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's resilience and the fortitude she derives from nature. The conclusion reveals her perseverance through her decision to retake the test despite her initial failure. Furthermore, it illustrates how nature empowers her, as she vows to attempt the test again upon the geese's return, the hibiscus's budding, and the spring thaw; these natural phenomena strengthen her by evoking memories of her former home and her grandmother. Ultimately, the author concluded with this paragraph to affirm that Saeng possesses determination and that nature provides her with confidence.
1584	10452	4	1	"The protagonist, Saeng, grapples with both internal and external conflicts, having failed her driver's test and continuing to yearn for Vietnam. The story's denouement was an exemplary conclusion. The flock of geese symbolized her transformation; she initially felt awkward and displaced, as many things were unfamiliar. Saeng ultimately recognized that her life possesses positive qualities. The planting of the ""winter hibiscus"" similarly represented her metamorphosis, indicating how she will commence anew and proceed with happiness, effectively ""planting a new seed."" The ending was aptly chosen for its foreshadowing of Saeng's future, contributing significantly to the narrative's inspiring effect."
1585	10453	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to reveal how Saeng draws a parallel between the hibiscus overcoming adversity and her own capacity to do the same. Saeng equates herself with the hibiscus; if the plant can adapt to its environment, then she can as well. Should the hibiscus endure the winter, she too will persevere and retake her previously failed examination. Previously, she observed that entities once strange, like the geese, had become familiar. Witnessing them flying in a V-formation overhead, she recognizes their adaptation by migrating to a warmer climate, an example she herself can emulate.
1586	10454	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that sentence to convey her anticipation for spring's return, enabling her to cultivate additional flora and observe their subsequent blossoming and revitalization.
1587	10455	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resilience. Having failed her driving examination, Saeng discovered a hibiscus during her walk home, which evoked memories of her native land. She subsequently procured one from a greenhouse and planted it upon her return. This hibiscus symbolizes her perseverance, and she intends to retake the examination once the plant begins to bud.
1588	10456	4	1	"The author selected that paragraph for the conclusion because it signifies the moment conditions become ideal for rectifying her error. Saeng's declaration, ""I-I failed the test!"" signifies her failure in a presumed competency. Her initiative to assist her mother with gardening demonstrates her determination to improve her skills. Consequently, Saeng aspires to pass the test to validate her gardening abilities, emulating her mother's proficiency."
1589	10457	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to generate anticipation for a subsequent story, compelling readers to discover the outcome of her retaken examination. Having previously failed, her personal growth now instills a renewed confidence, suggesting she will perform more capably than her initial attempt.
1590	10458	4	1	This paragraph serves as an effective conclusion because its constituent elements are interwoven throughout the preceding narrative. It encapsulates the central theme of adaptation, mirroring the plant's acclimatization as Saeng herself learns to adapt to her new homeland.
1591	10459	4	1	The author likely concluded the narrative with this particular paragraph to ensure thematic consistency. This deliberate choice provides the reader with a definitive illustration and a comprehensive understanding of the text's central message.
1592	10460	4	1	The narrative is integrated with the paragraph because they address congruent themes. The author likely included the anecdote to demonstrate the positive rapport between mother and daughter and their capacity for shared endeavors, which is further substantiated by their discussed plans to travel to Canada together.
1593	10461	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's resilience and restored confidence. Her declaration to retake the test in the spring signifies her self-assurance and anticipation of a new beginning. This conclusion is apt because, following her initial failure, Saeng's confidence was diminished; however, after a supportive conversation with her mother, she resolved to persevere until ultimately succeeding.
1594	10462	4	1	It is anticipated that she will retake the test in the spring and endeavor to pass. She was determined not to cry in front of her mother, and it is believed she will compensate for her previous failure by ultimately passing the examination.
1595	10463	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that the protagonist, though initially defeated, is resolved to recover and attempt the test again. This serves as an effective denouement, as it underscores her profound determination to pass and her unwavering resolve to persevere until she achieves her objective.
1596	10464	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to demonstrate her resolute determination and her intention to act when she is fully prepared. This interpretation is supported by her decision to undertake the test according to her own volition, when she feels sufficiently comfortable. These are the foundational reasons for the author's choice to conclude the story with that specific paragraph.
1597	10465	4	1	"The author likely concludes the narrative in this manner to exemplify perseverance. Saeng observes, ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" a statement that signifies her gradual adaptation to change. Given time, she will fully acclimate to her new environment, provided she maintains her perseverance, which will ultimately ensure her success. In the final paragraph, Saeng declares, ""when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the seasons cyclically restore life, she too will return to her endeavor, illustrating the author's message that perseverance is essential, as certain achievements simply require time."
1598	10466	4	1	"This statement reveals the author's concluding message and encapsulates the story's central theme: one must persist after failure. The declaration indicates that, having failed her initial attempts, she will endeavor to complete her task in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus's reblooming. It further conveys the imperative to never surrender. Saeng's admission, ""I-I failed the test,"" uttered in a despondent and disheartened tone, reflects her profound disappointment. Nevertheless, despite her dejection, Saeng resolves to attempt the test again the following year. Ultimately, the sentence demonstrates the author's concluding perspective on the story ""Winter Hibiscus."""
1599	10467	4	1	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow—""When they come back... then I will take that test again""—for several significant reasons. Primarily, Saeng resolves to emulate the hibiscus's resilience; her mother describes the plant as ""strong enough to make it through,"" inspiring Saeng to demonstrate similar fortitude and pass her driving test. Furthermore, the geese mentioned in the paragraph connect to her acclimatization, as their call now sounds ""familiar,"" indicating her growing adaptation to her new surroundings despite her nostalgia. Ultimately, by referencing the plant, symbolizing her homeland, and the geese, representing her new home, the conclusion signifies that while she misses her past, she is beginning to integrate into her new country and acknowledge her place within it, recognizing that dwelling on the past is counterproductive to her success."
1600	10468	4	1	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to convey a specific message to the reader. The author intends to communicate that if a plant can endure a harsh winter, then she too possesses the capacity to pass her driver's test. This symbolic parallel is the primary reason for the paragraph's inclusion in the narrative's conclusion.
1601	10469	4	1	I believe the author concluded the narrative in that manner because she appreciates observing the geese, adores the spring season, and is determined to undertake and succeed on the examination for which she is presently studying.
1602	10470	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because she perceives that Saeng will pass the examination if she possesses the hibiscus, attributing this belief to the flower's distinctive qualities. Furthermore, it evokes her memory of her residence prior to relocating to @ORGANIZATION1, a period during which Saeng appeared disoriented and uncertain of her actions.
1603	10471	4	1	The author demonstrates considerable creativity. He concludes the narrative by describing how the hibiscus is burgeoning and that she will retake the examination. She is confident she will perform better once the snow has melted. The author selected this conclusion because Saeng was deeply distressed by her initial failure, yet the solace provided by the hibiscus suggests her future success. He also employs that paragraph to resolve the narrative following the climactic event of her failed test, thereby concluding Saeng's trajectory concerning the examination.
1604	10472	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in that manner because the examination constituted the primary subject under discussion.
1605	10473	4	1	"In the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrator articulates her resolve to undertake and ultimately pass the driver's test she failed earlier, vowing silently to herself that she would succeed at a previous failure. This constitutes a significant concluding message, illustrating the protagonist's determination to overcome future obstacles. The narrative primarily concerns the narrator's sorrow stemming from nostalgia for her homeland; Saeng longs for her grandmother and the flora of Vietnam, even purchasing a hibiscus as a memento. She also struggles within @LOCATION2, having already encountered failure there. However, the story's conclusion provides a contrasting perspective, for Saeng pledges to achieve future success."
1606	10474	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to demonstrate the protagonist's profound development. She has comprehended that if a delicate entity like the hibiscus can endure harsh conditions, she possesses a parallel capacity for resilience. Nature's struggle for existence mirrors Saeng's personal strife within an unfamiliar environment. She ascertains that one gradually acclimates to one's circumstances. Following this period of adjustment, the new environment will ultimately evoke a sense of belonging. This principle of adaptation is consistently illustrated throughout the story, manifested in both the natural world and a child's experience. Consequently, the author would affirm that the story's denouement portrays Saeng's biological and psychological maturation.
1607	10475	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng is a recent arrival to @LOCATION1. While experiencing profound homesickness, she encounters a hibiscus within a florist's establishment. After procuring the plant and cultivating it in her garden, she resolves to reattempt the driver's examination coinciding with the hibiscus's budding in spring. The author selected this conclusion to establish a symbolic correlation between Saeng and the flower. The hibiscus serves as a tangible link to her native Vietnam, and its presence in this new context signifies that if the tropical plant can survive a frigid winter, so too can she. Undertaking the driving test will represent her triumph over adversity. The story conveys a universal theme that circumstances ameliorate with the passage of time. Saeng will ultimately adapt to @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will flourish, and she will succeed in her driving test."
1608	10476	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to underscore the protagonist's unwavering determination. She possesses the resolve to persist in her efforts toward the examination, refusing to concede defeat. Her outlook will become increasingly optimistic. She will ultimately pass the assessment, thereby avoiding the disappointment of her mother. This achievement will finally relieve her of the significant burden associated with the test, allowing her to progress unencumbered.
1609	10477	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to facilitate the reader's visualization of a new beginning for the protagonist. It signifies a time to reattempt the test while observing the emergence of fresh blossoms and the return of migratory geese. The geese are symbolically connected to her personal journey and the quest she has undertaken toward her new home. The confluence of melting snow and budding flora informs the reader of a bright, unclaimed future awaiting the girl. The author employs the final paragraph to elaborate on forthcoming events, enhance the narrative's imagery, and captivate the audience. It functions to reveal an indomitable spirit within the girl, permitting the audience to perceive that she, akin to the flower, initially struggles to establish roots within her new lifestyle, yet a new opportunity to persevere invariably arrives.
1610	10478	4	1	The author likely included that paragraph because it may represent a tradition or a token of good fortune, thus its inclusion is thematically significant. Furthermore, it potentially signifies that she will only undertake the test during the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus's initial budding, thereby imbuing the act with symbolic importance.
1611	10479	4	1	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with that particular paragraph to articulate Saeng’s profound longing for her homeland while simultaneously illustrating her nascent capacity to surmount adversity. Saeng yearns for her native country, persistently alluding to it because she desires its restoration. “I mean, it’s not like the one we had at—at—,” Saeng stammers, unable to mention home directly as it provokes profound sorrow. Furthermore, her allusion to the “test” compels her to purchase an artificial plant. “It’s—it’s not a real one.” She rejects acquiring a genuine specimen because it evokes the memory of her driving examination and her existing distress. The test metaphorically refers to both the botanical specimen and the driver’s examination. Saeng concludes with this resolution because the flower symbolizes hope for her: “… and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test.” The emotional trials inherent in both situations will ultimately fortify her resilience. This concluding vow demonstrates her determination to cultivate strength and ultimately prevail.
1612	10480	4	1	The author concludes that after she has completed her examination and finds nothing more to observe, she will subsequently experience significant personal growth and development.
1613	10481	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this specific paragraph because the protagonist failed her driving examination. She incorporates extensive natural imagery to underscore the character's deliberate engagement with the natural world, which constitutes the story's principal thematic concern.
1614	10482	4	1	I surmise the author incorporates this paragraph to convey to the reader that upon the restoration of beauty, the protagonist will endeavor to acclimate herself to unfamiliar circumstances once again.
1615	10483	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with that paragraph to evoke a sense of renewal and a nascent beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus serves as a memento of her homeland, sustaining her resolve and resilience; she analogizes her experience to the geese, noting that elements she initially perceived as alien became customary through gradual, seasonal repetition. During winter, the hibiscus remains dormant and Saeng fails her driver's test. The paragraph signifies that in spring, as the hibiscus flourishes and the geese reappear, it will inaugurate a new commencement for them and for Saeng as well."
1616	10484	4	1	The author likely concludes the narrative with Saeng’s vow to retake the examination to underscore her resolute determination. For instance, upon informing her mother of her failure, her mother recognized the difficulty Saeng had faced. The ensuing silence prompted her mother’s realization that admonishing her regarding the plant was misguided. Saeng implicitly draws a parallel between herself and the plant; she might have reasoned that if the plant could endure the winter and persist in growth, then she could likewise persevere through the examination. Consequently, this rationale most probably informs the author’s chosen conclusion for the story.
1617	10485	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey Saeng’s renewed hope and steadfast determination. The author holds a profound admiration for the hibiscus; for example, her mother observes, “But it’s strong enough to survive the winter.” Saeng aspires to confront adversity with the same resilience exhibited by the hibiscus. She is imbued with fresh resolve upon declaring to herself, “Then I will take the test again.”
1618	10486	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the entire story builds toward this moment, and the narrative would lack purpose without such a definitive resolution. The conclusion provides essential thematic closure, rendering the preceding events meaningful and complete.
1619	10487	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s capacity to adapt to the circumstances of her new existence. The hibiscus, a plant flourishing in warm, tropical climates, typically cannot endure cold conditions; only the winter hibiscus, which survives in both warm and cold environments, can. This hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng. She resided in Vietnam, cherishing its beautiful flora and her grandmother’s presence. However, her current life in the United States presents challenges to her adaptation. Now, possessing this hibiscus, which magnificently adapts to cold weather, she feels empowered to adjust to her new life. Observing the geese return for another spring and summer, she resolves to take the driving test, interpreting their return as the landscape receiving another opportunity to serve as their seasonal home. This symbolic parallel justifies the author’s concluding paragraph.
1620	10488	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it describes the melting snow and the resurgence of greenery, evoking a theme of rebirth. This natural transformation parallels his renewed motivation to retake the examination. It effectively demonstrates his profound connection to nature and the significant influence that his prolonged exposure to it has exerted upon him.
1621	10489	4	1	"I believe the author concluded the narrative with this paragraph because the entire story possessed a gentle sweetness, with nearly every sentence composing a beautiful image in the reader's mind. Therefore, concluding with a paragraph such as, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" is profoundly fitting. One must concede that the effect is indeed beautiful."
1622	10490	4	1	The author deliberately constructed the final sentence in that specific manner. Its implication is that, by the following spring, the protagonist intends to approach a similar situation with a different perspective. Having already experienced the circumstances, she now understands how to respond to the seasonal change with greater wisdom.
1623	10491	4	1	The author employs this line to conclude the story because it signifies her receiving another opportunity to pass the examination. The plant is utilized symbolically, as a plant perpetually returns and buds anew. This also constituted an effective conclusion, as it demonstrates how plants can serve as a source of inspiration, encouraging one to aspire towards something greater. Furthermore, this may represent the manner in which she communicates with her mother through the natural world.
1624	10492	4	1	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the narrative concludes with that particular paragraph because it signifies her gradual acclimatization to the new country. It also conveys the necessity of adapting to unfamiliar circumstances, which is the reasoning behind my belief that the author selected that paragraph for the conclusion."
1625	10493	4	1	The flowers on this bush provide significant comfort to Saeng. Within the story, she clarifies that they evoke memories of her home in Vietnam. The plant's budding and the spring season collectively symbolize renewed life. Saeng perceives that spring could also signify a new beginning for her personally, a time when she will improve and pass the examination. Yet, should she falter again, the flowers will have blossomed to offer her solace.
1626	10494	4	1	The author concludes with this analogy because she identifies with the flowers. She has adapted to her environment similarly to a flower. Furthermore, having failed her test, she will, akin to a flower that perishes and subsequently revives, return to attempt the examination once more.
1627	10495	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph because her test failure corresponds to the winter's absence of hibiscus; upon their return in the spring, she will likewise endeavor to retake the examination to achieve success.
1628	10496	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph for two principal reasons. Firstly, the flower's state mirrors her own; it had not yet bloomed. However, when the snow melts and the flower blossoms, she, resembling the flower, will endeavor to flourish by passing the examination. Secondly, it evokes memories of her home, and her mother comprehends the significance of its cost, compelling them to nurture it.
1629	10497	4	1	"Minfong Ho, author of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" concludes the story with Saeng resolving to retake and pass her driver's test in the spring, coinciding with the geese returning and plants rebudding. This final paragraph signifies Saeng's determination to begin anew. After failing her test, Saeng visits a greenhouse, misses Vietnam, and purchases a hibiscus, planting it upon returning home as geese fly south for winter. The plant symbolizes her memories; initially blossomed, it will rebud in spring, forming another blossom while growing larger. This parallels Saeng overcoming sadness and homesickness, reconstructing improved memories while growing stronger. The birds flying overhead seek southern shelter from the cold; in spring they return to start over, raise goslings, and rebuild their homes. Saeng plans to start over, pass her test, drive, and feel more accepted in her new environment. Minfong Ho chose this conclusion to signify the character's new beginning and reconstruction of positive memories."
1630	10498	4	1	"The concluding paragraph in ""Winter Hibiscus"" was included because the author wished to convey the protagonist's distress over failing the test. She feels disappointed, aware of her mother's disappointment and belief in her capability. While observing the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead, she realizes she possesses an opportunity to pass the examination. Now resolved to retake it, she will do so the following year at the same time, confident in her eventual success."
1631	10499	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey the girl's sentiment. She believes that with the arrival of spring, she can surpass her previous performance.
1632	10500	4	1	This signifies her desire to recommence the endeavor. The activity constitutes her sanctuary, which is her recourse during distress. This is the fundamental meaning of both the story and the phase.
1633	10501	4	1	"The author concluded with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring to convey the themes of perseverance and the essential support of family. The final affirmation, ""It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,"" further underscores this message of resilience and appreciation."
1634	10502	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate the character's profound appreciation for nature, as her anticipation for spring motivates her to attempt the test again. The author thus illustrates the protagonist's deep regard for the beauty of the natural world.
1635	10503	4	1	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring because the hibiscus symbolizes a talisman; its absence signifies discord, while its return heralds improvement. Furthermore, the charm provides the confidence necessary for success, ultimately revealing her belief in a source of hope that ensures her eventual triumph.
1636	10504	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner because a central theme involves transcending adversity. The hibiscus embodies Saeng’s perseverance, and the final paragraph provides resolution to the previously established conflict. The observation that the hibiscus is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here… that is what matters” forges a connection between the plant and the protagonist's resilience through its symbolic function. This concluding symbolism is reinforced by her declaration to wait until spring before retaking the examination.
1637	10505	4	1	Saeng conveys her intention to retake the examination when the appropriate season returns. The author concludes the story thusly to evoke contemplation regarding her subsequent attempt, while simultaneously illustrating the imperative of perseverance; if the flower can endure winter, she too can overcome the test. Furthermore, the author suggests that with seasonal shifts, circumstances transform. Witnessing the plant's survival through harsh conditions, despite her initial despair over failure, renewed her confidence. She cherishes the plant, anticipating its budding, as it represents quality time shared with her mother.
1638	10506	4	1	Saeng discusses her academic obligations and the garden, consistently drawing parallels between the two. She recognizes her duty to study while the garden develops, and though she desires to tend the flowers, she acknowledges that come spring she will be absent from the garden, compelled instead to undertake her examination.
1639	10507	4	1	The author concluded the narrative in this fashion to illustrate Saeng’s resolute determination and refusal to capitulate. The author intends for the reader to comprehend Saeng’s profound melancholy and her desire to surmount her homesickness. Saeng shares a distinct resemblance to the hibiscus; she is delicate and beautiful. Her statement that she will retake her test when the hibiscus buds suggests a parallel development, as if she is evolving alongside the plant.
1640	10508	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate that all entities possess the capacity to endure hardship. This passage serves as a final, affirmative message for the reader. The text states, “when they come back... I will take that test again,” revealing that Saeng identifies with the returning geese or the budding hibiscus. She perceives her test as a personal winter, recognizing that preparedness will enable a successful subsequent attempt. The hibiscus's budding signifies her moment of readiness. Despite present difficulties, she will persevere and endeavor again. This concluding section synthesizes the hibiscus's purpose; its omission would have obscured this message, leaving its role merely as a link to Saeng's past. Ultimately, this optimistic conclusion was incorporated to illustrate that recovery from adversity is universally attainable.
1641	10509	4	1	Primarily, it signifies that she can only undertake the examination in the spring. Additionally, her environment during that season provided her with a sense of tranquility. This was particularly beneficial when she was disheartened and @CAPS1 regarding her unsuccessful driving attempt.
1642	10510	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this @CAPS1 due to her profound regard for the hibiscus. She articulated this sentiment while drawing a parallel between her examination and the plant. She resolved to retake the test when the hibiscus commenced budding, as the flower represented her entire world and served as a talisman for good fortune. Its blossoming symbolized the potential for a renewed existence. Without it, her perspective was bleak, exemplified by her despondent replies to her mother's subsequent inquiries. Her profound disappointment from failing the test motivated her acquisition of the hibiscus to positively impact her life, deciding that the spring's budding would mark the commencement of her new beginning by retaking the examination.
1643	10511	4	1	The author's conclusion suggests that unforeseen events can transpire within the narrative. Saeng purchased a winter hibiscus, which provoked her mother's anger. Her mother was incensed because Saeng had expended funds on an entire plant rather than cultivating one from a seed, which would have been considerably more economical. Confronted with her mother's fury and disbelief, Saeng began to weep, leading her mother to ultimately forgive her actions, thereby demonstrating that unexpected outcomes are indeed possible.
1644	10512	4	1	The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate to the reader that one must not remain obstinate in the face of failure. Although Saeng failed her driving examination, she intends to retake it in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus plant's budding phase. She interprets the plant's blossoming as an auspicious indication that she will ultimately succeed on her subsequent attempt.
1645	10513	4	1	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to demonstrate her resolve to flourish akin to the hibiscus and to reattempt the test with renewed determination to pass. The plant instills hope within Saeng, serving as a poignant reminder of her cherished homeland. As the hibiscus begins to bud and acquire beautiful flowers, Saeng will similarly ""blossom"" and obtain her license, thus completing her symbolic parallel with the plant."
1646	10514	4	1	The passage suggests the concept of summation, as it references the spring season, a period characterized by melting snow, the exclusive influence of the sun, the return of geese for hunting, and the budding hibiscus, culminating in the narrator's decision to retake the examination. Since the sequence commences in spring, the central element must necessarily be the sun during that season.
1647	10515	4	1	The author employs the concluding paragraph to illustrate how Saeng will retest in the spring; the diction and cadence convey to the reader that Saeng has attained tranquility and acceptance regarding her life in the United States. When Saeng observes the budding hibiscus, she reflects upon its connection to her native country. Furthermore, her declaration to retake the test constitutes a personal vow to do so once she feels established within her new nation. Saeng is essentially reconciling herself to her relocation, acknowledging she can preserve memories of her homeland through the new hibiscus and other elements.
1648	10517	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this specific paragraph for a deliberate purpose, potentially to establish a foundation for a sequel. This technique encourages reader engagement, inviting speculation about future developments and signaling that Saeng's renewal will coincide with the natural world's resurgence. Concluding in this manner is highly effective, as it communicates that Saeng will rejuvenate her life alongside the plants and geese, choosing perseverance over surrender. The author may be cultivating suspense, prompting the audience to contemplate Saeng's subsequent actions and the fulfillment of her pledge, thereby creating anticipation for a continuation of her story.
1649	10518	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's resolve to surmount challenges and adapt. The hibiscus mentioned in the final quotation symbolizes Saeng's nascent hope and determination for success in the United States. For instance, the text describes her intense, visceral shock of recognition upon discovering the flower, a plant that connects her Vietnamese past with her future. This hibiscus signifies hope within a seemingly impossible context; its blossoming预示着 an unfolding world and a new life. This realization provides the reader with certainty regarding Saeng's newfound stability and eventual success. Additionally, the tactile memory of the flower, feeling smooth and cool as anticipated, allows Saeng to access past memories, serving as profound inspiration. The author thus concludes with Saeng's recollection and hope to demonstrate she has discovered a supportive, stabilizing force in her new environment.
1650	10519	4	1	"The author concluded ""The Winter Hibiscus"" with her chosen paragraph to portray that despite Saeng's hardship in leaving her former home, she can discover a positive life with a new beginning. In the final paragraph, winter symbolizes past difficulties, while spring represents an optimistic future and renewal. Although Saeng grieved her loss, she found potential for happiness; the hibiscus, once known in her homeland and now discovered in her new location, serves as a tangible reminder and semblance of her past. The preceding quote regarding the familiar becoming strange and then familiar again through seasonal repetition indicates her acceptance and ability to appreciate life in this new home. The final statement about retaking the test when familiar elements return signifies that Saeng will possess the strength to pursue accomplishments for her new life."
1651	10520	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that assertion because it conveys the perpetual capacity for renewal and the imperative of perseverance in pursuing one's genuine aspirations. The protagonist earnestly desired to pass the examination and consequently endeavored with diligence, yet she ultimately failed. She comprehends that, analogous to the plant, spring will proffer a new commencement in life, and one can invariably alter undesirable aspects of the self. I firmly concur with this perspective, for without opportunities for redemption, most individuals would be deemed failures, since everyone commits errors throughout their lives and possesses the capacity to rectify them. This rationale underpins my belief regarding the author's concluding statement.
1652	10521	4	1	The narrative concludes with that paragraph because Saeng maintains the conviction that the subsequent spring, upon the blossoming of her new hibiscus, she will possess the requisite fortune to pass her driving examination. This constitutes an apt denouement for the story, given the hibiscus was absent from her life prior to the initial test. Presently, she holds the belief that during her next attempt, she will be fortified by a connection to her heritage, an enhanced ability to surmount challenges, and solace derived from past disappointment, all of which she perceives as instrumental to her success.
1653	10522	4	1	The author likely possessed multiple motivations for concluding the narrative with this paragraph. One probable reason is to elucidate the protagonist's personal evolution. Initially, the author portrays her as disheartened and distressed by her failure. The final paragraph, however, illustrates her triumph over this apprehension. Furthermore, the migratory geese mirror her own journey; Saeng and her family relocated to the United States, and while the geese may initially appear disoriented by their movement, they faithfully return each year. Similar to the flower, Saeng is distinctive within her new existence and must learn to adapt, as do the geese and the hibiscus. She recognizes that the flower will bloom and the geese will return in the spring, a cycle she must emulate by not surrendering but instead endeavoring again later. This demonstrates her adaptation and transformation to function within her new environment.
1654	10523	4	1	"In ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's resolve not merely to pass her driving examination, but to assimilate into her new homeland. The author employs the term ""vowed"" to impart a positive connotation within the paragraph. The observation that ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had previously perceived as strange had become... familiar,"" indicates her ongoing adaptation to a novel lifestyle. However, the author utilizes the final paragraph to suggest that she requires additional time to complete this transition."
1655	10524	4	1	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng pledged to herself that she would not fail the examination again. She sought to retain a connection to her past and homeland, which motivated her purchase of the flowers. Ultimately, she vows, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus buds, then I will take the test again."" She declares this because she is now prepared to progress and endeavor to acclimatize to her new home."
1656	10525	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to synthesize all thematic elements and demonstrate Saeng’s readiness for future challenges. The act of planting the flower signifies the culmination of the blossom’s symbolic importance, reflecting the protagonist’s emotional state, whether joyous or sorrowful. However, her vow to retake the examination signifies not only preparedness for what lies ahead but also an open-minded receptivity to new experiences, enabling her to recognize her personal growth. Consequently, the author employs this concluding paragraph to impart a sense of mystery regarding subsequent events while providing a definitive resolution.
1657	10526	4	1	The author concludes the narrative at this juncture because the onset of winter signifies the flowers' absence; however, the period of planting coincided with her maturation. As the text indicates, elements she once perceived as foreign are now becoming recognizable, and she is acclimating to her circumstances. This progression occurs because she is acquiring greater understanding and will consequently be prepared for the examination the following spring.
1658	10527	4	1	The author employs this passage as the story’s conclusion to signify that, one year hence, she will undertake the test of life once more, demonstrating resilience and a commitment to personal growth.
1659	10528	4	1	"A story’s conclusion fundamentally determines its ultimate meaning, providing final closure and creating a lasting impression for the reader. In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with an encouraging paragraph. This finale promotes perseverance, as it declares that Saeng will retake the test when the hibiscus blooms again. This illustrates encouragement through her determination to attempt and succeed. The author culminates with this inspiring sentiment to leave the reader motivated. This strong conclusion also appears to recapitulate the story’s significance, given that Saeng, despite repeated disappointments with the flower, her mother, and her homeland, is ultimately encouraged to progress and endeavor anew. The selected ending was profoundly meaningful, effectively conveying the author’s intended message."
1660	10529	4	1	In Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the protagonist experiences distress after relocating from her homeland, where the culture, customs, and cuisine are profoundly dissimilar. Consequently, she struggles to adapt to her new surroundings. The author crafts the concluding statement to illustrate her persistent resolve to achieve her objective. She intends to retake the examination to ascertain whether circumstances have evolved over time. The narrative is deeply emotive, expressing considerable sorrow that is ultimately transcended by the conclusion.
1661	10530	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with that particular paragraph concerning geese to illustrate Saeng's resolve to surmount her challenges. Profoundly disheartened by her examination failure, she sought solace in recollections of her homeland. She purchased a hibiscus, a flower ubiquitous in her native country, which evoked comfort and affection. However, it also symbolized her capacity to overcome adversity, and while planting the hibiscus and observing the geese in flight, she recognized the necessity of persevering.
1662	10531	4	1	The author conveys this because the protagonist intends to cultivate her own garden. Her previous gardening endeavor proved unsuccessful, as the text indicates she required her mother's assistance to manage it.
1663	10532	4	1	"The author concludes the paragraph as Saeng comprehends she can mourn her former home while simultaneously needing to acclimate to her new environment. Saeng laments the memories of her homeland, experiencing ""a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes."" Yet, she begins to perceive that not everything is altered; certain elements remain recognizable. ""Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, the faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now."" This realization that some things endure provides Saeng the fortitude to proceed with her new life."
1664	10533	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it provides a fitting resolution. The conclusion discusses Saeng's intention to return after the snow melts, at which time she will endeavor to retake the examination.
1665	10534	4	1	The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate that Saeng retains hope for succeeding and adapting within her new country. She previously suffered profound homesickness, longing for her grandmother and mementos from her childhood. The zenith of her distress is evident upon returning home, where she finds herself too emotionally fragile to describe the hibiscus. However, Saeng's attitude ultimately shifts from despair to hope; despite failing her driver's test, she resolves to try again, a significant personal transformation underscored by the final imagery of the geese.
1666	10537	4	1	I surmise he included this passage to convey that one should disregard the initial failure upon the snow's thaw. The geese's return signifies a subsequent opportunity, while the hibiscus budding represents transcending one's previous endeavors.
1667	10538	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the characters were discussing the cold climate or the weather and the @CAPS1; thus, it states that when the snow melts, it references the weather or the @CAPS1.
1668	10539	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to demonstrate the protagonist's transformation resulting from the story's events. Initially, we discover the main character failed her driving examination. Furthermore, she expended a considerable sum on a single plant, which astonished her mother. At that juncture, the reader would anticipate profound sadness, yet influenced by her grandmother and heritage, she subverts expectations by adopting an optimistic perspective, vowing to retake the test upon the flower's re-blooming. This illustrates the profound connection between the protagonist and the plant, thereby attributing to it a quasi-human essence.
1669	10540	4	1	I contend the author selected this concluding paragraph to encapsulate the story's overarching theme. The passage effectively summarizes the message of perseverance and surmounting adversity. Saeng, having emigrated, confronts challenges in both her horticultural and personal life. She was compelled to adapt to a new environment and persist in her ambitions. Her declaration to retake the test in spring, coinciding with the thaw, the geese's return, and the hibiscus's budding, genuinely exhibits her resolve and lack of trepidation toward future obstacles.
1670	10541	4	1	The author concluded the story thus because, rather than internalizing the distress, the protagonist can focus on future prospects. By directing her attention forward, she can relinquish the past and strive for improvement subsequently.
1671	10542	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this passage, wherein she describes ""a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,"" to signify that although the geese passed overhead with their heads held high, Saeng's was not. Her resolution, ""Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" conveys her intent to no longer remain despondent but to gradually cultivate appreciation for her new home. Regarding her hibiscus, she will cherish fond memories without succumbing to sorrow, embracing her future with resilience."
1672	10543	4	1	Two principal reasons explain the author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph. The first is that Saeng had quietly retrieved a Winter Hibiscus, symbolizing her determination to ultimately pass the driving examination. The second reason is her resolve to attempt the test once more, thereby achieving the ability to drive upon successfully passing it. These two rationales, while initially perplexing, elucidate the author's concluding thematic intentions.
1673	10544	4	1	The author likely concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the profound sense of longing Saeng felt upon observing the geese, thereby emphasizing her emotional connection to the symbolism of migration and freedom that they represent within the narrative's context.
1674	10545	4	1	"Numerous interpretive possibilities exist regarding the author's conclusion for her story, ""Winter Hibiscus."" The mother's observation, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here…"" regarding Saeng's unexpected purchase is echoed in the ending. Saeng's vow implicitly affirms her own strength to endure the metaphorical winter and subsequent challenges. Furthermore, the author notes Saeng's realization that ""many of the things she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar,"" indicating that while she profoundly misses her homeland, she will ultimately adapt and prevail in her new environment. Her pledge to retake the test in the spring subconsciously affirms her capacity to overcome adversity, requiring only the passage of time."
1675	10546	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng's declaration that she will retake the test in the spring is connected to her desire to walk home and observe the flower she discovered. The narrative recalls her childhood encounter with a similar bloom in her native country, yet her immediate objective is to pass the driving examination. Her disappointment is evident, compounded by the significant fee of over nineteen dollars for the test. Her mother's initial astonishment and brief admonishment were followed by comforting sympathy, which subsequently fostered Saeng's determination to try again."
1676	10547	4	1	"Minfong Ho, the author of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" concludes her narrative with Saeng contemplating the spring to imbue the character's future with a sense of optimism. Saeng appears despondent, persistently reminiscing about her past life in Vietnam. Upon encountering the Hibiscus and Jasmine, she ""broke down and wept,"" and the Jasmine's fragrance evokes a memory of her grandmother arranging her hair. Compounding Saeng's distress is her failure of the driving test, a significant disappointment for most adolescents. At this juncture, one feels profound sympathy for Saeng and questions whether her circumstances will improve, as she exists detached from all she knew and loved, possessing only memories and a winter hibiscus distinct from the variety in her native Vietnam. However, the final line reveals a sudden, burgeoning hope within Saeng for her future, anticipating the time ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."""
1677	10548	4	1	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" imparts a profound sense of hopefulness for the future. The protagonist, Saeng, having just failed her examination, is immersed in dejection. Through a sequence of events, her melancholy dissipates and is supplanted by optimism. Her declaration, ""Then I will take that test again,"" within the final sentence demonstrates Saeng's resolute determination. She was distressed about abandoning her homeland and about failing her test, yet, inspired by a flower, she recuperated her confidence. When an individual is disheartened, surrendering is facile. Until the final paragraph, the narrative tone is decidedly bleak. The author's inclusion of this conclusion functions as illumination at the terminus of a somber passage, conveying that even during arduous and seemingly insurmountable circumstances, something will inevitably elevate one's morale. A positive aspect can be found within a negative situation, provided one endeavors to seek it."
1678	10549	4	1	One might conjecture that it signifies the increased difficulty of cultivating a garden during winter or spring. Furthermore, it potentially represents a specific challenge to foster the garden's growth by that particular season. Consequently, one would infer that this is the intended meaning of the statement regarding the seasonal conditions and the associated horticultural endeavor.
1679	10550	4	1	The author incorporates that sentence at the story's conclusion because the narrative consistently illustrated resilience, which elucidates her emotional recovery and demonstrates the fortitude required to return and endeavor to pass that examination, refusing to be demoralized by her initial failure.
1680	10551	4	1	The rationale for the author concluding the story with this paragraph is multifaceted. Interpretively, it could signify a new beginning or a fresh start. For instance, the geese's departure and return symbolize the changing seasons. Therefore, this seasonal transition or renewal could metaphorically represent his opportunity to retake the test, indicating he will receive another chance to succeed.
1681	10552	4	1	I presume they believe it will bestow upon them good fortune.
1682	10553	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with this paragraph because it demonstrates that one can surmount adversity through sheer determination. Saeng initially failed her examination. She procured a plant evocative of her homeland. She cultivated it despite the unyielding, frigid soil. She recognized that the once unfamiliar elements had integrated into her daily existence. She resolved to attempt the test again. Saeng comprehended that an initial failure necessitates perseverance for one's convictions. She further acknowledged that while she would always remember her home, she could still progress. Ultimately, Saeng understood that positive outcomes can eclipse negative ones. Following her failure, she purchased the blossom. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it encapsulates the narrative perfectly.
1683	10554	4	1	The author includes the excerpt at the end for a profoundly meaningful reason concerning Saeng. The hibiscus symbolizes everything: her home, her past, and her solace. Saeng perceives that if the flower can flourish, so too can she, which will facilitate her acclimation to her new environment and her decision to retake the examination. It also embodies hope, for if the plant can endure the winter and blossom in the spring, she possesses the same capacity. The author employed this to connect Saeng's emotional state with the tangible reality of the flower's potential to bloom.
1684	10555	4	1	The author concludes with that statement because the geese migrate south for the winter and return in the spring; similarly, Saeng failed her test during winter but will retake it with the arrival of spring. As Saeng fails her driving test and encounters the familiar plant, it signifies her intention to return and attempt the test again. The geese have departed but will return when the season changes. Thus, both the geese and Saeng possess a rationale for returning north or retaking the examination. The author adds the concluding statement because the geese's cyclical actions mirror Saeng's own resolve.
1685	10556	4	1	The author concludes this story with the paragraph to illustrate Saeng's unwavering resolve not to capitulate. Throughout the narrative, she had been experiencing profound despondency, from failing her examination to longing for Vietnam. Numerous elements within her and her mother's new surroundings evoke memories of her homeland. The poignant recollection of her grandmother, which rendered her deeply emotional, underscores how pervasively her past permeates her present. The author concluded in this manner to reveal how the cumulative weight of these experiences ultimately shaped her determination.
1686	10557	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to evoke a profound sense of resolve. Saeng acquired the plant as a memento of her homeland and a source of solace. Upon its blossoming, she envisions her own parallel flourishing, thereby attaining the fortitude necessary for her examination.
1687	10558	4	1	The author culminates the passage with a potent declaration: “When the geese return… in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” This assertion embodies themes of renewal and perseverance. Its inclusion suggests that after recognizing the plant's cyclical resilience, even amidst severe conditions, she ascertained her own analogous capacity. She pledged that with the season's return, she would be prepared to rejuvenate her efforts and resume her path, thereby conveying persistence. The plant does not perish each season; it is hardy and regenerates. Should the girl demonstrate similar tenacity by retaking the test, she will epitomize persistence. She aspires to emulate the flower, perceiving it as indomitable, renewable, and beautiful, traits it retains irrespective of its environment.
1688	10559	4	1	The author's rationale for this conclusion is to communicate to the reader that Saeng will not capitulate after an initial failure. She is determined to succeed, both to garner her mother's pride and to validate her own earnest efforts. The narrative affirms that Saeng will retake the examination in the spring, coinciding with the melting snow, the geese's return, and the hibiscus's budding. The hibiscus was not merely a narrative device but a pivotal element in her life, facilitating her progression by illustrating how entities evolve, develop, and adapt over time. While her mother was disappointed, she comprehended the plant's significance. It provided Saeng comfort as she navigated the disorienting circumstances of missing her test and adapting to an unfamiliar environment, compelling her to adjust to her new reality.
1689	10560	4	1	The author concludes with that specific paragraph to signify that Saeng's failure is not terminal; with the annual cycle's return, she will have another opportunity to pass the test. This interpretation is supported by the text's emphasis on the plant's cost, which exceeded that of all the vegetable seeds in the garden, underscoring its symbolic value and justifying the concluding focus.
1690	10561	4	1	The subsequent year, when the seasonal cycle returns and planting recommences, she will be prepared and intends to perform with significantly greater proficiency.
1691	10562	4	1	"The author incorporated these details to illustrate the winter setting, wherein the flower was poised to blossom and the geese were migrating due to the cold climate. Furthermore, the author’s choice aligns with the story’s title, ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" which inherently suggests a bloom in winter, thereby justifying the narrative elements presented."
1692	10563	4	1	"The author of ""The Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative by stating that Saeng will return to take her driver’s test when her hibiscus’s first bud emerges in spring. This conclusion may prompt the reader to consider whether she would proceed if the plant were to perish, thereby encouraging deeper contemplation. Ultimately, the author likely intended to create a degree of suspense with this ambiguous ending."
1693	10564	4	1	The story concludes with that line because Saeng derives fortitude from the hibiscus, ensuring she will not fail the test subsequently. During the hibiscus's growth period, she will undergo personal development, thus preparing herself for the examination. The narrative notes, “Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world” (Ho). Saeng experienced a nurturing childhood filled with love and support. Re-encountering these plants, particularly the hibiscus, allows her to draw strength from associated memories. However, the memories evoked by the hibiscus are also profoundly sorrowful; the story states, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her” (Ho). Confronting this sorrow will ultimately strengthen her resolve. Additionally, other sensory experiences will contribute to her readiness. The text describes, “It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center – just as she had known it would feel” (Ho). The tactile sensation of the hibiscus reminds Saeng of distant recollections, such as assisting her grandmother with her hair. Collectively, these experiences will empower Saeng, ensuring her success upon retaking the test.
1694	10565	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify that in the spring, once the snow has melted, she will undertake the test again, symbolizing renewal and a fresh start.
1695	10566	4	1	The provided quotation indicates that Saeng is relieved to have returned. She further declares that she would be prepared to undertake the endeavor again if necessary, demonstrating her resilience and determination.
1696	10567	4	1	I posit that the author concluded the narrative in such a manner due to the inclement weather. Furthermore, the author's implication is that the character composed the letter during a period of cold, resolving not to retake the examination until warmer conditions returned, as articulated: “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again.”
1697	10568	4	1	The author articulates Saeng’s vow, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” for several reasons. Primarily, the protagonist abandoned her previous existence to immigrate and cannot permit herself to fail. She lamented the absence of familiar elements, questioning, “But where was the fine-foothed come? the hibiscus hedge?” This reference is poignant because the hedge constituted a sole tangible connection to her homeland, alongside her mother; the budding hibiscus symbolizes a nascent life and growth, mirroring the girl's own progression and adaptation to her new circumstances.
1698	10569	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that a subsequent attempt, informed by prior experience, holds greater potential for success. Moreover, should the endeavor prove sufficiently profitable, it could generate revenue, thereby incentivizing its continuation for the foreseeable future and establishing a sustainable, long-term practice.
1699	10570	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng’s resolution to demonstrate her resilience and determination. The allusion to spring blossoms signifies her commitment to persevere through hardships, symbolized by winter. Analogous to the hibiscus struggling to acclimate to a new environment, Saeng grapples with adapting to a foreign country; the final paragraph resolves her internal conflict by suggesting her eventual success on the examination. In summation, the concluding passage provides a resolution to the story's central conflict and effectively conveys Saeng’s steadfast resolve to the reader.
1700	10571	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to reveal Saeng’s future actions and her academic intentions. Saeng deferred schooling until the snow melted, the geese returned, and the hibiscus budded, indicating a preference for horticulture over formal education, as gardening evokes memories of her homeland. For instance, Saeng excavated a hole and meticulously planted the winter hibiscus. Sensory details, such as the sound of eggs beating, the sizzle of hot oil, and the pungent aroma of bitter melon, triggered her recollections. Another instance finds her digging in the vegetable patch, a action that underscores her profound care for the garden.
1701	10572	4	1	The author concludes her narrative with the quotation, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to illustrate that nature and the plant hold significant value for her. Saeng, who articulates this vow, maintains a belief that the hibiscus will facilitate her success on the examination. Earlier in the story, a pattern is established wherein she rubs the plant’s leaves when confronting adversity, a gesture that assists her in overcoming challenges. The author thereby clarifies and portrays the concept that the plant provides Saeng with support against obstacles.
1702	10573	4	1	The narrative concludes with Saeng vowing to retake the driver’s test the following year. A primary reason for her resolution is to demonstrate her capability to ultimately pass the examination. Furthermore, the flower, after its purchase and planting, and following her recollection of fond memories from Vietnam, instilled in her the requisite confidence to pursue her objectives.
1703	10574	4	1	The author incorporates this paragraph to employ sarcasm, indicating the near impossibility of Saeng retaking the examination. This assertion is supported by the sarcastic tone, which signifies her refusal to undergo the test again. For instance, if an individual were instructed to take a test and responded by saying they would do so only when a highly improbable event occurs, that would constitute sarcasm, meaning it will not happen, rather than a simple refusal. The author included this to convey the exceedingly low probability of her attempting the test again.
1704	10575	4	1	The author includes this paragraph to provide a conclusion to the narrative and to demonstrate that Saeng has not relinquished her efforts. He intended to illustrate how the plant and the geese symbolize the continuation of Saeng's life within the United States. The geese will return, the hibiscus will bud and flourish, and Saeng will retake and, hopefully, pass her driving test. This paragraph functions not merely as an ending but as a new beginning for the geese, the winter hibiscus, and for Saeng herself.
1705	10576	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey resilience and encouragement. When she feels prepared and capable, she will retake the test with greater assurance. Saeng makes this silent vow to sustain herself until she can drive. She is asserting that by the following spring, she will have undertaken her test. By next spring, she will possess the ability to drive and will have acclimated to her new environment. This passage communicates that achievement requires time and persistence, as success is not always immediate.
1706	10577	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because Saeng was disheartened after failing her driving test; however, upon discovering the flowers, she recognized that upon arriving in @CAPS1 she had largely forgotten her hometown. Consequently, she resolved to reconnect with nature and postpone retaking the examination until spring, thereby avoiding undue haste.
1707	10578	4	1	I contend that the author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to illustrate her enduring hope for discovering a sense of home and achieving contentment. The hibiscus plant symbolizes her homeland and cherished memories of her grandmother. Therefore, when the plant buds, she will experience a feeling of being at home and happiness, which is the moment she intends to take the driving test. Furthermore, the paragraph demonstrates her gradual acclimation to her new home and lifestyle, as evidenced by the geese whose calls have become familiar. Through these examples, I believe the narrator included the final paragraph to reveal Saeng's assimilation into her new lifestyle and her acceptance of her circumstances.
1708	10579	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has not relinquished her intention to retake the examination. For instance, her declaration, “I will take the test again,” demonstrates her resolve to succeed. Saeng plans to wait until spring arrives and the snow melts before attempting the test once more. The narrative, which initially introduced the test, thus concludes with her commitment to retake it, thereby completing this narrative arc.
1709	10580	4	1	"In the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, reveals Saeng’s silent vow: “when they come back… then I will take the test again.” The author employs this conclusion to convey the hope inherent in Saeng's future. After failing her driver's test, Saeng returns home disheartened, yet this final paragraph indicates an impending positive change. The reader is left with the implication that Saeng will ultimately pass her test. Moreover, this concluding section reflects Saeng's determined character in overcoming the obstacles she faces in @CAPS1. It confirms her perseverance, even after being displaced from her homeland, and her successful adaptation is evidenced by her realization that formerly strange things have become familiar, underscoring her resolute nature."
1710	10581	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph for a specific reason. The story fundamentally concerns the girl's longing for her homeland. This final passage suggests that she will have adapted to her new country by the following @DATE1. Both the story and this paragraph demonstrate the girl's fortitude in overcoming adversity, which is the rationale for the author's chosen conclusion.
1711	10582	4	1	The author conveys to the reader that the protagonist intends to repeat the same process next year, once the snow has vanished, the geese have returned, and the climate is sufficiently temperate for the hibiscus to blossom again! The author @MONTH1 thereby concludes the narrative to demonstrate that this existence is the one the young protagonist has chosen, and she will persist with her nascent horticultural endeavors until the subsequent spring arrives.
1712	10584	4	1	Saeng concluded the narrative with that paragraph because it illustrates her recent experiences and her conviction that she could endure them once more. Should she fail the driving examination again, she would utilize the plants to surmount her difficulties. She @MONTH1 did indeed pass the test this time. The distinctive flora demonstrate that she is more resilient than she presumed and now believes, as she feels reassured by the plants that evoke memories of her youth.
1713	10585	4	1	She demonstrates profound affection for her grandmother and a genuine appreciation for their shared activities, such as gardening. Her mother exhibits concern for her well-being, yet maintains a notably strict demeanor toward her.
1714	10586	4	1	The author concluded the story in a manner that enlightens the reader. It demonstrates that regardless of what @MONTH1 may occur, how dire circumstances appear, or how hopeless one feels, a solution always exists. Saeng failed her examination, resided in a foreign country, and had lost her grandmother, yet she still resolved to attempt once more. Like the waves upon the shore, which perpetually return to erode the sand, Saeng possesses the determination to try again, as we all should.
1715	10587	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph to signify the conclusion of one season and the commencement of another.
1716	10588	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng’s vow: “when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This statement signifies that once the flower buds, she will retake the examination because she will possess the requisite courage and determination, confident in her success. The hibiscus embodies a symbolic entity that provides her with motivation and resolve. Every individual possesses something that galvanizes them to persevere in life, and for Saeng, it is her plant. The author also provides direction and implies the story’s trajectory through the flower's budding.
1717	10589	4	1	Saeng is not merely disappointed by failing her driver’s test; she is also disheartened and nostalgic for her native Vietnam. While walking home, she discovers a small fragment of Vietnam situated within the United States. She purchases the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to serve as a memento of her past. The story’s conclusion merges the two distinct countries, cultures, and virtually separate worlds comprising her life. Her statement, “when they come back,” refers to the geese, which symbolize her existence in her new environment and her gradual acclimatization to it. The hibiscus also functions as a symbol of her life and history in Vietnam, evoking memories; acquiring that plant was akin to obtaining a small piece of her homeland. She will attempt the test again once the “hibiscus is budding.” When this fragment of home flourishes, and she feels more established within the new culture while retaining a firm grasp of her own, she will be prepared to proceed.
1718	10590	4	1	It is evident that the author concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng is not a individual who surrenders easily. Saeng eagerly anticipates the return of the hibiscus. When the hibiscus blossoms again, she will retake the examination and demonstrate to her mother that she is capable of succeeding, thereby affirming her resilience and determination.
1719	10591	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because upon seeing the geese, Saeng realizes that with the return of spring, she will be prepared to seek out different flowers. She reminisces about her homeland, where she witnessed flowers emerging from the ground. Although she now resides in a city, she believes the flowers will blossom as beautifully as those she profoundly misses from home. Furthermore, she personifies the flowers as her companions. She also recalls the “Madagascar periwinkle” growing wild from cracks in brick walls and tiled roofs. Essentially, the author indicates her readiness to rediscover other botanical specimens remembered from her native land, symbolizing a reconnection with her past.
1720	10592	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes with this paragraph to illustrate a development in Saeng’s character. Initially, Saeng is dejected by her failure on the driver’s test. However, this final passage portrays her transformation. The text establishes that Saeng struggled to adapt from Vietnam to her new environment, finding solace in a native Vietnamese flower, the winter hibiscus. By referencing the hibiscus budding in the conclusion, the author depicts Saeng’s altered attitude and her acceptance of her new surroundings. Saeng now believes that, akin to the hibiscus re-emerging after winter, she can return and pass the test. Furthermore, the paragraph demonstrates Saeng’s adaptation to the local fauna; previously unexposed to Canada geese, her mention of their return signifies her adjustment. This illustrates Saeng’s development and integration into her new milieu. Whereas she initially found it difficult to leave Vietnam and embrace the new culture, this concluding passage summarizes her significant personal change, thereby highlighting the character's evolution.
1721	10593	4	1	They conclude the narrative thusly because the winter has concluded and spring has arrived, promising a return to beauty.
1722	10594	4	1	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s silent vow to retake the examination in the spring, as the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This signifies her anticipated acclimatization. For instance, the author observes, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things she had previously perceived as strange had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This indicates her belief that, with time, she will grow more accustomed to driving and subsequently retake the test, which she will then pass.
1723	10595	4	1	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” chose this conclusion to integrate the theme of new beginnings. Saeng, newly arrived in her location, has struggled to adapt, missing her grandmother and the flora of her homeland. Failing her driving test compounded her despair, yet the hibiscus plant revealed the possibility of a second chance. The hibiscus, surviving winter to bloom in spring, symbolizes Saeng’s own potential for renewal. The final paragraph, stating, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” aligns this season of geese returning and flowers blooming with Saeng’s personal resolve for a new beginning, thereby concluding the narrative by illustrating her inspired realization.
1724	10596	4	1	The author concludes with this paragraph to underscore Saeng’s profound desire to pass the examination. This is evident when the text states, “And in the warm, moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept,” a passage revealing her devastation. Upon arriving home with the potted bud, her mother noticed her distress and intended to plant it, but Saeng took the shovel and performed the task herself, thereby realizing she could attempt the test again.
1725	10597	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. Primarily, the hibiscus budding in spring signifies the plant’s imminent flowering, paralleling Saeng’s own readiness to retake the test. Furthermore, the paragraph’s placement at the narrative’s end reinforces the theme that if the plant can endure, then the girl can likewise pass her driving test and achieve happiness.

1731	10603	4	1	The author concluded the narrative for an internal adjustment. Saeng's recollections are conveyed through the individual at the hibiscus. Spring constitutes a season of renewal and freshness. With the arrival of spring, Saeng's hope is restored and flourishes, as the budding hibiscus empowers her to attempt the examination again with augmented fortitude and inspiration.
1732	10604	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with Saeng, the protagonist, resolving to undertake the driving examination in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus's bloom. This demonstrates to the reader that Saeng's determination will persist beyond the story's conclusion. The author incorporates the imagery of the flowering hibiscus because it symbolizes resilience for Saeng. This flower, prevalent in her homeland, evokes memories of all she relinquished upon emigrating from Vietnam to her new location. Saeng is endeavoring to acclimate to her new lifestyle, utilizing the hibiscus as a mechanism to navigate her more challenging periods. Subsequent to purchasing the plant, she vows to retake the failed examination after spring's arrival. Spring itself represents a new beginning. Saeng perceives that if the hibiscus can endure the winter in her new environment, she possesses the same capacity. The story's denouement employs considerable imagery to suggest Saeng's enduring strength and her continued life in this new locale."
1733	10605	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because Saeng failed her test and subsequently learned to appreciate nature more profoundly.
1734	10606	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify Saeng's anticipated return to the flowers with the arrival of spring.
1735	10607	4	1	The author articulates this idea to convey that perseverance is essential following an initial setback. Primarily, if one fails an examination on the first attempt, a subsequent effort often yields success. For instance, the narrative depicts Saeng failing a test, yet she is afforded another opportunity to demonstrate her capability. Secondly, she could solicit assistance or consult instructional materials for study. Diligent study, for example, facilitates a significantly easier passage. This constitutes the intended meaning of the statement.
1736	10608	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because it signifies the cyclical commencement and conclusion of each year.
1737	10609	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that Saeng has been consoled by the hibiscus and is resolved to reattempt the examination. She has adopted a more receptive perspective regarding her circumstances. Initially, Saeng was distressed and aggravated by her failure; for instance, her ""tearstained cheeks and puffy eyes"" and her declaration, ""I failed the test,"" demonstrate her profound disappointment. The author likely intended to avoid a despondent, unsatisfactory conclusion. Saeng's attitude transforms by the story's end, as evidenced by her silent vow: ""when they come back... I will take the test again."" This shift in disposition stems from the soothing memories of her homeland and her mother's influence. Ultimately, the author concludes thusly to impart the lesson that one must permit change to transpire and acknowledge that time facilitates healing."
1738	10610	4	1	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with this motivational paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination to adapt to her new environment and surmount common obstacles, such as a driver's examination. Struggling to cope, Saeng procured a hibiscus plant for its nostalgic connection to her homeland. The line, ""and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" functions symbolically, representing maturation and the act of overcoming adversity. This concluding passage provides a fitting and resonant resolution to the narrative."
1739	10611	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the return of spring, marked by melting snow and geese, will coincide with her renewed self-assurance for undertaking and passing the examination. Following her initial failure, the geese had departed; their subsequent return will therefore serve as a reminder of that past event. Concurrently, the spring season will prompt the hibiscus to blossom once more.
1740	10612	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the spring's return heralds renewed hope, comfort, and belief, as Saeng declares, ""in the spring... I will take that test again."" The returning hibiscus embodies this hope. Furthermore, her statement, ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" signifies a profound comfort, strengthened by her mother's encouragement, which is crucial for her resolve. Finally, her observation that the Canada geese's honks have become ""familiar"" indicates that through seasonal repetition, the once-strange has become almost customary. She will thus regain the necessary belief and fortitude for the test; the hibiscus symbolizes her hope, comfort, and conviction."
1741	10613	4	1	"Following her unsuccessful driving test, Saeng finds solace in discovering the hibiscus flower, which evokes cherished memories of her homeland, as it closely resembles the flora near her former residence. The narrative concludes with Saeng's silent vow: ""When they come back, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" a statement that draws a parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus. Both must endeavor to adapt to a new environment. The author demonstrates that Saeng perceives this connection and derives inspiration from it. In her perspective, if the hibiscus can endure transplantation, then she possesses the same capacity for resilience."
1742	10614	4	1	"The narrative of ""Winter Hibiscus"" constitutes an extended metaphor for connections to a consoling past and the anticipation of the future. Saeng yearns for her homeland, yet she must acclimate to her present circumstances and ultimately pass her driving examination. The story concludes effectively with Saeng's personal resolution to retake the test in the spring. The hibiscus itself inspires this pledge, providing her with a degree of closure and mitigating her homesickness. Saeng's promise signifies her acceptance of her situation. Observing the Canada geese in flight, she experiences a partial epiphany regarding the seasonal cycle. ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become... almost familiar to her now."" This realization represents a significant milestone for Saeng, and the conclusion illustrates her capacity for adaptation."
1743	10615	4	1	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, Saeng experiences a profound emotional connection to the memories evoked by the hibiscus. At one juncture, she weeps in mourning for her grandmother, as the plant elicits poignant recollections. Subsequently, she presents the plant to her mother. Initially, her mother is distressed, but she ultimately demonstrates comprehension of her daughter's sentiments and actions. Saeng is disheartened by her test failure, a feeling her mother acknowledges. The author likely concludes the story in this manner to illustrate that the hibiscus, being profoundly significant to Saeng and a reminder of her heritage, provides her with the necessary reason and motivation to persevere and achieve her objective of passing."
1744	10616	4	1	As winter approaches, the geese migrate southward and the plants shed their foliage. Saeng declares her intention to retake the examination. It appears that the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus will instill in her a sense of hope and confidence. The hibiscus is particularly significant, as it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother; her initial encounter with it, holding its leaf, brought her to tears. Its resurgence the following year will therefore rejuvenate her spirit and resolve.
1745	10617	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this particular paragraph because she believes it provides a comprehensive and fitting explanation for Saeng's subsequent actions and emotional resolution.
1746	10618	4	1	The author concludes her narrative with that final paragraph because it illustrates the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, and the profound resonance of merely observing it. It also demonstrates that the hibiscus motivates her, as it evokes her cherished homeland, functioning as a tangible memento of her native land.
1747	10619	4	1	The author draws a parallel, suggesting that when the geese are prepared, they will return, and when the flower is ready, it will bud and grow. The implication is that she, too, will take the test when she is ready. She articulates her need for time, analogous to the geese and the flowers. Consequently, one can compare Saeng to both the geese and the hibiscus, as they similarly require time to fulfill their inherent purposes. In this manner, Saeng has fundamentally assimilated with both entities.
1748	10620	4	1	The author likely concludes with this sentence because it symbolizes the girl's perception. She implies that the returning geese and the budding hibiscus signify the return of warmer weather, which elevates her spirits by reminding her of her homeland. This recollection would presumably facilitate taking the test, as her heightened happiness would enhance her performance. For instance, the author stated the flower provides comfort, and such comfort is arguably the optimal state for succeeding on the test. Ultimately, the author likely ended the story this way to ensure readers comprehend the connection between the girl, her homeland, and the solace the flower provides.
1749	10621	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph because it constitutes a compelling final passage that possesses significant thematic relevance to the story.
1750	10622	4	1	The author likely concludes the story with that aphorism because it demonstrates her adaptation to the new environment. It further reveals her resilience and refusal to surrender, mirroring the geese's persistent migration every winter and spring.
1751	10623	4	1	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng resolves to retake her failed driver's test in the spring. She is motivated by the temperate spring climate, which provides her with a sense of solace. This environment evokes memories of her homeland, for which Saeng possesses a profound attachment. It evokes reflections on all the places I have visited and the enduring memory of my favorite one. Similar to Saeng, I acquire objects that serve as mementos of my former residence; Saeng's dedication to her origins mitigates my sense of alienation when I experience nostalgia for my own previous home."
1752	10624	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that particular paragraph to signify Saeng's resolve to recommence and improve her performance on the subsequent attempt, driven by a desire to avoid personal failure. This thematic resolution is precisely why the author selected this paragraph for the story's denouement.
1753	10625	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate a theme of renewal. The arrival of spring heralds a period of rejuvenation, during which flora reemerge, fauna reappear, and sunlight intensifies. This seasonal renaissance serves as a metaphor for her own new beginning. She is afforded an opportunity to reattempt her endeavors because the circumstances provide a second chance. A further rationale for this conclusion is Saeng's affinity for nature; perhaps its resurgence in her surroundings will instill the hope and self-assurance required to succeed in her test.
1754	10626	4	1	"The story's concluding paragraph states: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I believe the author chose this paragraph to demonstrate her process of adaptation and her burgeoning acceptance of change. This interpretation is supported by her evident distress and resistance to change throughout the narrative, exemplified by the line: ""And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept."" The final paragraph's optimistic tone, referencing the budding flower and returning geese, suggests she is beginning to accept her new circumstances. In my view, the author incorporated this paragraph to conclude the story by illustrating Saeng's movement toward acceptance and optimism."
1755	10627	4	1	Saeng informed her mother of her test failure. She subsequently sought to compensate for this setback by assisting in the garden. Her mother then ushered her inside and commenced preparing the evening meal.
1756	10628	4	1	"The author concludes that upon the geese's return, she will undertake the examination, believing she will be better prepared and that it will be less demanding in the spring. This will afford her additional time for learning and studying, and she hopes her concentration will improve, no longer preoccupied with thoughts of home. She feels considerable remorse, as though she disappointed her mother by failing; ""I just stared at the hibiscus"" indicates she felt too ashamed to meet her mother's gaze. Consequently, next spring she intends to bring her mother happiness and succeed, as she will be adequately prepared."
1757	10629	4	1	The author selected this paragraph because it signifies that when the snow melts and the geese have all returned, the flowers blossom. That particular flower was the one upon which she had to be examined.
1758	10630	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the chosen paragraph to convey a message of perseverance. She communicates this theme by demonstrating her realization that she will ultimately be prepared. The line ""… Slowly fading into the distance"" could signify her acceptance that events transpire as they will, and one must never cease pursuing a desired objective. An additional reason she may have employed this conclusion is to illustrate that even in moments of despair, one possesses friends and family for support. The line ""… Through the quiet repetition of season upon season"" essentially conveyed that she merely required establishment of a routine to achieve her goal."
1759	10631	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this sentence to establish a parallel between the flowers and her test. Ending in this manner demonstrates her commitment to persist season after season, akin to the geese's annual return. Her persistent efforts reveal her refusal to surrender, indicating she will continue attempting year after year. Furthermore, it illustrates the girl's determination and her resolve to persist until she succeeds. This final paragraph also encapsulates the story's essence and, ultimately, provides a resonant tone for the entire narrative.
1760	10632	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to provide the reader with material for contemplation. When an author concludes in such a manner, the intention is for the reader to formulate their own interpretation or prediction, and sometimes it implies a potential sequel to the narrative.
1761	10633	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to provide a resolution characterized by optimism, as the protagonist demonstrates resilience by deciding to retake the examination. Furthermore, she is motivated by a desire to avoid disappointing her mother, aspiring instead to bring her happiness and to grant the assessment a subsequent opportunity.
1762	10634	4	1	"The author concludes with this statement to signify her readiness to embrace spring in the new nation, now that the hibiscus provides solace. The test symbolizes adapting to the unfamiliar country, which she initially failed, believing her reliance on native flora for comfort was a shortcoming. However, she is confident of succeeding next year, as each seasonal cycle affords her greater cultural acclimatization. Her declaration, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" utilizes these natural signs to mark a new beginning, thereby facilitating her acceptance of the ongoing transition."
1763	10635	4	1	She comprehended that phenomena are transient yet subject to alteration. During specific seasons, her environment underwent transformations over which she exerted no influence. Additionally, she confronted the challenges of residing in a foreign nation. This new existence proved arduous for Saeng; she encountered unfamiliar cuisine, strange sounds, and novel sights. Failing her driving examination was a significant setback. The difficulty of navigating an unknown language and an incomprehensible milieu was taxing, as her surroundings were profoundly unaccustomed. She recognized the necessity of personal transformation and increased diligence to achieve her objectives.
1764	10636	4	1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph to convey to readers the protagonist's unwavering determination. Throughout the narrative, she appeared to entertain thoughts of surrender, yet memories of her homeland provided consolation during moments of potential capitulation. However, the final paragraph definitively confirms her refusal to relinquish her efforts.
1765	10637	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative in this manner because the flower bestowed good fortune upon her, as during the initial attempt she was unaware of its presence.
1766	10638	4	1	"It appears that the individual expressing this sentiment must have been enduring considerable hardship, experiencing a sense of being profoundly tested. Perhaps someone she deeply loved departed, as suggested by the phrase ""when they come back,"" indicating that this person may have left. The rationale for inferring she felt tested originates from the declaration, ""I will take the test again."""
1767	10639	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate her persistent discomfort. For instance, her emotional collapse in the flower shop demonstrates that while certain stimuli may evoke memories of home, the experience is not equivalent. One must gradually adapt and become accustomed to a new environment. This further suggests that, given sufficient time to acclimate, she believes she will ultimately succeed in passing the test.
1768	10640	4	1	"The author employs this conclusion with deliberate intent. The purpose of this cliffhanger is to sustain the reader's engagement and cultivate a desire for further narrative development. By stating, ""I will take that test again,"" the author prompts the reader to question whether Saeng will subsequently pass and to speculate upon the nature of ""the test"" itself."
1769	10641	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she likely wishes for the snow to remain, thereby preventing the geese's return. Furthermore, it serves to illuminate Saeng's internal reflections for the reader, providing insight into her contemplative state and concluding the narrative arc.
1770	10642	4	1	The author had a specific rationale for concluding the story with that particular quote: to demonstrate how the plant instilled in Saeng a renewed sense of determination. Previously distraught and dismantling the plant, she appeared to recognize its capacity to bud and survive against formidable odds. Consequently, she resolved to confront her own challenges with equal tenacity and retake the examination she had failed.
