1	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her emotional transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding resilience and hope for the future. This final paragraph signifies that Saeng has begun to reconcile her past in Vietnam with her present life in the United States, choosing to persevere rather than surrender to grief. Throughout the story, Saeng is confronted by a deep sense of displacement and nostalgia. Failing her driver's test is not just a personal failure but a symbol of her struggles to adapt to a new culture. Her visit to the greenhouse triggers a flood of memories from her childhood in Laos, making her acutely aware of everything she has lost—her grandmother, the hibiscus hedge, and her former home. This wave of loss causes her to break down and weep, overwhelmed by the feeling that her past is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” However, her mother’s reaction to the purchased hibiscus provides a crucial shift in perspective. Instead of anger over the cost, Mrs. Panouvong focuses on the plant’s symbolic value, calling it a ""winter hibiscus."" She points out that while its flowers are not as pretty as the ones from home, it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters.” This teaches Saeng a lesson in resilience; the plant, like their family, must adapt and endure in a new, harsher environment. The act of planting the hibiscus together in the cold, hard soil is a physical manifestation of putting down new roots and choosing to grow despite the challenges. Furthermore, Saeng’s observations just before her vow show her growing familiarity with her new home. She notes that the pungent smell of bitter melon cooking is a “cultivated taste” she prefers to a Big Mac, and the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, is now “familiar.” These details show her slowly integrating her old life with the new, finding comfort and identity in the blend of both cultures. By connecting her personal goal of retaking the test to the natural cycles of spring, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding, Saeng aligns her own growth with the rebirth of the world around her. The conclusion therefore reveals that Saeng is no longer paralyzed by her past but is instead looking forward, using the strength of the “winter hibiscus” as an inspiration to try again."
2	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s transformation from being overwhelmed by grief to finding a renewed sense of hope and determination. This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life in the United States and her decision to move forward, rooted in the resilience she has learned from her mother and the ""winter hibiscus"" itself. Throughout the story, Saeng is consumed by a profound sense of loss for her childhood in Laos. The sight of the hibiscus in the greenhouse triggers a ""shock of recognition"" that is ""almost visceral,"" plunging her into memories of her grandmother and her former home. This wave of nostalgia is so powerful that she breaks down and weeps, feeling that her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her failure of the driver's test amplifies this feeling of alienation and inadequacy in her new country. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is pivotal. Instead of focusing on the cost or the failed test, Mrs. Panouvong focuses on the plant's strength, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of endurance. By planting the hibiscus in their garden, Saeng and her mother perform an act of putting down roots, both literally and metaphorically. As she works, Saeng notices that things she once found strange, like the honking of Canada geese, have become ""familiar."" She even admits to preferring the bitter melon her mother cooks to a Big Mac, showing her growing connection to her new hybrid identity. The hibiscus, now planted in the cold, hard ground, becomes a living testament to this adaptability. Therefore, the concluding paragraph solidifies this theme. Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring directly links her personal growth to the natural cycles of her new environment. Just as the hibiscus will bud again after winter, and the geese will return, Saeng gives herself time to gather strength. She is no longer fleeing her past or despairing about her future but is instead integrating both into a resilient whole. The ending affirms that hope and the courage to try again are the true blossoms of the winter hibiscus."

However, her mother’s reaction to the plant—acknowledging its differences but appreciating its strength to survive the winter—mirrors Saeng’s own journey. The ""winter hibiscus"" becomes a metaphor for adaptation, showing that while it may not be the same as the hibiscus from Vietnam, it can still thrive in its new environment. The final paragraph reinforces this theme of hope and perseverance. Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, signifies her determination to try again despite her initial failure. The geese, once strange to her, now feel familiar, mirroring her growing comfort in her new home. By linking her resolve to the natural cycles of migration and growth, the author highlights Saeng’s emotional growth. She is no longer paralyzed by grief but instead finds strength in the promise of renewal, both in nature and in herself. The ending thus leaves readers with a sense of optimism, showing that Saeng is learning to navigate her dual identity—honoring her past while embracing her future."

This final paragraph connects her personal growth to the natural cycles she is learning to understand, symbolizing resilience and the possibility of new beginnings. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss for her homeland and her former life. Failing her driver's test is a painful reminder of her struggles to adapt, and her visit to the greenhouse triggers a powerful wave of grief for the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her childhood, causing her to weep. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive hibiscus plant is a turning point. Instead of anger, her mother shows understanding, calling the plant a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This reframes the plant not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of survival and endurance in a new, harsher environment. This new perspective allows Saeng to see her own situation differently. As she plants the hibiscus, she notices that the honks of the Canada geese are now ""familiar,"" realizing that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar."" This shows she is slowly putting down roots and adapting, just like the winter hibiscus. The cyclical imagery of the melting snow and returning geese promises renewal. By vowing to retake the test when the hibiscus buds, Saeng aligns her personal goal with this natural cycle, demonstrating that she has found the perseverance to try again. The conclusion thus highlights the story's central theme: while the past is gone, one can still grow and flourish in a new world by finding strength in resilience and hope."
28	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it signifies her acceptance of her new life and her renewed sense of hope. This final paragraph resolves her inner conflict between clinging to the past and embracing the future. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a deep sense of loss for her childhood in Vietnam, triggered by her failure and the plants in the greenhouse. The hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle unleash a flood of visceral memories, culminating in her breaking down and weeping for a world that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” However, her mother helps her reframe her perspective. By calling the plant a “winter hibiscus,” Mrs. Panouvong points out that while it is different from the one they had at home, it is strong enough to survive the cold. This teaches Saeng that resilience and adaptation are what matter. Planting the hibiscus in their own garden is a symbolic act of putting down roots in this new, harsh environment. The specific imagery in the final paragraph connects Saeng’s personal growth to the natural cycle, showing that she has learned to find familiarity and beauty in her new world. She notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, is now “familiar.” She lifts her head to watch them, an active gesture of engagement compared to her earlier downcast state. Her vow is therefore not just about a test; it is a promise to herself to try again when the signs of life return—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. The hibiscus, which first represented pure nostalgia, is transformed into a symbol of her own potential to endure and eventually bloom. The conclusion thus beautifully ties together the story’s themes of memory, loss, and resilience, ending on a note of quiet determination and forward-looking hope.
29	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to achieving a sense of hopeful resilience. This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life while finding strength in her heritage, symbolized by the winter hibiscus. Throughout the story, Saeng is acutely aware of what she has lost. Her visit to the greenhouse triggers a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes,"" as the familiar plants vividly remind her of her childhood home and her grandmother. This grief is compounded by her failure of the driver's test, a tangible setback in her attempt to navigate American life. However, her mother’s reaction provides a crucial shift in perspective. Mrs. Panouvong does not scold Saeng for the expensive plant or the failed test; instead, she focuses on the hibiscus's strength, noting that while its flowers ""aren’t as pretty,"" it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol of survival and adaptation, not just loss. Planting the hibiscus becomes an act of putting down roots, both literally and metaphorically. As Saeng works in the garden, she experiences a moment of integration. The sounds and smells from the kitchen—the bitter melon she has a ""cultivated taste"" for—connect her present to her past. Similarly, the call of the Canada geese, which she now finds ""familiar,"" shows her that the strange can become familiar through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season."" She is beginning to belong. Therefore, the concluding paragraph resolves Saeng’s inner conflict. Her vow to retake the test in the spring ties her personal goal to the natural cycles of her new environment. The return of the geese and the budding of the hardy ""winter hibiscus"" will signal a time of renewal, mirroring the new strength and hope she has found. The ending affirms that while the past is gone, the future holds the promise of growth and success, built upon the resilience she has discovered within herself and her culture."
30	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it represents her newfound resilience and acceptance of her hybrid identity, blending her Laotian past with her American present. This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict, which is Saeng’s struggle with loss and displacement. Her initial failure and subsequent visit to the greenhouse trigger a profound grief for everything she left behind in Laos—the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her grandmother. This wave of memory and loss causes her to break down, feeling that her past is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” However, her mother’s reaction to the purchased plant provides a crucial shift in perspective. Instead of anger over the cost, her mother focuses on the plant’s strength, calling it the “winter hibiscus” that is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters.” This teaches Saeng that survival and beauty are possible in this new, harsher environment, even if the form is different. This lesson is then mirrored in Saeng’s own observations as she plants the hibiscus. She notices that the bitter melon, a “cultivated taste” from her homeland that none of her American friends like, is something she now prefers to a Big Mac. Similarly, the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become “familiar.” These details show her slowly rooting herself in her new life, not by replacing her past but by integrating it. The final vow connects her personal growth to the cyclical, renewing power of nature. The return of the geese and the budding of the hardy hibiscus in spring become symbols of hope and a new beginning. By linking her decision to these natural signs, the author shows that Saeng is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead looking forward, ready to face a challenge she once failed. The ending thus completes her emotional journey from despair to determined resilience, firmly planting her in the fertile ground between two worlds.

This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict, showing how Saeng has moved from being overwhelmed by loss to finding resilience and a connection between her past and her future. Throughout the story, Saeng is engulfed by a profound sense of displacement and grief. After failing her driver’s test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt, she is drawn into the florist shop, which becomes a portal to her childhood in Laos. The sight and smell of familiar plants like the hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle trigger visceral memories of her grandmother and her old home, leading to an overwhelming ""wave of loss"" that causes her to break down and weep. This illustrates that her sadness was not just about the test but about everything she had ""irretrievably, irrevocably"" lost. However, the conversation with her mother marks a turning point. Her mother’s gentle reaction to the failed test and the expensive plant shows understanding, not anger. More importantly, her mother reframes the hibiscus not as a poor imitation of the past, but as a ""winter hibiscus""—a plant that is strong enough to survive the cold. This idea of resilience is a crucial lesson for Saeng. By planting it together in their new garden, an act that merges the cherished plant from her memory with the harsh soil of her new environment, Saeng begins to root herself in the present. The concluding paragraph weaves together all the symbols of this newfound acceptance. The budding of the hibiscus represents the promise of new life and the persistence of her cultural identity. The return of the geese, which she now finds ""familiar,"" shows her growing attachment to her new home. Her vow to retake the test, therefore, is not just about passing an exam; it is a promise to herself to try again, armed with the strength she has gained from reconciling her past with her present. The cycle of the seasons provides a timeline for her personal growth, making the ending a powerful statement about hope, adaptation, and the quiet courage to begin anew."

This resolution is earned through her emotional journey in the florist shop, where the ""shock of recognition"" from seeing the hibiscus triggers a powerful wave of grief for the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her childhood. The subsequent purchase of the plant, an act her mother initially sees as financially reckless, becomes a crucial bridge between her profound loss and her potential for growth. Her mother’s wisdom reframes the hibiscus not as a poor replica of the past, but as a ""winter hibiscus""—a variation that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This teaches Saeng that resilience, not mere replication, is what matters. Planting the hibiscus in their new garden is a physical act of putting down roots in foreign soil, mirroring Saeng’s own process of adaptation. This is further solidified as she recognizes that the honks of the Canada geese have become ""familiar,"" showing her that a new sense of belonging can be cultivated over time through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season."" Therefore, the final paragraph connects her personal growth to the natural cycle. The budding of the hibiscus in spring represents hope and new beginnings, and by linking her vow to this specific moment, Saeng demonstrates that she is no longer paralyzed by loss. Instead, she has integrated her past—symbolized by the plant—with her future in America, finding the strength to face her challenges again.

This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict by showing Saeng’s emotional shift from despair to resilient hope. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss for her homeland. In the greenhouse, the familiar plants trigger powerful memories of Vietnam, leading to a “wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes” and causes her to weep for an “irretrievably, irrevocably gone” past. This profound grief is compounded by her immediate failure—failing her driver’s test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt to American life. However, the conversation with her mother and the act of planting the “winter hibiscus” initiate her healing. Her mother accepts both the expensive plant and the failed test without anger, focusing instead on the plant’s strength, noting “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, that’s what matters.” This teaches Saeng a lesson in resilience. The specific details in the concluding paragraph chart Saeng’s new, hopeful perspective. She links her personal goal—retaking the test—to the natural cycles of her new environment: “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” Just before this vow, she realizes that the honks of the Canada geese, once strange, have become “familiar,” showing she is gradually putting down roots. The hibiscus itself is a hybrid symbol; it is not the authentic “saebba” of Vietnam but a hardy “winter hibiscus” that can survive the cold. By associating her future success with the budding of this specific plant, Saeng acknowledges that her Laotian identity can persist and even flourish in this new context, not as a perfect replica of the past, but as something adapted and resilient. Therefore, the ending powerfully conveys that Saeng has moved from being paralyzed by grief to being motivated by hope. She is no longer looking only backward but is now looking forward, integrating her cherished memories with a determination to succeed in her new world. The vow represents a promise of growth and renewal, perfectly mirroring the coming spring.

This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life in the United States and her determination to persevere. Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by a deep sense of dislocation and grief. Failing her driver's test amplifies her feeling of not belonging. The encounter with the hibiscus and other familiar plants in the greenhouse triggers a powerful wave of memories, making her painfully aware of all that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone,"" such as her grandmother and her childhood home. This wave of loss causes her to break down and weep. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is not one of anger but of understanding and quiet wisdom. She recognizes the plant’s value not as a perfect replica of the past, but as a ""winter hibiscus""—a different, stronger variety that can ""make it through the cold months."" This idea of resilience is what matters. By planting the hibiscus together, Saeng and her mother engage in an act of putting down new roots, both literally and symbolically. As Saeng works in the garden, she notices that things which were once strange, like the honking of Canada geese, have become ""almost familiar"" through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" This observation marks a significant shift in her perspective. She is beginning to find a place for herself in this new environment, even developing a cultivated taste for its aspects, such as preferring a bitter melon omelet to a Big Mac. Therefore, the concluding paragraph ties these threads together. Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring connects her personal growth to the natural cycle.

Throughout the story, Saeng is confronted with powerful memories of her past life in Vietnam, triggered by the plants in the greenhouse. These memories are bittersweet, culminating in a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes"" and causing her to weep. The hibiscus, or *saebba*, represents everything she has lost—her home, her garden, and her grandmother. Her failure of the driver's test intensifies this feeling of dislocation, as it is a stark reminder of her struggles to adapt to American culture.

Instead of scolding her for the expensive plant or the failed test, her mother focuses on the hibiscus's strength, calling it a “winter hibiscus” that is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This observation subtly shifts the meaning of the plant from a symbol of pure loss to one of endurance. The act of planting it together in the cold, hard soil is a literal and metaphorical act of putting down new roots. Saeng’s growing acceptance of her new environment is further signaled by her appreciation for the bitter melon, a “cultivated taste” she prefers to a Big Mac, and the now-familiar honking of Canada geese.

Her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is crucial; instead of anger, she offers understanding and calls the hibiscus “strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This reframes the plant not as a poor replica of the past, but as something resilient and adapted to its new conditions—a ""winter hibiscus."" By planting it in their own garden, Saeng and her mother are literally putting down roots. Saeng also realizes that some things from her new home, like the taste of bitter melon and the call of the Canada geese, have become “almost familiar” through the “quiet repetition of season upon season.” Therefore, the final paragraph ties these themes of resilience and adaptation together. Saeng’s vow connects her future action—retaking the test—to the natural cycles of her new home: the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of the newly planted hibiscus. She is no longer looking back to a lost paradise but forward to a future that harmonizes her heritage with her new reality, using the resilient ""winter hibiscus"" as her model for survival and eventual flourishing."
47	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her transition from being overwhelmed by the past to finding hope and resilience in her new life. Throughout the story, Saeng is consumed by a deep sense of loss for her home in Vietnam, a feeling triggered by her failure on the test and powerfully evoked by the plants in the greenhouse. The hibiscus and jasmine plunge her into visceral memories of her grandmother and their garden, leading to a wave of grief so strong that she breaks down, mourning a world that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” This failure and the subsequent emotional collapse represent her struggle to adapt. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant provides a pivotal shift. Instead of anger, her mother shows understanding, focusing on the plant's strength, calling it the “winter hibiscus” that is “strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This reframes the hibiscus from a fragile relic of the past into a symbol of hardiness and the possibility of thriving in a new, harsher environment. The act of planting it together in the cold, hard soil is a practical act of putting down new roots. The final paragraph weaves these elements together. The signs of her adaptation are now all around her: the smell of bitter melon, a “cultivated taste” she has come to prefer, and the honks of the Canada geese, which have become “familiar.” Her vow is therefore not just about a test; it is a promise aligned with the cycles of her new world. She will try again when the geese return and the winter hibiscus buds—symbolizing her own readiness to bloom anew. The conclusion thus marks her acceptance of a hybrid identity, honoring her past while finally committing to a future in America.
48	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it powerfully symbolizes her shift from despair to resilience and her growing ability to merge her past and present identities. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss for her homeland, triggered by her failure and the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The intensity of her grief is clear when she ""broke down and wept,"" mourning the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her childhood, including her grandmother and the hibiscus hedge. This emotional nadir makes her final resolution all the more significant. The ""winter hibiscus"" itself becomes a crucial metaphor for this change. As her mother wisely points out, this American variety is not identical to the one from home—""Its flowers aren’t as pretty""—but it is strong enough to survive the cold. This teaches Saeng that beauty and strength can be found in adaptation, not just in perfect recreation of the past. By planting the hibiscus in their new garden, Saeng is literally putting down roots in her new country, an act that mirrors her mother’s quiet perseverance in tending a vegetable patch that grows culturally significant foods like bitter melon. Furthermore, Saeng’s perception of her new environment has subtly changed. She notes that the honks of the Canada geese, once strange, are now ""clear and—yes—familiar."" This shows that through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" she is beginning to belong. Her vow is therefore timed to the natural cycle of this new land: she will try again when the snow melts, the geese return, and the winter hibiscus buds. The paragraph shows that Saeng is not abandoning her past but is using the strength derived from it to face her future. Her grief is being transformed into determination, concluding her emotional journey with a note of hope and integration."

Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with feelings of loss and displacement, symbolized by her emotional breakdown in the greenhouse when she encounters plants that remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus, in particular, becomes a powerful symbol of her past, connecting her to memories of Vietnam. However, by the end, the ""winter hibiscus"" also represents adaptation—it is a hardier variety that can survive the cold, much like Saeng herself must learn to endure her new environment. The final paragraph ties together these themes of hope and perseverance. Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in spring mirrors the cyclical return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, suggesting renewal and growth. The geese, once strange to her, now feel familiar, just as she has begun to find small comforts in her new life, like the bitter melon omelet. By linking her personal resolve to the natural world’s rhythms, the author shows Saeng’s growing determination to rebuild her identity while honoring her roots. The ending leaves the reader with a sense of quiet optimism, underscoring the idea that healing and adaptation take time but are possible."

Throughout the story, Saeng is engulfed by a deep sense of loss for her homeland, triggered by her failure on the test and the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The sight of the hibiscus causes a ""shock of recognition"" that pulls her into vivid memories of her grandmother and her childhood home, culminating in a wave of grief so strong that she ""broke down and wept."" This emotional breakdown illustrates how her past and present are in conflict, making her current life in the United States feel foreign and difficult. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive hibiscus becomes a turning point. Instead of anger, her mother shows understanding, recognizing the plant’s symbolic value. She calls it the ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol of endurance and adaptation, qualities Saeng needs to cultivate. This lesson is reinforced as Saeng works in the garden, noticing that the ""pungent smell of bitter melon"" is a ""cultivated taste"" she prefers to a Big Mac, and the honking of the Canada geese has become ""familiar."" These details show her slowly putting down roots and adapting, just like the winter-hardy plant. By vowing to try again when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, Saeng aligns her personal growth with the cycles of her new environment. The promise is not just about passing a test; it is a commitment to persevere. The winter hibiscus, which survives the cold to bloom again, becomes a metaphor for Saeng's own journey.

This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life in the United States and her determination to persevere. Throughout the story, Saeng is consumed by a powerful sense of dislocation and grief. Failing her driver's test reinforces her feeling of being an outsider, unable to navigate this new world. This failure is followed by an intense wave of nostalgia in the greenhouse, where familiar plants like the hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle trigger visceral memories of her grandmother and her childhood home in Vietnam. The encounter causes her to break down, weeping for an “irretrievably, irrevocably gone” past. Her subsequent dread in telling her mother about the expensive plant and the failed test shows her fear of disappointment and her deep sadness. However, her mother’s reaction provides the turning point. Instead of scolding her for the cost, Mrs. Panouvong focuses on the plant's beauty and, more importantly, its strength. She calls it the “winter hibiscus,” noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters.” This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol of resilience and adaptation rather than just a relic of the past. The act of planting it together in the cold, hard soil is a literal and metaphorical act of putting down new roots. This newfound perspective allows Saeng to see her surroundings differently. She realizes that many things she once found strange, like the taste of bitter melon or the honking of Canada geese, have become “almost familiar” through “the quiet repetition of season upon season.” The paragraph’s conclusion ties this acceptance directly to her personal resolve. By vowing to retake the test in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, Saeng aligns her personal growth with the natural cycle. She is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead looking forward, ready to face a challenge again. The “winter hibiscus” symbolizes her own ability to survive the cold of change and loss and eventually bloom again, making the ending a powerful statement of quiet determination and hope.

Instead of scolding her for the expensive plant or the failed test, her mother responds with quiet understanding. She recognizes the hibiscus as a ""winter hibiscus,"" a different but strong variety that can ""make it through the cold months."" This observation becomes a metaphor for their own resilience as immigrants. The act of planting the hibiscus together in the cold, hard soil is a physical act of putting down roots in their new home.

Her mother’s gentle acceptance of both the failed test and the expensive plant, and her wisdom in valuing the hibiscus for its strength to survive the cold, provide Saeng with a new perspective.

In the greenhouse, the sight of the hibiscus and other familiar plants from Laos—the *saebba*, *dok Malik*, and Madagascar periwinkle—triggered powerful memories of her grandmother and her childhood home, causing her to break down. The plants were symbols of everything “irretrievably, irrevocably gone,” and her failure of the driver’s test symbolized her struggles in this new, unfamiliar country.

This final paragraph resolves the story's central conflict, which is Saeng's struggle between her painful longing for the past and the need to build a future in America. Her initial failure and the subsequent wave of grief in the greenhouse demonstrate how disconnected she feels. The hibiscus and other plants trigger visceral memories of her grandmother and her home in Vietnam, making her feel the loss ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This despair is what makes her impulsive purchase of the expensive ""winter hibiscus"" so significant; it is an attempt to physically hold onto a piece of that lost world. However, the conversation with her mother provides a crucial shift in perspective. Her mother, instead of focusing on the cost or the failed test, focuses on the plant's resilience, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This reframes the hibiscus from being a poor substitute for the past into a symbol of survival and adaptation. The act of planting it together in the cold, hard soil is a literal and metaphorical act of putting down roots in their new environment. Saeng then experiences a moment of profound realization as she hears familiar cooking sounds and smells the bitter melon, a ""cultivated taste"" she now prefers to a Big Mac. She notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" These sensory details mark her growing connection to her new home. Therefore, her vow to retry the test in the spring is not just about a driver's license. It is a promise synchronized with the natural cycles of her new land—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the resilient hibiscus she has just planted. She aligns her personal growth with the coming spring, showing that she has found the strength to move forward. The conclusion affirms that while the past is cherished, the future, like the winter hibiscus, holds the promise of new life and enduring hope."
113	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring to show her emotional transformation from despair to resilience, a change inspired by the ""winter hibiscus."" This final paragraph signifies that Saeng has chosen to adapt and persevere in her new life, rather than remain trapped in grief for the past. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss and dislocation. Failing her driver's test is a stark reminder of her difficulties adapting to American life. This failure triggers a deep homesickness, which intensifies when she encounters the hibiscus and other plants in the greenhouse. These plants are powerful sensory links to her childhood in Laos, and the memories they unlock—of her grandmother, their garden, and the well—are so potent that they cause a ""shock of recognition"" and bring her to tears. She mourns for a world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone,"" feeling the pain of her displacement acutely. However, the interaction with her mother and the act of planting the hibiscus become a turning point. Her mother, instead of scolding her for the expensive purchase, recognizes her daughter's pain and focuses on the plant's positive qualities. She calls it a ""winter hibiscus"" and points out that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the tropical kind, ""it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol not of what was lost, but of the strength to survive and endure in a new, harsher environment. This new perspective allows Saeng to begin appreciating the present. As she plants the hibiscus, she notices the familiar, comforting sounds and smells from her kitchen—the sizzle of oil and the pungent bitter melon, which she ""much preferred... to a Big Mac."" She then observes the Canada geese flying overhead, and their honks, which she once found strange, are now ""clear and—yes—familiar.""

114	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it signifies her transition from being paralyzed by grief over her lost past to finding the resilience to build a new life.

The hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle vividly transport her back to Vietnam, culminating in the painful realization that her old life—the hedge, the well, her grandmother—is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone,” causing her to break down. This deep sorrow shows how her attachment to the past has been a barrier to moving forward in her new country. However, the interaction with her mother and the act of planting the “winter hibiscus” mark a turning point. Her mother, instead of scolding her for the expensive purchase, recognizes the plant's symbolic value and its hardiness, noting that “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here...

However, her mother reframes the plant not as a poor imitation of the past, but as a ""winter hibiscus,"" a variety that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This perspective shift is crucial. By planting the hardy hibiscus in their new garden, Saeng actively puts down roots in her new home, mirroring her mother’s adaptability. The concluding vow connects Saeng’s personal growth to the natural cycles of her new environment. She links her own resolve to the predictable, comforting return of the Canada geese, whose honks are now ""familiar."" This shows that, just as the seasons change and the geese return, she too can find strength and familiarity through repetition and time. The promise to try again when the hibiscus buds in spring signifies that her hope is no longer fragile but is now tied to a concrete, forward-looking plan. The act of planting the hibiscus, coupled with her appreciation for the bitter melon omelet—a ""cultivated taste"" she prefers to a Big Mac—shows she is integrating her heritage into her American life rather than being paralyzed by grief.

117	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng’s resilience and her gradual acceptance of her new life in the United States while still holding onto her cultural roots. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with feelings of loss and displacement after failing her driver’s test, which symbolizes her difficulty adapting to her new environment. However, her encounter with the hibiscus and other familiar plants at the florist shop reconnects her to her childhood in Vietnam, evoking both joy and sorrow. This moment of emotional release allows her to process her grief and begin to reconcile her past with her present. The final paragraph highlights Saeng’s determination to try again, linking her personal growth to the natural cycles of the seasons. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus in spring symbolize renewal and hope, mirroring Saeng’s own journey toward adaptation. Her vow to retake the test reflects her newfound resolve to persevere, even in the face of challenges. Additionally, the imagery of the geese, which she now finds familiar, underscores her gradual acclimation to her new home. By ending the story with this promise, the author leaves the reader with a sense of optimism, showing that Saeng is learning to navigate her dual identity—honoring her heritage while embracing the possibilities of her future. The conclusion also ties back to the theme of resilience, as seen in the ""winter hibiscus"" itself, a plant that endures the cold months. Just as the hibiscus survives the winter, Saeng, too, is finding strength in her struggles. Her mother’s quiet acceptance and practical response to the expensive plant further reinforce this theme, showing how small acts of kindness and understanding can help heal wounds of displacement. Ultimately, the ending underscores the idea that growth and belonging are gradual processes, shaped by both memory and the courage to move forward."
118	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her emotional shift from despair to resilient hope, mirroring the central symbol of the winter hibiscus. After failing her test, Saeng is overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss"" for her past life in Laos, a grief triggered by the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The hibiscus she finds, however, is not identical to the one from her homeland; it is a hardy ""winter hibiscus"" that can survive the cold. Her mother points out that this quality—its strength to endure—is what matters. This teaches Saeng that adaptation and resilience are a form of beauty and survival. By connecting her personal resolve to the natural cycles of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding, Saeng aligns her own growth with this new environment. Her earlier alienation, represented by the strange geese and bitter melon disliked by her classmates, is replaced by a dawning familiarity. The final vow demonstrates that she is no longer looking only backward with sorrow but is now planting herself in her new life, determined to try again when the season of renewal comes, just as the winter hibiscus will. The ending thus completes her journey from mourning an irretrievable past to embracing a future of perseverance and gradual acceptance."
119	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring because it represents her acceptance of her new life and her renewed sense of hope, symbolically linking her personal growth to the resilience of the natural world. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a deep sense of loss for her childhood in Laos. Her failure of the driver's test reinforces her feeling of being an outsider in America, and her subsequent visit to the greenhouse triggers a visceral wave of grief for the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her past. The hibiscus and other plants powerfully reconnect her to her memories, but this connection initially brings only the pain of realizing what she has lost. However, her mother provides a crucial shift in perspective. She does not focus on the failed test or the expensive plant but instead calls it the ""winter hibiscus."" She points out that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from their homeland, ""it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That's what matters."" This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol of survival and adaptation, not just memory. The act of planting it together in the cold, hard soil is a physical act of putting down roots in their new environment. This is mirrored in Saeng’s own changing perceptions; she realizes that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has now become ""familiar"" through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" Therefore, the final paragraph connects Saeng’s personal resolve directly to this cycle of nature. By vowing to retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the resilient winter hibiscus buds, Saeng aligns her own future with the promise of renewal. The hibiscus is no longer just a relic of the past but a living testament to the ability to endure and flourish in a new world. Her decision to try again shows that she has moved from being paralyzed by grief to being motivated by hope, ready to face her challenges as the seasons turn."
120	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to illustrate her emotional transformation from despair to resilience and her budding connection to her new home. This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict by showing Saeng beginning to reconcile her past in Laos with her present in America. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a deep sense of loss for her homeland and her grandmother, a feeling so powerful it causes her to weep in the greenhouse. The hibiscus and other plants trigger visceral memories, but they also highlight everything that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” Her failure of the driver’s test symbolizes her broader struggles to navigate and succeed in this unfamiliar culture. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant provides a pivotal shift. Instead of anger, her mother shows understanding and calls the plant a “winter hibiscus,” noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters.” This teaches Saeng a lesson in resilience and adaptation. Planting the hardy hibiscus becomes a symbolic act of putting down roots in the new, harsher environment. As she works in the garden, she notices that the honks of the Canada geese have become familiar, and she admits that many once-strange things have become so through “the quiet repetition of season upon season.” Her vow to retake the test is therefore linked to the natural cycles of her new home—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of the winter hibiscus. It signifies that she has chosen to persevere, using the strength of the hardy plant as a model for her own life. The ending thus completes her arc, showing that she will face challenges not by retreating into the past, but by moving forward with hope, nurtured by the symbolic strength of the winter hibiscus.
121	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding resilience and hope for the future. Throughout the story, Saeng is confronted by a deep sense of dislocation after failing her driver's test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt to her new American life. This failure triggers a wave of memories when she encounters the hibiscus and other familiar plants in the greenhouse, leading her to grieve for the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her childhood in Vietnam. However, her mother’s reaction provides the turning point. Instead of scolding her for the expensive purchase or the failed test, Mrs. Panouvong focuses on the positive, admiring the plant and calling it a ""winter hibiscus."" She emphasizes its strength, noting that while its flowers ""aren’t as pretty,"" it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This lesson of resilience—of adapting and surviving in a harsher climate—is transferred to Saeng. As she plants the hibiscus in their garden, she experiences a shift in perception. She notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar,"" recognizing that adaptation happens through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" The final paragraph crystallizes this newfound understanding. Saeng aligns her personal goal of retaking the test with the natural cycles of her new environment: the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the very hibiscus that symbolizes hardy survival. By vowing to try again in the spring, Saeng demonstrates that she has internalized her mother’s wisdom. She is no longer paralyzed by the past but is instead looking forward, having found a source of strength in the ""winter hibiscus"" and the promise of renewal it represents. The conclusion thus affirms the story's central theme that hope and the capacity to begin anew can take root even in the midst of loss and change."
122	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring to illustrate her emotional transition from being lost in the past to finding the resilience to face the future. This final paragraph signifies a crucial moment of growth and acceptance for Saeng, who has been overwhelmed by feelings of loss and displacement. Her intense grief in the greenhouse, triggered by the familiar plants, shows how deeply she mourns her former life in Vietnam—the ""hibiscus hedge,"" the ""well,"" and her ""gentle grandmother,"" all of which are ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" The winter hibiscus she buys is a poignant symbol of this compromise; it is not the real thing from her homeland, but her mother wisely notes that it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This embodies the idea of a new, different, but still valid life in America. Saeng's promise to herself is therefore a symbol of hope and integration. She connects her personal goal to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. Earlier in the story, the honks of the Canada geese were strange to her, but now she finds them ""familiar,"" showing she is slowly putting down roots. By vowing to try again only after the hibiscus, a part of her heritage now planted in American soil, shows signs of new life, Saeng demonstrates that she is learning to blend her past with her present. The conclusion shows that she is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead drawing strength from both her cultural memory and her evolving adaptability, ready to face her challenges with renewed determination."
123	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it signals her shift from being overwhelmed by the past to finding a resilient hope for the future. This final paragraph resolves the story's central conflict—Saeng's feeling of being lost between two worlds—by showing her acceptance of her new life and her determination to persevere. Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by a deep sense of loss for her homeland. Her intense, visceral reaction to the hibiscus and other plants in the greenhouse triggers powerful memories of her grandmother and her childhood in Vietnam, culminating in a wave of grief so strong that she ""broke down and wept."" She feels her old life is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This establishes her initial despair and disconnection from her new environment. However, the conversation with her mother provides a crucial turning point. Her mother does not scold her for failing the test or spending a large sum of money; instead, she focuses on the plant, calling it a ""winter hibiscus."" She points out that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol not of what was lost, but of the resilience needed to survive and adapt. This new perspective allows Saeng to begin reconciling her past with her present. As she plants the hibiscus, she notices that the sounds and smells from her kitchen—the beating of eggs and the pungent bitter melon—are things she has come to love, a ""cultivated taste"" she prefers ""to a Big Mac."" Most importantly, she realizes that the honking of the Canada geese, which she once found strange, has become ""familiar."" This shows she is slowly putting down roots and building a new sense of home. Her vow to retake the test is therefore tied to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of the resilient winter hibiscus. She is no longer looking back to a lost Vietnam but forward to a spring in America, aligning her personal growth with the seasons. The conclusion powerfully shows that Saeng has chosen to embrace the future with the same hardiness as the winter hibiscus, transforming her grief into determined hope."
124	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has finally found a source of strength and a sense of connection to her new home, transforming her deep sorrow into resilient hope. This final vow represents her emotional journey from being overwhelmed by loss to accepting her new life and moving forward. Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by a profound sense of displacement. Failing her driver's test symbolizes her struggle to navigate American culture, and the subsequent discovery of the hibiscus plunges her into a wave of grief for ""all that was irretrievably, irrevocably gone""—her grandmother, her garden, and her homeland. Her breakdown in the greenhouse is a cathartic release of this pent-up sadness. However, the interaction with her mother upon returning home begins her healing. Her mother’s gentle reaction to both the failed test and the expensive plant provides comfort and understanding. More importantly, her mother reframes the hibiscus not as a poor imitation of the past, but as something valuable in its own right: a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This perspective shift is crucial. By planting the hibiscus, Saeng literally puts down roots in her new environment. The sensory details of her mother cooking a bitter melon omelet—a ""cultivated taste"" she prefers to a Big Mac—and the now ""familiar"" honking of the Canada geese show her subconscious integration into this new life. The hibiscus becomes a symbolic bridge between her past and her future. It is a piece of her homeland, but it is also a hardy plant capable of surviving an American winter. Therefore, her vow to retake the test in the spring ties her personal growth to the natural cycle. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus will be signs of renewal and resilience, mirroring her own. She is no longer looking back with despair but forward with determination, using the strength of the ""winter hibiscus"" as her model to endure hardship and eventually bloom again. The conclusion solidifies the story's theme that while the past is cherished, identity can be rebuilt and hope can take root in a new world."
125	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding resilience and hope for the future. This final paragraph signals a shift in Saeng’s mindset, connecting her personal growth to the natural cycles of her new environment. Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by the irretrievable loss of her past in Vietnam, a pain triggered by her failure and then intensified in the greenhouse. The familiar plants—hibiscus, jasmine, periwinkle—act as powerful conduits to memories of her grandmother and home, causing her to break down because she cannot reclaim that world. Her initial perspective is that everything valuable belongs to the past. However, her mother provides a crucial new perspective, calling the plant a “winter hibiscus.” She acknowledges it is not the same as the one from home, but she values its strength to survive the cold. This idea of resilience in a new context plants the seed for Saeng’s change. As Saeng gardens, she has a series of realizations about her new life. She notes that the bitter melon, a taste from her childhood that her American friends dislike, is something she “much preferred... to a Big Mac.” Similarly, the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become “familiar.” These details show her beginning to integrate her past with her present, building a new sense of home. By vowing to try again “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” Saeng explicitly links her personal goal to the symbolic rebirth of spring. The hardy winter hibiscus, which will bud again, becomes a metaphor for her own ability to endure and flourish despite hardship. The cyclical promise of nature replaces the feeling of permanent loss with one of patient, hopeful anticipation. The conclusion, therefore, completes her emotional arc, showing that she has found a way to carry her past forward without being paralyzed by it, ready to face the challenges of her new world.

Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a deep sense of loss for her homeland. Her intense, visceral reaction to the plants in the greenhouse triggers a flood of memories from Vietnam, culminating in her breakdown as she realizes her old life is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” The hibiscus she buys is not the same as the one from home; it is a “winter hibiscus,” a hardy substitute that can survive the cold. Her mother points out the significance of this, noting, ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This observation reframes the plant from a symbol of what was lost to a symbol of survival and adaptation.

After failing her test, Saeng is overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes"" for the irretrievable world of her childhood in Vietnam, a loss triggered by the familiar plants in the greenhouse. Her subsequent, seemingly impulsive purchase of the hibiscus for nineteen dollars—a sum her mother finds shocking—is a desperate attempt to physically hold onto a piece of that lost home. However, her mother reframes the plant not as a poor replica of the past, but as something valuable in its own right: a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This conversation is the turning point. Saeng moves from passively grieving her loss to actively planting the hibiscus in the cold, hard ground, a physical act that parallels her internal growth. As she works, she experiences a new sense of familiarity with her American environment. She realizes she has developed a ""cultivated taste"" for the bitter melon her mother is cooking, ""much preferred it to a Big Mac,"" and finds the honks of the Canada geese overhead to be ""clear and—yes—familiar."" These details show she is putting down roots, much like the plant. Therefore, her vow to retry the test in the spring is not just about driving; it is a promise to herself to keep growing and adapting.

By linking her personal vow to the predictable, returning patterns of nature—the melting snow, the geese’s return, and the hibiscus budding—Saeng demonstrates that she has found a new foundation for hope. The test is no longer just a symbol of failure but a future goal anchored in the steady passage of the seasons. Therefore, the ending shows that Saeng has chosen to root herself in this new world, embracing both memory and the promise of spring."
137	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has moved from a state of paralyzing grief to one of resilient hope, symbolized by her connection to the ""winter hibiscus."" Her initial encounter with the plant in the greenhouse triggers a powerful wave of memories and a profound sense of loss for her homeland and grandmother, causing her to break down. She feels her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, her mother’s reaction to the plant provides a crucial shift in perspective. Mrs. Panouvong does not scold Saeng for the expense but instead focuses on the plant’s beauty and, more importantly, its strength. She identifies it as a ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers may not be as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This observation helps Saeng see the plant, and by extension herself, not as a poor imitation of the past but as something capable of surviving and adapting to a new, harsher environment. This realization is reinforced as Saeng works in the garden, noticing that the bitter melon she prefers is a ""cultivated taste"" and that the call of the Canada geese has become ""familiar."" She recognizes that through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season,"" her new life is becoming more familiar. The final vow to retake the driver's test in the spring, timed with the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, completes this arc. The hibiscus is no longer just a reminder of what was lost; it becomes a symbol of future growth and resilience. Saeng’s plan aligns her personal goal with the natural cycles of her new home, demonstrating that she has chosen to put down roots and persevere, just like the winter hibiscus. The conclusion thus affirms the story's central theme: that while the pain of loss is real, it is possible to find strength and build a new sense of belonging by adapting and enduring."
138	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s transformation from feeling overwhelmed by loss to finding a new sense of hope and resilience. This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life and her determination to persevere. Throughout the story, Saeng is consumed by a profound sense of dislocation and grief. Failing her driver's test is not just a simple failure; it symbolizes her struggle to adapt to American culture. This disappointment triggers a powerful wave of memories when she encounters the hibiscus and other plants in the florist shop, leading her to vividly recall the world she lost in Laos. The intensity of her grief is clear when she breaks down weeping in the greenhouse, overwhelmed by the thought that her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her journey home is framed by a bleak, cold landscape that mirrors her inner despair. However, a shift begins with her mother’s reaction. Instead of scolding her for the expensive plant or the failed test, Mrs. Panouvong shows understanding and focuses on the positive. She calls the plant ""beautiful"" and, crucially, reframes it as a ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers may not be as pretty, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This observation serves as a metaphor for their own lives as immigrants; they must be resilient and adapt to a harsher environment to survive. The act of planting the hibiscus together in the cold, hard soil is a physical act of putting down roots in their new home. This newfound perspective allows Saeng to begin seeing her new environment with familiar eyes. She realizes she has developed a ""cultivated taste"" for the bitter melon her friends dislike, and the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, is now ""familiar."" The paragraph’s conclusion directly builds on this realization. By linking her decision to retake the test to the natural cycles of spring—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus—Saeng aligns her personal growth with the rhythms of her new world. No longer fighting against her reality, she finds a source of strength and timing within it. The winter hibiscus, capable of surviving the cold, becomes a symbol of her own resilience, and her vow signifies a commitment to bloom again in the spring."
139	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to illustrate her emotional shift from being trapped in the past to finding the resilience to face the future. This final paragraph signifies a crucial moment of growth and acceptance for Saeng, who spends much of the story overwhelmed by a sense of loss for her homeland. Her initial encounter with the hibiscus in the greenhouse triggers a flood of visceral memories from Vietnam—the ""saebba hedge,"" her grandmother’s hair ""combed out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb,"" and the ""well."" This wave of nostalgia is so powerful it causes her to break down, mourning an ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world. The hibiscus initially represents everything she has lost, making her failure on the driver’s test feel like another confirmation that she doesn't belong in this new, cold country. However, the conversation with her mother serves as a turning point. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test, but instead focuses on the plant’s positive qualities, calling it a ""winter hibiscus."" She points out that while its flowers ""aren’t as pretty"" as the ones from home, it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This reframes the hibiscus from a poor substitute into a symbol of hardiness and adaptation. By helping her mother plant it in their American garden, Saeng begins to put down literal and metaphorical roots. She notices the familiar, ""cultivated taste"" of the bitter melon cooking for dinner and realizes the honks of the Canada geese have become ""familiar to her now."" Therefore, the concluding vow connects her newfound resilience directly to the cycles of her new environment. She ties her personal goal of retaking the test to the natural signs of spring—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of the very winter hibiscus she has just planted. This shows that Saeng is no longer looking backward with only grief, but is instead looking forward, integrating the strength of her past with the hopeful promise of her future. The winter hibiscus, capable of surviving the cold, becomes a symbol for Saeng herself, and her promise marks her decision to persevere and bloom where she is now planted."
140	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring because it signifies her acceptance of her new life and a renewed sense of hope, blending her past and her present. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss for her homeland. In the greenhouse, the familiar plants trigger powerful, visceral memories of her grandmother and her childhood in Vietnam, leading to a wave of grief so strong that she breaks down and weeps. She feels her old life is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone,” highlighting her deep dislocation and sadness after failing her driver's test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt. However, her interaction with her mother and the “winter hibiscus” marks a turning point. Her mother, instead of scolding her for the expensive plant or the failed test, focuses on the plant's resilience, noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng a crucial lesson about survival and adaptation. The act of planting the hibiscus together is a physical act of putting down new roots in the hard, cold American soil, mirroring their own difficult effort to build a new home. The final paragraph weaves these elements together. The return of the geese, which Saeng now finds ""familiar,"" shows her growing connection to her new environment. The budding of the winter hibiscus represents the promise of new growth and beauty, even in a different and harsher climate. By linking her personal goal of retaking the test to these natural cycles of return and rebirth, Saeng demonstrates that she has found a way to move forward. She is not forgetting her past but is learning to carry it with her as a source of strength, allowing her to face the future with resilience and determination.

141	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has moved from a state of paralyzing grief to one of hopeful determination, finding a new source of strength in her hybrid identity. This final vow represents a significant emotional shift. Earlier, in the greenhouse, Saeng was overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes,"" as she mourned the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her childhood. The hibiscus initially triggered this pain, connecting her to the ""saebba hedge"" of her past. However, through her interaction with her mother, the plant is transformed into a symbol of resilience. Her mother calls it the ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This reframes the plant not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a survivor, capable of adapting and enduring. This new perspective allows Saeng to begin appreciating the familiar within her new environment. As she plants the hibiscus, she notices the Canada geese flying overhead and realizes their honks are now ""clear and—yes—familiar."" She understands that ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" things that were once strange have become almost familiar. This realization is mirrored in her culinary preferences; she admits she much prefers the bitter melon her mother is cooking—a ""cultivated taste"" from her upbringing—to a Big Mac. By linking the returning geese, the budding of the hardy hibiscus, and her own resolve to retake the test, Saeng aligns her personal growth with the natural cycles of her new home. The conclusion shows that she is no longer looking only backward with sorrow, but forward with hope, ready to put down roots and bloom where she is planted."

This final paragraph shows that Saeng has transformed from a character overwhelmed by grief and loss into one who is beginning to find strength and belonging in her new environment. Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by memories of her past life in Vietnam, triggered by the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The sight of the hibiscus causes a ""shock of recognition,"" and the scent of jasmine vividly recalls her grandmother. This wave of nostalgia culminates in a feeling of deep loss, making her weep for a world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her failure of the driver’s test symbolizes her initial failure to adapt and navigate this new American world. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is not one of lasting anger but of quiet understanding. She calls the plant a ""winter hibiscus,"" acknowledging it is different but strong enough to survive the cold, teaching Saeng a lesson in resilience. This lesson is reinforced as Saeng plants the hibiscus and notices the familiar honking of Canada geese, realizing that many once-strange things have become familiar ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season."" By connecting her personal growth to the natural cycles of her new home—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus—Saeng finds a new timeline for her life. Her vow to retake the test is therefore not just about passing an exam; it is a promise to herself to try again when the world awakens in the spring, symbolizing her own emotional reawakening and determination to put down roots and thrive. The ending thus completes her arc from despair to a resilient and hopeful commitment to her future."

Throughout the story, Saeng is confronted by a deep sense of loss for her homeland and her past. Failing her driver’s test intensifies this feeling, making her new life in America seem alien and difficult. Her emotional breakdown in the greenhouse is triggered by the familiar plants, which are powerful reminders of everything she has left behind—her grandmother, the hibiscus hedge, and the well. These memories are so painful that they are ""Irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, the conversation with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" become a turning point. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive purchase or the failed test but instead focuses on the plant's strength, noting that ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol not only of the past but also of endurance and adaptation.

The final paragraph crystallizes this newfound perspective. By vowing to retake the test in the spring, Saeng aligns her personal growth with the natural cycles she is observing. The return of the geese and the budding of the hardy hibiscus, which survives the winter, become metaphors for her own resilience. She is no longer paralyzed by loss but is instead learning to put down roots and persevere in her new environment, finding the strength to try again.

144	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s final shift from being overwhelmed by grief to embracing a resilient hope for the future. This resolution is earned through her emotional journey, which begins with a profound sense of loss triggered by the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The sight of the hibiscus unleashes a wave of visceral memories of her grandmother and her home in Vietnam, culminating in the devastating realization that her past is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” Her breakdown represents the peak of her despair, a feeling compounded by her earlier failure on the driver’s test, which symbolizes her struggles to adapt to her new American life. However, Saeng begins to heal through her interaction with her mother. Her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is not one of lasting anger but of understanding. She recognizes Saeng’s pain and focuses not on the cost or the failure, but on the plant’s potential. By calling it the “winter hibiscus,” she recontextualizes it as something that is “strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor imitation of the past, but as a symbol of survival and adaptation. The act of planting it together becomes a ritual of putting down new roots, both literally and metaphorically, in their current home. The final paragraph weaves together all these elements to show Saeng’s new perspective. The sounds and smells from the kitchen, along with her admitted preference for bitter melon over a Big Mac, show her appreciating the enduring aspects of her culture within her new environment. The Canada geese, once strange, are now “familiar,” mirroring her own gradual acclimatization. By vowing to retake the test in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, Saeng aligns her personal goal with the natural cycles of her new home. She is no longer looking back with pure sorrow but forward with patience and determination, symbolizing that hope and memory can coexist, allowing one to grow even in a winter landscape.

She notes that while this new hibiscus isn't identical to the one from home, it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This teaches Saeng that strength and beauty can be found in adaptation.

Instead of anger, her mother expresses understanding, recognizing the plant's symbolic value. She identifies it as a ""winter hibiscus,"" a hardy plant that can survive the cold, teaching Saeng a crucial lesson about resilience. As they plant it together in their new garden, Saeng begins to reconcile her two worlds. She notices that the bitter melon cooking for dinner, a taste from her past that her American friends find strange, is something she ""much preferred... to a Big Mac."" Simultaneously, the honking of the Canada geese, once alien, now sounds ""familiar."" This shows her gradual acceptance of her new life, where elements from both cultures can coexist. The final vow, therefore, symbolizes Saeng's newfound determination. By linking her decision to retake the test to the natural cycle of spring—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus—the author shows that Saeng is now drawing strength from her environment.

Throughout the story, Saeng is flooded with painful memories of her lost home in Vietnam, triggered by her failure on the driver's test and the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle are not just plants; they are visceral connections to her grandmother, her garden, and her childhood. The intensity of her grief is clear when she breaks down and weeps, feeling that her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her subsequent, expensive purchase of the hibiscus is an impulsive attempt to physically hold onto a piece of that world. Initially, she sees it as inferior, noting, ""It's not a real one,"" meaning it is not the same as the hibiscus from her homeland. However, her mother provides a crucial new perspective, calling the plant ""winter hibiscus."" She acknowledges its differences but values its strength, stating, ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This idea of resilience in a new, harsher environment is the lesson Saeng internalizes.

156	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it powerfully symbolizes her shift from dwelling on the past to embracing a resilient hope for the future. This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict: Saeng’s struggle with her identity and feelings of loss after immigrating from Vietnam. Her initial failure and the subsequent wave of grief in the greenhouse stem from feeling disconnected from both her old life and her new one. However, her mother’s wise perspective on the ""winter hibiscus"" provides the key insight. She notes that while this new hibiscus isn't identical to the one from home, it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This teaches Saeng that strength and beauty can be found in adaptation. By connecting her personal goal to the natural cycles of her new environment—the return of the geese and the budding of the newly planted hibiscus—Saeng integrates her past with her present. The geese, once strange, are now ""familiar,"" just as she has developed a taste for the bitter melon her friends dislike. These details show her creating a new, hybrid identity. Her vow is not just about passing a test; it is a promise to herself to grow and persevere. The spring represents renewal, and by aligning her personal resolve with this season, she demonstrates that she, like the winter hibiscus, has the resilience to put down roots and eventually blossom in her new home. The conclusion thus leaves the reader with a sense of forward-looking optimism, affirming the themes of memory, adaptation, and the enduring strength found in hope."
157	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s transformation from being overwhelmed by grief to finding a sense of hope and resilience. Throughout the story, Saeng is burdened by a profound sense of loss for her homeland and her past life, a feeling that culminates in her breakdown in the greenhouse. The hibiscus plant triggers powerful memories of Vietnam, but these memories initially highlight everything she can never regain, making her failure on the driver's test feel like a larger failure to adapt to her new country. However, the conversation with her mother provides a crucial shift in perspective. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test but instead focuses on the plant’s positive qualities, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of survival and strength in a new environment. By planting it together, they perform an act of putting down new roots, literally and metaphorically, in their new home. The final paragraph connects this symbolism to Saeng’s personal resolve. The natural cycles she observes—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding hibiscus—become markers of time and promise rather than reminders of loss. She realizes that familiarity, like her acquired taste for bitter melon or the now-recognizable call of the geese, grows over time through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season."" By vowing to retake the test in the spring, Saeng aligns her own growth with the resilience of the winter hibiscus, showing that she has found the strength to persevere. The ending thus completes her emotional journey from despair to determination, emphasizing themes of adaptation and the slow, steady process of building a new life."

There, the sight of the hibiscus and other familiar plants triggered powerful memories of her lost home in Vietnam, culminating in a “wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes” and caused her to “break down and wept.” This despair is compounded by her initial failure, making the test symbolic of her struggles in a new country.

This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict—Saeng’s struggle with her identity and sense of loss in a new country—by demonstrating that she has found a new source of strength and hope. Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by memories of her homeland, triggered by her failure on the driver's test and the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The sight of the hibiscus causes a ""shock of recognition,"" plunging her into a wave of visceral memories of her grandmother, their garden, and the well. This connection to the past is so powerful that it leads her to weep for an ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world. Her purchase of the ""winter hibiscus"" is an impulsive act, an attempt to physically hold onto a piece of that world, but it also brings her shame and dread when she has to confess its high cost and her test failure to her mother. However, her mother’s reaction provides the crucial turning point. Instead of scolding her for the expense, Mrs. Panouvong focuses on the plant's potential, calling it ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here.""

This shows how her past is a source of pain, making her current challenges, like failing her driver’s test, feel even more insurmountable.

The hibiscus she bought for a high price symbolizes a desperate but flawed attempt to reclaim that past, as she tells her mother, ""It’s not a real one."" However, her mother reframes the plant’s meaning, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that survival and adaptation, rather than perfect recreation of the past, are valuable. This lesson is reinforced as Saeng works in the garden, noticing that the bitter melon cooking inside is a ""cultivated taste"" she has come to prefer, and that the honks of the Canada geese have become ""familiar."" These details show her slowly putting down roots in her new environment. The final paragraph ties these elements together. The cyclical return of the geese and the budding of the hardy hibiscus in spring become symbols of renewal and second chances. By linking her personal goal of retaking the test to these natural signs, Saeng shows she is no longer paralyzed by loss. Instead, she has adopted the resilience of the winter hibiscus, choosing to grow and try again in a new landscape, thus concluding her emotional journey from grief to determined hope."
183	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring because it powerfully symbolizes her transition from being lost in the past to finding the resilience to build a new life in the present. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss for her homeland. Failing her driver’s test reinforces her feeling of being an outsider, but her discovery of the hibiscus and other familiar plants in the greenhouse triggers a flood of memories. This experience, however, ends in tears as she grieves for ""the hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?""—all things that are ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her mother, however, provides a crucial perspective shift. She calls the plant a ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that survival and adaptation have their own beauty. By planting the hardy hibiscus in their new garden, Saeng performs a symbolic act of putting down roots in her new country. The final paragraph connects this act of planting to the natural cycle of the seasons and the now-familiar honking of the Canada geese. Her vow to retake the test when the hibiscus buds in the spring shows that she has internalized her mother’s lesson; she is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead looking forward, finding strength and a sense of belonging in the very things that have proven they can endure and return.

184	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it signifies a crucial turning point in her journey from despair to resilience and adaptation. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a deep sense of loss for her homeland and past life in Vietnam. This is powerfully illustrated in the florist shop, where the sight and scent of familiar plants like the hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle trigger visceral memories of her grandmother and her childhood home, culminating in a wave of grief that causes her to break down and weep. These plants represent an ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world, highlighting her initial inability to reconcile her past with her present in the United States. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive ""winter hibiscus"" provides the catalyst for this shift. Instead of anger, her mother shows understanding and focuses on the plant’s symbolic strength, noting that while its flowers ""aren’t as pretty,"" it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of hardiness and the possibility of survival and even flourishing in a new, harsher environment. This new perspective is reinforced as Saeng, while planting the hibiscus in the cold soil, has a moment of realization. She notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar,"" and she admits that she now prefers the bitter melon to a Big Mac. These details show her gradual, unconscious adaptation. Therefore, the final paragraph masterfully ties these threads together. By linking her resolve to try again with the natural cycles of spring—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus—the author shows that Saeng has chosen to engage with her new life. The ""winter hibiscus"" represents her own capacity to endure hardship and eventually bloom. Her vow is not just about passing a test; it is a commitment to her future, demonstrating that she has found a way to carry her past within her while finally putting down roots in her new home."

This final paragraph resolves the story's central conflict by showing how Saeng has begun to reconcile her memories of Laos with her present life in America, transforming her deep sense of loss into determination. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by the past. Failing her driver's test amplifies her feeling of being an outsider, and her visit to the greenhouse triggers a powerful wave of nostalgia and sorrow for her homeland. The sight and smell of familiar plants like the hibiscus, dok Malik, and Madagascar periwinkle vividly recall a world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone,"" causing her to break down and weep. This shows she is initially stuck, measuring her new life against an idealized past and finding it lacking. However, the interaction with her mother serves as a turning point. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test but instead focuses on the plant's practical strength, calling it the ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This shifts the value from nostalgic accuracy to resilient survival. Planting the hibiscus becomes a symbolic act of putting down new roots. As Saeng works in the cold soil, she is surrounded by the familiar sounds and smells of her current home—her mother cooking a bitter melon omelet, a taste she has ""cultivated"" and now prefers ""to a Big Mac."" This shows she is already adapting and building a new life. The overhead geese, once strange, are now ""familiar,"" demonstrating that gradual exposure and the passing of seasons have created a new sense of belonging. Therefore, her vow to retake the test is not just about passing an exam; it is a promise grounded in the cyclical hope of spring. She links her personal growth to the natural world—the returning geese and the budding hibiscus—showing she now believes she too can endure and flourish. The conclusion affirms that while the past is cherished, the future, like the hardy winter hibiscus, is worth fighting for."

Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss for her homeland. The hibiscus and other plants in the florist shop trigger powerful memories of Vietnam—her grandmother’s hair, the well, the monsoon rains—leading to a visceral wave of grief that causes her to weep. This shows her deep connection to a past that feels ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, her mother’s reaction to the ""winter hibiscus"" provides a crucial shift in perspective. Mrs. Panouvong acknowledges that this new plant is not the same as the one from home, but she values its strength to survive the cold, stating, ""That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that resilience and adaptation are valuable, and the act of planting the hibiscus in their new garden is a literal act of putting down roots. The final paragraph connects this act of planting to the natural cycles of her new environment. The Canada geese flying overhead, whose honks were once strange but are now ""familiar,"" demonstrate how repeated exposure can lead to belonging. By linking her personal vow to the return of the geese and the budding of the newly planted hibiscus, Saeng aligns her personal growth with the seasonal cycle. She is no longer just mourning the past; she is looking forward to a future in this new land. The winter hibiscus, which is strong enough to bloom despite the cold, becomes a symbol for Saeng herself.

187	-1	4	4	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake her driver's test in the spring to illustrate her emotional shift from despair to resilience and her growing connection to her new home. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss for her past life in Vietnam, a feeling triggered by her failure on the test and then intensified by the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle vividly transport her back, leading to a wave of grief so powerful that she breaks down and weeps for the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her childhood. This deep sorrow makes her initial failure feel like a confirmation that she doesn't belong. However, the conversation with her mother and the act of gardening mark a turning point. Her mother’s gentle acceptance of both the failed test and the expensive plant provides comfort. More importantly, her mother identifies the hibiscus as a ""winter hibiscus,"" a strong plant that can survive the cold, which serves as a metaphor for their own family's resilience. As Saeng plants it in their American garden, she is literally putting down roots. She notices the familiar, ""cultivated taste"" of the bitter melon her mother is cooking and realizes she prefers it to a Big Mac. She even finds the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" These sensory details show her building a new life and finding value in its unique blend of the old and the new.

By linking her resolve to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the newly planted hibiscus—she aligns her personal growth with the promise of spring.

This final paragraph shows that Saeng has moved from a state of overwhelming grief to one of resilience and determination, themes that are developed throughout the story. Earlier, after failing her test, Saeng is engulfed by a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes"" as she mourns the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her childhood in the greenhouse. The familiar plants she encounters trigger visceral memories of her grandmother and her home, making her feel the pain of her displacement acutely. Her subsequent purchase of the winter hibiscus is an impulsive, expensive attempt to hold onto a piece of that lost world. However, her mother provides a crucial perspective shift.

Earlier in the story, Saeng is consumed by a ""wave of loss"" for her homeland, triggered by the familiar plants in the greenhouse. She weeps for the irretrievable past—her grandmother, the hibiscus hedge, and the well. However, her mother helps shift her perspective by focusing on the new plant's strength to survive the cold, calling it the ""winter hibiscus."" This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of endurance. Planting the hibiscus with her mother is an act of putting down new roots, both literally and metaphorically. Saeng notices the familiar sounds and smells from her kitchen, like the bitter melon, which she has a ""cultivated taste"" for, showing she has begun to integrate her old life with the new. The Canada geese flying overhead, once strange, are now ""familiar,"" illustrating her gradual adaptation. By connecting her personal vow to the natural cycles of spring, the geese's return, and the budding hibiscus, the author shows that Saeng is no longer paralyzed by grief.

192	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring to illustrate her journey from despair to resilience and her evolving relationship with her new home. This final paragraph signifies a pivotal moment of personal growth and acceptance. Earlier in the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes"" as she mourns the irretrievable past represented by the tropical hibiscus and jasmine in the greenhouse. Her failure on the driver's test compounds this feeling of alienation and incompetence in her new country.

Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test, but instead focuses on the plant's hardiness, noting, ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that survival and adaptation, even in a less ideal form, have their own value. Planting the hardy winter hibiscus becomes a symbolic act of putting down roots, both for the plant and for Saeng herself. As she works in the garden, she has a moment of realization, noticing that the honks of the Canada geese are now ""familiar."" This shows she is beginning to integrate her old life with her new one, finding beauty in the bitter melon and comfort in the sounds and rhythms of her current environment. Her vow is therefore not just about a test; it is a promise to herself to keep trying, to grow and bloom when the conditions are right, just like the winter hibiscus that survives the cold to bud again in the spring. The conclusion thus powerfully ties together the story's themes of memory, loss, and the slow, difficult, but hopeful process of building a new life."
193	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring because it powerfully symbolizes her transition from dwelling on the past to embracing her new life, blending resilience with hope. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss for her homeland. The hibiscus and other plants in the greenhouse trigger visceral memories of Vietnam—her grandmother’s hair, the well, the monsoon rains—making her weep for an “irretrievably, irrevocably” lost world. This deep sorrow is compounded by her initial failure, the failed driver’s test representing her struggles to adapt. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is not anger but understanding, and she calls it the “winter hibiscus,” a variety that is strong enough to survive the cold. This reframes the plant not as a poor imitation of the past, but as something valuable and resilient in its own right, mirroring their own ability to endure. By planting the winter hibiscus in their new garden, alongside the bitter melon that Saeng has acquired a taste for, she actively puts down roots in her new environment. The final paragraph connects this act of planting to a cyclical, forward-looking hope. The return of the geese, which have themselves become “familiar,” and the budding of the hibiscus are part of the natural cycle of the seasons. Saeng’s vow ties her personal goal—passing the test—to this cycle of renewal and growth. She is no longer looking back at a lost spring in Vietnam but forward to a new spring in America, indicating that she has found the strength to try again, having accepted that her new life, though different, can still hold beauty and promise. The ending thus completes her emotional journey from grief to resilience, showing that she is ready to face the future.
194	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it symbolizes her newfound resilience and acceptance of her hybrid identity. This final paragraph marks a significant shift from the profound grief she experienced in the greenhouse to a quiet determination, showing that she is beginning to put down roots in her new country, much like the winter hibiscus itself. In the florist shop, Saeng was overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss"" for her past in Vietnam, triggered by the familiar plants. She wept for the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her grandmother and the hibiscus hedge. This despair is contrasted by her mother’s wisdom upon seeing the plant. Mrs. Panouvong does not focus on the cost or the failure, but instead acknowledges the plant's strength, noting that while its flowers ""aren’t as pretty,"" it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This ""winter hibiscus"" becomes a metaphor for the family's own survival—different from what they knew, but resilient and capable of thriving in a new, harsher environment. By connecting her personal goal to the natural cycle of her new home, Saeng shows she is integrating her past and present. She notices that the honks of the Canada geese have become ""familiar,"" and she realizes that many once-strange things have become familiar ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season."" Her vow to try again is therefore not an isolated decision but is intrinsically linked to this budding sense of belonging and the promise of renewal that spring represents. The hibiscus budding and the geese returning are signs that life, though changed, continues and blooms again. Just as the plant will survive the winter and flower, Saeng will gather strength from her memories and her new community to face her challenge again. The conclusion thus provides a hopeful resolution, showing that Saeng is learning to hold on to her heritage while also adapting and growing in her new world."
195	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding a resilient sense of hope and belonging in her new life. Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by the painful contrast between her cherished memories of Laos and the unfamiliar, sometimes harsh, reality of the United States. Failing her driver's test intensifies her feelings of being an outsider, and her subsequent visit to the greenhouse unleashes a flood of memories associated with specific plants, culminating in a wave of grief so strong that she weeps for all that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” However, the conversation with her mother marks a turning point. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test but instead focuses on the positive, calling the hibiscus “beautiful.” More importantly, she reframes the plant’s identity, noting that while it is not identical to the one from home, it is a “winter hibiscus”—strong enough to survive the cold. This idea of resilience is then acted upon as they immediately plant it together. This shared, practical act of putting down roots in their new garden is symbolic. As Saeng works, she finds comfort in the familiar sounds and smells of her mother’s cooking, even acknowledging that her cultivated taste for bitter melon is something she genuinely prefers to American fast food. This signifies a growing acceptance of her blended identity. The honking of the Canada geese, which she now finds “familiar,” solidifies this shift. She realizes that through the “quiet repetition of season upon season,” what was once strange has become part of her life. The concluding vow to retake the test in the spring directly ties her personal growth to this natural cycle of dormancy and renewal. The return of the geese and the budding of the winter hibiscus will signal a new beginning, paralleling Saeng’s own readiness to try again. The paragraph thus ends the story on a note of quiet determination, showing that Saeng is no longer paralyzed by the past but is instead looking forward to the future, having found strength in the enduring roots of her family and culture, now transplanted into new soil.

Throughout the story, Saeng is gripped by a profound sense of displacement and grief. Failing her driver's test accentuates her feeling of not belonging in America. This failure is compounded when she enters the greenhouse and is flooded with memories of her childhood in Laos, triggered by the familiar plants. The hibiscus, or ""saebba,"" evokes a visceral connection to the home she has lost—the garden, the well, and her grandmother. The intensity of her memory leads to a wave of loss so strong that she breaks down and weeps, feeling that her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, the conversation with her mother marks a turning point. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test, but instead focuses on the positive, calling the hibiscus ""beautiful."" More importantly, she reframes the plant’s identity, noting that while it is not exactly the same as the one from home, it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.

By planting the hibiscus in their own garden, Saeng and her mother are literally putting down roots in their new country. The concluding paragraph shows Saeng internalizing this lesson. She observes the Canada geese, whose honks were once strange but are now ""familiar."" This observation signifies her dawning recognition that familiarity and a sense of belonging can grow over time through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season.""

In the greenhouse, the sight of the hibiscus triggers a ""shock of recognition"" that pulls her into vivid memories of her grandmother and her childhood garden, culminating in a wave of loss so strong she ""broke down and wept."" This deep sorrow stems from feeling that her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, her mother helps her reframe this perspective. By calling the plant a ""winter hibiscus,"" Mrs. Panouvong points out that while it is different from the kind they had back home, it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here.

As Saeng works, she notices that things she once found strange, like the bitter melon for dinner and the honking of Canada geese, have become ""almost familiar."" This shows her beginning to find a sense of belonging in her new environment. The hibiscus is no longer just a painful reminder of what was lost; it becomes a symbol of what can survive and even flourish in a new context. Therefore, her vow to retake the test in the spring ties her personal growth to the natural cycle.

The promise to retake the driver's test in the spring is tied directly to the ""winter hibiscus"" budding and the geese returning, symbols she has come to accept as part of her life. Earlier in the story, Saeng is struck by a ""shock of recognition"" upon seeing the hibiscus, but this recognition initially brings pain, emphasizing everything that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her breakdown in the florist shop shows her feeling rootless and disconnected. However, her mother provides a crucial perspective, noting that while this American hibiscus is not identical to the one from home, it is strong enough ""to make it through the cold months."" This idea of resilience is what Saeng internalizes. By planting the hibiscus and tending to it, she actively participates in nurturing a piece of her heritage while helping it adapt to a new climate, just as she must. The conclusion shows Saeng beginning to find a balance between her two worlds. She acknowledges that many things she once found strange, like the honking of Canada geese, have become ""familiar"" through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season.""

This profound grief is compounded by her immediate failure—failing the driver's test, a symbol of her inability to navigate her new world. Her reaction is to tear a leaf from the hibiscus and shred it ""to bits,"" an action that mirrors her feeling of being shattered.

She calls it a ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers ""aren’t as pretty,"" it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that adaptation and resilience are more valuable than perfect replication of the past. The act of planting the hibiscus together is a physical manifestation of putting down new roots in the cold, hard American soil. This newfound resilience is solidified as Saeng works alone in the garden. She notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, is now ""familiar."" She realizes that ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" many things in her new life have become almost familiar. This shows she is slowly building a new sense of belonging.

She views her past in Vietnam as ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone,"" feeling disconnected and defeated. The purchase of the hibiscus is an impulsive attempt to hold onto a piece of that past, but it initially only deepens her sorrow. However, through her interaction with her mother and the act of planting, Saeng begins to find a new perspective.

This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of endurance and adaptation. As Saeng works in the garden, she has a moment of realization, noting that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar."" The honking of the Canada geese, once strange, is now a recognized sound. By linking her decision to retake the test to the natural cycles of spring—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the newly planted hibiscus—Saeng aligns her personal growth with the rhythms of her new environment. She is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead looking forward, finding strength in the hybrid identity that blends her past (symbolized by the hibiscus) with her present (the winter it must endure). The conclusion thus affirms the story's central theme: that while loss is profound, resilience is built by planting roots in new soil and finding the courage to try again."
201	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding resilience and hope for the future. This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict by symbolizing Saeng’s acceptance of her new life and her determination to succeed in it. Throughout the story, Saeng is engulfed by a deep sense of loss for her past life in Vietnam. The sight of the hibiscus in the greenhouse triggers powerful, visceral memories of her grandmother and her childhood home, leading to an overwhelming wave of grief where she ""broke down and wept."" This shows how disconnected and defeated she feels in her new country, a feeling compounded by her failure to pass the driver's test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt. However, the conversation with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" mark a turning point. Her mother acknowledges that this new plant is different—""not as pretty""—but notes its crucial strength: it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This teaches Saeng a lesson in resilience; to survive, one must adapt, just as the plant does. The imagery in the final paragraph connects Saeng's personal growth to the natural cycle of the seasons, a motif that runs through the story's conclusion. As she plants the hibiscus, she hears the Canada geese overhead and realizes their honks have become ""familiar."" This shows she is slowly putting down roots and that her new environment is becoming less strange. Her vow is therefore timed with the hopeful, renewing season of spring, linking her personal resolve to the budding of the hardy hibiscus and the return of the geese. It demonstrates that she is no longer paralyzed by the past but is instead looking forward, ready to try again. The winter hibiscus becomes a symbol of her own journey—it is different from the one in Laos, but it is resilient, and its ability to survive the winter gives Saeng the courage to believe she can, too. The ending thus provides a powerful sense of closure, showing that Saeng has chosen to embrace her new life with the same strength as the winter hibiscus, turning her grief into determined hope."
202	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her transformation from being paralyzed by loss to finding resilience and hope for the future. This final paragraph signifies that Saeng has begun to reconcile her past with her present, choosing to adapt and grow in her new environment. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by grief for her lost home in Vietnam. The sight of the hibiscus in the greenhouse triggers a “shock of recognition” and a flood of memories about her grandmother and her childhood, culminating in a “wave of loss so deep and strong” that she breaks down. This shows how her past is a source of pain that makes navigating her new life, symbolized by failing the driver’s test, especially difficult. However, her mother provides a crucial perspective. She accepts the expensive “winter hibiscus,” noting that while its flowers “aren’t as pretty” as the ones from home, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters.” This teaches Saeng that survival and strength are valuable, even if the form is different. The act of planting the hibiscus with her mother is a turning point. As she works in the cold soil, she becomes aware of the familiar, comforting sounds and smells of her current home—the sizzle of cooking and the “cultivated taste” of bitter melon she has come to prefer. She then notices the Canada geese, whose honks are now “familiar.” This shows she is putting down new roots and that aspects of her American life are becoming meaningful. Her vow to retake the test is therefore linked to the natural cycles of her new home—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of the hardy winter hibiscus. She is no longer looking only backward but forward, aligning her personal growth with the resilience of the plant and the promise of spring. The conclusion thus emphasizes that by accepting a new kind of beauty and strength, Saeng finds the courage to try again.
203	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it powerfully symbolizes her shift from being trapped in the past to finding a resilient hope for the future. This final paragraph resolves the story's central conflict: Saeng’s struggle with her identity and sense of loss after immigrating from Vietnam. Her initial failure and the subsequent emotional breakdown in the greenhouse stem from a profound grief for everything she has left behind. The hibiscus and other plants trigger visceral memories of her grandmother and her childhood home, making her feel the loss as ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, the conversation with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" become a turning point. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test but instead focuses on the plant's strength, noting that ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, that’s what matters."" This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol of endurance and adaptation, not just memory. Saeng then begins to notice other familiar things in her new environment, like the taste of bitter melon and the honking of Canada geese, realizing that through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" they have become almost familiar. Therefore, her vow to try again is intrinsically linked to the natural cycles of her new home. By connecting her personal goal to the spring—when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds—she aligns her own growth with the resilience of the winter hibiscus. She is no longer just mourning a lost past but is putting down roots in the present, finding the strength to face challenges again. The ending thus completes her emotional arc, moving from despair to a determined hope that is intertwined with her new life."
204	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring to illustrate her emotional transformation from despair to resilient hope, mirroring the qualities of the “winter hibiscus” itself. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss for her homeland. Failing her driver’s test intensifies this feeling, and her subsequent visit to the greenhouse unleashes a flood of memories, making her “break down and wept” for the “irretrievably, irrevocably gone” world of her childhood. The hibiscus and other plants act as powerful triggers, connecting her to a past that seems completely lost, and her initial purchase of the plant is an impulsive, costly attempt to grasp a piece of that world. However, her mother’s reaction provides a crucial shift in perspective. Mrs. Panouvong, though initially shocked by the price, recognizes the plant's symbolic value. She identifies it as a “winter hibiscus,” noting that while its flowers “aren’t as pretty” as the ones from home, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters.” This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor replica of the past, but as a symbol of survival and adaptation. This lesson is cemented by the story’s final scene, where Saeng, now alone in the garden, experiences a moment of acceptance. The sounds and smells from the kitchen—the bitter melon she has a “cultivated taste” for—and the “familiar” honking of the Canada geese show her that new roots and new familiarities are possible. The final paragraph weaves these threads together. The promise to retake the test is explicitly linked to the natural cycles of her new environment: the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of the newly planted winter hibiscus. Her personal resolve is no longer isolated but is now part of a larger, hopeful process of renewal. Just as the hardy plant will survive the winter and bloom again, Saeng vows to persevere through her own setback. The conclusion thus transforms the hibiscus from a mere reminder of loss into a symbol of enduring strength and the specific, seasonal promise of a second chance, allowing the story to end on a note of forward-looking determination.

Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss for her homeland. The hibiscus and other plants in the greenhouse trigger visceral memories of her grandmother and her life in Vietnam, leading to a wave of grief so strong that she breaks down and weeps. This shows her initial inability to reconcile her past with her present life in the United States, a feeling compounded by her failure of the driver's test, which represents her struggles to adapt. However, her mother provides a crucial shift in perspective. She does not scold Saeng for the expensive plant or the failed test but instead calls the hibiscus “strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This reframes the plant not as a poor imitation of the past, but as a symbol of survival and endurance in a new, harsher climate. By planting the ""winter hibiscus"" in their own garden, Saeng performs her first concrete act of putting down new roots, literally and figuratively, in America. The final paragraph connects this act of planting to the natural cycle of the seasons, a ""quiet repetition"" that has already made unfamiliar things, like the honking of Canada geese, become ""almost familiar."" Her vow to retake the test when the hibiscus buds in the spring shows that she has internalized her mother’s lesson. She is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead looking forward, aligning her personal growth with the resilient plant and the returning geese.

206	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it powerfully symbolizes her newfound resilience and acceptance of her hybrid identity. This resolution is earned through her emotional journey in the florist shop, where the sight of the hibiscus triggers a visceral wave of nostalgia and grief for her lost home in Vietnam. She weeps for “the hibiscus hedge, the well, [and] her gentle grandmother,” realizing these are “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” This catharsis is necessary for her to begin moving forward. The subsequent interaction with her mother is crucial to this transformation. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test, but instead focuses on the plant’s practical strength, calling it the “winter hibiscus” that is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters.” This reframes the hibiscus from a fragile relic of the past into a symbol of endurance and adaptation. Planting the hibiscus together becomes an act of putting down roots, both literally and metaphorically, in their new environment. As Saeng works in the garden, she notes how the sounds and smells of her mother’s cooking—the bitter melon with its “cultivated taste”—are deeply comforting. She admits she prefers it to a Big Mac, signaling an acceptance of her cultural heritage within her new context. This theme of the unfamiliar becoming familiar is reinforced as she hears the Canada geese and realizes their honks are now “clear and—yes—familiar.” The story’s final paragraph ties all these elements together: the melting snow and returning geese represent the cyclical nature of life and new beginnings, while the budding hibiscus represents her own potential for growth. Her vow to retake the test is therefore not just about driving; it is a promise to herself to face the challenges of her new world with the same hardiness as the winter hibiscus, having finally found a way to carry her past within her as she moves forward.
207	-1	4	4	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake her driver's test in the spring because it powerfully symbolizes her transition from being trapped in the past to finding the resilience to embrace her new life. This final paragraph shows that Saeng has internalized the lesson of the ""winter hibiscus"" itself—a plant that, as her mother notes, isn't as pretty as the tropical kind but is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" Saeng's initial despair in the greenhouse was born from the painful realization that her old world was ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, by planting the hibiscus in her own cold, hard soil and caring for it, she begins to put down her own roots. The details surrounding her vow illustrate this newfound acceptance and strength. She notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar,"" showing she is slowly adapting. The smell of the bitter melon, a ""cultivated taste"" that she ""much preferred... to a Big Mac,"" represents her choosing to value her own heritage within her new environment rather than rejecting it. Her vow is timed with the natural cycles of her new home—the melting snow and the return of the geese—demonstrating that she is now looking forward and aligning her personal goals with the rhythms of this new world. The budding of the hibiscus she just planted represents hope and future growth, both for the plant and for herself. Therefore, the conclusion does not simply state she will retry a test; it signifies that Saeng has chosen to persevere, having found a way to blend memory with resilience, and is finally ready to move forward."
208	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it powerfully symbolizes her acceptance of her new life and renewed sense of hope. This final paragraph marks a significant emotional shift from the profound grief Saeng experiences in the greenhouse. There, the sight of the hibiscus and other plants like the jasmine (“Dok Malik”) had overwhelmed her with a “wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes,” making her mourn for her grandmother, her old home, and a world that was “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” Her failure of the driver’s test, a symbol of her struggles to adapt, had compounded this despair. However, the interaction with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" begin her healing. Her mother’s gentle reaction to both the failed test and the expensive plant provides comfort and understanding. More importantly, her mother reframes the hibiscus not as an inferior replica of the past, but as something strong and valuable in its own right: “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters.” This lesson directly influences Saeng’s resolution. By planting this hardy plant, Saeng is literally putting down roots in her new environment, accepting that life here is different but can still grow and thrive. This newfound perspective is solidified as she finishes her task. She notices that the honks of the Canada geese are now “familiar,” and realizes that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar.” This shows her growing adaptation. Therefore, her vow to retake the test in the spring ties her personal goal to the natural cycle of resilience and rebirth. The budding of the hibiscus, the return of the geese, and the melting snow are all signs of a new beginning, mirroring the internal spring occurring within Saeng herself. The conclusion affirms that while she cherishes her past, she is now ready to move forward with determination in her new home."

This final vow represents a crucial turning point in her attitude toward her new life in the United States. Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by a profound sense of loss for her homeland. The sight of the hibiscus in the greenhouse triggers a ""shock of recognition"" so intense it brings her to tears as she remembers everything she has lost—her grandmother, the garden, the well. This wave of grief makes her current life feel foreign and difficult, symbolized by her failure of the driver's test. However, her mother provides a key perspective when she calls the plant a ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that resilience and adaptation are valuable forms of strength. Planting the hibiscus with her mother becomes an act of putting down roots, both literally and metaphorically. As she works in the garden, Saeng has a revelation. She realizes that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar."" The honking of the Canada geese, which she once found strange, now sounds clear and familiar. This shows her beginning to accept and find a place for herself in this new world, blending the old with the new, just as she enjoys the bitter melon her friends find strange. Therefore, the concluding paragraph powerfully encapsulates this newfound resilience. Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring directly links her personal growth to the natural cycles of her new home. The return of the geese and the budding of the winter hibiscus become symbols of hope and renewal. She is no longer paralyzed by the past but is instead looking forward, using the strength of the hardy ""winter hibiscus"" as her model to persevere.

Throughout the story, Saeng is burdened by her failure and a deep sense of displacement, which culminates in her emotional breakdown in the greenhouse as she mourns the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her childhood. The hibiscus plant she buys is a painful reminder that the flowers in America are not the same as the ones from home; they are a ""winter hibiscus,"" a different, hardier version. Her mother’s acceptance of the plant and explanation that its strength is what matters—that it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months""—provides the crucial turning point. This teaches Saeng that survival and beauty are possible even in a new, harsher environment. The final paragraph connects this newfound understanding to the natural cycles Saeng is beginning to recognize. She notices the Canada geese flying overhead, and their honks, which once seemed strange, are now ""familiar."" This shows she is slowly putting down roots and adapting.

212	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s emotional transformation from despair to hope, marking her acceptance of her new life and the beginning of her resilience. This resolution is earned through the powerful sensory journey she experiences in the greenhouse, which connects her past to her present. After failing her driver's test, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss and dislocation. Her visit to the florist shop plunges her into memories of Vietnam, triggered by the ""blood-red blossom"" of the hibiscus, the dok Malik (jasmine), and the Madagascar periwinkle. These plants are not merely familiar; they are visceral links to her grandmother, her home, and her childhood. However, this connection initially deepens her sorrow, leading her to weep for all that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her purchase of the hibiscus is an attempt to hold onto a piece of that past, but she initially sees it as inferior, telling her mother, ""It’s not a real one.""

Even the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, is now ""familiar."" By vowing to retake the test in the spring, a season of renewal aligned with the budding of the hibiscus and the return of the geese, Saeng demonstrates that she has internalized her mother’s wisdom. The ""winter hibiscus"" represents the ability to endure hardship and eventually bloom again. Her vow, therefore, is not just about passing a driving test; it is a commitment to persevere and grow in her new environment, blending the strength from her past with the possibilities of her future."

However, the interaction with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" initiates her recovery. Her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant shifts from shock to quiet understanding, focusing not on the cost or the failed test, but on the plant's symbolic value. She calls it a “winter hibiscus,” noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters.” This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol not of pure loss, but of endurance and adaptation. Saeng internalizes this perspective as she works in the garden, noticing that the once-strange honks of Canada geese have become “familiar” and that she has developed a cultivated taste for the bitter melon her friends dislike.

After failing her test, she is overwhelmed by grief, and her visit to the greenhouse triggers a flood of memories from Vietnam, culminating in her breaking down and weeping for a world that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” The hibiscus she finds, however, is a “winter hibiscus,” a different, hardier variety that can survive the cold.

She finds that she has developed a ""cultivated taste"" for the bitter melon her mother is cooking, a sign that she is adapting and finding value in her new life. Furthermore, she realizes that the honking of the Canada geese, which she once found strange, has now become ""familiar."" These small acceptances demonstrate that she is slowly building a new sense of belonging. By linking her decision to retry the test to the natural cycles of the geese returning and the hardy hibiscus budding, the author shows that Saeng has chosen to align herself with this new environment. She is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead looking forward, using the enduring ""winter hibiscus"" as a model of strength. The conclusion thus transforms the story from one about mourning the past into one about the quiet, persistent courage required to build a future, demonstrating that hope can take root even in a harsh new climate."
221	-1	4	4	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring because it powerfully symbolizes her transition from being anchored in the past to finding the resilience to build a new life. This final paragraph represents a synthesis of the story's central conflict—Saeng's deep sense of loss for her homeland and her difficult adjustment to a new country. After failing her test and experiencing a wave of grief in the greenhouse, triggered by memories of her grandmother and their garden in Laos, Saeng is initially overwhelmed. She weeps for a world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her mother, however, provides a crucial perspective by calling the plant the ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This idea of resilience is what Saeng internalizes. As she plants the hibiscus, she experiences a shift in her perception of her new environment. The honking of the Canada geese, once strange, is now ""clear and—yes—familiar."" She realizes that through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season,"" many things have become ingrained in her life, just as the bitter melon for dinner is a cultivated taste she prefers to a Big Mac. By linking her personal goal of retaking the test to the natural cycles of spring, the geese's return, and the budding of the hardy hibiscus, Saeng aligns her own growth with the endurance of the world around her. The conclusion shows that she is not forgetting her past, but is instead learning to draw strength from it to face the future, finding a new kind of hope rooted in the familiar rhythms of her new home."
222	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her newfound sense of resilience and hope, mirroring the ""winter hibiscus"" she has just planted. This final paragraph resolves Saeng’s emotional journey, which began with a deep sense of loss and failure. In the greenhouse, she was overwhelmed by the memories of her lost home in Vietnam and wept for her grandmother, the hibiscus hedge, and the well—all ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This wave of grief was triggered by her failure, making the test represent more than just an exam; it symbolized her struggle to adapt to a new and often alienating world. However, through the act of buying and planting the hibiscus with her mother, Saeng begins to find a path toward acceptance. Her mother’s reaction is crucial; instead of anger over the cost, she recognizes the plant's symbolic value and calls it ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This winter hibiscus represents the family's own resilience—the ability to survive and put down roots in a harsh, new environment. Saeng’s work in the garden, accompanied by the familiar smells and sounds of her mother cooking bitter melon, grounds her in her new reality. She realizes that many things she once found strange, like the taste of bitter melon or the call of Canada geese, have become ""almost familiar"" through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season."" Therefore, the concluding vow ties these themes together. By linking her personal goal to the natural cycles of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding, Saeng aligns her own growth with the enduring strength of nature. The paragraph confirms that she is no longer paralyzed by grief or failure but is instead looking forward, ready to try again. Her resilience, like the plant's, has been firmly planted in the new soil of her life."
224	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it represents her final transition from being anchored in the past to finding the resilience to build a new life in the present. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss for her homeland and her grandmother, a feeling triggered by her failure and then magnified in the greenhouse. The familiar plants—hibiscus, jasmine, periwinkle—act as powerful conduits to her memories, and her subsequent weeping is a release of the grief for an “irretrievably, irrevocably gone” world. This deep sorrow makes her initial state one of helplessness. However, the conversation with her mother provides a crucial shift in perspective. Her mother is not angry about the expensive plant or the failed test, but instead focuses on the hibiscus's practical strength, calling it the “winter hibiscus” that is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This reframes the plant from being a poor substitute for the past into a symbol of survival and adaptation. The act of planting it together in the cold, hard soil is a physical act of putting down new roots, mirroring their own efforts to establish a life in a new country. The final paragraph synthesizes these themes. Saeng connects her personal growth to the natural cycles of her new environment. The returning geese, which she notes have become “familiar,” and the budding of the hardy hibiscus become markers of a future she is now willing to engage with. By vowing to retake the test in the spring, she is no longer running from her new reality but is instead aligning her own goals with the resilient rhythm of the seasons. The conclusion thus signifies her acceptance of a hybrid identity, one that honors her past through memory while finding the strength, like the winter hibiscus, to survive and eventually flourish in a new world.
225	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s final transformation from being overwhelmed by the past to finding the resolve to face her future. Throughout the story, Saeng is engulfed by a profound sense of loss for her homeland, triggered by her failure on the driver's test and the powerful memories associated with the plants in the greenhouse. Her breakdown in the florist shop reveals how disconnected and sad she feels, viewing her old life in Vietnam as ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, through her interaction with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus,"" she begins to find a new perspective. Her mother points out that while this American hibiscus is different, it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months,"" teaching Saeng a lesson in resilience and adaptation. This idea is reinforced when Saeng, while planting, hears the Canada geese and realizes their honks are no longer strange but ""familiar."" This shows her slow, subconscious process of putting down roots in her new country. By linking her personal goal of retaking the test to the natural, hopeful cycle of the seasons—the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus in spring—the author demonstrates that Saeng has found a new source of strength. Her vow is not just about passing a test; it is a promise to herself to grow and persevere, just like the winter hibiscus, blending her past memories with a newfound hope for the future."
226	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring to illustrate her emotional transformation from despair to resilient hope, mirroring the qualities of the winter hibiscus itself. This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict—Saeng’s struggle with her new identity and her profound sense of loss—by showing how she finds the strength to face the future. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by grief for her lost home in Vietnam; the visit to the greenhouse triggers powerful memories of her grandmother, the *saebba* hedge, and the well, culminating in her breaking down because it is all “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” Her failure of the driver's test symbolizes her broader feelings of failure and alienation in this new country. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant provides a pivotal shift. Instead of anger, her mother shows understanding and focuses on the plant's strength, calling it the “winter hibiscus” that is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters.” This moment, followed by the shared act of planting, helps Saeng begin to reconcile her past with her present. She realizes that, like the bitter melon she has cultivated a taste for and the now-familiar honks of the Canada geese, new things can become meaningful over time. The budding of the hibiscus in spring therefore becomes a symbol of both memory and new growth. By linking her personal vow to the natural cycles of return and rebirth—the melting snow, the geese, and the budding plant—the author shows that Saeng is no longer paralyzed by the past. Instead, she has found a fragile but determined hope, choosing to face her challenges again with the enduring strength of the winter hibiscus.

This final paragraph resolves the story's central conflict—Saeng’s feelings of dislocation and loss—by showing her shift from despair to determined hope. Earlier in the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss"" for her homeland, and her failure of the driver’s test represents her struggle to adapt. The hibiscus she finds, a ""winter hibiscus,"" is not identical to the one from Vietnam but is strong enough to survive the cold, just as her mother points out. This teaches Saeng a crucial lesson about resilience and finding familiar beauty in a new context. By connecting her personal goal to the natural cycle of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding, Saeng aligns her own growth with the seasons. She is no longer just mourning an ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" past, but is instead planting roots in her new environment, much like the hardy plant. The promise to try again in the spring shows she has accepted that her Laotian heritage and American life can coexist, and she is now ready to move forward with patience and strength. This ending completes her emotional journey from weeping in the greenhouse to working in her garden, looking toward the future with quiet confidence."
229	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring to show her transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding resilience and hope for the future. This final paragraph connects Saeng’s personal growth directly to the natural world, which has been a source of both painful memories and new strength. After failing her driver’s test, Saeng is consumed by a sense of displacement and grief for her lost home in Vietnam. This is powerfully illustrated in the florist shop, where the sight of the hibiscus triggers visceral memories of her grandmother and her childhood, culminating in a wave of loss that makes her weep. She feels her past is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant provides a pivotal shift in perspective. Instead of anger, her mother focuses on the plant’s value, calling it a “winter hibiscus” that is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters.” This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of survival and adaptation. The act of planting it together in the cold, hard soil is a physical manifestation of putting down new roots in a foreign land. Furthermore, Saeng realizes that things she once found strange, like the bitter melon for dinner or the honking of Canada geese, have become familiar through the “quiet repetition of season upon season.” By linking her resolve to retry the test with the cyclical return of spring, the melting snow, the geese, and the budding hibiscus, the author shows that Saeng has internalized this lesson of resilience. The natural world, which first plunged her into mourning, now provides the timeline for her renewed determination. She is no longer looking only backward but is instead looking forward, aligning her personal goals with the hopeful, renewing cycles of her new environment. The conclusion, therefore, affirms the story’s central theme that while the past is cherished, life and hope persist and can flourish anew, even in a different season.

This final paragraph serves as the culmination of Saeng's emotional journey, showing how she has begun to reconcile her past in Laos with her present in America. Throughout the story, Saeng is acutely aware of everything she has lost—her homeland, her grandmother, and the familiar plants that were part of her old life. Her failure on the driver's test intensifies this feeling, making her feel like a failure in her new country as well. The subsequent visit to the greenhouse plunges her into a wave of visceral grief, as the familiar plants trigger powerful memories of ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" things. However, her mother's reaction to the expensive hibiscus is pivotal. Instead of anger, her mother shows understanding, recognizing the plant's symbolic value. She calls it the ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This reframes the plant, and by extension Saeng's experience, not as a poor replacement but as a symbol of strength and adaptation. This new perspective allows Saeng to see her surroundings with fresh eyes. As she plants the hibiscus, she notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" She realizes that ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" many things in her new life have taken root.

Her mother observes that while this American variety is not identical to the one from their homeland, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, that’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that adaptation and strength are possible, even if the new life is different. By planting the hibiscus in their own garden, Saeng literally puts down roots in her new country, an act that mirrors her internal shift. Her sensory appreciation for the smells and sounds of her mother cooking bitter melon, a ""cultivated taste"" she prefers to a Big Mac, shows she is already building a new life that incorporates her heritage. The honking of the Canada geese, which she now finds ""familiar,"" signifies her growing acclimatization. Therefore, her vow to retake the driver's test in the spring aligns her personal goal with the natural cycles of her new environment. The return of the geese and the budding of the hardy hibiscus will signal a season of renewal, and Saeng chooses to see it as a time for her own new beginning. The conclusion shows that while Saeng will always cherish her past, she is now ready to actively engage with her future in America."

This wave of sorrow causes her to break down, emphasizing how disconnected she feels. However, her mother’s reaction to the plant provides a crucial shift. Instead of scolding her for the cost, her mother calls it a ""winter hibiscus,"" a strong plant that can survive the cold. This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of endurance and adaptation. By planting the hibiscus in their own garden, Saeng and her mother perform an act of putting down roots, both literal and metaphorical, in their new environment.

This shows her growing connection to her new home, where elements of her culture can persist and thrive. Similarly, the Canada geese flying overhead, once strange, now sound ""familiar."" This detail highlights her gradual acclimatization, mirroring the hibiscus's ability to weather a foreign climate. Therefore, the concluding vow ties these threads together.

The sight and scent of the hibiscus, the jasmine, and the periwinkle trigger visceral memories of her grandmother and her childhood home in Vietnam, culminating in a wave of grief so strong that she weeps for all that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This deep sorrow shows how her failure on the test symbolizes a larger failure to adapt, making her feel disconnected from her new world. However, the conversation with her mother provides a crucial shift in perspective. Her mother, though initially shocked by the cost of the hibiscus, responds with understanding and compassion. She does not scold Saeng for her failure but instead focuses on the plant, naming it with a familiar term, ""dok faeng-noi."" Most importantly, she re-frames the hibiscus not as a poor imitation of the past, but as something valuable in its own right—a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This act of planting the hibiscus in their new, cold garden is a symbolic act of putting down roots and choosing to endure. The final paragraph builds on this symbolism. Saeng links her own resolve to the resilient natural cycles of her new home.

She is no longer pining for an irretrievable past but is instead looking forward to a future where she can put down roots and try again. The ending thus completes her emotional journey from despair to resilience, showing that she has found the strength to endure her own ""winter"" and is ready to bloom."
243	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s emotional transformation from despair to resilience and acceptance of her new life. This final vow represents a pivotal moment of hope and determination, directly contrasting with the overwhelming grief she experienced in the greenhouse. Earlier, after failing her driver's test, Saeng is consumed by a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes"" as she mourns the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her childhood. The hibiscus and other plants trigger powerful memories of Vietnam, making her current life in the United States feel alien and cold. However, the conversation with her mother acts as a catalyst for change. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test; instead, she focuses on the positive, calling the hibiscus ""beautiful"" and highlighting its strength to ""make it through the cold months."" This practical, nurturing response teaches Saeng to see value in adaptation. By planting the ""winter hibiscus,"" Saeng literally puts down roots in the new soil, a symbolic act mirrored in her changing perceptions. As she works, she notices that the honking of Canada geese, once strange, is now ""familiar."" She even admits a preference for the bitter melon her mother is cooking over a Big Mac, acknowledging that she has developed ""a cultivated taste"" for her new life. The paragraph’s structure links her personal growth to the natural cycle: the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding hibiscus all signify renewal and the promise of spring. Her decision to retake the test ""in the spring"" is therefore not just about passing an exam, but about embracing a future where her past and present can coexist. The conclusion shows that Saeng has moved from being paralyzed by grief to finding the strength to begin again, anchored by the symbolic winter hibiscus that endures the cold to bloom another season."
244	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has moved from a state of paralyzing grief to one of resilient hope, finding a new strength rooted in her heritage and her adapted life. The encounter with the hibiscus and other plants in the greenhouse initially triggers a profound wave of sorrow for everything she has lost—her homeland, her grandmother, and her past. This emotional breakdown is a necessary catharsis. However, by the end of the story, Saeng begins to integrate these memories into her present reality. The ""winter hibiscus"" itself becomes the central symbol of this transformation. Her mother acknowledges that this American hibiscus is not identical to the one from their garden in Laos; its flowers ""aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This quality of endurance is what matters. By planting it in their new garden, Saeng and her mother are literally putting down roots, choosing to nurture a piece of their past in their new soil. This act, combined with the comforting sounds and smells of her mother cooking a familiar bitter melon omelet, grounds Saeng in the present. She even admits to preferring this taste to a Big Mac, signifying an acceptance of her identity. Furthermore, Saeng’s perception of her new environment shifts. The honking of the Canada geese, which she once found strange, is now ""clear and—yes—familiar."" This shows that through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" the unfamiliar has begun to become familiar. The geese’s migratory pattern provides a natural, cyclical promise of return. By linking her own resolve to this natural cycle—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus—Saeng aligns her personal journey with the dependable rhythm of the seasons. Her vow to retake the test in the spring is therefore not just about passing a driving exam; it is a symbol of her renewed courage to engage with her new world, armed with the strength she draws from her past. The conclusion thus powerfully illustrates that Saeng has found a way to honor her grief without being defeated by it, embracing a future where her two worlds can coexist."
245	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s emotional transformation from despair to hope, symbolizing her reconciliation of her past and present identities. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss for her homeland and childhood in Vietnam, triggered by her failure on the driver’s test and the powerful memories evoked in the greenhouse. The hibiscus and other plants serve as potent reminders of everything she has “irretrievably, irrevocably” lost, causing her to break down. However, her interaction with her mother and the act of planting the “winter hibiscus” become a turning point. Her mother does not focus on the failed test or the expensive plant but instead focuses on the plant’s resilience, noting that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This shifts the symbolic meaning of the hibiscus from a mere relic of the past to a symbol of endurance and adaptation. Saeng internalizes this lesson. As she plants the hibiscus, she begins to notice familiar elements in her new environment, such as the taste of bitter melon and the call of the Canada geese. She realizes that many things she once found strange have become “familiar to her now through the quiet repetition of season upon season.” The concluding vow to retake the test in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, directly ties her personal resolve to the natural cycle. The spring represents renewal, and the budding of the hardy “winter hibiscus” symbolizes her own potential for growth and success. By linking her second attempt to these signs of resilience and cyclical return, the author shows that Saeng is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead learning to plant roots and thrive in her new world, embracing both her heritage and her future.
246	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it signifies her acceptance of her new life and her renewed sense of hope and resilience. This final paragraph shows that Saeng has progressed from being overwhelmed by grief for her lost past to finding a way to integrate her heritage with her present reality, creating a foundation for her future. Throughout the story, Saeng is confronted by a deep sense of displacement and loss. Failing her driver’s test is a concrete example of her struggles to adapt, and her subsequent visit to the greenhouse unleashes a flood of memories from Vietnam, causing her to ""break down and weep"" for a world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" The plants she finds, like the hibiscus and jasmine, are powerful sensory links to her grandmother, her home, and a life that has vanished. However, the ""winter hibiscus"" becomes a crucial symbol of this transition. Her mother acknowledges that while this American hibiscus is different—""not as pretty"" as the ones from home—it is strong enough to survive the cold. This insight helps Saeng see the value in resilience and adaptation. The act of planting the hibiscus together in their new garden is a physical act of putting down roots, both for the plant and for their family. Saeng’s growing appreciation for the bitter melon and the now ""familiar"" honk of the Canada geese shows her slowly building connections to her new environment. Therefore, the concluding vow ties Saeng’s personal growth to the natural cycle of the seasons. She aligns her personal goal of retaking the test with the spring, a time of renewal when the geese return and the hibiscus she has just planted will bud. This parallels her own journey; she will allow herself time to grow stronger, just like the winter hibiscus, and try again. The ending confirms that Saeng is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead looking forward, having found a way to carry her past within her as she moves ahead in her new home."
247	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding a resilient hope for the future. This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life and a commitment to persevere, themes that are carefully developed throughout the story. Saeng begins the story weighed down by failure and nostalgia. Failing her driver's test is more than a simple setback; it symbolizes her struggle to adapt to American culture. Her subsequent discovery of the hibiscus plant in the florist shop triggers a powerful wave of memories of her homeland, culminating in an overwhelming sense of loss that causes her to weep. The hibiscus and other plants like the dok Malik are visceral connections to a past she feels is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This deep sorrow highlights her initial inability to reconcile her past with her present. However, the interaction with her mother marks a turning point. Instead of expressing anger over the expensive plant or the failed test, Mrs. Panouvong reacts with understanding and gentle wisdom. She recognizes the plant as a ""winter hibiscus,"" a hardy variety that can survive the cold, and her comment, ""That’s what matters,"" reframes the symbol of the hibiscus from one of pure nostalgia to one of adaptation and strength. Together, they plant it in their new garden, an act that signifies putting down roots and choosing to grow in a new environment. This is paralleled by Saeng’s own realization as she hears the Canada geese; she acknowledges that many things she once found strange have become ""almost familiar"" through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" The concluding paragraph brings these elements together. Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring is directly linked to the natural cycles she now observes—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the newly planted hibiscus. She is no longer looking back to an irretrievable past but forward to a future that incorporates both her heritage and her new reality. The hibiscus is no longer just a memory of Vietnam but a promise of survival and bloom in America. Therefore, the ending affirms that Saeng has found a source of strength, allowing her to face her challenges with renewed determination and hope."
248	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her emotional shift from despair to resilient hope, mirroring the ""winter hibiscus"" she has just planted. This final paragraph resolves the central conflict of the story: Saeng’s struggle with her identity and sense of belonging in a new country. After failing her test, she is overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss"" for her homeland, a grief so powerful it causes her to weep in the greenhouse. The familiar plants she finds there—the hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle—initially sharpen this sense of irretrievable loss, making her mourn her grandmother, her old home, and the life ""a blink, a channel switch, a boat ride"" away that is now gone. However, the act of planting the winter hibiscus with her mother becomes a pivotal moment of acceptance and adaptation. Her mother recognizes that this new plant, though not identical to the one from home, is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This resilience becomes a metaphor for Saeng herself. As she gardens, she notices that the honks of the Canada geese, once strange, are now ""familiar,"" and she admits that many things have become familiar through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" This includes her cultivated taste for bitter melon, which she prefers to a Big Mac, symbolizing how her old and new lives are integrating. Therefore, her vow is not just about a driver’s test. It is a promise to herself to keep trying in this new world, to root herself and grow. By linking her next attempt to the natural cycles of spring and the budding of the resilient hibiscus, the author shows that Saeng has found a new source of strength. She is no longer paralyzed by grief for the past but is looking forward to a future where she, like the winter hibiscus, can survive, adapt, and eventually bloom."
249	-1	4	4	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring because it powerfully illustrates her character's emotional growth and the story's central theme of building a new life by blending the past with the present. This final paragraph marks a significant shift from the despair Saeng felt earlier. In the greenhouse, she was overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes,"" grieving for her grandmother, her home, and everything ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" The plants had initially served only as painful reminders of all she had lost, making her break down and weep. The failed driver's test symbolized her struggle to navigate and succeed in this unfamiliar country, compounding her sense of failure and alienation. However, her interaction with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" becomes a turning point. Her mother, instead of scolding her for the expensive purchase, recognizes its deeper value and calls it ""beautiful."" She wisely re-frames the plant's identity, noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng a crucial lesson about resilience and adaptation. As Saeng plants the hibiscus, she begins to internalize this lesson. She notices the familiar, comforting sounds and smells from her kitchen—the sizzle of oil and the pungent bitter melon, a ""cultivated taste"" she now prefers to a Big Mac. Even the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" Her vow is therefore not just about a test; it is a symbol of her newfound hope and determination. By linking her next attempt to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the resilient winter hibiscus—Saeng shows she is ready to put down roots. She is no longer paralyzed by grief for the past but is learning to integrate memories of her old home with the realities of her new one. The conclusion thus shows that Saeng has found the strength to face the future, using the resilience of the winter hibiscus as a model for her own life."
250	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her shift from despair to resilience, symbolizing her acceptance of her new life while still honoring her past. This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict by connecting Saeng’s personal growth to the natural cycles she observes. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss for her homeland. The sight of the hibiscus in the greenhouse triggers a ""shock of recognition"" and a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes,"" causing her to weep for the irretrievable past, represented by her grandmother, the family well, and the hibiscus hedge. Her failure of the driver's test, an emblem of her struggle to adapt to American life, compounds this sadness. However, the concluding paragraph demonstrates a significant change in her perspective. Her mother’s wise comment about the ""winter hibiscus"" being strong enough to ""make it through the cold months"" provides a crucial insight. Saeng internalizes this idea, realizing that resilience, not replication, is what matters. She sees that the plant, though different from the one in Laos, can still survive and bloom in its new environment. This new understanding is mirrored in her own experience. As she plants the hibiscus, she notes that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" This observation signifies that familiarity and belonging are built gradually through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" By linking her personal goal—retaking the test—to the natural milestones of spring, the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the very hibiscus she has just planted, Saeng aligns her future with the rhythms of her new home. The vow is not just about passing a test; it is a promise to herself to put down roots and persevere. The conclusion thus powerfully illustrates that while the past is cherished, the future is built by adapting and finding strength, like the winter hibiscus, to bloom again."
251	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring as a powerful symbol of her renewed hope and acceptance of her new life. This final paragraph resolves the story's central conflict—Saeng’s painful struggle with displacement and loss—by showing her shift from despair to resilience. Earlier in the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by grief; the sight of the hibiscus triggers visceral memories of her lost home in Vietnam, leading her to break down in tears as she laments that everything from her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" The driver's test failure compounds this feeling of being an outsider, intensifying her sense of defeat. However, the interaction with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" begin her emotional recovery. Her mother’s gentle reaction to the failed test and her insightful comment about the plant being ""strong enough to make it through the cold months"" reframe the hibiscus as a symbol of adaptation rather than just loss. It is not the same as the hibiscus from home, but it is hardy and can survive, just as their family must learn to do. This idea is reinforced as Saeng, while planting, realizes that many things she once found strange, like the call of Canada geese, have become ""almost familiar"" through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season."" Therefore, the concluding paragraph ties these elements together. The cyclical return of spring, the melting snow, the geese, and the budding hibiscus all represent a future filled with possibility rather than a past that is gone. By vowing to try again in sync with these natural cycles, Saeng demonstrates that she has internalized the story’s theme: while one cannot reclaim the past, one can put down new roots and find the strength to grow in a new environment. The ending affirms that Saeng is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead looking forward, ready to face her challenges with newfound courage."
252	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring to show her transition from being overwhelmed by grief to finding a sense of hope and resilience. This final paragraph acts as the culmination of Saeng’s emotional journey, symbolizing her acceptance of her new life while still honoring her past. Throughout the story, Saeng is consumed by a profound sense of loss for her homeland. Her visit to the greenhouse triggers a visceral wave of memories connected to the hibiscus, jasmine, and other plants, culminating in her breakdown as she grieves for ""the hibiscus hedge, the well, [and] her gentle grandmother,"" all of which are ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This deep sorrow is compounded by her immediate failure—failing the driver's test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt to American life. However, the act of purchasing the ""winter hibiscus"" and planting it with her mother becomes a turning point. Her mother’s wisdom is crucial; she acknowledges the plant is not exactly the same as the one from home, but she values its strength, noting it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol not of what was lost, but of what can endure and adapt. The final paragraph connects this symbolism directly to Saeng's personal resolve. By linking her vow to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hardy hibiscus—Saeng aligns her own growth with the resilient plant. She has moved from seeing the geese's honks as strange to finding them ""familiar,"" just as she has developed a ""cultivated taste"" for the bitter melon her mother cooks. These details show her gradual, unconscious adaptation. Therefore, her decision to try again is not just about passing a test; it is an affirmation that she, like the winter hibiscus, can put down roots, survive the harsh seasons, and eventually bloom again. The conclusion thus provides a powerful message of hope, showing that healing and strength are found by embracing the future without forgetting the past."
253	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to illustrate her emotional shift from being anchored in the past to finding the resilience to face her new future. This final paragraph signifies a crucial moment of growth and acceptance for Saeng, who spends much of the story overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss for her homeland. Her initial encounter with the hibiscus in the greenhouse triggers a wave of visceral memories of Vietnam—her grandmother, the garden, the well—culminating in her breaking down in tears as she grieves for a world that is “irrevocably gone.” This despair is compounded by her failure of the driver’s test, a symbol of her struggles to adapt to American life. However, the conversation with her mother and the act of planting the “winter hibiscus” serve as a turning point. Her mother, instead of scolding her for the expensive purchase, recognizes its deeper significance and reframes the plant’s identity. She calls it “dok faeng-noi” and notes that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” This statement connects the plant's resilience to their own experience as immigrants; they must adapt and endure in a harsher climate. As Saeng plants it, she is surrounded by sensory details of her current life—the smell of bitter melon, a “cultivated taste” she now prefers, and the sound of Canada geese whose calls have become “familiar.” Her vow is therefore intrinsically linked to the natural cycles of her new environment. The return of the geese and the budding of the hardy hibiscus in spring become symbols of hope and renewal. By choosing to try again only after these signs of new life appear, Saeng aligns her personal growth with the rhythms of her adopted home. The paragraph shows that she is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead drawing strength from the same resilience that allows the winter hibiscus to survive. She is learning to put down roots, both for the plant and for herself, embracing a future where memories of the past and the realities of the present can coexist.

This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life in the United States and her determination to persevere. Throughout the story, Saeng is acutely aware of everything she has lost—her homeland, her grandmother, and the familiar plants of her childhood. The sight of the hibiscus in the greenhouse triggers a ""shock of recognition"" so intense it brings her to tears, as she mourns for an ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" past. This sense of failure is compounded by her inability to pass her driver's test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt to her new culture. However, the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" with her mother becomes a pivotal moment. Her mother acknowledges that this new variety is not the same as the one from home—its flowers ""aren’t as pretty""—but she values its strength to ""make it through the cold months."" This teaches Saeng a crucial lesson about resilience. The concluding paragraph connects Saeng’s personal resolve to the natural cycles she is beginning to recognize. As she plants the hibiscus, she hears Canada geese flying overhead, and their honks, which she once found strange, are now ""clear and—yes—familiar."" This shows she is starting to put down roots and find belonging in this new environment. Her vow to retake the test in the spring is therefore tied directly to these symbols of endurance and renewal: the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of the hardy hibiscus she has just planted. She is no longer looking only backward with grief but is now looking forward with purpose, aligning her own growth with the seasons. The paragraph thus completes her emotional journey, ending the story on a note of quiet determination and the promise of new beginnings."

The geese, once strange to her, have become familiar, mirroring her gradual adjustment to her new environment. By linking her personal goal to the natural cycles of her adopted home, the author suggests that Saeng is beginning to reconcile her past and present.

This resolution is earned after a day of profound emotional turmoil where Saeng is overwhelmed by feelings of loss and displacement following her test failure. Her visit to the greenhouse plunges her into memories of Vietnam, symbolized by the hibiscus and jasmine, culminating in a wave of grief for her lost home and grandmother. The purchase of the ""winter hibiscus"" is an impulsive act to reclaim a piece of that past, but it also leads to her mother’s wisdom. Mrs. Panouvong does not scold her for the expense but acknowledges the plant's strength, noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here...

Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by the loss of her homeland, symbolized by the intense memories triggered by the tropical plants in the greenhouse. The hibiscus, or *saebba*, connects her so powerfully to Vietnam that the wave of loss causes her to break down and weep, feeling that her old life is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, her mother provides a crucial perspective shift by accepting the ""winter hibiscus"" not as a poor substitute, but as a plant that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This teaches Saeng that survival and beauty are possible in this new, harsher environment. The final paragraph crystallizes this lesson.

She connects her personal goal to the budding of the hibiscus and the return of the geese, signs of spring that have become ""familiar"" to her. Earlier in the story, she realizes that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar.""

Instead of anger, her mother shows understanding, recognizing the plant's symbolic value. She identifies it as a ""winter hibiscus,"" a hardy variant that can survive the cold, teaching Saeng a crucial lesson about resilience and adaptation. This lesson is what the final paragraph embodies. By connecting her personal goal of retaking the test to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus—Saeng demonstrates a newfound sense of hope and integration. The hibiscus is no longer just a painful reminder of what was lost, but a symbol of what can endure and even flourish in a new context. Similarly, the Canada geese, which she notes have become ""familiar,"" represent her growing connection to the American landscape. Her vow shows that she is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead looking to the future, using the rhythms of nature as a framework for her own growth and perseverance. The conclusion, therefore, affirms the story's central theme: that identity can be rebuilt by weaving the memories of the past into the fabric of a new life."
263	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring because it symbolizes her newfound resilience and acceptance of her hybrid identity, blending her past with her present. This final paragraph resolves the story's central conflict, which is Saeng's profound sense of displacement and grief after immigrating from Vietnam. Her initial failure and the subsequent wave of loss in the greenhouse show her feeling ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" from her childhood world. However, her mother’s reaction to the hibiscus provides the turning point. Instead of focusing on the cost, her mother recognizes the plant's value, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is strong enough to survive the cold. This teaches Saeng that beauty and strength can be found in new, adapted forms. Saeng then internalizes this lesson. As she plants the hibiscus, she has an epiphany, realizing that many things she once found strange, like the honking of Canada geese, have become ""almost familiar."" This shows she is beginning to put down roots in her new environment, just as she is literally putting the plant in the ground. The specific, cyclical events she ties her vow to—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus—demonstrate that she now sees her life as part of the natural rhythm of her new home. The hibiscus is no longer just a painful reminder of all she has lost, but a symbol of hope and future growth. Her decision to try again is therefore not just about a driver's test; it is a commitment to her future in America, strengthened by the memories of her past and the enduring love of her family. The ending thus completes her emotional journey from despair to determined hope."
264	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her journey from being overwhelmed by the past to finding hope and resilience in her new life. Throughout the story, Saeng is engulfed by a deep sense of loss for her homeland. In the greenhouse, the familiar plants—hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle—trigger powerful memories of her grandmother and her childhood in Vietnam, leading to an intense wave of grief where she feels everything from her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This despair is compounded by her failure of the driver's test, an event that highlights her struggle to adapt. However, the interaction with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" mark a turning point. Her mother, instead of scolding her for the expensive plant, recognizes its symbolic value and identifies its strength to survive the cold months, calling it a ""winter hibiscus."" This reframes the plant not as a poor substitute for the past, but as something resilient and adapted to its new environment. As Saeng plants it, she notices that the honks of the Canada geese, once strange, have become ""familiar,"" and she admits that many things have become familiar through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" The final paragraph ties these elements together. Saeng’s vow to retake the test is directly linked to the natural cycles of her new home—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hardy hibiscus she has just planted. This shows that she is no longer looking only backward but is now rooted in the present and future. She has found a source of strength in this hybrid identity, just like the winter hibiscus that is different from the one in Laos but is strong enough to bloom again. The conclusion thus signifies her acceptance of change, her newfound resilience, and her determination to keep moving forward."

This final paragraph shows that Saeng is no longer completely overwhelmed by her loss but is instead finding a way to integrate her past with her present. The hibiscus she has just planted serves as a powerful symbol of this transition. Her mother identifies it as a ""winter hibiscus,"" a variety that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This parallels Saeng's own journey; she is learning to be strong and endure the emotional ""winter"" of displacement and failure. Furthermore, the specific conditions of her vow link her personal growth to the natural cycles of her new environment. She will try again ""when the snows melt and the geese return."" Just before making this vow, Saeng realizes that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" This shows she is slowly putting down roots and adapting. The budding of the hibiscus, a plant that connects her to Vietnam, represents the eventual blooming of hope and memory within her American context. By connecting her personal goal to the seasonal return of the geese and the flowering of the hibiscus, the ending provides a sense of cyclical renewal and forward momentum. It contrasts sharply with her earlier breakdown in the greenhouse, where she was crushed by the feeling that her past was ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" The conclusion affirms that while her past cannot be recreated, its essence can be replanted and can give her the strength to face the future, turning her initial failure into a postponed, yet determined, effort to succeed."

This resolution is the culmination of her emotional journey, which begins with a deep sense of loss and ends with a fragile but hopeful connection to the future. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by the pain of her displacement from Laos. Failing her driver's test, a symbol of American practicality and assimilation, deepens her feeling of being an outsider. Her subsequent discovery of the hibiscus plant in the florist shop triggers a powerful wave of nostalgia, pulling her back into visceral memories of her grandmother, their garden, and the well. This connection to her past is so intense that it causes her to break down and weep, feeling that her old life is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" The purchased hibiscus, a ""winter hibiscus,"" is a poor substitute, a symbol of what has been lost. However, her mother’s reaction to the plant and the failure is pivotal. Instead of anger over the cost, Mrs. Panouvong focuses on the plant’s resilience, noting that it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This reframes the hibiscus from a symbol of loss to one of endurance. The act of planting it together in their cold, new soil is a symbolic act of putting down roots in this unfamiliar land. This is mirrored in the story’s final scenes, where Saeng finds comfort in the familiar smells and tastes of her mother’s cooking—the bitter melon—and realizes that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" Therefore, the final paragraph ties these threads together. By linking her personal goal of passing the test to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the newly planted hibiscus—Saeng aligns her own growth with the coming spring. She is no longer looking only backward with grief but is now looking forward with hope, vowing to try again when the resilient ""winter hibiscus"" itself shows new life. The conclusion powerfully illustrates that while the past is gone, the future holds the promise of new beginnings, nurtured by the strength and adaptability she has inherited from her family and culture."

Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by the ""irretrievable"" loss of her past life in Laos, a feeling triggered by her failure on the driver's test and intensified by the memories evoked in the greenhouse. The winter hibiscus she buys becomes a potent but painful symbol of what she has lost, as it is ""not a real one"" like the hibiscus hedges of her childhood. Her mother, however, provides a crucial perspective shift. She recognizes the plant not for its inadequacy, but for its strength, noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters."" This insight allows Saeng to begin reconciling her past with her present. The act of planting the hibiscus in the cold, hard soil is an act of putting down new roots, mirroring her family’s own difficult transplantation to a new country. As she works, she notices that things which were once strange, like the honking of Canada geese, have become ""familiar."" She even admits to preferring the bitter melon her mother is cooking to a Big Mac, signifying an acceptance of her own cultivated identity. The final vow connects her personal growth to the natural cycle. The return of the geese in spring and the budding of the hardy hibiscus she has just planted become symbols of renewal and perseverance. By linking her decision to retake the test to these seasonal changes, Saeng demonstrates that she has internalized her mother’s lesson: the goal is not to replicate the past perfectly, but to endure, adapt, and eventually bloom in a new environment.

Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss for her homeland. Failing her driver’s test exacerbates this feeling, highlighting her struggles in a new culture. Her breakdown in the greenhouse is triggered by the plants that vividly recall her childhood in Vietnam, making her painfully aware that her past life is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” This moment represents the depth of her sorrow and displacement. However, the interaction with her mother serves as a turning point. Her mother’s gentle acceptance of the expensive plant and the failed test provides comfort and understanding. More importantly, her mother reframes the ""winter hibiscus"" not as a poor imitation of the past, but as something valuable in its own right—a hardy plant that can “make it through the cold months.” This lesson in resilience is mirrored in Saeng’s own realizations as she plants it. She notices that the bitter melon, a taste from her old life, is now a cultivated preference, and the honking of Canada geese has become “familiar.” These details show her beginning to integrate her past with her present.

The sight and touch of the hibiscus, the scent of the jasmine, and the memory of her grandmother combing her hair evoke a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes."" She breaks down, mourning not just a plant or a person, but an entire world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is pivotal.

The final paragraph highlights Saeng’s determination to try again, linking her personal growth to the cyclical nature of seasons. The return of the geese in spring mirrors her own hope for renewal and success when she retakes the driver’s test.

By calling the plant a ""winter hibiscus,"" her mother points out that while its flowers ""aren’t as pretty"" as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that resilience and adaptation are valuable forms of beauty. Planting the hibiscus in their own garden is an act of putting down roots in this new, cold land. The concluding paragraph connects this act of planting to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow and the returning geese, which have become ""familiar."" Her vow to retake the test when the hibiscus buds shows that she now sees her own life as being in sync with these cycles; she will try again not in a moment of despair, but in a season of growth and renewal. The ending thus completes her emotional journey from sorrow to resilience, illustrating that hope can be found in learning to endure and flourish in a new world."
284	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding a resilient sense of hope and determination for her future in America. This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life and her decision to persevere. The paragraph is powerful because it connects Saeng's personal goal—passing her driver's test—with the natural cycles of her new environment. The hibiscus plant, which initially provoked a wave of painful memories and grief for her lost home in Vietnam, has been recontextualized by her mother as a ""winter hibiscus,"" a hardy survivor that can ""make it through the cold months."" By planting it in their garden, Saeng symbolically plants a part of her past in the soil of her present. Her vow to retake the test in the spring, a time of renewal marked by the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, shows that she now sees her life as cyclical rather than focused on an irretrievable past. She has begun to find familiarity in this new world, noting that the honks of the Canada geese, once strange, are now clear and ""familiar."" Furthermore, this resolution is earned through the story’s exploration of Saeng’s sensory memories. In the greenhouse, the sight and smell of plants like the hibiscus and jasmine overwhelmed her with a sense of ""irrevocable"" loss. However, by the end, the sensory experiences at home—the sound of eggs being beaten, the smell of bitter melon—are comforting and cherished. She admits she prefers this taste to a Big Mac, signaling her acceptance of her cultural identity within her American context. The concluding paragraph, therefore, shows that Saeng is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead ready to grow and try again, just like the winter hibiscus itself. Her determination is now rooted in the blended reality of her past and present, promising resilience and continued growth."
285	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring because it powerfully symbolizes her transition from being anchored in the past to finding the resilience to build a new life. This final paragraph resolves the story's central conflict: Saeng's paralyzing grief over the loss of her homeland. Her initial failure of the driver's test represents her broader struggle to navigate and succeed in this unfamiliar American environment. Overwhelmed by memories in the greenhouse, she breaks down, feeling that her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, the conversation with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" become a turning point. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test, but instead focuses on the plant's strength, noting, ""its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng a crucial lesson about resilience and adaptation. The hibiscus is not the same as the one from Vietnam, just as their life in America is not the same, but it can still survive and have value. This idea is reinforced as Saeng, alone in the garden, realizes that many things she once found strange, like the honking of Canada geese, have become ""almost familiar."" By linking her personal goal to the natural cycles of her new home—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of the resilient hibiscus—Saeng aligns her own growth with the coming spring. The vow is not just about a driver's test; it is a commitment to hope and a future in this new land. She will try again when the world around her shows its own capacity for renewal, demonstrating that she has internalized the lesson of the winter hibiscus and is finally ready to put down roots and move forward."
286	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring because it signifies her acceptance of her new life and a newfound sense of hope, resilience, and connection between her past and her future. This resolution is earned through her emotional journey, which begins with profound grief and ends with a quiet determination. After failing her driver's test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt to American life, Saeng is overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss"" for her childhood in Vietnam. The familiar plants in the greenhouse trigger powerful memories, but they also make her acutely aware that her old life is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone,"" causing her to break down. However, her interaction with her mother and the ""winter hibiscus"" provides a crucial shift in perspective. Her mother, instead of scolding her for the expensive plant or the failed test, focuses on the hibiscus's strength, noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the tropical kind, ""it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng a lesson in resilience—the ability to endure and adapt to a harsh new environment. Furthermore, Saeng begins to recognize that familiar, comforting elements can be found in her new home. As she plants the hibiscus, she hears the comforting sounds and smells of her mother cooking bitter melon, a ""cultivated taste"" from her heritage that she now prefers ""to a Big Mac."" She also notices the Canada geese, whose honks were once strange but are now ""clear and—yes—familiar."" This shows her that a sense of belonging is not instantaneous but grows through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" The budding of the hibiscus, the return of the geese, and the melting snow become intertwined symbols of cyclical renewal and hope. By vowing to try again in the spring, Saeng aligns her personal growth with the natural world, demonstrating that she has found a way to carry her past within her as she moves forward into her future. The final paragraph, therefore, completes her arc from despair to resilience, showing that she will face her challenges again, not as a stranger, but as someone who is slowly putting down roots in her new home."

This final paragraph represents a pivotal moment of resilience and integration, where the natural world becomes a source of motivation rather than a reminder of loss. Throughout the story, Saeng is deeply affected by her memories of Laos, and her failure of the driver’s test underscores her struggle to adapt to her new life. The intense wave of grief she experiences in the greenhouse is triggered by plants that connect her to a world that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” However, her mother helps her reframe this connection. By calling the plant a “winter hibiscus,” Mrs. Panouvong highlights its strength to survive the cold, teaching Saeng that adaptation and resilience are possible. This new hibiscus is not the same as the one from home, but it is strong in its own way, just as their family must learn to be. The imagery in the final paragraph symbolizes Saeng’s newfound hope. The cyclical return of the geese, which she now finds “familiar,” mirrors the budding of the hardy hibiscus. These are not symbols of her old life, but of the new seasonal rhythms she is learning. Her vow to retake the test “when the snows melt” directly links her personal goal to this natural cycle of renewal. She is no longer looking back with despair but forward with purpose, using the endurance of the winter hibiscus as a model for her own life. The conclusion, therefore, shows that Saeng has begun to root herself in her new environment, finding the courage to try again by embracing the strength she sees in the world around her.

Her vow to retake the driver’s test in spring, when the hibiscus buds and the geese return, reflects her hope and determination. The geese, once strange to her, now feel familiar, mirroring her growing comfort with her surroundings. This parallels her earlier realization that many things she once found foreign—like the bitter melon or the dok Malik—have become part of her life. The ending ties together her journey of loss and adaptation, showing that while she mourns her past, she is also planting new roots, both literally with the hibiscus and metaphorically in her new home. The cyclical imagery of seasons and returning geese underscores the idea of renewal, suggesting that Saeng’s story is one of ongoing growth and perseverance.

This final paragraph connects Saeng’s personal growth directly to the natural world, which throughout the story serves as a powerful link to her past and a bridge to her new life. After failing her test, Saeng is consumed by a ""wave of loss"" for her homeland, a grief so profound she breaks down in the greenhouse. The familiar plants she encounters there—hibiscus, jasmine, periwinkle—initially trigger painful memories of everything ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone,"" including her grandmother and her childhood home. However, her mother helps her reframe this perspective. When Saeng apologetically says the hibiscus is ""not a real one,"" her mother does not despair. Instead, she calls it a ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This lesson in resilience is mirrored in Saeng's own experience. As she plants the hibiscus in the cold, hard soil, she has an epiphany. She hears the Canada geese and realizes their honks are now ""familiar."" She understands that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar."" This shows she is beginning to put down roots, much like the hibiscus. Therefore, her vow to retake the test is not just about driving. It is a promise to herself to persevere and bloom where she is planted. By linking this personal goal to the cyclical, hopeful signs of spring—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus—the author illustrates that Saeng has learned to accept her new environment. She will no longer be paralyzed by the past but will draw strength from it, using the memory of the vibrant saebba to fuel her determination to succeed in her new world. The conclusion powerfully symbolizes that growth is a gradual process of adaptation, and Saeng is now ready to face her challenges with newfound hope."

Her visit to the greenhouse plunges her into memories of Vietnam—the hibiscus, the jasmine, her grandmother’s hair—making her grief ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This wave of sadness is a turning point. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is crucial. Instead of anger, she focuses on the plant’s strength, calling it the ""winter hibiscus"" that can ""make it through the cold months.""

This feeling is compounded when she enters the greenhouse, where the familiar plants trigger visceral memories of her grandmother and her childhood home. The intensity of these memories leads to a wave of grief so strong that she breaks down weeping, mourning everything that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” In this moment, the past seems like a beautiful but lost world, contrasting sharply with a cold and unfamiliar present. However, the interaction with her mother serves as a crucial turning point. Instead of scolding her for the expensive plant or the failed test, Mrs. Panouvong responds with understanding and gentle wisdom. She recognizes the hibiscus not for what it is not—“not a real one”—but for what it is: a strong survivor, a “winter hibiscus” capable of enduring the cold. This reframing is a lesson for Saeng. By helping her daughter plant the hibiscus in their new garden, alongside the bitter melon that represents their cultivated tastes, Mrs. Panouvong literally and metaphorically shows how to put down roots in this new soil. The final paragraph shows that Saeng has internalized this lesson. She notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become familiar through the “quiet repetition of season upon season.” This observation signifies her growing awareness that familiarity and belonging are built over time. Her vow to retake the test in the spring is therefore not just about passing an exam; it is a promise to herself to grow and persevere. She aligns her personal goal with the natural cycle of the seasons—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the resilient hibiscus she has just planted.

The hibiscus she finds is not the same as the one from her homeland; it is a ""winter hibiscus,"" a hardy substitute that can survive the cold, just as she must learn to endure her new environment. Her mother’s quiet acceptance of the expensive plant and her practical wisdom about what ""matters"" provides the catalyst for this change. She teaches Saeng that value lies not in perfect replication of the past, but in the strength to adapt and grow, even in harsh conditions. This newfound resilience is reinforced by the story’s closing imagery. Saeng notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" This shows her gradual, almost unconscious, acclimatization to her new home. The seasonal cycle of the geese’s departure and return, paralleled with the hibiscus’s budding, provides a framework for hope and patience. By linking her personal goal of passing the test to the natural promise of spring, Saeng aligns her own growth with the enduring cycles of nature.

The plant she ultimately buys is different, a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""not as pretty"" but is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" Her mother’s acceptance of this hardy plant teaches Saeng a crucial lesson about resilience and adaptation. This lesson is reinforced by other details in the final scenes that show Saeng becoming familiar with her new environment. She realizes she has developed a ""cultivated taste"" for the bitter melon her friends dislike, and she finds the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, to now be ""familiar."" By planting the winter hibiscus in the cold, hard soil of her American home, she physically and symbolically puts down roots. Her vow is therefore not just about a test; it is a promise to herself to keep trying, mirroring the plant's struggle to survive the winter.

The honking of the Canada geese, once foreign, is now a recognizable sound, signifying her growing connection to her new environment. Therefore, her vow to try the test again is not just about passing an exam; it is a promise to actively engage with her new world.

She feels that her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This sorrow is compounded by her initial failure to pass her driver's test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt to American life. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive hibiscus plant is a turning point. Instead of anger, her mother shows understanding and compassion, recognizing Saeng’s pain. She then reframes the plant’s identity, calling it the ""winter hibiscus"" and pointing out that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This lesson in resilience is what Saeng internalizes. By the end, as she plants the hibiscus, Saeng begins to find a new sense of familiarity and belonging in her current environment. She notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, is now ""familiar."" She admits that the bitter melon her mother cooks is a ""cultivated taste"" that she ""much preferred... to a Big Mac."" These details show her slowly integrating her past with her present. The vow to retake the test in the spring, a season of rebirth, directly ties her personal growth to the natural cycles of her new home. The return of the geese and the budding of the hardy ""winter hibiscus"" will be markers of her own readiness to try again. Therefore, the concluding paragraph powerfully illustrates that Saeng is no longer trapped by grief but is instead building a new life, rooted in the strength of her heritage and adapted to flourish in her new world."
308	-1	4	4	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake her driver's test in the spring because it signifies her newfound resilience and acceptance of her hybrid identity, blending her past in Laos with her present in America. This final paragraph resolves the story's central conflict by showing Saeng's emotional shift from being paralyzed by loss to finding a source of strength. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a deep sense of displacement and grief for her lost homeland. Failing her driver's test, an American rite of passage, intensifies her feeling of not belonging. The subsequent discovery of the hibiscus in the greenhouse triggers a flood of visceral memories, connecting the plant to her grandmother, their garden, and a world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This wave of nostalgia causes her to break down, emphasizing how her past hinders her ability to move forward in her new life. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant provides a crucial turning point. Instead of focusing on the financial cost or the failed test, her mother recognizes the plant's symbolic value. She calls it the ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of survival and adaptation. The act of planting it together in the cold, hard soil is a physical act of putting down new roots. This symbolism culminates in the final paragraph. Saeng’s vow is directly linked to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the winter hibiscus. Earlier in the story, the honks of the Canada geese were strange to her, but now she finds them ""familiar."" This shows her growing acclimatization. By connecting her personal goal of retaking the test to the resilient hibiscus and the returning geese, Saeng demonstrates that she has internalized her mother’s wisdom. She is learning to endure the ""winter"" and is ready to bloom again when the season changes, embracing both her heritage and her future in America. The ending thus transforms the hibiscus from a trigger of grief into a beacon of hope and perseverance."

This final paragraph shows that Saeng has moved from her initial state of overwhelming grief to a place of hope and determination, mirroring the qualities of the ""winter hibiscus"" itself. Throughout the story, Saeng is assailed by a profound sense of loss for her homeland. In the greenhouse, the sight and smell of familiar plants trigger visceral memories of her grandmother and her childhood in Vietnam, leading to a wave of grief so strong that she “broke down and wept.” This illustrates how her past feels “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” However, her mother provides a crucial perspective when she admires the hibiscus Saeng bought, noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters."" This reframes the hibiscus from being a poor substitute for the past into a symbol of strength and adaptation. Saeng internalizes this lesson as she plants the hibiscus in the cold, hard soil of her new home. The act of planting is an act of putting down new roots, literally and metaphorically. This is paired with her realization that things she once found strange, like the honking of Canada geese, have become “almost familiar.” She even acknowledges a cultivated taste for the bitter melon her mother is cooking, a flavor from her culture that she prefers to American fast food. These details show her beginning to synthesize her old life with her new one. Therefore, her vow to retake the test in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, is a promise of renewal. It demonstrates that she is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead looking forward, using the resilient ""winter hibiscus"" as a model for her own life. The paragraph confirms that Saeng has accepted that her new life, though different and difficult, is a place where she too can survive the cold, put down roots, and eventually blossom."

Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by her past in Vietnam, and her failure on the driver’s test intensifies her feelings of being an outsider in America. The hibiscus and other plants in the florist shop trigger powerful, visceral memories of her grandmother and her childhood home, leading to a wave of grief so strong she breaks down. This emotional collapse represents her struggle to reconcile her past with her present life. However, the conversation with her mother and the act of planting the “winter hibiscus” mark a turning point. Her mother accepts both the expensive plant and the failed test without anger, focusing instead on the plant’s strength to survive the cold, which serves as a metaphor for their own resilience as immigrants. This moment of shared understanding and the familiar, comforting sounds and smells from the kitchen begin to heal Saeng. The final paragraph solidifies this shift. The migrating geese, which she notes have become “familiar,” symbolize the cyclical nature of life and adaptation. By linking her resolve to retake the test to the natural cycles of the geese returning and the hardy hibiscus budding, the author shows that Saeng has found a new source of strength. She is no longer paralyzed by the irretrievable past but is instead looking forward, using the rhythms of her new environment as an anchor for her own personal growth and determination. The conclusion, therefore, leaves the reader with a sense of hope, emphasizing that Saeng is learning to put down roots and thrive in her new home, just like the winter hibiscus.

This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life and her determination to succeed within it, using the ""winter hibiscus"" as a symbol of this new strength. Throughout the story, Saeng is ambushed by powerful memories of her lost home in Vietnam, triggered by the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The sight of the hibiscus causes a ""shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral,"" and the jasmine blossom vividly recalls her grandmother. These sensory experiences lead to a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes,"" causing her to weep for all that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her failure of the driver's test compounds this feeling of not belonging in her new country. However, the interaction with her mother marks a turning point. Instead of scolding her for the expensive plant or the failed test, her mother responds with quiet understanding. She recognizes the hibiscus as a ""winter hibiscus,"" a variety that is different from the one they had at home—less pretty, but ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This observation reframes the hibiscus from a symbol of painful memory into a symbol of adaptation and survival. By planting it together in their own garden, Saeng and her mother are literally putting down new roots. Saeng also realizes she has developed a taste for her new life, noting that she prefers the bitter melon her mother cooks to a Big Mac, and that the call of the Canada geese has become ""familiar.""

By planting it together, they symbolically put down roots in their new environment. The concluding paragraph shows Saeng internalizing this lesson. She connects her personal growth to the natural cycles she is beginning to recognize and appreciate, such as the flight of the Canada geese, whose honks are now ""familiar."" Her vow to retake the test in the spring is explicitly tied to the hibiscus budding and the geese returning. This parallel demonstrates that she now sees her own challenges as part of a larger cycle of dormancy and renewal.

This final paragraph shows that Saeng is no longer overwhelmed by her loss but is instead motivated by it. Her visit to the greenhouse had unleashed a torrent of visceral memories, connecting the hibiscus and other plants to her grandmother and her home in Vietnam. The experience was so powerful it made her ""break down and weep"" from the ""wave of loss."" However, the conversation with her mother provides a crucial shift in perspective. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test, but instead calls the hibiscus ""strong enough to make it through the cold months,"" reframing it as a symbol of endurance. By planting this ""winter hibiscus,"" Saeng actively puts down roots in the cold, hard American soil, mirroring her own struggle to adapt. The specific details she associates with spring—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding hibiscus—demonstrate that she has found a way to see her two worlds as interconnected rather than separate. Earlier in the story, the honks of the Canada geese were strange to her, but by the end, she recognizes them as ""familiar."" This shows her growing attachment to her new environment. Her vow is therefore not just about passing a test; it is a promise to herself to try again when the signs of life and renewal return. She links her personal goal to the natural cycles of her new home, proving that the memories of her past can give her strength for the future instead of only causing pain. The conclusion thus completes her emotional journey from grief to a determined and hopeful resilience."
330	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s transformation from being overwhelmed by grief for her past to finding a sense of hope and resilience in her new life. Throughout the story, Saeng is confronted by the deep loss of her homeland, triggered by her failure to pass the driver's test and intensified by the familiar plants in the florist shop. The sight of the hibiscus, the dok Malik, and the Madagascar periwinkle unlocks a flood of visceral memories of her grandmother and her life in Laos, culminating in a wave of sorrow that causes her to weep in the greenhouse. This moment represents her being stuck between two worlds, feeling that her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, the interaction with her mother marks a turning point. Instead of scolding her for the expensive plant or the failed test, her mother reacts with understanding and gentleness. She calls the plant ""dok faeng-noi,"" a winter hibiscus, and points out its strength: its flowers may not be as pretty as those from home, but it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This observation shifts the focus from perfect replication to resilient adaptation. Together, they plant the hibiscus in their new garden, a symbolic act of putting down roots in the harsh, cold soil of their new country. The final paragraph crystallizes this newfound resilience by connecting Saeng’s personal vow to the natural cycle. The elements she notes—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus—are all signs of spring and renewal. By vowing to retake the test in the spring, Saeng aligns her own efforts with this cycle of perseverance and hope. The geese, which she once found strange but now acknowledges as ""familiar,"" symbolize her own gradual acclimatization. The hibiscus is no longer just a painful reminder of what was lost but has become a symbol of her own potential to survive and eventually blossom in her new environment. The conclusion thus powerfully conveys that Saeng has chosen to move forward, embracing the strength of the winter hibiscus as her own."
331	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it symbolizes her newfound resilience and acceptance of her hybrid identity. This final paragraph shows that Saeng is no longer solely overwhelmed by loss, but is instead learning to merge her past with her present to build a future. The hibiscus she has just planted is not the same as the one from Laos; it is a “winter hibiscus,” a hardy variant that can survive the cold, just as Saeng must learn to thrive in her new environment. Her emotional breakdown in the greenhouse was for a world “irretrievably, irrevocably gone,” but the act of planting, encouraged by her mother, is an act of putting down new roots. The specific details she associates with spring—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus—are all symbols of this adaptation. Earlier in the story, the honking of Canada geese was an unfamiliar sound, but now she finds them “familiar.” This parallels the “winter hibiscus,” which, though different, is still a hibiscus. Her mother’s acceptance of the plant, despite its cost and its differences, models this resilience, focusing on what “matters”—that it is strong enough to survive. Saeng’s vow ties her personal goal to the natural cycle of this new land, demonstrating that she has found a source of strength and is ready to try again, not by forgetting her past, but by allowing it to coexist with her life in America. The conclusion thus marks a turning point from paralyzing grief to hopeful determination, rooted in the enduring symbolism of the hibiscus.
332	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her journey from being overwhelmed by the past to finding hope and resilience in her new life. Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by a deep sense of loss for her homeland. Failing her driver’s test intensifies her feeling of being an outsider, but the discovery of the hibiscus plant triggers a powerful flood of memories. In the greenhouse, she is transported back to Vietnam, surrounded by familiar plants like the *saebba* hibiscus, *dok Malik* jasmine, and Madagascar periwinkle. These connections are bittersweet; they bring comfort but also a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes,"" making her weep for a world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, the story shifts when Saeng returns home. Her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is initially shock, but she quickly understands its deeper significance. By calling it a ""winter hibiscus,"" Mrs. Panouvong highlights its key quality: it is not identical to the hibiscus of their homeland, but it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This statement reframes the plant from being a poor substitute into a symbol of endurance and adaptation. This lesson is mirrored in the final scene as Saeng plants the hibiscus. She notices the ""faint honks"" of the Canada geese, realizing that what was once strange has become ""familiar to her now."" This shows she is beginning to put down roots, just like the plant. The final paragraph, therefore, ties these themes together. The promise to retake the test is linked to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. The hibiscus is no longer just a reminder of what was lost; it has become a promise of future growth. By vowing to try again in the spring, Saeng demonstrates that she has internalized her mother’s wisdom. She is learning to endure the ""winter"" of her displacement and hardship, with the hope of blossoming in her own time. The ending affirms that while the past is gone, the future holds the potential for new beginnings and hard-won success."
333	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring because it signifies her acceptance of her new life and her renewed sense of hope. This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict, which is Saeng’s struggle between her past in Laos and her present in the United States. Her initial failure and the powerful memories in the greenhouse had overwhelmed her with a sense of irreparable loss. However, the interaction with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" provide a new perspective. Her mother acknowledges that this new plant is different—""not as pretty""—but values its strength to survive the cold, teaching Saeng that resilience and adaptation are what matter. By planting it in their own garden, Saeng performs a symbolic act of putting down new roots in her new country. This act of planting leads directly to the conclusion. As she works, Saeng notices that the sounds and smells of her mother’s cooking, once unfamiliar, are now comforting, and she even prefers her bitter melon omelet to a Big Mac. Most importantly, the honking of the Canada geese, which she once found strange, is now ""familiar."" This shows she is gradually building a new sense of home. Her vow is therefore timed to the natural cycle of this new environment—the spring return of the geese and the budding of the newly planted hibiscus. She is no longer looking back to an irretrievable past but forward to a future in her new home, using its own symbols of renewal as her motivation. The ending thus completes her emotional journey from despair to resilience, showing that she will face her challenges again with newfound strength drawn from her ability to blend memory with the reality of her new life."

This final paragraph signifies a crucial moment of growth and acceptance for Saeng, which is developed through her interactions with the plants and her mother. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a deep sense of loss for her homeland. In the greenhouse, the sight and scent of familiar plants like the hibiscus, dok Malik, and Madagascar periwinkle trigger powerful, visceral memories of her grandmother and her life in Vietnam, causing her to break down and weep over everything that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” This wave of grief shows how disconnected she feels from her new environment. However, the conversation with her mother serves as a turning point. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test, but instead focuses on the positive, calling the hibiscus “beautiful” and noting its strength to survive the cold months as “what matters.” By planting the “winter hibiscus” together, they perform a symbolic act of putting down new roots in the harsh, unfamiliar soil, just as they must put down roots in their new home. The specific details in the conclusion tie together these themes of resilience and gradual adaptation. Saeng’s vow is linked to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus she has just planted. Earlier in the story, the honks of the Canada geese were strange to her, but now she finds them “clear and—yes—familiar,” showing that she is slowly becoming accustomed to America. The hibiscus itself is a metaphor for Saeng; it is not the exact same as the one from her homeland (“it’s not a real one”), but it is a hardy, adaptive variety that can withstand the winter. Her decision to try again is therefore not just about a driver’s test, but a commitment to persevere and bloom where she is planted. The story thus ends on a note of quiet hope, demonstrating that Saeng has chosen to face the future with the same strength as the winter hibiscus.

This final paragraph signifies a pivotal change in Saeng’s perspective. Earlier in the story, she is crushed by grief, weeping in the greenhouse as memories of her grandmother and her homeland in Vietnam surface with painful clarity. The familiar plants trigger a “wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes,” making her feel that her past is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” However, her mother’s reaction to the winter hibiscus provides a crucial shift. Mrs. Panouvong does not focus on the cost or the failed test but instead focuses on the plant’s strength, noting, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters.” This teaches Saeng that resilience and adaptation are forms of beauty and survival. Planting the winter hibiscus with her mother becomes an act of putting down new roots, both literally and metaphorically. As she works in the garden, Saeng has a moment of realization, noticing that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become “familiar to her now.” This shows she is beginning to find a sense of belonging in her new environment. Her vow to retake the test is therefore not just about passing an exam; it is a promise to herself to persevere, paralleling the hibiscus that endures the winter to bud again in the spring. The cyclical imagery of the melting snow and returning geese underscores this theme of renewal and the promise of a new beginning. The ending thus completes Saeng’s emotional journey, showing that she has chosen to face the future with courage, inspired by the hardy plant that symbolizes her own capacity to adapt and thrive.

This resolution is earned through her emotional journey, which is triggered by her encounter with the plants in the florist shop. Initially, the familiar hibiscus and jasmine cause a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes,"" making her grieve for her grandmother, her old home, and a life that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her weeping in the greenhouse represents the culmination of her sadness after failing her driver's test, an event that symbolizes her struggles to adapt to her new country. However, Saeng begins to heal upon returning home. Her mother’s warm, understanding reaction to the expensive plant and the failure of the test provides immediate comfort. More importantly, her mother reframes the hibiscus not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of strength, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This idea of resilience is then acted upon as they plant the hibiscus together, connecting it to their new land. This act, combined with the familiar sounds and smells of her mother cooking a bitter melon omelet—a ""cultivated taste"" she has come to prefer—shows Saeng beginning to value her new life. The honking of the Canada geese overhead finalizes this shift. The narrator notes that their calls are ""clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now,"" demonstrating that through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" the strange has become familiar. The geese become a new, accepted part of her life, just as the winter hibiscus will be. Therefore, her vow to retake the test in the spring directly connects her personal growth to the natural cycle. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus are no longer reminders of what she lost but symbols of renewal and adaptation. By linking her own resolve to these signs of spring, Saeng shows she has embraced a resilient hope, choosing to face the future with strength learned from both her past and her present."

The hibiscus, the dok Malik, and the Madagascar periwinkle trigger a ""shock of recognition"" and a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes,"" causing her to weep for the world and the grandmother she has ""irretrievably, irrevocably"" lost. She is adrift, unable to even say the word ""home"" without fearing she will cry. Her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is the turning point. Instead of focusing on the failure or the cost, her mother focuses on the plant's strength, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This shifts the perspective from what was lost to what can survive and endure. The act of planting the hibiscus together is a symbolic act of putting down new roots in their new, cold home. This is mirrored by Saeng’s own shifting perceptions; the honks of the Canada geese, once strange, are now ""familiar,"" and she realizes that through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season,"" many new things have become almost familiar. The final paragraph connects these elements into a promise for the future. By linking her vow to the natural cycles of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding, Saeng shows she has internalized her mother’s lesson about resilience. The winter hibiscus represents the ability to endure hardship and bloom again, just as Saeng plans to endure her setback and try again. The conclusion shows that Saeng is no longer looking only backward with grief but is now looking forward with hope, ready to face her challenges again when the season of renewal arrives."

This feeling is magnified in the greenhouse, where the familiar plants trigger powerful memories of her grandmother and her life in Vietnam, causing her to weep over everything that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” The hibiscus she finds is not the same as the one from home; it is a hardier, less pretty ""winter hibiscus"" that can survive the cold, just as Saeng and her family must adapt to their new environment. Her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is pivotal. Instead of anger, she shows understanding, recognizing Saeng’s emotional pain and the plant's symbolic value. By planting the hibiscus in their cold, new-world garden, Saeng’s mother demonstrates a practical resilience, focusing on what can survive and grow rather than what has been lost. This act, along with the comforting sounds and smells of her mother cooking a familiar bitter melon omelet, grounds Saeng in the present and shows her that pieces of her old life can be integrated into the new. The final paragraph weaves these elements together. The budding of the hibiscus represents hope and new life, paralleling Saeng’s own potential for growth. The returning geese, once strange, have become “familiar,” showing her gradual acclimatization. By vowing to retake the test in the spring, Saeng aligns her personal journey with the resilient rhythm of the seasons, choosing to move forward with hope instead of being anchored by grief. The conclusion thus affirms the theme of resilience, showing that Saeng has found a way to honor her past while finally committing to her future in America."
349	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring to illustrate her emotional journey from paralyzing grief to resilient hope. This final paragraph serves as the culmination of Saeng's character development, showing how she has begun to reconcile her past with her present. Earlier in the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes"" upon remembering her childhood in Laos and her grandmother. The familiar plants in the greenhouse acted as powerful triggers for this grief, making her feel that her past was ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her failure of the driver's test symbolized her struggle to adapt and succeed in this new, unfamiliar world. However, the interaction with her mother and the act of planting the ""winter hibiscus"" becomes a turning point. Her mother, instead of scolding her for the expensive purchase, recognizes its deeper significance and offers a new perspective. She calls it a ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng a crucial lesson about resilience and finding beauty and strength in adaptation. Planting the hibiscus in the cold, hard soil is a symbolic act of putting down roots in her new environment. This newfound perspective allows Saeng to notice that many things she once found strange, like the honking of Canada geese, have become ""almost familiar."" The cyclical imagery of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding in the spring provides a framework for her own personal growth. Her vow, therefore, is not just about a test; it is a promise to herself to try again when signs of life and renewal return. It shows she is no longer defeated by her past or her failures but is instead looking forward, using the memory of her homeland as a source of strength rather than a cause for despair. The ending thus completes her arc, transforming her initial sorrow into a determined and hopeful resilience, ready to face the future."
350	-1	4	4	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in spring because it underscores her growing resilience and connection to her new environment while honoring her past. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with feelings of displacement after moving from Vietnam to the U.S., symbolized by her failure on the driver’s test and her emotional breakdown upon encountering familiar plants. The hibiscus, though not identical to the one from her homeland, becomes a bridge between her memories and her present life. Her mother’s acceptance of the ""winter hibiscus"" as strong enough to survive the cold mirrors Saeng’s own adaptability. By linking her resolve to retake the test with the return of the geese and the budding hibiscus, the author shows Saeng embracing the cyclical nature of life and growth. The geese, once strange to her, now feel familiar, reflecting her gradual acclimation to her new home. The paragraph ties together themes of perseverance, cultural adaptation, and hope, leaving the reader with a sense of quiet determination. Saeng’s vow signals not just a practical goal but a symbolic renewal, aligning her personal growth with the natural world’s rhythms. The ending affirms that while loss is inevitable, resilience and new beginnings are possible."
351	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s transition from being overwhelmed by grief to finding a fragile but determined sense of hope. This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life and her resolve to persevere, symbolically linking her personal growth to the resilience of nature. Throughout the story, Saeng is acutely aware of everything she has lost—her homeland, her grandmother, and the familiar plants of her childhood. This loss is so powerful that it causes her to weep in the greenhouse. Her failure of the driver's test compounds this feeling, making her feel like an outsider who cannot adapt. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive hibiscus is not one of anger but of understanding and gentle wisdom. She calls it the ""winter hibiscus,"" acknowledging that while it is different and its flowers ""aren’t as pretty"" as those from home, its strength lies in its ability to survive the cold. This reframes the plant from a symbol of painful memory into a symbol of resilience. By planting the hibiscus in their new garden, Saeng and her mother perform an act of putting down roots in their new environment. As Saeng works, she notices that things which were once strange, like the call of the Canada geese, have become ""almost familiar."" This shows a quiet, unconscious process of adaptation. The paragraph’s concluding sentence ties this adaptation to a concrete goal: retaking the test. Saeng’s vow is deliberately connected to the natural cycles of her new home—the spring thaw, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. She is no longer fighting the change of seasons but is learning to move with them, using them as a timeline for her own efforts. Therefore, the ending provides a resolution that is not about erasing the past, but about finding the strength to grow in a new world, mirroring the hardy winter hibiscus itself."
352	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring to show her transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding resilience and hope for the future. This final paragraph connects her personal growth to the cycles of nature, suggesting that she has begun to put down roots in her new country, much like the winter hibiscus. Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by a deep sense of loss for her homeland. Her failure of the driver's test is not just a single setback but feels like a failure to adapt, intensifying her grief. This is powerfully illustrated in the florist shop, where familiar plants like the hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle trigger visceral memories of her grandmother and her childhood in Vietnam, causing her to break down in tears. The past feels ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone,"" and her initial purchase of the hibiscus is a desperate, expensive attempt to hold onto a piece of that world. However, her mother’s reaction provides a crucial shift in perspective. Mrs. Panouvong does not scold her for long about the cost or the failed test; instead, she focuses on the plant, calling it a ""winter hibiscus."" She notes that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng a lesson in resilience—it is not about perfectly recreating the past, but about surviving and adapting to a new environment. This new understanding is what makes the final vow possible. As Saeng plants the hibiscus, she notices that the honks of the Canada geese, once strange, have become ""familiar."" This parallels her own journey; through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season,"" the unfamiliar has begun to feel like home. Her vow to retake the test ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" directly links her personal resolve to the natural cycle of rebirth and return. The winter hibiscus, which survives the cold, becomes a symbol for Saeng herself, who is now determined to endure her current hardships and bloom again in the spring. The conclusion thus signifies her acceptance of a hybrid identity, honoring her past while putting down roots and looking forward to her future in America."

This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life in the United States and her determination to move forward, blending her past heritage with her present reality. Throughout the story, Saeng is consumed by a deep sense of loss for her homeland. Failing her driver's test amplifies her feelings of being an outsider, unable to navigate this new culture. Her subsequent visit to the florist shop plunges her into a wave of visceral memories associated with plants like the hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle. These memories are so powerful that they cause her to break down and weep, mourning for ""the hibiscus hedge, the well, [and] her gentle grandmother,"" all of which feel ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This illustrates that her sorrow is not just about the test but about a profound dislocation from her past. However, the interaction with her mother marks a turning point. Instead of scolding her for the expensive plant or the failed test, Mrs. Panouvong reacts with understanding and gentle wisdom. She recognizes the plant as a ""winter hibiscus,"" acknowledging it is not exactly like the one from home but valuing its strength to ""make it through the cold months."" This act of planting the hibiscus together symbolizes putting down roots in their new, harsher environment. Saeng then notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar,"" and she admits that many things have become familiar through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" Therefore, the concluding paragraph ties these elements together. Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring is directly linked to the natural cycles she now observes—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the newly planted hibiscus. The hibiscus is no longer just a symbol of what was lost; it has become a symbol of endurance, a ""winter hibiscus"" that can survive.

This final vow represents a significant shift in her character, moving beyond the paralyzing grief she experienced in the greenhouse. Earlier in the story, Saeng is consumed by a sense of irretrievable loss. The familiar plants in the florist shop trigger powerful memories of her childhood in Laos, leading to a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes."" She focuses on everything that is gone forever: ""the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?"" This overwhelming grief causes her to break down. However, a pivotal change begins when she returns home and interacts with her mother. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test for long; instead, she focuses on the positive, calling the hibiscus ""beautiful"" and immediately deciding to plant it. She acknowledges the plant's difference, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This act of planting symbolizes adaptability and putting down new roots in a harsh environment. Saeng internalizes this lesson. As she plants the hibiscus, she notices that things she once found strange, like the honking of Canada geese, have become ""familiar."" She even admits to preferring the bitter melon her mother is cooking to a Big Mac, showing she is integrating her old life with her new one.

After failing her test, she is overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss"" for her homeland and grandmother while in the greenhouse, ""break[ing] down and [weeping]"" as she confronts the irretrievable nature of her past. The hibiscus she finds, however, is not the same as the one from her childhood; it is a ""winter hibiscus,"" a hardy variant that can survive the cold. Her mother points out that this strength ""is what matters,"" teaching Saeng that survival and beauty are possible even in a new, harsher environment.

This paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict by showing Saeng’s emotional journey from despair to determination. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a deep sense of loss for her homeland. In the greenhouse, the sight of the hibiscus triggers powerful memories of her grandmother and her childhood in Vietnam, leading to a “wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes” and causes her to weep. This shows how disconnected and rooted in the past she feels. Her failure of the driver’s test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt to American life, compounds this feeling of alienation.

Saeng’s act of planting the hibiscus in their American garden is a pivotal moment of putting down new roots, both literally and metaphorically. As she works, she notices that the honks of the Canada geese have become “familiar to her now,” showing a gradual acceptance of her new surroundings. The final vow ties her personal growth to the natural cycle of the seasons. She links her next attempt at the test to the spring, a time of rebirth, when the snow melts, the geese return, and her own “winter hibiscus” will bud. This parallel shows that she now sees her own life as cyclical and full of potential for new beginnings, rather than defined by a single failure. The hibiscus, which once represented everything she had lost, is now a living promise for the future, and her decision to try again demonstrates that she has found the strength to move forward, integrating her heritage with her new life.

The final paragraph reinforces this theme of hope and perseverance. Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring aligns with the natural cycles of renewal, symbolized by the returning geese and the budding hibiscus. This suggests that Saeng is learning to navigate her dual identity, embracing the familiar (like the bitter melon and the geese’s honks) while facing new challenges. The author leaves the reader with a sense of forward momentum, showing that Saeng’s grief is not the end of her story but a step toward growth. By tying her resolve to the changing seasons, the ending underscores the idea that healing and adaptation take time, but they are possible.

373	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring to illustrate her shift from being paralyzed by grief to finding resilience and hope for the future. This final paragraph serves as the culmination of her emotional journey, which begins with a profound sense of loss. After failing her driver's test, Saeng is overwhelmed by the disorienting unfamiliarity of her new country. This feeling deepens in the greenhouse, where the sight of the hibiscus and other plants from her childhood—like the *dok Malik* that reminds her of her grandmother—unleashes a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes."" She breaks down, mourning the ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world of her past. However, the interaction with her mother provides a crucial turning point. Her mother’s gentle reaction to the failed test and the expensive plant, followed by her practical wisdom about the ""winter hibiscus,"" re-frames Saeng’s perspective. Her mother notes that although this American hibiscus’s flowers ""aren’t as pretty"" as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that survival and adaptation have their own beauty and strength. The act of planting the hibiscus together is a symbolic act of putting down new roots in the cold, hard soil of their new environment. This newfound resilience is solidified as Saeng works in the garden. She notices that the honks of the Canada geese, once strange, are now ""familiar,"" and she admits that many things have become familiar ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season."" Her vow to retake the test is therefore linked to the natural cycles of resilience and rebirth that she now observes around her. Just as the winter hibiscus survives the cold and the geese return in the spring, Saeng decides she too will try again. The concluding paragraph thus powerfully symbolizes her acceptance of her new life, her connection to the hopeful rhythm of the seasons, and her determination to move forward."
374	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it powerfully symbolizes her shift from dwelling on the past to finding the resilience to build a new life. This final paragraph shows that Saeng has internalized the lesson of the “winter hibiscus”—a plant that, while different from the one in her homeland, is strong enough to survive the cold. Her initial grief in the greenhouse was for an ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone"" world, a loss made more acute by her failure on the test, which represented another failure to adapt. However, her mother’s gentle acceptance and their shared act of planting the hibiscus reframe Saeng's perspective. Her mother notes that the winter hibiscus’s flowers ""aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that value and beauty can be found in resilience and adaptation, not just in perfect recreations of the past. This newfound understanding is confirmed by the story’s closing images. As she plants the hibiscus, Saeng notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" She realizes that familiarity is built through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" By linking her personal vow to the natural cycles of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding, Saeng aligns her own growth with the enduring power of nature. She is no longer a fragile blossom torn from its hedge but a resilient plant putting down roots in hard, new soil. Therefore, the conclusion transforms the driver’s test from a symbol of defeat into a future goal, demonstrating that Saeng has chosen to persevere and bloom where she is planted, embracing both her heritage and her new home."
375	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her emotional transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding resilience and hope for the future. This final paragraph resolves the story's central conflict by connecting Saeng’s newfound determination directly to the symbolism of the winter hibiscus and the natural cycles she now observes in her new home. Throughout the story, Saeng is consumed by a profound sense of dislocation and grief for her lost life in Laos. Her failure of the driver’s test intensifies this feeling, symbolizing her struggles to navigate and succeed in American culture. The subsequent discovery of the hibiscus plant triggers a flood of visceral memories, culminating in her breaking down in tears as she mourns for her grandmother, her garden, and her homeland, which feel ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, her mother provides a crucial perspective when she calls the plant the ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This reframes the hibiscus from being a poor substitute for the past into a symbol of hardiness and adaptation. This lesson in resilience is then mirrored in the story's final scene. As Saeng plants the hibiscus, she notices the familiar honking of Canada geese and realizes that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar."" This observation marks a significant shift; she is beginning to put down roots and find belonging in this new environment, just like the hibiscus. Her vow to retake the test ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" directly links her personal growth to these natural cycles. The budding hibiscus will represent a new beginning, and her decision to try again demonstrates that she has internalized its lesson of endurance. She is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead looking forward, using the promise of spring as a source of strength. The story thus ends on a note of quiet determination, showing that Saeng is learning to survive the winter of her displacement and is ready to bloom again."
376	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring because it powerfully demonstrates her shift from despair to hope and her growing acceptance of her new life. This final paragraph shows that Saeng has found a way to reconcile her past with her present. Her profound homesickness and sense of loss, which caused her to break down in the greenhouse, are now tempered by a newfound resilience. This change is sparked by her mother’s wisdom. When Saeng is ashamed that the hibiscus is not ""real,"" like the ones in Laos, her mother points out its true strength: ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that beauty and value can be found in adaptation and survival. The act of planting the hibiscus together is a physical act of putting down roots in their new, harsh environment. Furthermore, Saeng realizes that many things she once found strange have become ""almost familiar,"" such as the taste of bitter melon and the honking of Canada geese. These details show her slowly building a new sense of home. By linking her personal goal of passing the test to the natural cycles of her new home—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the winter hibiscus—Saeng aligns her own growth with the resilience of the plant. The hibiscus becomes a symbol of her own journey; just as it is strong enough to survive the winter and bloom again, she too can endure hardship and try again. The conclusion, therefore, leaves the reader with a sense of quiet determination, showing that Saeng has chosen to face the future with hope rather than be paralyzed by the past."
377	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding a resilient hope for the future. This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life and the strength she has gained from reconnecting with her cultural roots. Throughout the story, Saeng is assailed by powerful feelings of displacement and grief. Failing her driver's test underscores her struggle to adapt, and her subsequent visit to the greenhouse unleashes a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes"" as she remembers her grandmother and her former home in Laos. The tropical plants are visceral links to a past she feels is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, her mother’s reaction to the hibiscus provides a crucial shift in perspective. Mrs. Panouvong does not focus on the cost but recognizes the plant's symbolic value. She calls it a ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of endurance and the possibility of blooming in a harsh new environment. This new understanding allows Saeng to see her own situation differently. As she plants the hibiscus, she becomes aware of sounds and smells from her kitchen—the beating of eggs and the pungent smell of bitter melon, a ""cultivated taste"" she realizes she ""much preferred... to a Big Mac."" This signifies a dawning acceptance and even appreciation of her unique identity. The honking of the Canada geese, which she once found strange, now sounds ""familiar."" The author uses the natural cycle of the seasons and the migration of the geese to mirror Saeng’s emotional journey. By linking her decision to retake the test to the spring return of the geese and the budding of the hardy hibiscus, the author shows that Saeng’s hope is no longer fleeting. It is now rooted, like the plant, in the reality of her new life. Her vow is a promise to persevere, demonstrating that the strength she derives from her heritage will help her weather the ""cold months"" and eventually bloom again."
378	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has moved from a state of paralyzing grief to one of hopeful determination, symbolizing her acceptance of her new life while still honoring her past. The paragraph acts as a resolution to the emotional crisis Saeng experiences in the greenhouse, where the sight of familiar plants triggers a “wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes” for everything she left behind in Laos. Her breakdown is a culmination of her feelings of alienation, which are emphasized by her failure of the driver's test, an emblematic American rite of passage. By the end of the story, however, the hibiscus plant, which her mother calls the “winter hibiscus,” becomes a powerful symbol of resilience. Her mother notes that while its flowers “aren’t as pretty” as the ones from home, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters.” This teaches Saeng that adaptation and strength are valuable, even if the new version is different. Saeng’s internal vow is directly connected to the natural cycles she now observes in her American environment. The promise to retake the test is synchronized with the return of the Canada geese in spring, a sight that she realizes has become “familiar to her now.” This parallels the hibiscus's ability to survive the winter and bud again. Just as the plant must endure the cold to bloom, and the geese must migrate to return, Saeng understands that her own journey involves perseverance through difficulty. Her newfound appreciation for the bitter melon, a “cultivated taste” that she prefers to a Big Mac, shows she is already integrating her heritage with her new surroundings. Therefore, the final paragraph completes Saeng’s character arc by demonstrating that she has found a source of strength. She is no longer overwhelmed by loss but is instead motivated by the hope of renewal, vowing to face her challenge again when the world around her signals a new beginning.
379	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to illustrate her emotional transformation from despair to resilience and her budding connection to her new home. This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict by showing that Saeng has found a source of strength, merging memories of her past with hope for her future. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss for her homeland. After failing her driver's test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt, she is drawn into a greenhouse where the familiar plants trigger visceral memories of Vietnam. The hibiscus, the Madagascar periwinkle, and the jasmine blossom vividly transport her back to her grandmother’s garden and well, culminating in a wave of grief so strong that she “broke down and wept.” This intense sorrow highlights how disconnected and rootless she feels in the cold, unfamiliar American landscape. However, her mother’s reaction to the hibiscus plant begins Saeng’s healing. Instead of focusing on the cost, her mother recognizes the plant's symbolic value, calling it a “winter hibiscus” that is strong enough to survive the cold. This reframes the plant not as a poor substitute for the past, but as something resilient and valuable in its own right. The act of planting it together in their American garden is a literal and metaphorical act of putting down new roots. As Saeng works, she notices that the sounds and smells of her mother cooking bitter melon—a “cultivated taste” she prefers to a Big Mac—have become comforting. Even the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, is now “familiar.” Therefore, the concluding vow represents a new, determined acceptance of her life. By linking her resolve to the natural cycles of her new environment—the return of the geese and the budding of the hardy hibiscus in spring—Saeng demonstrates that she is no longer solely looking backward. She has begun to integrate her past with her present, finding beauty and strength in the hybrid “winter hibiscus” and in her own capacity to endure and try again. The ending affirms that while the past is “irretrievably gone,” the future holds the promise of growth and renewed effort.
380	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because this paragraph powerfully resolves the story’s central conflict: Saeng’s struggle between her painful past in Laos and her challenging present in America. This resolution is not a sudden dismissal of her grief but a hard-won acceptance that allows her to move forward. The paragraph connects her personal growth directly to the symbolism of the ""winter hibiscus"" and the natural cycles she now observes. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss. The familiar plants in the greenhouse trigger vivid memories of her grandmother and her childhood home, leading to a ""wave of loss so deep and strong"" that she weeps. She feels her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, her mother provides a crucial perspective when she examines the hibiscus Saeng bought. She acknowledges it is not exactly the same as the one from home, but she values its strength to ""make it through the cold months here."" This reframes the plant from being a poor substitute for the past into a symbol of resilience and adaptation. By helping her mother plant the hibiscus in their new garden, Saeng actively participates in putting down roots in this new, cold environment. The concluding paragraph shows that Saeng has internalized her mother’s wisdom. She no longer sees the natural world around her as purely strange and hostile. The honking of the Canada geese, which she once found foreign, is now ""clear and—yes—familiar."" She realizes that familiarity is built through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season."" Her vow to retake the test is therefore timed with the hopeful, cyclical return of spring—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of the resilient hibiscus she has just planted. The test is no longer just a personal failure but part of a larger process of growth and adaptation. By linking her personal goal to the natural cycle, the author shows that Saeng has found a way to honor her past while tentatively embracing her future. The winter hibiscus, which survives the cold, becomes a metaphor for Saeng herself, who is now determined to endure her own ""winter"" and bloom again in the spring."
381	-1	4	4	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring because it signifies her acceptance of her new life and her newfound resilience, symbolically merging her past and her present. This final paragraph demonstrates that Saeng's profound grief in the greenhouse has been transformed into quiet determination. The hibiscus she plants is not the same as the one from her homeland; it is a ""winter hibiscus,"" a hardy plant that can survive the cold, just as Saeng must learn to thrive in a new and often harsh environment. Her mother’s acceptance of this new plant and her gentle understanding of Saeng's failure show Saeng that growth and beauty are possible even in difficult circumstances. This resolution is reinforced by the specific details Saeng notices in her own yard. She hears the familiar sounds and smells the pungent aroma of her mother cooking bitter melon, a ""cultivated taste"" that she prefers to a Big Mac. This represents her deep, enduring connection to her Laotian heritage, which provides comfort and strength. Furthermore, the Canada geese flying overhead are no longer strange but their honks are ""familiar."" This shows that, through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season,"" aspects of her American life are becoming part of her identity. By linking her personal goal—retaking the test—to the natural cycles of the geese returning and the hardy hibiscus budding, Saeng aligns her own growth with the resilience of nature. She is not erasing her past but is instead choosing to move forward, using the memory of her homeland as a foundation for her future. The ending thus completes her emotional journey from being overwhelmed by loss to finding the strength to try again, rooted in the hybrid identity of the winter hibiscus itself."

When Saeng apologetically says the hibiscus is ""not a real one,"" her mother redefines its value, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng that while this new version is different, its strength and ability to survive and bloom in a harsh environment give it its own worth. This lesson in resilience is mirrored in Saeng’s own life. As she plants the hibiscus in their cold, hard soil, she hears the familiar sounds and smells the pungent aroma of her mother cooking bitter melon—a ""cultivated taste"" she has come to prefer over American food like a Big Mac. She then notices the Canada geese flying overhead, whose honks were once strange but are now ""familiar.""

This highlights her initial inability to reconcile her past with her difficult present, symbolized by her failure of the driver's test and the cold, unfamiliar American environment.

Her mother, instead of scolding her for the expensive purchase or the failed test, offers comfort and understanding. She identifies the plant's strength, noting that while its flowers ""aren’t as pretty,"" it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This serves as a metaphor for their own lives as immigrants; they must adapt and endure hardships to survive in a new, colder climate.

This lesson is reinforced as Saeng works in the garden, noticing that the once-alien sounds of Canada geese have become ""familiar,"" and admitting she prefers the bitter melon of her culture to a Big Mac. By vowing to retake the test in the spring, Saeng aligns her personal goal with the natural cycles of her new home.

By planting the hardy winter hibiscus in their cold new garden, Saeng and her mother perform a symbolic act of putting down new roots. This act of planting, combined with the comforting sounds and smells of her mother cooking a culturally significant bitter melon omelet, grounds Saeng in her new reality. She realizes that some things she once found strange, like the taste of bitter melon or the call of Canada geese, have become ""almost familiar."" The final paragraph connects the budding of the hibiscus—a symbol of her heritage now adapted to a new climate—with the return of the geese and the melting snow, all symbols of a cyclical renewal. Her vow to retake the test demonstrates that she has internalized the lesson of the winter hibiscus: she too can endure the harsh ""winter"" of her displacement and bloom again, finding the strength to move forward in her new life."
391	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her journey from being overwhelmed by loss to finding resilience and a new sense of belonging. This final paragraph signifies a crucial shift in Saeng’s perspective, connecting her past in Vietnam with her future in the United States. Throughout the story, Saeng is haunted by the “irretrievable” loss of her homeland, a pain so sharp it causes her to weep in the greenhouse. The familiar plants she encounters, like the hibiscus and jasmine, are bittersweet because they are not the “real” ones from home but substitutes that highlight everything she has lost. However, her mother helps reframe this perspective by valuing the “winter hibiscus” for its strength to survive the cold, teaching Saeng that adaptation and resilience are what matter. By the end, Saeng begins to recognize that “familiarity” can be built over time, even in a new land. She notices that the honking of Canada geese, once strange, is now a recognizable sound, and she admits a preference for the bitter melon of her childhood over a Big Mac. The winter hibiscus, planted in the cold, hard soil of her new home, becomes a symbol of this fragile but tenacious new life. Her vow to retake the test is therefore not just about a driver’s license; it is a promise to move forward, synchronized with the hopeful, renewing cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. The conclusion thus emphasizes that while the past is gone, the future holds the promise of growth and integration, marking Saeng’s acceptance of her hybrid identity and her determination to persevere.
392	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng’s resilience and her gradual acceptance of her new life in the United States while still holding onto her cultural roots. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with feelings of loss and displacement after failing her driver’s test, which symbolizes her difficulty adapting to her new environment. However, her encounter with the hibiscus and other familiar plants in the florist shop reconnects her to her childhood in Vietnam, evoking powerful memories of her grandmother and home. This moment of recognition and grief ultimately helps her reconcile her past with her present. The final paragraph reflects Saeng’s renewed determination and hope. By vowing to retake the test in the spring, she aligns her personal growth with the natural cycles of her new home—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. These details suggest that Saeng is beginning to find familiarity and comfort in her surroundings, even as she cherishes her heritage. The hibiscus, though not identical to the one from Vietnam, becomes a symbol of resilience, adapting to the cold just as Saeng must adapt to her new life. The author’s choice to end on this note underscores the theme of perseverance and the quiet strength found in embracing change while honoring one’s past. The conclusion also ties together the story’s central conflict—Saeng’s struggle between memory and adaptation.

The final vow to retake the test signifies Saeng’s commitment to moving forward, blending her old and new worlds with hope and determination. Thus, the paragraph serves as a poignant resolution, highlighting growth, resilience, and the enduring connection to one’s roots."
393	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng’s emotional transformation from despair to resilience and acceptance of her new life. This final vow represents a significant shift from the overwhelming grief she experienced in the greenhouse. There, the sight of the hibiscus triggered a “wave of loss so deep and strong” for her childhood in Laos, making her feel that her past was “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” Her failure of the driver’s test compounded this feeling of alienation, symbolizing her struggle to navigate American culture. However, the interaction with her mother and the act of planting the “winter hibiscus” become a healing process. Her mother’s gentle reaction to the test failure and her insightful comment about the plant—“its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, that’s what matters”—reframes the hibiscus as a symbol of adaptation rather than loss. It is not the same as the one from home, but it is hardy and can survive in a new, harsher climate, just as their family must. This lesson is reinforced as Saeng acknowledges that once-strange things, like the taste of bitter melon and the call of Canada geese, have become “familiar.” By linking her personal goal of retaking the test to the natural cycles of her new environment—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hardy hibiscus—Saeng demonstrates that she has internalized her mother’s wisdom. She is no longer paralyzed by the past but is instead looking forward to the future, finding strength and a sense of belonging in the rhythm of the seasons. The conclusion thus shows that Saeng has chosen to persevere, symbolically planting her own roots and vowing to blossom again in the spring.

This feeling is magnified in the greenhouse, where the familiar plants trigger powerful memories of her grandmother and her home in Vietnam, leading to a wave of ""irretrievable"" loss that causes her to weep. However, the interaction with her mother marks a turning point. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test; instead, she focuses on the positive, calling the hibiscus ""beautiful"" and appreciating its strength to survive the cold months as ""winter hibiscus.""

She mourns not just the hibiscus hedge and the well of her childhood, but also her grandmother and the entire world that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” Her failure of the driver’s test compounds this feeling of alienation, making her feel incompetent in her new country.

That’s what matters.” This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol not of the lost past, but of survival and resilience in a new, harsher climate.

She hears the Canada geese and recognizes their honks as “familiar.” She understands that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar.” This shows her beginning to put down roots, much like the plant.

Her mother’s reaction is crucial; instead of focusing on the cost, she recognizes the plant's symbolic value and calls it a “winter hibiscus,” highlighting its strength to survive the cold. This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of endurance. By planting the hibiscus in their new garden, Saeng is literally putting down roots in her new environment. The comforting sounds and smells from her mother’s cooking—the bitter melon she has a “cultivated taste” for—show her appreciating the blend of her old and new worlds. Even the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become familiar. The paragraph’s conclusion ties Saeng’s personal resolution to the natural cycle of the seasons. She vows to retake the test in the spring, linking her personal growth to the hibiscus budding and the geese returning. This shows she is no longer paralyzed by the past but is instead looking forward, using the resilience of the winter hibiscus as a model for her own life. The ending affirms that while her past is integral to her identity, she is now ready to face the challenges of her future with renewed determination.

This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life in the United States and a renewed sense of determination. Throughout the story, Saeng is confronted by a deep sense of dislocation. Failing her driver's test is not just a personal failure but a symbol of her struggle to adapt. Her trip to the florist plunges her into a wave of visceral memories of her grandmother and her home in Vietnam, culminating in an outpouring of grief for all that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, the conversation with her mother marks a turning point. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test, but instead focuses on the positive, noting the strength of the ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This reframes the plant not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of hardiness and survival. Planting the hibiscus together is an act of putting down roots, both literally and metaphorically. As she works in the garden, Saeng notices that the sounds and smells of her mother’s cooking, once symbols of difference, are now comforting. She admits she prefers the bitter melon to a Big Mac, and the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" This shows a gradual, subconscious integration into her new environment. Her vow to retake the test in the spring directly connects her personal growth to the natural cycle.

412	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the test in the spring to show her shift from despair to hope, illustrating her path toward reconciling her past and present. After failing her driver's test, Saeng is overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss for her homeland, a feeling that peaks in the greenhouse where familiar plants trigger memories of Vietnam and her grandmother, causing her to weep. The “winter hibiscus” she buys becomes a powerful symbol of this painful transition; it is not the same as the hibiscus from home, but her mother points out it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months,” teaching Saeng that resilience and adaptation are possible. This lesson is reinforced as Saeng plants the hibiscus and notices the familiar honk of Canada geese, realizing that many once-alien things have become familiar through the “quiet repetition of season upon season.” Her vow to retake the test when the geese return and the hibiscus buds therefore represents her newfound determination. She is no longer paralyzed by grief but is instead learning to put down roots in her new environment, using the cyclical promise of spring as a metaphor for her own potential for growth and future success. The ending thus completes her emotional journey, showing that she has begun to accept her new life while still honoring the old, finding the strength to move forward.

This final paragraph serves as the culmination of Saeng’s emotional journey, which begins with a profound sense of dislocation. After failing her test, she is engulfed by memories of her past life in Vietnam, triggered by the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The sight of the hibiscus causes a ""shock of recognition,"" and the scent of jasmine vividly recalls her grandmother, leading to a wave of grief so strong that she breaks down, mourning a world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant provides a pivotal shift. Instead of anger, her mother focuses on the plant's strength, calling it the ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months.""

This resolution is earned through her emotional journey, which is catalyzed by the ""winter hibiscus."" Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a sense of loss. Failing her driver's test reinforces her feeling of not belonging, and her visit to the greenhouse unleashes a flood of memories associated with the plants of her homeland. The sight of the hibiscus causes a ""shock of recognition,"" and the jasmine blossom vividly reminds her of her grandmother. This sensory immersion leads to a ""wave of loss so deep and strong"" that she breaks down weeping, mourning not just the plants but the entire world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, the conversation with her mother provides a crucial shift in perspective. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test for long; instead, she focuses on the hibiscus itself. She recognizes it is not identical to the one from home, but she values its strength, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here.

This paragraph demonstrates that Saeng is no longer overwhelmed by her past losses but is instead learning to integrate her heritage with her present reality to build a hopeful future. Throughout the story, Saeng is caught between her memories of Laos and the unfamiliarity of America. Failing her driver’s test is a concrete example of her struggle to adapt, and her subsequent visit to the greenhouse plunges her into a wave of grief for everything she has lost—her grandmother, the hibiscus hedge, and her former home. Her breakdown in the greenhouse shows the depth of her sorrow and her feeling that her past is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is pivotal.

She calls it a “winter hibiscus,” strong enough to survive the cold, and together they plant it in their new garden. This act is symbolic; they are putting down roots, both literally and figuratively, in their new home. The final paragraph builds on this symbolism. The “winter hibiscus” now planted in the ground represents Saeng herself—a transplant that can survive and even thrive in a harsh new environment. The return of the Canada geese, which she now finds “familiar,” shows that she is slowly becoming accustomed to her new surroundings. By connecting her personal goal—retaking the test—to the natural cycle of the seasons and the budding of the hibiscus, Saeng aligns her own growth with the resilience of nature. Her vow is not just about passing a test; it is a promise to herself to keep trying, to bloom again in the spring after a difficult emotional winter.

Her visit to the greenhouse triggers a flood of visceral memories connected to the plants of her homeland, culminating in an overwhelming wave of grief where she mourns the loss of ""the hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?"" She sees these memories as ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, her mother helps initiate her change in perspective. By calling the plant ""winter hibiscus,"" her mother reframes it not as a poor imitation of their past life, but as something strong enough to survive the cold, highlighting the importance of resilience. The act of planting the hibiscus together in their new garden is a tangible act of putting down roots in this unfamiliar soil. The concluding paragraph weaves together the symbols of her old and new lives, showing her acceptance of a blended identity. The return of the geese, which she now finds ""familiar,"" represents the cyclical nature of life in her new home, a rhythm she is slowly learning. She connects this new familiarity directly to the budding of the hibiscus, the symbol of her past. This fusion demonstrates that her Laotian heritage does not have to be lost but can instead grow and adapt in a new environment.

This final paragraph completes Saeng’s emotional journey from overwhelming grief to quiet determination. Her initial failure and the subsequent wave of loss in the greenhouse show her feeling disconnected and adrift. The hibiscus plant triggers powerful memories of her grandmother and her home in Vietnam, making her painfully aware of all that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" However, the conversation with her mother provides a crucial shift in perspective. Her mother accepts both the expensive plant and the failed test with gentle understanding, reframing the hibiscus not as a poor imitation of the past, but as a ""winter hibiscus""—a different, hardier plant that ""is strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This idea of resilience is what Saeng internalizes as she plants the hibiscus in their new garden. She notices that the bitter melon cooking inside is a ""cultivated taste"" she has come to prefer, and even the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" The act of planting the winter hibiscus is an act of putting down roots, both literally and metaphorically, in her new environment. Therefore, her vow to try the test again is intrinsically linked to the natural cycle of the seasons and the plant’s survival.

Earlier in the story, Saeng is crushed by the ""wave of loss"" for her homeland, realizing that her old life in Laos is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone,"" and she breaks down weeping in the greenhouse. The hibiscus plant she buys is a painful reminder that it is ""not a real one,"" not like the kind from her home, highlighting her initial inability to see value in her new environment. However, her mother’s reaction and wisdom provide the turning point. Mrs. Panouvong does not focus on the exorbitant cost of the plant or the failed test, but instead appreciates the plant's beauty and strength, calling it the ""winter hibiscus."" She notes that while its flowers aren't as pretty as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng a crucial lesson about resilience and adaptation. As Saeng plants the hibiscus in the cold, hard soil, she simultaneously begins to put down new roots in her own life. She notices that the honks of the Canada geese, once strange, have become ""familiar,"" and she admits she prefers the bitter melon her mother cooks to a Big Mac. Therefore, the vow to retake the test in the spring directly links her personal growth to the natural cycles of her new home.

The hibiscus, periwinkle, and jasmine evoke powerful memories of her grandmother and her life in Laos, leading her to weep for all that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” Her purchase of the hibiscus is an attempt to physically hold onto a piece of that past. However, her mother’s reaction provides a crucial shift in perspective. Mrs. Panouvong does not focus on the high cost of the plant or the failed test, but instead focuses on its potential.

The sight and sound of the Canada geese, which have become “familiar” through the “quiet repetition of season upon season,” mirrors her own gradual acclimatization. She realizes that things once strange can become familiar over time.

427	-1	4	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring to show her emotional transition from being overwhelmed by loss to finding resilience and hope for the future. Throughout the story, Saeng is engulfed by a profound sense of grief for her past life in Vietnam, triggered by her failure on the test and the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The intensity of her sorrow is clear when she “broke down and wept” among the flowers, mourning the irretrievable loss of her grandmother, her home, and the hibiscus hedge. This failure and the wave of nostalgia make her feel that her old world is “irrevocably gone.” However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive “winter hibiscus” provides a turning point. Instead of anger, her mother expresses understanding, noting that while the plant is different and “its flowers aren’t as pretty,” it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This observation serves as a metaphor for their own lives as immigrants; they must adapt and endure in a new, harsher environment. The act of planting the hibiscus together in the cold, hard soil is a physical act of putting down new roots, symbolizing perseverance. This newfound resilience is reinforced by Saeng’s observations as she plants the hibiscus.

However, through her interaction with her mother, Saeng begins to see the plant—and by extension, her identity—in a new light. Her mother immediately recognizes the hibiscus as “dok faeng-noi,” a winter-hardy variety. She acknowledges that its flowers “aren’t as pretty” as the ones from their homeland, “but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters.” This insight is crucial. The “winter hibiscus” becomes a symbol not of loss, but of endurance and the possibility of thriving in a new, harsher climate. By planting it together in their garden, a place where they cultivate bitter melons—another “cultivated taste” from home that has taken root in America—Saeng and her mother perform an act of resilience. The paragraph connects this act of planting to the natural cycles of her new home. As she works, Saeng hears the Canada geese, whose honks were once strange but are now “familiar.” This detail shows her growing connection to the rhythms of American life. Her vow is timed to the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, linking her personal goal to the hopeful, renewing season of spring.

The honking of the Canada geese, which she now finds familiar, signals this shift. The cyclical, predictable return of the geese represents the quiet passage of time and the way strange things can become familiar. By linking her personal goal—retaking the test—to the natural cycle of the seasons and the budding of the hibiscus she has just planted, Saeng demonstrates a newfound patience and hope. She is no longer overwhelmed by immediate failure or loss but is able to look forward to a future where her past and present can coexist.

The sight of the hibiscus in the greenhouse triggers a ""shock of recognition,"" but this connection to her childhood also leads to a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes."" She is painfully aware that her old life, symbolized by the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her grandmother, is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her failure of the driver's test, an American rite of passage, underscores her struggle to adapt, making her feel like an outsider. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant and the failed test is a turning point. Instead of anger, her mother shows understanding, calling the plant “strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” This reframes the hibiscus as a symbol not of pure memory, but of survival and hardiness in a new, harsher climate. By planting it in their own garden, Saeng and her mother perform an act of putting down roots, both literally and metaphorically, in their new home. The final paragraph weaves together the symbols of this new life that have become ""almost familiar."" The bitter melon cooking for dinner is a ""cultivated taste"" she has retained and now prefers ""to a Big Mac."" The call of the Canada geese, once strange, is now a recognizable sound. By linking her personal vow to the budding of the winter hibiscus and the return of the geese, Saeng aligns her own growth and future efforts with the resilient, natural world around her. The conclusion shows that she is no longer paralyzed by grief but is looking forward, using the strength of the ""winter hibiscus"" as a model to persevere and try again."

This final paragraph resolves the story’s central conflict by connecting Saeng’s past in Laos with her new life in America, symbolized by the winter hibiscus. Throughout the story, Saeng is consumed by a sense of dislocation and grief. Failing her driver's test intensifies her feeling of not belonging, and her subsequent discovery of the hibiscus plant triggers a ""shock of recognition"" and a flood of memories from her childhood. These memories, however, are bittersweet, culminating in a ""wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes"" as she realizes her old life is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her breakdown in the greenhouse represents the peak of her sorrow and her inability to hold onto the past. Her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is crucial to Saeng’s shift in perspective. Instead of anger, her mother shows understanding and gentle wisdom. She calls the plant a ""winter hibiscus,"" noting that while its flowers ""aren’t as pretty"" as the ones from home, ""it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This teaches Saeng a vital lesson about resilience and adaptation. The act of planting the hibiscus together in the hard, cold soil is a physical metaphor for putting down new roots in an unforgiving environment. This newfound perspective allows Saeng to finally see value in her new life. She notices that the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, is now ""familiar."" She admits she prefers the bitter melon, a taste from her culture, to a Big Mac. These details show she is beginning to integrate her past and present. The concluding vow, therefore, is not just about a driver's test. It is a promise grounded in the natural cycles of her new home—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of the resilient winter hibiscus. She aligns her personal goal with the promise of spring, demonstrating that she has found the strength to move forward. The story thus ends on a note of quiet determination, showing that Saeng has learned to carry her memories without being crippled by them, embracing a future where her heritage and her new world can coexist."
433	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow to retake the driver’s test in the spring because it signifies her transition from being lost in grief over the past to finding the resilience to build a new life. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss. In the greenhouse, the familiar plants trigger powerful memories of her grandmother and her home in Vietnam, culminating in a wave of grief so strong that she breaks down and weeps. The hibiscus she buys is a painful reminder that the past is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” However, the conversation with her mother provides a crucial shift in perspective. Her mother calls the plant a “winter hibiscus,” noting that while its flowers aren't as pretty, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That’s what matters.” This reframes the plant not as a poor substitute for the past, but as a symbol of survival and adaptation. This new understanding allows Saeng to see her surroundings with fresh eyes. As she plants the hibiscus, she notices that the once-strange honks of the Canada geese are now “familiar.” She realizes that through the “quiet repetition of season upon season,” many things in her new country have become almost familiar. Her vow to retake the test in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, directly ties her personal resolve to the cyclical, hopeful rhythm of nature. The driver's test, which she initially failed, transforms from a simple failure into a symbol of her struggle to navigate her new world. By connecting her personal goal to the resilient ""winter hibiscus"" and the returning spring, the ending shows that Saeng has chosen to root herself in the present and move forward with hope, embracing a future that blends the memory of her past with the realities of her new home."

This final paragraph signifies that Saeng has begun to accept her new life, integrating memories of her past with the realities of her present. Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a deep sense of loss for her homeland, triggered by the familiar plants in the greenhouse. The hibiscus, periwinkle, and jasmine unleash visceral memories of her grandmother, their garden, and a world that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone,” causing her to break down in tears. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant provides a pivotal shift. Instead of anger, her mother focuses on the plant’s practical strength, calling it the “winter hibiscus” that is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters.” This highlights a theme of resilience and adaptation. By planting the hibiscus together in their cold, new soil, Saeng and her mother perform an act of putting down roots in their new country. This is mirrored in the story’s details: Saeng realizes she has developed a “cultivated taste” for the bitter melon her friends dislike, and the honks of the Canada geese, once strange, have become “familiar.” Therefore, the promise to retake the test is not just about a driver’s license; it is a metaphor for her renewed will to try again, synchronized with the natural cycles of her new environment. She ties her personal goal to the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the winter hibiscus buds—symbols of perseverance and new beginnings. This conclusion shows that Saeng is no longer looking only backward but is now looking forward, ready to grow and succeed in her new home.

This final resolution is earned through the emotional journey she experiences after failing her driver's test, a symbol of her struggle to adapt to American life. Her subsequent discovery of the hibiscus plant plunges her into a wave of grief for her lost home in Vietnam, causing her to break down in the greenhouse as she mourns the irretrievable past, including her grandmother and their garden. However, her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant is crucial to this shift. Instead of focusing on the cost or the failed test, Mrs. Panouvong focuses on the plant’s strength, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This reframes the hibiscus not as a fragile relic of the past, but as a symbol of endurance and the possibility of thriving in a new, harsher environment. The act of planting the hibiscus together in the cold, hard soil is a tangible act of putting down new roots. Saeng’s observations while planting solidify this change. She notices that the bitter melon, a ""cultivated taste"" from her past, is something she now prefers to a Big Mac. Similarly, the honking of the Canada geese, once strange, has become ""familiar."" These details show her gradual, unconscious adaptation. By linking her vow to retake the test to the natural cycles of spring—the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus—the author shows that Saeng’s hope is now grounded in the rhythms of her new life. The hibiscus is no longer just a reminder of what was lost, but a promise of what can bloom again, making Saeng's final vow a powerful statement of resilience."
437	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng’s resilience and her gradual acceptance of her new life in the United States while still holding onto her cultural roots. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with feelings of loss and displacement after moving from Vietnam, as seen in her emotional breakdown in the greenhouse when she encounters familiar plants that remind her of home.

The final paragraph ties these themes together by showing Saeng’s determination to try again. The return of the geese in spring mirrors her own cyclical journey of growth and renewal. By linking her decision to retake the driver’s test to the natural cycles of the hibiscus and the geese, the author highlights Saeng’s newfound hope and perseverance.

Failing the test deepens her feeling of alienation, and her trip to the greenhouse unleashes a flood of memories, making her ""break down and wept"" for a world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" This profound grief highlights how disconnected she feels from her new life. However, her mother provides a crucial perspective by focusing not on the plant’s differences, but on its strengths, calling it a ""winter hibiscus"" that is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here. That’s what matters."" This conversation and the act of planting the hibiscus in their own garden represent a conscious choice to cultivate a new life. The final paragraph connects this act of planting to the natural cycle of the seasons, a cycle Saeng is slowly becoming part of. She realizes that many things she once found strange, like the call of the Canada geese, have become ""familiar to her now"" through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" Her vow to retake the test in the spring, a time of renewal, directly ties her personal growth to this natural rhythm.

The familiar plants in the greenhouse trigger a visceral connection to her childhood, but they also highlight everything she has ""irretrievably, irrevocably"" lost, causing her to break down. Her failure on the driver’s test symbolizes her initial struggle to adapt to this new world.

This final paragraph resolves Saeng’s internal conflict, which is triggered by her failure and the intense wave of nostalgia and loss she experiences in the greenhouse. Seeing the hibiscus and other familiar plants from her childhood in Laos causes her to break down, overwhelmed by the feeling that her past is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” Her purchase of the plant is an impulsive attempt to hold onto a piece of that lost world, but it also leads to her mother’s practical wisdom. Mrs. Panouvong acknowledges that this American hibiscus is “not as pretty” as the ones from home, but she values its strength to survive the cold, calling it the “winter hibiscus.” This reframes the plant not as a poor copy of the past, but as a symbol of hardier, resilient life in a new land. This new perspective allows Saeng to see her own situation differently. As she plants the hibiscus, she hears the familiar sounds and smells of her mother’s cooking—like the bitter melon, a “cultivated taste” she has come to prefer—and notices the Canada geese, whose honks are now “familiar.” She realizes that through the “quiet repetition of season upon season,” many things she once found strange have become almost familiar.

She notices that the honks of the Canada geese, once strange, have become ""familiar,"" and she admits that many things have become familiar ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season."" This shows she is beginning to put down roots. Her vow to retake the test in the spring directly links her personal growth to the natural cycle. She will try again when the snow melts, the geese return, and—most importantly—when the hardy hibiscus she has just planted begins to bud. The budding plant represents her own budding resilience and hope. The conclusion, therefore, does not promise immediate success, but it affirms Saeng's determination to persevere, blending the memory of her homeland with the reality of her new life and finding the strength to face its challenges anew."
454	-1	4	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s transformation from being overwhelmed by loss to finding resilience and hope for the future. This final vow represents a significant shift in her character, moving beyond the paralyzing grief she experienced in the greenhouse. Earlier in the story, Saeng is crushed by the weight of her memories. The sight of the hibiscus and other plants triggers a ""shock of recognition"" that pulls her back into her childhood in Laos, making her acutely aware of everything she has lost. The wave of loss is so powerful it brings her to tears, and she views her past as ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" Her failure of the driver's test compounds this feeling of inadequacy and dislocation in her new country. However, her interaction with her mother becomes a turning point. Her mother does not scold her for the expensive plant or the failed test, but instead focuses on the positive, calling the hibiscus ""beautiful."" More importantly, she re-frames the plant’s identity, noting that while it is not exactly like the one from home, it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters."" This lesson of resilience in a new environment is what Saeng internalizes. As she plants the hibiscus, Saeng has a moment of clarity. She realizes that through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season,"" things that were once strange, like the honking of Canada geese, have become familiar. This observation signifies her growing adaptation. The paragraph’s structure mirrors this progress: it connects the cyclical return of the geese in spring with the budding of the newly planted hibiscus and her own resolve to try the test again. The hibiscus is no longer just a symbol of the past she mourns, but becomes a symbol of her own potential to survive and eventually thrive. By vowing to try again in the spring, Saeng demonstrates that she has embraced her mother’s wisdom. She is learning to put down roots in the harsh ""winter"" of her new life, with the hope of budding anew herself when the conditions are right. The conclusion thus powerfully conveys the story's theme of finding the strength to move forward by honoring the past while adapting to the present."

This final vow represents her acceptance of her new life and the resilience required to bridge her past and her present. Throughout the story, Saeng is weighed down by a profound sense of dislocation. Failing her driver's test is not just a simple failure but a symbol of her struggle to adapt to American culture. Her subsequent emotional breakdown in the greenhouse is triggered by the plants, which serve as powerful sensory links to her childhood in Laos. The hibiscus, periwinkle, and jasmine evoke vivid memories of her grandmother and her former home, leading to a wave of grief for a world that is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone.""

Throughout the story, Saeng is overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss triggered by her failure on the test and the memories associated with the plants in the florist shop. The hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle violently transport her back to Vietnam, making her acutely aware that her old life is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone.""

This idea of resilience is reinforced as they plant the hibiscus together. Saeng notices the familiar, comforting sounds and smells of her mother cooking a bitter melon omelet—a ""cultivated taste"" she has come to prefer. This signifies that aspects of her new life, though initially strange, are becoming familiar and valued. The overhead Canada geese, whose honks were once alien, now sound ""familiar.""

The subsequent discovery of the hibiscus in the florist shop triggers a flood of visceral memories of her grandmother and her home in Vietnam, culminating in an outpouring of tears as she mourns all that is “irretrievably, irrevocably gone.” Her mother’s reaction to the expensive plant, however, begins a shift. Instead of focusing on the cost, her mother recognizes the plant’s symbolic value and its practical strength, calling it the “winter hibiscus” that is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This reframes the hibiscus not as a poor imitation of the past, but as something resilient and capable of surviving in a new, harsher environment.
