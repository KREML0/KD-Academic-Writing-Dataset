1	8863	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner because a garden cannot flourish when the ground is covered in snow. She resolves to attempt cultivating another garden once the snow has completely melted. I believe that her attitude should be one of greater interest and anticipation for this new endeavor, rather than the disappointment she seems to feel, as a more positive outlook would be more conducive to the task.
2	8864	4	2	The narrator includes this paragraph because its elements are cohesive and logically connected. The narrator indicates that the emergence of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus signify the return of spring once again.
3	8865	4	2	The author concludes the story with that passage to underscore the significance of the inspiration Saeng derives from the hibiscus. Throughout the narrative, Saeng found solace in the plant, as it served as a reminder of her homeland. The hibiscus in winter functions as a metaphor for Saeng's attitude toward her new country and her driving test; though diminished in the bitter cold, the plant adapts, survives, and will regain its beauty in spring. Similarly, Saeng, despite her initial bitterness, is adapting, and the plant's springtime resurgence will inspire her to attempt the test again. In conclusion, the author ended the story in that way to stress the importance of the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus plant.
4	8866	4	2	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate a theme of transformation. The melting snow signifies a change from cold to warmth. The geese returning symbolize a renewal of life, akin to a fresh start. This parallels the protagonist's intention to return to driver's education. The budding hibiscus represents personal growth, suggesting the author will return older, more knowledgeable, and more skilled than before.
5	8867	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph from ""Winter Hibiscus"" because it recalls key events from the narrative. Saeng had previously failed her driving test. The spring will bring the hibiscus into bud once more. Saeng realized that many elements she initially found strange were becoming almost familiar, including the calls of the snow geese. The melting snow signals the arrival of spring. As a result of the new season, Saeng may pass her test, earn her mother's pride, and continue acclimating to her new country and surroundings, moving beyond her reminiscences of life in Vietnam."
6	8868	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's resolve to retake the test in the spring. The seasonal imagery of melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus provides a clear temporal setting. This concluding section enhances the reader's comprehension of the narrative's resolution, which is the primary reason for its inclusion.
7	8869	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test only in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus buds. This decision stems from her frustration over spending money on a plant that differed from the one she remembered from home. By linking her next attempt to these natural signs, she is effectively declaring a moratorium on such tests of purchasing until a specific, future time.
8	8870	4	2	I believe the author uses this concluding paragraph to provide narrative closure. In it, Saeng essentially states that she will be ready to take the test when the geese return and her flower buds. Her preparedness is linked to having adapted and gained sufficient experience, much like the migrating geese and the budding hibiscus. She is drawing a direct parallel between her own process of acclimatization and the natural cycles of these elements.
9	8871	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph because the protagonist previously failed her test and now desires to pass it. This ending creates a sense of anticipation, leaving the reader to ponder the eventual outcome of her next attempt and whether she will ultimately succeed.
10	8872	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes on a hopeful note. The protagonist, Saeng, purchases a hibiscus that evokes memories of her homeland. After failing a test, she returns home, tells her mother, and plants the hibiscus. Observing geese, she feels a renewed connection to home and realizes that many aspects of America, once strange, have become familiar. This growing sense of belonging gives her the confidence to retake the test, optimistic about her chances of passing as America begins to feel more like home."
11	8873	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide a cohesive resolution to Saeng's emotional journey. After failing her test, Saeng purchases a plant for solace, which evokes memories of her homeland and initially deepens her sadness. Her mother's understanding response—preparing a favorite meal and assisting with planting the hibiscus—offers crucial support. This act symbolizes that while the new plant differs from those in her past, the associated memories and her mother's compassion instill in Saeng a renewed determination not to surrender. The conclusion thereby reinforces the central themes of resilience and familial support, clarifying that Saeng, now emotionally prepared, will attempt the test again when the opportunity arises.
12	8874	4	2	I think the author ended with that paragraph to show how things in the story, and in life, often come full circle. Just like the geese that leave and return, the character's chance to take the test will come again. That's the meaning I take from it—it's about cycles and getting another opportunity.
13	8875	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify a new beginning. It illustrates that as the seasons turn and life continues its cycle, Saeng will have another opportunity to take the test. This final passage therefore serves to complete the narrative arc by looking forward to this future possibility.
14	8876	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's developing determination. Distraught after failing her test, Saeng presents the hibiscus plant to her mother with tears, initially meeting with disappointment which quickly turns to understanding. Her mother's subsequent act of helping to plant the hibiscus provides a pivotal comfort. This is crystallized in the line, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" The strategic use of ""familiar"" indicates Saeng's growing acceptance that while her new environment is different, it can become normalized through time and repetition. This acceptance fosters a more positive outlook, equipping her with the resilience needed to persevere."
15	8877	4	2	The author uses the concluding paragraph to encapsulate the story's central themes. The text reflects on the significance of the seasons, drawing comparisons and contrasts that mirror the character's own experiences. It delves into the symbolism of growth, referencing various stages of plant development such as buds and new shoots. The hibiscus itself serves as a potent symbol of beauty and new beginnings within the narrative, tying these elemental concepts together to form a meaningful conclusion.
16	8878	4	2	He concludes that this serves as the story's resolution because it demonstrates her faith in the flower and its perceived ability to bring her fortune for the imminent examination. She senses that the familiar flower is as out of place as she is, and this shared quality allows them to relate to one another on a fundamental level.
17	8879	4	2	In my view, the author concludes with Saeng's perspective to highlight a moment of profound connection to her homeland. I believe she felt a surge of confidence about passing the test when she saw the flower blooming, as it powerfully reminded her of home. Her murmured statement, “Not like the kind we had before,” strongly suggests she was experiencing homesickness. Consequently, the flower's spring bloom could provide her with the emotional fortitude needed to succeed on her test, which is the reasoning behind my interpretation of the author's concluding paragraph.
18	8880	4	2	The author employs this conclusion to illustrate how Saeng regained her confidence through the act of planting the hibiscus and the cumulative experiences of that year. She is now prepared to face her challenges, and this state of readiness is the key insight the author intended for the reader to discern from the narrative's end.
19	8881	4	2	"The author concludes the story in this manner to underscore three pivotal elements: Saeng's failure on the test, the solace she finds in the hibiscus, and her identification with the migrating geese. For instance, Saeng's admission, ""I-I failed the test,"" reveals her distress and her subsequent desire to ""take that test again."" Furthermore, while describing the hibiscus, Saeng notes its ""rich sweet scent—that was familiar, too,"" indicating how the plant's familiarity comforts her and bolsters her courage for a second attempt. Finally, Saeng reflects on ""the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese,"" feeling a kinship with them that solidifies her decision to retake the test ""when the snow melts and the geese return."" Thus, the author powerfully weaves together Saeng's failure, her comfort from the hibiscus, and her connection to the geese to form a resonant conclusion."
20	8882	4	2	I believe the author chose to end the story with this paragraph to emphasize how Saeng will be perpetually reminded of her homeland and her desire to return. The basis for this is that the geese are depicted returning home, mirroring her own deep-seated longing. Simultaneously, the hibiscus budding in the wild will serve as a direct and poignant echo of the landscape she left behind.
21	8883	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's development of confidence and her silent vow to persevere. This serves to impart further lessons following her failure of a test earlier in the passage. Saeng informs her mother that she will retake the test in the spring once the snow has melted, a decision made after her mother was initially very upset upon learning of the failure.
22	8884	4	2	The story's conclusion is likely designed to build suspense and leave the reader on an optimistic note, with the suggestion that circumstances will improve for the characters. It implies that Saeng may eventually obtain her license and that their financial situation could also see betterment.
23	8885	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the protagonist, Saeng, encounters numerous obstacles while adapting to a new country vastly different from her homeland. The author chooses to conclude the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, a season marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. This ending assures the reader that Saeng has discovered a new sense of hope, symbolized by the flower, which also carries sentimental value connected to her home. The narrative suggests that overcoming obstacles sometimes requires embracing them, as Saeng did in the greenhouse, thereby creating room for a new beginning."
24	8886	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the message that a single failure should not lead to surrender. The sentiments expressed within the paragraph imply that Saeng will develop greater resilience by spring, positioning her to pass the test successfully.
25	8887	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight how all living things follow routines essential for survival. The geese migrate south to avoid the winter cold, and the hibiscus flower, having died back, is revived in the spring. This cyclical pattern directly pertains to Saeng, who vows that upon the return of the geese and the flower, she will again take the test of trying to fit into her new country, which is the reason the author selected this ending.
26	8888	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with the specified paragraph to cultivate a deliberate sense of ambiguity, compelling the reader to contemplate the unresolved narrative. This technique generates dramatic effect by leaving central questions unanswered, such as the protagonist's future success on the test, the nature of her relationships with her grandmother and Mrs. Lambert, and the ultimate meaning of ""home."" The reader is thus invited to speculate on subsequent events, guided only by the protagonist's resolution to retake the test upon the arrival of spring, a device which also serves to pique interest in the author's future literary endeavors. The strategic use of an open ending is therefore a calculated narrative choice to engage the audience's imagination beyond the final sentence."
27	8889	4	2	I believe the story ends as it does to show the protagonist is gradually acclimating to the cycle of seasons in her new environment. Her statement, “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” indicates she will wait for winter's end, a time associated with the geese's return. This suggests she links her personal readiness to these natural signs, implying that by the time spring arrives, she will be prepared not just to retake the test, but to pass it. The seasonal elements hold a deeper significance for her, which is why the author chose this concluding sentiment.
28	8890	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph functions to illustrate the central theme of adaptation to change. Saeng's decision to retake the driver's test symbolizes her commitment to adapting to her new life, a process mirrored by the hibiscus, which, having originated in her homeland, must now survive in a different climate. The budding of the hibiscus acts as a botanical metaphor for Saeng's own nascent adaptation; its new growth coincides with her resolve to succeed. The narrative thereby connects the character's emotional low point following her failure with the comfort derived from a symbol of her past, ultimately framing the conclusion as a testament to the universal struggle of becoming accustomed to new circumstances.
29	8891	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to establish a tone of renewal and perseverance. The imagery of melting snow, returning geese, and a budding hibiscus collectively symbolizes a fresh start, which Saeng aligns with her decision to retake the test. This parallel extends to a demonstration of perseverance; just as the hibiscus endures the winter to bloom again, Saeng demonstrates resilience by choosing to try again despite her initial failure. The final paragraph thus serves to underscore Saeng's determination, clearly conveying that she will not surrender to adversity.
30	8892	4	2	The author ends the story with that particular paragraph because it reveals the specific conditions under which Saeng feels sufficiently comfortable to attempt the test again. Her profound longing for her homeland is assuaged by the familiar signs of spring—the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. By pledging to act only when these events occur, she creates a personal ritual rooted in comfort and familiarity. This stipulation naturally leads the reader to question the deep-seated connection between these natural phenomena and her sense of readiness, highlighting how their occurrence provides her with the emotional solace necessary to proceed.
31	8893	4	2	The concluding paragraph outlines her subsequent objective. She undertook a test but was unsuccessful. She purchased the plant for a sum exceeding nineteen dollars. It evoked memories of her former residence. She will possess confidence in the spring, for just as the plant adapted to its new environment, she too will adapt to her new home.
32	8894	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph because it shows Saeng's resolve. She will retake the test in the spring and endeavor to do her best. ""I-I failed the test,"" Saeng admitted. However, failing a test does not signify the end of everything. She will approach the next attempt with greater confidence."
33	8895	4	2	"The author concludes ""The Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's character development and renewed determination. This conclusion demonstrates her increased willingness to strive and perform to the best of her ability. Her declaration to retake the test signifies a gain in confidence and her gradual acclimatization to a foreign land. She is now actively working toward success, making the best of her circumstances. The author thereby adds depth to the narrative, completing a thematic circle from Saeng's initial nervous failure to setting a future goal aligned with the flower's bloom."
34	8896	4	2	The author concludes with that paragraph to demonstrate that, despite her sorrow and discomfort, Saeng retains a capacity for hope. In the narrative, Saeng encounters a hibiscus that induces intense homesickness for her native Vietnam. The reader also learns of her test failure and her feelings of displacement. The hibiscus, however, functions as a symbol of hope and comfort. The author selects this conclusion to show that, despite her hardships, the hibiscus helps Saeng realize she can overcome obstacles and look toward the future with optimism.
35	8897	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight a moment of shared understanding between Saeng and her mother. They recall their former home, where the flowers were more beautiful than those in their current environment. Saeng wishes to plant flowers that will remind her of home. Her mother observes that the winter hibiscus may not be as pretty, but it is strong enough to survive the cold months, implying that resilience is more important than beauty and that they, too, can endure.
36	8898	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng's failure on the test does not signify her surrender. She declares that she will retake the examination when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This signifies that while she has failed presently, she intends to use the intervening time to study and prepare. The imagery of the departing snow, the warming weather, the returning birds, and the flourishing flower all symbolize the passage of time until she is ready. The author's choice of words not only confirms her intention to retake the test but also implies her ultimate success.
37	8899	4	2	The author ends the story in this manner to illustrate that the character, now happy and encouraged by the budding hibiscus, is resolved to try again. She is stating that after the geese return and the snow melts, she will undertake the endeavor once more, suggesting a cyclical renewal of hope and effort.
38	8900	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story to emphasize the importance of perseverance. The protagonist fails her initial driving test, yet the narrative inspires a resolve to never surrender, a sentiment that resonates personally. One must persevere through all of life's challenges; to give up is to forfeit all accomplishment. The character vows to retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus buds, a pledge that mirrors the hope for personal success on a driver's test. This lesson extends beyond large trials to even small daily tasks, like maintaining employment, reinforcing the universal principle that one must never give up."
39	8901	4	2	The author included that sentence to highlight Saeng's deep affection for nature and gardening. It reveals that she prefers working with plants to doing schoolwork, indicating a genuine passion for cultivating new life in the garden.
40	8902	4	2	"The author concludes with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng's growing acclimatization to her new environment. Initially, she felt as out of place as the ""winter hibiscus,"" but she later reflects that many once-strange things have become almost familiar through seasonal repetition, signifying her adaptation. The final paragraph shows that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds in the spring, she will retake the test. Therefore, the conclusion parallels her personal growth and adaptation with the resilience and seasonal renewal of the hibiscus itself."
41	8903	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with a profound sense of optimism. Although the narrator purchases the hibiscus plant in a moment of dejection following her driving test failure and homesickness, it ultimately serves as a powerful symbol of hope. The blossoming of the flower is equated with the rekindling of her own aspirations and her resolve to attempt the test again, potentially with a successful outcome. While she may currently experience sadness and fear, there is an underlying conviction that circumstances will improve. Her gradual acclimatization to the new environment is evident in her observation that previously strange elements have become familiar. By spring, she anticipates being sufficiently settled and content to retake the driving test. Thus, the hibiscus embodies both her nostalgia for the past and her hopeful outlook toward the future.
42	8904	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng finds comfort and a sense of readiness through symbols of her homeland. Her intention to retake the driving test is linked to the return of the ducks and the budding of the hibiscus, which are familiar elements from her past. The narrative recalls that ""a saebya hedge, tall and high, had surrounded their garden,"" indicating the hibiscus was a feature of her life in Vietnam, and the well story reinforces this connection. Similarly, the observation that ""overhead, a flock of wild geese, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now,"" demonstrates that the geese also symbolize home. These familiar signs provide her with the assurance needed to face new challenges in her adopted country."
43	8905	4	2	"I believe the author chose this concluding quote for several key reasons. Primarily, it demonstrates the character's resilience; her failure is not a final defeat but a temporary setback, conveying a moral about perseverance. The character seems to use the hibiscus as a profound metaphor. When she states, ""The hibiscus will be budding,"" it signifies her own potential for growth and branching out. By spring, she will have gained the necessary experience and knowledge to attempt the test once more. Furthermore, the plant serves as a comforting reminder of her home, whose memory will grant her the courage to confront challenges like the driving test. Ultimately, the ending effectively wraps up the story by highlighting the character's unwavering will to keep trying."
44	8906	4	2	"The author employs this concluding paragraph to synthesize the story's central themes. It references three key subjects: the driving test, the geese, and the hibiscus plant. The statement ""when the snow melts and the geese return"" connects directly to an earlier scene where the narrator ""lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky."" Saeng undergoes a significant personal transformation, analogous to the migratory cycle of the geese. Her realization that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become...familiar to her now"" signifies this adaptation. The paragraph suggests that while change is a universal experience, Saeng's journey of adjustment was particularly profound."
45	8907	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide a resonant summary of the narrative's core elements. It revisits the central themes and motifs presented earlier in the text, but with enhanced detail and a deeper exploration of the protagonist's internal conflicts and developments. This final section serves to crystallize the story's message, offering a cohesive and reflective ending that ties together the character's journey and the symbolic weight of the events described.
46	8908	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's reverence for her homeland and her profound sense of nostalgia. This is first evidenced by Saeng's silent vow, which demonstrates her respect and longing. It signifies her desire to attempt once more what she had previously failed. The final example is her resolve to surmount this past failure, culminating in the line, ""then I will take that test again,"" expressing her wish for another opportunity in life. These elements exemplify the author's rationale for the concluding paragraph."
47	8909	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a sense of a clean slate, as if the characters have started anew and are no longer burdened by the past. Saeng exhibits a sense of relief after bringing her mother the plate, and her assured tone at the paragraph's end suggests she feels significantly better. Her certainty is evident when she declares, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This final statement conveys the impression of a person reborn, one who has moved beyond her past."
48	8910	4	2	The author ends the story with this paragraph because Saeng notices the plant upon returning home after failing her driving test. She resolves to retake the test when conditions are favorable, linking this decision to the plant's natural cycle. Although the driving test itself is not the ultimate priority, her determination to try again is synchronized with the plant budding and reaching its optimal state, marking a moment of personal readiness.
49	8911	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's personal growth from her experiences and her renewed determination. This final section provides a sudden, hopeful conclusion to a predominantly somber narrative, leaving the reader with the assurance that the protagonist is now confident enough to try again. The story is permeated with the sadness of Saeng's family relocating to a new country and starting over. Their gardening serves as an escape, a reminder of their life and garden in Vietnam. Although saddened by failing her driving test, Saeng discovers a plant that brings her happiness and revitalizes her hope. The final paragraph confirms her restored self-confidence, which is fueled by the happy memories she contemplates.
50	8912	4	2	The author utilizes the final paragraph because the hibiscus functions as a symbol for Saeng. It represents that she will be prepared when spring arrives. As the plant readies itself to bud, she will have the faith necessary to attempt the test again. She will likely focus on nurturing the plant beforehand, and once it blooms, her attentive care will no longer be required, signaling her own readiness to move forward.
51	8913	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph to convey Saeng's resolve to retake the test she had failed when conditions improve. For instance, on page @NUM1, Saeng states, ""I-I failed the test,"" which underscores the significance of this event. The conclusion is therefore structured around the idea that passing the test is a crucial objective for Saeng, one she intends to pursue again during the favorable season of spring, symbolizing renewal and a fresh start."
52	8914	4	2	"The narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" follows Saeng, a girl who has relocated from Vietnam to the @ORGANIZATION1. After failing her driver's test, she walks home and discovers a hibiscus plant. She is deeply affected by its scent, which vividly recalls the memory of her grandmother. Saeng visits a flower shop and, despite the high cost due to its rarity, purchases the plant because of its personal significance, as hibiscus plants were part of her life in Vietnam. She brings it home, telling her mother it reminds her of their homeland, a sentiment her mother shares, though she is displeased with the expense. As Saeng plants the hibiscus in the garden, a flock of geese flies overhead. The story concludes with the anticipation that when the hibiscus blooms again in the spring, Saeng will have a new opportunity to pass her driver's test, paralleling the season's theme of renewal and second chances."
53	8915	4	2	The author includes this element to draw a parallel between Saeng and a flower, suggesting that personal growth and renewal can lead to future success. The central idea is that there is always a second chance following a failure or mistake. This is exemplified by the text's reference to the cyclical nature of the seasons, indicating that just as nature renews itself, so too can an individual have another opportunity to prove themselves and overcome past errors.
54	8916	4	2	"The author concludes the story in this manner to communicate the depth of Saeng's emotional connection to the hibiscus. She perceives the plant as wonderful, describing its texture as ""smooth and cool."" Her initial experience with the hibiscus in Vietnam was of a plant that grew wildly, so she was surprised to find it cultivated in a pot within the United States. She further describes its ""sweet scent,"" which underscores her profound appreciation. @CAPS1, this profound feeling for the plant is the foundational reason for the story's concluding emphasis."
55	8917	4	2	The author concludes with this statement to highlight Saeng's profound passion for gardening. Her willingness to retake the test is intrinsically linked to her anticipation of the hibiscus budding with the arrival of spring. This eagerness to nurture the plant's growth during the new season demonstrates Saeng's deep investment in gardening and her anxious hope for the hibiscus to flourish.
56	8918	4	2	The author concludes the story with this statement to signify that Saeng will retake her test once normalcy and beauty are restored in the spring. This device illustrates that Saeng is a person of the spring season, who finds joy in gardening during that time. It further implies her belief that her academic performance improves in the spring, connecting her personal renewal with the season's arrival.
57	8919	4	2	"Overcoming change and disappointment is a significant challenge, and many people harbor a deep-seated fear of change. For Saeng, the protagonist of ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" this change materializes through her relocation to a new country. Her surroundings are entirely foreign, and the disappointment of failing her driver's exam compounds her sense of helplessness. However, after purchasing a winter hibiscus, she resolves to retake the test when the plant blooms in spring. The flower's resilience and the memories it evokes ultimately inspire Saeng to persevere and try again."
58	8920	4	2	I believe the author's intention was to convey Saeng's internal vow and to articulate her emotional state. The statement was crafted to generate reader interest, but its primary function is to provide a deeper understanding of the character's motivations and feelings, thereby enriching the narrative's overall meaning.
59	8921	4	2	The final paragraph serves several literary functions: foreshadowing, future reference, and the illustration of continuous behavior. It acts as foreshadowing by indicating a future action Saeng intends to take. She is referencing her own plans, thereby demonstrating a consistent pattern of behavior by committing to retake the test the following spring. Her vow, made when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, effectively utilizes these three elements to solidify her character's determination and forward-looking resolve.
60	8922	4	2	"I believe the author concludes the story in this manner to emphasize the continuous cycle of life. Saeng fails a significant test, which symbolizes her struggle to overcome the memories of her lost homeland. The hibiscus plant she purchases at a high cost represents that former life, a source of both pain and longing. Her silent vow to return to the evocative greenhouse when the geese fly back signifies her commitment to confront her past, aiming to speak of ""home"" without emotional collapse or further costly retreats into memory."
61	8923	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator does not explicitly identify the specific test that Saeng has failed. Nevertheless, the thematic content and deliberate diction indicate that this examination holds significance not only for Saeng and her mother but also for her successful integration into her new life in @LOCATION1. Saeng's profound longing for her homeland is a dominant force, and the painful flood of memories triggered by her purchase of a hibiscus plant is a recurring part of her daily existence. She strives to preserve her memories of Vietnam while simultaneously acknowledging the necessity of adapting to @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. Certain elements, however, such as passing the test, remain non-negotiable. Saeng ultimately realizes that she can harness these memories to sustain her spirit and use them as motivation. This synthesis of memory and change is what renders the story's final sentence so empowering, as she resolves, ""when this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again,"" demonstrating her newfound resilience."
62	8924	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the final paragraph to illustrate the girl's adaptation to her new country. Saeng deeply missed her home, to the point where she could not speak of it without becoming emotional, as seen when she struggles to say, ""It's not like the wind we had at—at—."" Her purchase of a plant for @MONEY1, because it reminded her of home, further underscores her connection to the past. One can infer her successful adaptation from her growing familiarity with the seasonal changes; her statement that she will retake the test when the geese return signals her acceptance of a new rhythm of life and her readiness to try again."
63	8925	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph because it signifies Saeng finding a sense of belonging in her new environment. The text states, ""the snow melt, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This is significant because the elements mentioned—the plant and the geese—are familiar to her from her homeland. Their presence in her new surroundings provides comfort and a link to her past. Therefore, as winter ends, these familiar signs will bolster her spirits, giving her the confidence to face the test once more, which completes her emotional arc."
64	8926	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to emphasize her profound commitment. Having failed the test initially, she is now determined to pass. She consciously links her renewed attempt to the arrival of spring, waiting for the snow to melt, the @CAPS1 geese to return, and the hibiscus to bud. This deliberate timing, marked by the natural cycle of @CAPS2, underscores her resolve and hope for a new beginning, demonstrating that her pledge is both a personal goal and a symbolic act of renewal.
65	8927	4	2	The author likely concluded the story in this manner because the entire plot is set during the winter season. The protagonist may have wished to attempt her challenge again in a different season to see if she could perform better under altered circumstances. This seasonal shift represents a new beginning and the potential for improved outcomes, which is the reasoning behind the author's chosen conclusion for the narrative.
66	8928	4	2	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's resolve. Her statement that she will retake the test ""in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return"" explicitly signifies her intention to try again the following year. Her growing confidence is further illustrated by her observation that ""the hibiscus is budding,"" a detail that mirrors her own burgeoning determination. Saeng's words convey a firm commitment to ultimately passing the test, which is the central reason this paragraph serves as the story's fitting conclusion."
67	8929	4	2	The author utilizes the final paragraph to convey the protagonist's resilient spirit. By resolving to retake the test in the spring, a time symbolizing renewal with the melting snow and returning geese, the character signals a fresh start after an initial failure. This decision exemplifies a persistent nature, demonstrating a willingness to continue attempting until the goal of obtaining a driver's license is finally achieved, thus concluding the narrative on a note of hopeful perseverance.
68	8930	4	2	"The inclusion of this paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's profound passion for horticulture. The narrative focuses on this moment to articulate the character's deep-seated feelings toward plants.

70	8932	4	2	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to powerfully illustrate that the protagonist remains steadfast in her aspirations and has not relinquished her pursuit of them, thereby providing a final, resonant emphasis on her enduring determination.
71	8933	4	2	"The speaker's concluding statement, ""I will take that test again,"" is imbued with the symbolic significance of hope, new beginnings, and adjustment. The hibiscus flower serves as a source of hope for the girl, evoking memories of her grandmother and her idyllic former home; its budding demonstrates that such beauty can flourish in her new environment as well. By spring, she anticipates having adjusted to her surroundings, established new friendships, and created fresh memories, thereby mitigating the pain of looking back. The flower thus provides both hope and comfort throughout her period of adjustment, culminating in her resolve to try again."
72	8934	4	2	The author explains that she is waiting for a suitable day to resume her activities. She desires weather that is neither too cold nor too unpleasant, allowing her to go outside and play with her children. Consequently, she has decided that she will retake her test on such a pleasant day, aligning her personal endeavors with favorable conditions.
73	8935	4	2	"The author's conclusion illustrates the protagonist's profound desire to integrate her life in the United States with her cultural heritage from Vietnam. The narrative details her homesickness and ongoing adaptation to a new country. Her declaration of having failed a test and wishing to retake it signifies her determination to succeed in America without disappointing her mother. The purchase of the plant, which initially caused maternal disbelief given their financial struggles, symbolizes this effort. The concluding vow, ""I will take the test again,"" represents her resolve to build a better life through hard work while simultaneously preserving Vietnamese traditions, as exemplified by her attempt to make her new home feel familiar through a plant her mother would appreciate."
74	8936	4	2	The author likely concluded the story to illustrate a narrative of downfall and subsequent resurgence. The protagonist is currently at his lowest point and must now embark on the arduous journey toward success. His decision to start over and retake the test signifies a firm commitment to learning from past failures, with a determined resolve to achieve a different outcome this time.
75	8937	4	2	"The author concludes the paragraph in this manner to evoke a specific emotional tone. This final section conveys the emotion of being unable to garden during the winter, a season that causes all plants to die. The author indicates that Saeng will return after the snow, frost, and cold weather have subsided. The statement, ""I will take the test again,"" signifies that Saeng will resume her efforts in gardening and with her mother the following season, when growth begins anew, thus completing the cyclical narrative of dormancy and renewal."
76	8938	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's immediate future, which entails remaining with her mother for the coming year, assisting her in the garden, and doing so without the companionship of friends. This final passage solidifies the girl's solitary and supportive role alongside her mother.
77	8939	4	2	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate how Saeng has drawn a parallel from the hibiscus plant. Just as the plant is poised to overcome the harsh, brutal winter months, Saeng is determined to overcome the adversity she faced upon failing her driving test and confronting profound homesickness. The plant's resilience, leading it to bloom in the spring, symbolizes Saeng's own anticipated renewal; she too will metaphorically bloom, ensuring that the winter of her despair does not prevent her from living happily and retaking the test. The story thus ends by showing how the ""Winter Hibiscus"" has imparted a lesson on overcoming obstacles."
78	8940	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it signifies Saeng's acceptance of her new home and her recognition of the similarities it holds with her old one. By holding memories close, she finds a means to overcome her current life obstacles. The mention of the winter hibiscus, which blooms differently yet is strong enough to survive the cold, establishes a tangible link between her old home and her new one. This illustrates that while circumstances change, essential qualities of strength and beauty persist. The passage leads to the story's conclusion as it is the moment Saeng realizes she can use her memories of the past to navigate the troubles of the present, thereby finding a path forward.
79	8941	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to underscore the parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus plant, demonstrating how both will overcome their respective obstacles. Saeng's primary challenge is adjusting to her new life, with passing her driver's test being a crucial step, as indicated by her admission of failure to her mother. Similarly, the hibiscus must endure the winter and adapt to new surroundings to survive. The mother's observation about the plant's strength to persevere highlights what truly matters. The narrative concludes with Saeng's resolution to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus budding. This synchronized timing deepens the symbolism, revealing a shared, determined spirit to adapt and succeed simultaneously.
80	8942	4	2	The narrative returns to this point because it mirrors the story's beginning, which commenced with Saeng undertaking and failing a test. The conclusion suggests that with the improvement of weather and circumstances, she will have a better opportunity to pass. This structural return provides a sense of cyclical hope and resolution, which is why the author chose to conclude with the test.

86	8948	4	2	"The short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" chronicles a young girl's relocation with her mother to a new country and her subsequent cultural transition. Throughout the narrative, the author references a test the protagonist must pass. The story concludes with her resolution to ""take that test again"" in the spring. When the girl describes the winter hibiscus plant as ""not a real one,"" it implies her memories of home are poignant but no longer tangible. Furthermore, her stated preference for her native cuisine over a ""Big Mac"" indicates a struggle to adapt to her new American environment. Ultimately, the girl's test appears to be learning to manage change while recalling her homeland with a sense of happiness rather than sorrow."
87	8949	4	2	The author selected this conclusion to convey a message of perseverance and open-mindedness. The intent is to show that if one makes an effort, they might discover something they enjoy. This is embodied by the girl's declaration that she will return in the spring when the snow melts to attempt the test once more, symbolizing a renewed willingness to engage with her new circumstances.
88	8950	4	2	"The author concludes with this particular paragraph because it effectively synthesizes the story's core elements. It connects the initial events, such as Saeng's motivation for purchasing the flower, with the narrative's resolution. The paragraph also serves to bridge Saeng's past memories of Vietnam with her present life in the United States. This is illustrated when the text describes how ""carefully Saeng picked it up and smiled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs,"" demonstrating how the flower triggers potent memories. This unification of past and present is the reason for the author's choice of concluding paragraph."
89	8951	4	2	The author concludes with that paragraph to illustrate that Saeng is resolved to attempt the test again in the spring. Acquiring the hibiscus plant stirred memories of her homeland, which in turn restored her self-belief and determination to try once more, filling her with hope. The author uses the imagery of the melting snow, returning geese, and the budding hibiscus to signify the coming of spring, the time she has chosen to retake her test, thereby using the season as a symbol of renewal and second chances.
90	8952	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave the reader with a positive impression after a series of challenging events, such as Saeng's failure on the test. The intention was to demonstrate that despite a setback, her resolve to try again remains strong. This final passage highlights her persistent character and unwillingness to surrender, showing that she actively pursues her goals. The author deliberately chose to end on this note of resilience and forward-looking optimism.
91	8953	4	2	The author's conclusion serves to signify the protagonist's unwavering resolve to pass her examination and adapt to her new environment, transforming it into a home reminiscent of her past life in Vietnam. The girl reflects nostalgically upon her former existence, yearning to return to the life she once knew in her homeland. When she is confronted with the challenges of her present circumstances, her determination to persevere and establish a sense of belonging becomes the central theme of the resolution.
92	8954	4	2	"The author, Minfong Ho, selected this concluding paragraph for its resolutive function, providing closure to the preceding narrative. The protagonist, Saeng, experiences distress following her failure of a driver's test and melancholy triggered by memories of a hibiscus plant from her native Vietnam. The final statement, which references the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, employs these elements as symbols of change and adaptation. Saeng's declaration to retake the test aligns with these natural cycles, indicating her necessary transformation and adjustment to a new life. This deliberate use of strong, symbolic imagery is why Ho's conclusion to ""Winter Hibiscus"" is so effective and definitive."
93	8955	4	2	"Following her failure of the driver's test, Saeng initially abandons hope for her future. However, encountering the hibiscus plant reignites her determination to persevere despite adversity. Her mother observes, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters."" This statement underscores that resilience and survival, not mere beauty, are of paramount importance. Saeng identifies with the plant, recognizing her own capacity for strength and survival within a new and challenging environment. Although she is a newcomer, Saeng demonstrates that even the most daunting obstacles can be surmounted through self-belief and the support of family."
94	8956	4	2	The author likely employed this final paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's intention to retake the test the following year, using the cyclical patterns of nature as a temporal framework. The narrative implies that her initial failure coincided with the geese's migration for winter and the hibiscus's blooming period, thereby framing her renewed attempt within the context of the seasons' return.
95	8957	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to emphasize the profound significance of the plant to Saeng. She resolves to wait for the hibiscus to bloom, as its development is intrinsically linked to her own readiness to retake the driving test. The flower serves as a metaphor for her personal journey; when the hibiscus is prepared to blossom, she too will be prepared to drive. The plant provides her with hope for a new beginning and another opportunity. This final passage allows the reader to comprehend the plant's deep symbolic meaning for the girl, as it offers her a sense of belonging and comfort, effectively countering the misery of her initial failure.
96	8958	4	2	"She concludes the story with this paragraph to express her hope for @DATE1's return. Her statement, ""when the snow melts,"" signifies her intent to revisit past events and address them with care, bringing a sense of closure to her narrative."
97	8959	4	2	In the narrative, Saeng resolves to retake the test in the spring, confident she will pass once she has fully accepted her new environment. Her initial distress over the move and longing for her former home hindered her focus. However, her appreciation for the beauty of the new flowers and the familiarity of the geese symbolize her adjustment. Furthermore, her desire to avoid disappointing her mother again, coupled with her mother's kind disappointment, fuels her determination. By spring, Saeng will be prepared, having successfully adapted to her new life.
98	8960	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's journey of adaptation. Having moved from Vietnam, Saeng fails her driving test. While walking home, she discovers a familiar plant, seeks it out at a florist, and ultimately plants its seeds. She plans to retake the test once the seeds bloom, using the plant as a token of luck. This concluding action underscores her growing connection to her new home and her resolve to succeed.
99	8961	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's capacity to overcome obstacles, suggesting that future reminders of her past will lead to success. The line where Saeng realizes that previously strange elements have become ""almost familiar"" indicates her growing acclimatization to a new life. The final paragraph effectively encapsulates this theme of gradual acceptance and personal growth."
100	8962	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding paragraph serves multiple purposes. It highlights the protagonist's struggle to overcome change and improve her situation, exemplified by her decision to retake the test. The paragraph also reflects her heartbreak that life has not proceeded as planned, compelling her to take corrective action. Ultimately, the conclusion serves to test and reveal her determination and resilience."
101	8963	4	2	The author likely concludes the story in this manner to illustrate the protagonist's potential for adapting to a new country. This is an effective narrative technique as it creates a cliffhanger, leaving the reader uncertain of the outcome. Furthermore, such an open ending provides a clear opportunity for a sequel or a series, which is a strategically sound literary decision.
102	8964	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph employs the imagery of snow and geese to emphasize the beauty of the natural world. The intention is to direct the reader's focus toward the outdoors, presenting it as the most significant and pleasing element within the narrative's context.
103	8965	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho concludes with a specific paragraph to symbolize Saeng's new beginning. The description of spring—the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus—parallels Saeng's life, indicating her fresh start. While she undoubtedly misses her old life, her grandmother, and specific mementos, she demonstrates resolve by deciding to retake the test. This action signifies her refusal to succumb entirely to her grief and sense of loss, marking a pivotal step forward."
104	8966	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to suggest that the story's central conflicts are cyclical and unresolved. The mention of the geese's annual return serves as a metaphor, clearly indicating that these issues are likely to resurface in the future, implying that the narrative's challenges are persistent and ongoing.
105	8967	4	2	The author uses the concluding sentence to signify that Saeng will take the test again once she feels prepared. A comparison is drawn between Saeng and the natural elements—the snow, the geese, and the hibiscus. By stating she will retake the test when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she is effectively communicating that she is not yet ready. The test will be undertaken only when she has reached a state of personal readiness, aligning with the renewal suggested by the changing seasons.
106	8968	4	2	The story's conclusion illustrates Saeng's interpretation of the day's events. The author employs a springtime setting to symbolize the rebirth of Saeng's self-confidence. Observing the hibiscus bud in spring provides her with a renewed sense of integrity and the resolve to attempt the driving test once more.
107	8969	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to convey Saeng's hopeful, positive, and helpful nature. Hope is evident in her decision to retake the test, motivated by a desire to assist her mother. Her positivity is shown through purchasing a new flower and planning to try again in the spring. Furthermore, her helpfulness is demonstrated by finishing the gardening chore for her mother. Like any newcomer, Saeng experienced fear, yet she ultimately persevered through hope, a positive attitude, and a helpful disposition.
108	8970	4	2	For Saeng, the hibiscus represented a personal trial. She perceived her purchase of the flower, which reminded her of her homeland, as a failure to release the past and accept her present circumstances. Having spent a significant sum on it despite her family's financial needs, she essentially felt she had failed a crucial test of her adaptability.
109	8971	4	2	"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph to highlight Saeng's inner strength. It seems the ending is meant to show that she connects her own resilience to the plant's vitality; she feels that when the hibiscus is strong and free from snow, she too will be strong enough to retake her driving test. This is clear when she declares she will take the test again ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" which is precisely why the author chooses to end on this note of determined anticipation."
110	8972	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist Saeng and her mother have relocated from their homeland to an unfamiliar place where Saeng struggles to adapt. After failing an important test, she becomes discouraged and seeks comfort in memories of home. Her purchase of a winter hibiscus serves this purpose, yet while planting it, she finds a renewed determination to adapt. The author concludes the story by emphasizing the hope and resolve Saeng discovers, symbolized by her plan to retake the test when the hibiscus buds, signaling her commitment to her new life."
111	8973	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the uplifting message that Saeng will surmount the challenges of residing in a foreign country. The geese represent a facet of her new home, as she reluctantly acknowledges their familiarity, thereby illustrating her capacity for adaptation. Furthermore, she associates spring with the budding hibiscus, a symbol of her own existence, as both strive to thrive in a land not originally their own. Consequently, the hibiscus budding signifies her potential to live contentedly in her new environment. Finally, her resolution to retake the driver's test is pivotal; her initial failure symbolized her inability to integrate, whereas passing it would signify successful adaptation. In essence, the author utilizes this concluding paragraph to encapsulate the story's central theme through an optimistic message.
112	8974	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the ending connects the budding hibiscus, the geese, and the decision to retake the test. The geese signify Saeng's adaptation to her new country, as she now recognizes their migratory patterns. The hibiscus budding is more than a floral event; it symbolizes the rejuvenation of her own spirit, akin to the renewal of spring. This internal rebirth fuels her newfound confidence to attempt the driving test again. Thus, the geese, the hibiscus, and the test are all woven together in the conclusion to illustrate the connection between her past life and her successful adaptation to a new one."
113	8975	4	2	She intends to resume her gardening when the geese return and the flowers bloom again. Her aspiration is to cultivate the finest garden in the vicinity. Ultimately, she is determined to carry on the tradition.
114	8976	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng discovered the winter hibiscus had survived in the ground, while her other plants were lost to the snow. Her declaration that she will take the test again symbolizes her commitment to begin anew, mirroring the process of replanting her garden and starting over from the very beginning.
115	8977	4	2	"The author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the geese's return and the hibiscus budding, demonstrating her refusal to surrender. Earlier, Saeng's inability to utter the words ""at home"" reveals her lingering distress and homesickness for Vietnam. By planting the hibiscus in the ground, she seeks a sense of vitality and a deeper connection to her new life in the United States. Therefore, Saeng's resolution is not to abandon her efforts to drive but to persevere with greater determination to pass the test."
116	8978	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it reflects Saeng's thoughts. When her mother's welcoming smile warmed her, Saeng cheerfully noted the passage of time and inquired about the delay, asking how things went. This section is fundamentally connected to her internal feelings and perspective.
117	8979	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, a season symbolizing a fresh start marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. This final paragraph is significant as it draws a parallel between Saeng and the winter hibiscus, a plant her mother describes as strong enough to survive the cold, even if its flowers are not the prettiest. Like the hibiscus, Saeng possesses the resilience to endure her current hardships, and her failure on the driving test becomes a temporary setback. The blooming of the flower in spring represents her future success, tying together her feelings about her old and new home while highlighting her ability to overcome obstacles."
118	8980	4	2	I believe the author chose to end with that paragraph because the hibiscus symbolizes the ability to overcome challenges. Saeng's determination to retake the test stems from a desire to prove to her mother that she can pass. The hibiscus, in my opinion, serves as a source of inner strength, boosting her confidence and reinforcing her resolve to succeed on her next attempt.
119	8981	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph serves multiple purposes. Primarily, it establishes a tone of hope by illustrating how natural cycles of renewal, such as the melting snow and returning geese, promise second chances. This leaves the reader with an uplifting and optimistic final impression. Furthermore, the ending underscores the vital importance of persistence, using the recurring blooming of the hibiscus as an analogy for the tenacity required to overcome life's continual challenges. Thus, the conclusion effectively communicates themes of hope, redemption, and resilience.
120	8982	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng feels most capable and assured during the spring. The sight of growing flowers evokes a sense of being at home, which in turn bolsters her self-confidence and strengthens her belief that she will pass the test.
121	8983	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's silent vow to retake her test in the spring, a decision that underscores her resolute determination to change her circumstances following her initial failure. This concluding thought is imbued with deeper emotional significance through the hibiscus, which serves as a tangible connection to her grandmother. The anticipated budding of the flower symbolizes a spiritual return of her grandmother, whose memory will provide Saeng with the strength and encouragement needed to attempt the test once more."
122	8984	4	2	The author employs the final paragraph to illustrate that Saeng, akin to the budding hibiscus, is poised for renewal. This parallel suggests she will overcome her present challenges and embark on a new beginning with the arrival of spring.
123	8985	4	2	I believe the author chose this conclusion to create an open ending, inviting readers to imagine the story's future for themselves. This technique grants the audience control over the narrative's ultimate resolution, a common literary device used to foster engagement and speculation about what might happen next, potentially even setting the stage for a sequel.
124	8986	4	2	In my view, the author uses the concluding paragraph to emphasize future events and engage the reader's thoughts. This technique builds excitement and leaves one contemplating Saeng's journey, questioning whether she will successfully adapt to an unfamiliar lifestyle and survive the challenges of different seasons. It ultimately conveys that life is a continuous series of obstacles to be faced and overcome.
125	8987	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph for its profound emotional resonance. Saeng's declaration that she will retake the test alongside the hibiscus's spring bloom is deeply symbolic. The flower serves as a potent reminder of her homeland, offering her comfort and a sense of connection. She hopes that witnessing its bloom will fortify her spirit, drawing strength from these memories to achieve success in her forthcoming test.
126	8988	4	2	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to signify the geese's arrival and departure as symbols of change for Saeng. The hibiscus, differing from her recollections of her homeland, represents a connection to her past. Its budding state reflects Saeng's rediscovered happiness and sense of belonging. This final passage demonstrates how the familiar plant instills in Saeng the courage and fortitude to overcome her challenges. The geese function as a temporal marker, their return coinciding with the plant's flowering. Without this concluding paragraph, the profound impact of memory on Saeng's resilience would remain inadequately conveyed. The implication is that Saeng's initial inability to surmount her obstacle stemmed from the unfamiliarity of her new environment; however, the comfort derived from the budding plant will empower her to approach her driving test with renewed confidence and determination.
127	8989	4	2	The author includes this detail to illustrate the character's perseverance. Since she has not given up, she retains the opportunity to try again, demonstrating a resilient spirit that is central to the narrative's conclusion.
128	8990	4	2	"The author's decision to conclude with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test is multifaceted. Initially, the story establishes a somber tone, as seen when ""Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test,"" a moment that underscores her dejection and isolation. A shift occurs when she encounters ""a familiar plant,"" reintroducing hope into the narrative. The purchase of the plant and the subsequent exchange with her mother, who questions the cost, highlight its significance. Over time, the mother recognizes the plant as a symbol of strength and hope for her daughter. This parallels the personal resonance of a gifted object, where perceived initial value is transcended by its emotional meaning. Ultimately, the hope and courage Saeng derives from the plant directly motivate her resolve to attempt the test again, providing a coherent and thematically rich conclusion to the story."
129	8991	4	2	The author likely chose this concluding paragraph to provide a more substantial and thematically resonant ending for the narrative. A well-crafted conclusion should offer closure and reinforce the story's central ideas without requiring explicit explanation, allowing the symbolism and events to speak for themselves and impart a sense of finality to the reader.
130	8992	4	2	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to provide insight into the future beyond the main events and to clarify the narrative's resolution. This creative choice was made to ensure the story's message was effectively communicated and to offer a sense of completion for the reader.
131	8993	4	2	Saeng has resolved to wait for the conclusion of winter to make a fresh start. Her motivation stems from a previous failure where she accidentally destroyed the plants. She now aspires to emulate her mother and become a skilled gardener.
132	8994	4	2	The author concludes with these sentences to convey the character's dawning realization that they are returning.
133	8995	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow..."" to illustrate Saeng's newfound strength. This resilience stems from her successful adjustment to her new home and environment. She has gained the confidence to retake the test, determined not to repeat her previous emotional reaction. Her increased self-assurance and adaptation are the very reasons for her strengthened resolve and her decision to try again."
134	8996	4	2	"Confidence, persistence, and memories are the key attributes that explain the author's concluding paragraph. Since moving from her homeland, Saeng has been largely unhappy, filled with longing for everyone and everything from Vietnam; every sight reminds her of what she has lost. The final paragraph, where she states, ""then I will take that test again,"" demonstrates her regained self-confidence and determination to strive harder. This declaration shows her persistence and a hope that she will not surrender. Her memories of Vietnam, including the food, her family, and their appearance, had likely hindered her concentration during the initial driving test. She had wanted to succeed, hence purchasing the flower to improve her spirits. It is hoped that Saeng's life in the United States will improve and that she will learn to appreciate her new country."
135	8997	4	2	The blooming of the hibiscus plant symbolizes a new hope. In the narrative, the protagonist associates the hibiscus with her former existence, and the budding of the plant signifies the commencement of a new chapter in the young girl's life.
136	8998	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to substantiate his central argument. The narrative establishes a parallel between Saeng and the flower; the flower was originally a wild specimen later potted, while Saeng was a contented girl who subsequently relocated to @LOCATION1. Both entities experience a sense of displacement. Given this similarity, Saeng's observation of the flower leads her to a realization: if the flower can endure the winter, then she too can survive her challenges in @LOCATION1 and ultimately pass her test. The author employs this concluding paragraph to effectively communicate this message of resilience.
137	8999	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to underscore Saeng's determination to eventually pass her driver's test. By ending on this note, the author leaves the character in a positive and hopeful state, rather than in despair. This resolution suggests that upon retaking the test, Saeng will be better prepared and will know what to expect, ultimately positioning her for a more successful future.
138	9000	4	2	The author's concluding choice functions to impart a lesson on perseverance. The central message is that one should never surrender in the face of obstacles or setbacks. The imperative is to persist in one's efforts, and if initial attempts result in failure, to continue trying repeatedly until success is achieved. This final note reinforces the value of unwavering determination.
139	9001	4	2	Courage, memories, and hardship are the key reasons the author concludes the story with Saeng's vow. Her courage is evident in her decision to retake the test after failing, an act requiring significant willpower. Furthermore, the painful memory of her grandmother, while upsetting, also fuels her determination. These memories, largely positive, compel her to persevere as a form of tribute. Finally, the hardships her grandmother endured inspire Saeng to honor that legacy by appreciating the sacrifices made for her. These interconnected elements of courage, memory, and hardship are why the author selected this particular concluding paragraph.
140	9002	4	2	The author includes the final paragraph to illustrate that Saeng retains a sense of hope. The concluding sentence, articulated by @CAPS1 Fong Ho, demonstrates that even when circumstances seem most dire, one can always anticipate improvement. The coming of spring symbolizes a new beginning, not only for Saeng's hibiscus plant but also for her life in a foreign country, promising renewal and a fresh start.
141	9003	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" selected the concluding paragraph to reinforce the narrative's central theme and to establish a hopeful resolution. The theme concerns adaptation to new circumstances and optimizing each transition. Saeng's silent vow indicates her commitment to assimilating and identifying positive aspects within her new life. This hopeful tone illustrates her acceptance of life's changes and her resolve to surmount obstacles. Her declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" positions the test as a symbol of challenges that can be overcome with perseverance. Furthermore, the budding hibiscus, mentioned in the context of the snow melting and the geese returning, serves as a metaphor for Saeng's own new beginning. The author thus utilizes this final paragraph to accentuate the theme and symbolize a fresh start, effectively concluding the selection."
142	9004	4	2	I believe the author ended the story with that line so readers can see the parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus. After reading it, I saw that both Saeng and the plant are similar because they're both going to persevere and succeed—Saeng by getting her license and the hibiscus by budding. The author probably used this ending to show Saeng's dedication to her goal and her refusal to quit, as shown when she vows to retake the test. Finally, I think it provides a satisfying conclusion by letting the audience know what Saeng will do next, while still leaving some mystery about the outcome. For instance, I'm sure she will pass the test, but another reader might think she failed and had to try once more, allowing for personal interpretation.
143	9005	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph facilitates a comparative analysis between the protagonist, the geese, and the hibiscus. The geese, which depart for the winter and return in the spring, prefigure the girl's intention to return and retake her driver's test in the spring. Concurrently, the hibiscus, which withers in the winter and recommences budding in the spring, demonstrates a cyclical pattern of renewal, with winter representing its vulnerable period. Analogously, the girl surmounts her own challenge—the inability to drive—by drawing strength from memories of her homeland. The author's placement of this paragraph at the narrative's denouement allows the reader to perceive the symbolic connections between the girl, the geese, and the hibiscus, thereby unifying the story's concluding imagery.
144	9006	4	2	In my view, the author chose to end the story with that phrase to illustrate the character's impending maturity. She acknowledges that she was unprepared for the challenges she faced, such as failing her test, but instead of lamenting her failure, she simply resolves to try again the following year. Her longing for her homeland is another significant element, representing a deep sense of loss. She finds a way to cope by purchasing a winter hibiscus, which serves as a tangible reminder of both her homeland and her grandmother. Ultimately, the main character demonstrates considerable depth and maturity throughout the narrative, and the ending solidifies this personal growth.
145	9007	4	2	"The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate Saeng's readiness to adapt to her environment, mirroring the hibiscus's own adaptation. Saeng must adjust to her new home, just as the hibiscus must prepare for the approaching winter. Her vow, beginning with ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...,"" clearly conveys her hope for both herself and the plant. Initially, Saeng was reluctant to accept her new surroundings, noting that the hibiscus was different from those in her homeland. However, she came to realize the plant could function as a memento of home while also symbolizing the necessity of change for her new life. She understood that if the hibiscus could endure the winter, she too could persevere in a new location, thus completing her arc of acceptance."
146	9008	4	2	The narrative concludes with Saeng's internal vow to retake her test in the spring, a decision born from her struggle to adapt to a new home and her refusal to capitulate after a single failure. While memories of her lost home are a source of pain, they also provide a means of coping with her sense of loss. The discovery of familiar flora, such as the hibiscus, offered her comfort through its connection to her past. Thus, the coming spring, symbolized by the return of geese and the blooming hibiscus, represents both a renewed opportunity for Saeng to attempt the test and the promise of a new beginning.
147	9009	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's resolve to retake the test. Having previously informed her mother of her failure, Saeng's determination aligns with the seasonal return of spring, when the hibiscus will bud and the geese, which had departed due to winter, will come back. This cyclical return of the geese serves as a metaphor for Saeng herself, who misses her original home but, like the birds, understands that a return is possible when conditions are favorable, a concept the final paragraph effectively communicates.
148	9010	4	2	I believe the author chose this concluding paragraph because the hibiscus symbolizes a determined will to survive. Essentially, the plant signifies a token of good fortune for Saeng's next driving test, which she will undertake when the hibiscus buds again after winter. The author's intent was to use this symbolic imagery to clearly illustrate Saeng's future plans and her enduring sense of hope following an initial setback.
149	9011	4	2	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph serves to underscore Saeng's resilience. It confirms her refusal to surrender, instead choosing to wait for another opportunity to take the test, next time with better preparation and heightened confidence. This resolution assures the reader of Saeng's ultimate success and the subsequent pride her mother will feel. Her unwavering spirit is further exemplified by her immediate desire to plant the hibiscus, an action mirroring her mother's enduring hope and demonstrating that Saeng's own hope remains intact despite her recent failure and disappointment."
150	9012	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to articulate Saeng's silent vow, a promise made as she reflects on her past with her mother and the plants from their garden. She contemplates the transformative return of spring, with the melting snow, the reappearance of geese, and her own commitment to retake the test. This internal pledge, centered on renewal and a second chance, is the fundamental reason the author selected this paragraph to bring the story to its close.
151	9013	4	2	The narrative concludes by focusing on a girl and her mother. The girl is given money to purchase a seed for a plant, on which she spends @MONEY1. Although her mother is initially upset by the expenditure, the situation resolves positively, culminating in a meal of egg omelets that include pieces of melon.
152	9014	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resilience and her process of adaptation. For instance, Saeng's declaration, ""When they come back in the spring... then I will take that test again,"" demonstrates her determination, while also creating suspense for the reader regarding the geese's return. The mother's observation about the ""winter hibiscus"" being strong enough to survive the cold signifies their effort to find elements of their homeland in the new country. Ultimately, the paragraph serves to show how Saeng is learning to adapt to her changed environment."
153	9015	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the protagonist's anticipation for spring. She eagerly awaits the budding of her plant, an event that will reconnect her with memories of her homeland. Furthermore, she looks forward to retaking a test in the spring, having previously failed it. This ending underscores her hopeful outlook and her particular affection for the spring season.
154	9016	4	2	There is a meaningful reason for the author's concluding paragraph. It suggests the protagonist will feel more comfortable and prepared to retake her test after winter, allowing herself time for adequate preparation. The budding of the hibiscus plant is central to this, as it symbolizes comfort; the narrative shows how Saeng consoles herself by reminiscing about Vietnam. The author emphasizes the flower's importance to signify that when Saeng feels a vital part of her life is returning, she can achieve a state of comfort and focus.
155	9017	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to underscore the theme of hope. The protagonist believes she can pass the test when conditions normalize in the spring, marked by the return of geese and the budding of the hibiscus. These seasonal changes make her feel more at home, as they recall her life before moving. The presence of these familiar elements provides her with comfort, which is the central reason for the hopeful conclusion.
156	9018	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with a paragraph that establishes a parallel between Saeng's life and a plant. Following her failure of a driving test, Saeng encounters a plant that evokes memories of her homeland. Her journey from the flower shop to her residence is marked by a continuous comparison of her native country to the flower, illustrating her deep personal connection to it. The concluding passage signifies that, just as the hibiscus enters a new phase by budding, Saeng too will embark on a new beginning by retaking her driver's license examination.
157	9019	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's resolve to adapt to the changes in her life. After failing her driving test and struggling to adjust to her new environment, Saeng finds solace and motivation in familiar elements like the hibiscus and geese. Purchasing the hibiscus, which reminds her of home, provides comfort while simultaneously intensifying her longing for it. The plant's ability to thrive in two different climates demonstrates to Saeng that she too can survive and adapt. Similarly, the geese, whose migratory ""V"" formation she now recognizes, signal her growing familiarity with her new surroundings. This realization of her own increasing acclimatization and resilience fortifies her determination to retake and pass her driving test, thereby encapsulating the story's central theme of adaptation."
158	9020	4	2	In my view, the author included that specific sentence to foster a more intimate connection with the character, thereby allowing the reader to relate to her experiences and emotional state on a personal level. This technique effectively draws the audience deeper into the narrative.
159	9021	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore the significance of new beginnings and to reinforce the central theme of overcoming adversity. The narrative's theme posits that individuals must confront challenges and pursue fresh starts. Springtime functions as a metaphor for such a new beginning, suggesting it will afford her another opportunity to pass her driving test. Furthermore, the author utilizes the paragraph to highlight the symbolic resonance of ordinary objects; just as the hibiscus evoked memories of her homeland, the geese will come to symbolize the promise of spring and renewal.
160	9022	4	2	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" author Minfong Ho concludes with that paragraph to signify Saeng's decision to move beyond her past failure on the driving test and strive for improvement. The author suggests a form of rebirth for Saeng, analogous to the hibiscus regenerating with the arrival of spring. Throughout the narrative, Saeng, like the hibiscus, underwent a period of adjustment. The hibiscus ultimately inspired Saeng to thrive in her new environment, marking a new beginning for her after learning from the plant's resilience."
161	9023	4	2	The hibiscus functions as a central motif within the narrative. It inspires the protagonist, Saeng, motivating her to pursue new endeavors. The flower evokes memories of her homeland, thereby stimulating her desire for novel experiences. This symbolism is significant as it underscores the profound importance of the hibiscus to Saeng's character and motivations, illustrating its role as a catalyst for her personal development.
162	9024	4	2	The author likely chose this conclusion to depict the girl achieving a state of remembrance and tranquility through the flower, finding a sense of peace. This conveys the idea that regardless of one's background or habits, it is possible to discover an object or focus that brings genuine happiness and clarity, ultimately providing comfort and a renewed sense of purpose in life.
163	9025	4	2	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determined resolve. She is resolved to pass the test and will persist in her efforts until she ultimately succeeds, demonstrating a firm commitment to achieving her goal despite any previous setbacks she may have encountered.
164	9026	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate the character's maturation and personal growth within her circumstances. This conveys that an initial failure does not predestine future outcomes. Furthermore, it suggests that feeling displaced is a common experience, and life invariably presents opportunities for new beginnings; the choice to embrace these chances or remain stagnant ultimately rests with the individual, defining their personal journey.
165	9027	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake her driving test in the spring, a season symbolizing renewal with the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus. Having failed her test, Saeng experiences a profound disappointment familiar to many. The author employs the returning geese and the budding flower as potent symbols of new beginnings and the cyclical nature of life. Observing these natural cycles empowers Saeng, helping her realize that failure is an inherent part of progress and that success is ultimately born from perseverance, hard work, and the resilience to try again, which forges a stronger individual."
166	9028	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph with that sentence to convey that the narrative is not concluded. Its purpose is to inform the reader that @ORGANIZATION1 will retain this memory and that such events are likely to recur in the future.
167	9029	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph, featuring the line ""I will take that test again,"" signifies that the protagonist's struggles will recur, but she will be better prepared. Saeng's difficult transition to a new country is mitigated by her mother's support and symbolized by the hibiscus plant, which she acquired during her most challenging period. The story's final passage, which describes the snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding, reflects Saeng's silent vow for the future and her hopeful anticipation of spring, marking a cycle of hardship and renewal."
168	9030	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to indicate the protagonist's planned actions upon the arrival of spring. The paragraph describes her intention to resume caring for the plants and her desire for the winter snow to melt, signaling a return to life and growth. This concluding section effectively communicates the character's focus on renewal and the cyclical nature of the seasons.
169	9031	4	2	I believe the author chose this concluding paragraph to affirm the protagonist's determination to try again. Furthermore, this ending demonstrates that throughout life's journeys, there is often someone or something that provides reassurance. The author also aims to foster a sense of identification with the character, suggesting that even when one feels displaced, a point of connection can always be found, which is a profoundly relatable human experience.
170	9032	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to generate anticipation for a subsequent publication or to sustain the reader's heightened interest. This technique is a strategic narrative choice intended to create a sense of ongoing engagement rather than providing a definitive resolution.
171	9033	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to illustrate her need for a familiar and comforting environment. Saeng associates passing the test with the return of spring, a season marked by budding hibiscus and returning geese, elements that remind her of her homeland's perpetual springtime. This deliberate choice by the author underscores Saeng's longing for a setting reminiscent of her native country, thereby connecting her personal success to the comfort of a recreated, familiar landscape. The final paragraph thus serves to emphasize the character's deep-seated desire for a symbolic return home as a prerequisite for her achievement.
172	9034	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph functions to highlight how Saeng draws comfort from memories of her homeland and her appreciation for tropical flora. The narrative suggests that Saeng believes she cannot pass her driving test during the winter, a season when the hibiscus is dormant. Her realization that unfamiliar things have become familiar through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season"" indicates a growing adaptation. However, her conviction that she will pass the test only when the plants bud in spring reveals her continued belief that personal success is intrinsically linked to a comfortable, familiar environment reminiscent of her past."
173	9035	4	2	The author concludes the story by highlighting Saeng's search for comfort in the familiar. The returning geese and the budding hibiscus represent normal, accustomed things for Saeng, providing her with a sense of stability. She desires their presence during her driving test to recreate this feeling of comfort, as she still longs for her home in Vietnam and does not fully feel integrated into her new country. The hibiscus, in particular, evokes the comfort of home, while her test failure and the greenhouse plants contribute to her emotional state. Having arrived with nothing familiar, Saeng now finds solace in these natural cycles. The author's decision to end with Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring effectively provides insight into her future actions and her reliance on seasonal familiarity for confidence.
174	9036	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring when the geese return and the hibiscus buds because the narrative is set in winter, a time when school is closed. The return of the geese signals the arrival of spring, which coincides with the reopening of school. This seasonal transition provides the logical timeframe for her to attempt the test again, making this the reason for the specific timing of her resolution.
175	9037	4	2	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, which signifies her ongoing process of adaptation. Her failure on the driver's test parallels her struggle to accept the new country, and her vow to try again demonstrates a willingness to grant it another chance. The line, ""She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home,"" indicates that she does not yet consider this new place her home, revealing that she remains emotionally anchored in her past. The ending thus encapsulates her tentative steps toward future integration while still being held by nostalgia."
176	9038	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng will not cease her efforts due to an initial failure. It further illustrates her resilience, indicating she will not allow setbacks to defeat her.
177	9039	4	2	"The concluding sentence of a story often carries significant meaning. The author likely ended the narrative in this manner to leave the reader with a powerful impression of determination. The character's declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" employs the definitive word ""will,"" signifying her resolve rather than a mere intention. Furthermore, this ending underscores the theme of new beginnings, as the character vows to retake the test in the spring, a season symbolic of renewal. This deliberate choice effectively reinforces the story's central messages."
178	9040	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" is a deliberate narrative choice that signifies Saeng's intention to synthesize her old and new lives. The hibiscus symbolizes her past, a constant from her homeland, while the geese represent her evolving familiarity with her new environment. The obstacle of the driving test is thus framed not as a permanent defeat but as a challenge to be overcome. The author implies that in the spring, a time of convergence for these symbolic elements, Saeng will be poised to surmount her difficulty, achieving a sense of wholeness as her life comes full circle."
179	9041	4	2	The author includes this final paragraph to specify when Saeng will retake her test, linking this decision to the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus. This timing is the central reason for the paragraph's placement at the story's conclusion.
180	9042	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's resolve to retake the test. This determination is supported by her growing acclimatization, as noted in the preceding text where she realizes that once-strange elements have become familiar through the passing seasons. This demonstrates her evolving perspective and acceptance that things, like the plant, can hold meaning even when different. The author's choice to end here effectively encapsulates this character development and thematic resolution."
181	9043	4	2	"The author concludes with the paragraph describing spring to signify that Saeng will regain her confidence once her new environment begins to mirror the familiar qualities of her former home. The harsh winter represents the stark contrast to her past life, but the anticipated spring, with its budding hibiscus and returning geese, symbolizes the emergence of comfort and belonging. This feeling of being ""at home"" will provide the positive and secure foundation she needs to retake her test successfully."
182	9044	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the narrative illustrates the protagonist Saeng's journey toward cultural adaptation. Initially, Saeng is overwhelmed by nostalgia and fails to recognize similarities between her old and new homes. However, through the quiet repetition of seasons, the unfamiliar becomes almost familiar, a process that allows her to integrate new memories with old. Her initial emotional fragility, where she was ""too shaky to say the words,"" gradually gives way to a burgeoning confidence. The concluding paragraph offers a sense of hope, suggesting that her willingness to adapt will enable her to eventually retake her driving test and succeed. The story ultimately posits that courage and adaptation can forge a satisfying life, blending new experiences with cherished memories."
183	9045	4	2	The author's intent in this brief story is straightforward. The excerpt primarily signifies that with the arrival of spring, the protagonist will return to the greenhouse. Upon her return, she intends to acquire a plant that grows wild in her native country and introduce it to her new home environment, thereby completing a symbolic act of transplantation.
184	9046	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to characterize Saeng as a resilient individual who, like the hibiscus plant, is committed to continuous growth. Her perspective has shifted; phenomena she once found strange have become familiar through the cyclical passage of the seasons. This realization fosters a forward-looking optimism, as she understands that with the next season—marked by the grown plant and the geese's return—comes a new opportunity to try again, reinforcing the theme of perseverance.
185	9047	4	2	"Minfong Ho ends the story with this specific paragraph to convey Saeng's internal resolve. When Saeng declares, ""I will take that test again,"" it signifies her determination to face her challenges once more. This statement reflects her decision to persevere despite previous difficulties, concluding the narrative on a note of quiet determination."
186	9048	4	2	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to convey the enduring possibility of a positive resolution. The return of the geese brought the girl considerable happiness, thereby illustrating that favorable outcomes are always attainable.
187	9049	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph underscores the protagonist's steadfast resolve. She draws a parallel between her own perseverance and the resilience of nature; just as a flower survives the winter and geese reliably return, she too will persist in her efforts until she ultimately passes her driving test.
188	9050	4	2	Saeng finds greater comfort in the spring season because it evokes memories of her homeland. Having likely never experienced snow or winter before, this cold period holds no familiar associations for her. The spring, however, with the return of the geese and the re-budding of the hibiscus, restores a sense of her native environment. It is with the arrival of spring that she regains her confidence.
189	9051	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to encapsulate the strength and courage the hibiscus has imparted to Saeng. Similar to the plant, Saeng initially felt displaced in her new country; the hibiscus helps her comprehend the necessity of adaptation for survival and happiness. She realizes she cannot dwell perpetually in the past but must learn to appreciate her present surroundings. Consequently, her statement about retaking the test in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, symbolizes her own budding openness to new experiences, such as learning to drive."
190	9052	4	2	"I believe the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" used this final paragraph to show that the hibiscus will revive memories of home, providing the encouragement she needs for her test. The geese symbolize Saeng's determination to pass and to persevere in the new country. When she watches the geese fade into the distance, it creates a vivid image that assures me she will indeed take that test, fortified by the encouragement from both the geese and the hibiscus."
191	9053	4	2	The author concludes with that paragraph to convey a sense of reassurance, indicating that Saeng's circumstances will improve. Her decision to retake the driver's test signifies a return to normalcy and an optimistic outlook. This ending fosters a feeling of hope, suggesting that Saeng will overcome her challenges and begin to embrace life more fully, which is the author's intended final message.
192	9054	4	2	"The author employs this paragraph to conclude the story as it demonstrates Saeng's ongoing adaptation to her new country, a process she is beginning to comprehend and appreciate. The statement, ""and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" functions as a metaphor for Saeng herself; just as the plant begins to bloom and flourish, so too is she beginning to blossom and thrive in her new environment, which justifies the author's choice of this concluding passage."
193	9055	4	2	Saeng declared she would retake the driving test once the plant she purchased began to bud. This suggests she feels unable to attempt the test without the plant, which has been a constant presence throughout her life. She appears to believe she requires it for success, though this is likely a psychological dependency rather than a genuine necessity. Ultimately, the plant seems to function primarily as a source of comfort for her.
194	9056	4	2	The author suggests Saeng was not prepared for the test until she gained more familiarity with her new surroundings. Preoccupied with gardening and isolated at school without friends, Saeng was initially reluctant. However, her vow to take the test is positive, as one cannot predict outcomes without trying. The author thus conveys that Saeng will ultimately choose to take the test and succeed.
195	9057	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize the connection to Saeng's memories of her homeland. By stating she will retake the test in the spring, the author highlights how the season's return—with its blossoming trees and emerging wildlife—will evoke powerful memories. These recollections of her native country will provide the emotional support she needs to attempt the test again with renewed confidence.
196	9058	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the conclusion powerfully conveys a universal will to survive. This is first illustrated through the 'dok faeng-noi' plant, which, having migrated to a seemingly warm environment, adapted to subsequent cold conditions, a process driven by a fundamental instinct for survival. The theme is further embodied by the protagonist, Saeng, who, despite experiencing profound melancholy after failing a test, resolves to attempt it again in the spring. This decision signifies a crucial human drive to persevere; for Saeng to live successfully in a new country, she must adapt and overcome such challenges, thereby affirming her own resilience and capacity to survive."
197	9059	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph describing the snow on the roads to illustrate a journey through adversity. This imagery serves to show people navigating their path carefully under difficult conditions. Ultimately, the paragraph signifies that the protagonist successfully endured and emerged from the challenging snowstorm.
198	9060	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a paragraph in which Saeng vows to retake her test in the spring, a season marked by melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus. This final passage is significant because the hibiscus provides her with both comfort from her homeland and newfound confidence, as suggested by the phrase ""almost familiar to her now."" This indicates her growing acclimatization and the realization that her new environment can possess qualities reminiscent of her past home. Both Saeng and her mother value the flower for its connection to their previous life, with the mother noting that while its flowers are less pretty, it is strong enough to survive the cold. The author uses this concluding paragraph to underscore the importance of memory and familiar symbols in the process of adapting to a new life, demonstrating how the past can provide strength for the present."
199	9061	4	2	The author selected this ending to demonstrate that Saeng has not surrendered to her difficult circumstances. Despite her deep affection for her hometown and the weight of her memories, her initial failure on the test and the pressures of her new life were overwhelming. Although she has not fully adapted, the conclusion shows her resolve to persevere and overcome the challenges she faces. This provides the reader with a sense of hope, rather than leaving the narrative at the point of her purchasing a flower after her failure. Her distress and anger following the test are palpable, as seen when she nervously tears a leaf from the hibiscus plant, a reaction to the frustration of leaving a happy past for a challenging present. By concluding with Saeng's determination, the author communicates that even in the face of extreme emotional turmoil, there remains a tangible chance for hope and future success.
200	9062	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" author Minfong Ho concludes the narrative in this particular manner for a multitude of deliberate reasons, which serve to encapsulate the central themes of adaptation, memory, and resilience that are developed throughout the text. This carefully crafted ending provides a cohesive and resonant finale to the protagonist's journey."
201	9063	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides a final summation of the narrative's themes. It explains that the protagonist is anticipating the arrival of spring, a time when the hibiscus will bloom, symbolizing a new beginning.
202	9064	4	2	The author ends the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to illustrate her newfound resilience. By aligning her personal journey with the natural cycles of the returning geese and the budding hibiscus, the narrative suggests that Saeng, like the migratory birds and the perennial plant, can adapt and thrive in her new environment. This connection gives her the confidence and sense of security she needs to face her challenge again, believing that conditions will be more favorable then.
203	9065	4	2	The author chose this conclusion for two primary reasons. Firstly, it is designed to provoke the readers' curiosity, encouraging them to speculate about potential future events in the narrative. Secondly, it deliberately leaves the story open-ended, creating a logical opportunity for a sequel should the author wish to continue the tale. This technique effectively maintains reader engagement beyond the final page.
204	9066	4	2	She made this vow because she recognized that her return was as inevitable as the geese's migration. The tests she faced concerning love, survival, and family tradition were part of a necessary journey for growth. Just as the geese depart to escape the harsh winter and ensure their survival, only to return to their ancestral grounds to raise their young, she understood the cyclical nature of challenge and homecoming. Through this, she learned essential lessons about family, freedom, and the will to endure.
205	9067	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize the character's commitment to attempting the test again. This resolution underscores the theme that there is always an opportunity for a second attempt. The primary purpose is to convey the message that perseverance is vital and that everyone deserves another chance to succeed, a universal concept with which most readers can identify.
206	9068	4	2	The author's choice of conclusion aligns with the cyclical transition of the seasons, which signifies both an ending and a new beginning. This method of concluding the story is effective as it establishes a distinct tone and emotional resonance for the final passage.
207	9069	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to convey the central theme of adapting to life's changes. The protagonist, Saeng, has experienced significant upheaval and has not yet fully acclimated to her new environment. However, she learns the necessity of determination and resilience, much like the hibiscus that endures the winter. The text's reference to the plant budding in spring illustrates this lesson in perseverance; just as the hibiscus survives the cold, Saeng resolves to persist despite her initial failure on the driving test, fortified by her memories. The final paragraph thus encapsulates the idea of persevering through displacement, showing Saeng's gradual acceptance of her new home as she recognizes the changing seasons and internalizes this crucial insight."
208	9070	4	2	Such a paragraph serves to establish a specific tone and provide descriptive details. It can also function as a narrative springboard, potentially beginning another story or inspiring further inquiry into a subject. Furthermore, it invites a personal comparison, allowing the reader to reflect on their own life's challenges in relation to the experiences of the geese, thereby drawing a parallel between the text and the reader's personal journey.
209	9071	4	2	The author selects this conclusion for several reasons. The narrative consistently implies Saeng's homesickness, which is then metaphorically linked to the hardy flower that survives the winter. This parallel suggests that Saeng, too, will endure her difficulties. Although the American hibiscus differs from the one in her homeland, symbolizing inevitable change, it nonetheless provides a tangible connection to her past. Therefore, the author ends the story on this note to affirm that, akin to the plant, Saeng will survive and strive to adapt with the coming spring, as evidenced by her resolve regarding the driving test.
210	9072	4	2	The author's concluding remarks were intended to evaluate the subsequent text, assigning a score based on established criteria for quality and key comprehension. The author was reportedly surprised by the need to distinguish between various submissions, and this process was conducted with the aim of providing a high standard of assessment for all entries until the final evaluation was complete.
211	9073	4	2	"The author included this paragraph to demonstrate the protagonist's resilience and refusal to surrender after a failure. Saeng explicitly states, ""I failed the test,"" to her mother, yet the tone shifts to one of pride and optimism regarding a future attempt. This portrayal of determination is particularly notable when contrasted with a more common reaction, such as promising a retake without following through, thereby underscoring the character's resolute commitment to her goal."
212	9074	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to affirm that Saeng has not given up, despite her setback. The narrative reveals that Saeng finds solace in memories of her homeland, indicating the difficulty of her relocation. This is exemplified when she touches a hibiscus flower, noting its smooth, cool texture and hint of velvet, a sensation that provides profound comfort. Her subsequent purchase of the plant serves to lift her spirits after failing the test. The author's decision to end with Saeng's vow to retake the test when the hibiscus buds is significant; the plant symbolizes a positive connection to her past and becomes the specific motivation that fuels her renewed determination, clearly signaling her perseverance to the reader.
213	9075	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a powerful paragraph to illustrate Saeng's passion and resolve in her new environment. The closing statement, in which Saeng ""vows"" to pass the test, demonstrates her fighting spirit. This determination appears to be fueled by memories of her grandmother and the flowers that vividly recall her former home. Saeng's courage in confronting her homesickness forms the narrative's core, and by concluding with such a definitive promise, Ho transforms a potentially sorrowful tale into one of willpower and the drive to succeed. While ""Winter Hibiscus"" explores themes of heartache and yearning, its uplifting conclusion provides a hopeful resolution to the story."
214	9076	4	2	The author employs this concluding paragraph to create a parallel between the narrative's end and the conclusion of a seasonal cycle. This structural choice provides a sense of closure, mirroring the natural ending of the season described within the story itself and bringing the tale to a fitting and coherent conclusion.
215	9077	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the character's forward-looking mindset and acceptance of a cyclical process. This is evidenced by the textual clue stating, ""in the spring... I will take this test again."" The statement indicates that the character is not defeated but is instead mentally preparing for a future attempt, viewing it as an inevitable part of her ongoing journey. This perspective on perseverance is the fundamental reason for the paragraph's placement at the story's end."
216	9078	4	2	Following her evening meal, Saeng contemplated the recent examination. She was confident in her capacity for significant improvement over her prior performance. Consequently, she resolved that upon the conclusion of winter and the arrival of spring, she would undertake the test once more, with the firm intention of achieving a successful outcome on this subsequent attempt.
217	9079	4	2	Saeng intends to retake the test during a season of beauty, when the hibiscus is in bud. The flowering plant symbolizes the accomplishment of passing. Its qualities—strength, resilience, and refined beauty—are traits that will aid her success and that she shares with the flower. She wishes to take the test on a similarly fine day. The plant's earlier hardiness reflected her own during her initial failure, about which her mother was very understanding. Both the hibiscus and the migrating geese represent positive, beautiful outcomes. Saeng is determined to succeed next time and envisions returning home after passing her test to a beautiful setting, thereby cementing the memory. The author uses this conclusion to underscore the symbolic importance of the natural surroundings to her anticipated success.
218	9080	4	2	The author likely chose to conclude the narrative with that specific paragraph to reinforce the profound connection between the protagonist, Saeng, and the hibiscus. This interpretation is supported by Saeng's consistent display of compassion and attentiveness toward the plant throughout the story. It appears she identified with the flower, perceiving a shared experience or essence that made the hibiscus a meaningful symbol for her personal journey.
219	9081	4	2	"The author utilizes this concluding paragraph to symbolize a new beginning. After admitting, ""I failed the test,"" Saeng, despite her sadness, makes a commitment to pursue a fresh start, paralleling the world's renewal each spring. This reinforces the story's theme that when confronted with difficulty, one should adopt a new perspective. Her specific plan for moving forward is to retake the driver's examination, marking her resolve to begin again."
220	9082	4	2	The author's conclusion demonstrates that Saeng understands she will be prepared for the test only after a period of personal growth and adaptation to her new environment, much like the hibiscus plant must acclimate to conditions outside the greenhouse and the geese adapt by migrating south. Saeng recognizes she has more to learn and must fully adapt before she can pass her driver's test. This ending signifies her realization that she must cease dwelling on her past life and actively begin her new one in a different country.
221	9083	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" on an optimistic note to counterbalance the protagonist Saeng's waning hope. Saeng resolves to retake her driving test when the hibiscus blooms, a flower that evokes powerful memories of her grandmother and her former life in Vietnam. The sensory detail of combing her grandmother's hair connects her to a comforting past, which she prefers to her current life in an unfamiliar location. By waiting for the hibiscus to bud, a symbol of renewal, Saeng positions herself to feel more comfort and happiness. The author's intent was thus to provide a hopeful and satisfying conclusion for Saeng's emotional journey."
222	9084	4	2	The author chose this concluding tone to convey a sense of sadness while simultaneously imparting a message of hope, urging the reader to persevere and never surrender. An ending that left the protagonist despondent would have been less effective. Instead, this resolution inspires hope and underscores the value of practice, as the character plans to practice driving before retaking the test in the spring. The character's increasing happiness at the end positively affects the reader. Ultimately, the conclusion was a sound choice as it leaves the reader feeling uplifted, provides courage to persist despite failure, emphasizes the importance of practice, and even highlights the value of helping family.
223	9085	4	2	The author employs the final paragraph to develop the story's central theme of adapting to life's changes and to foreshadow the protagonist's future actions. The theme is advanced through Saeng's internal vow to retake her driving test in the spring, a season of renewal marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. This demonstrates Saeng's developing resilience in the face of adversity, such as failing her test. Her purchase of the hibiscus, which symbolizes her homeland, represents a coping mechanism and a symbol of a new beginning, reinforcing the thematic focus on adjustment and the promise of a fresh start.
224	9086	4	2	Consequently, she remained committed to her plan of retaking the examination at a later date, ensuring she would not abandon her objective.
225	9087	4	2	Saeng demonstrated resilience by refusing to surrender after her initial failure, resolving to try again with the belief that she could eventually succeed. This reflects a universal truth that success is not always immediate and often requires persistent effort. Her actions serve as an encouragement to the reader to persevere despite early setbacks, while also illustrating her own journey toward building self-confidence. The author selected this concluding message precisely to emphasize these values of determination and personal growth.
226	9088	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's resolution to retake the examination in the spring to illustrate that the geese and the hibiscus symbolize a form of personal renewal for her. This conclusion establishes an optimistic tone. Spring is an archetypal season representing birth and growth. After her initial failure, the sight of the hibiscus evoked comforting memories of Vietnam for Saeng. She believes that witnessing the plant's flourishing and the geese's return will facilitate a similar revival within herself, providing the fortitude to try again.
227	9089	4	2	The author structures the conclusion around Saeng's decision to retake the driver's test in the spring, following her initial failure. This progression is logical, as her encounters with nature have provided her with a new perspective. Observing the plants and the geese flying in a familiar formation reminded her of Vietnam, leading to the realization that she must adapt to her new environment. Concluding with the spring test is thematically appropriate, as the returning geese and the budding hibiscus signify new beginnings, mirroring Saeng's own fresh start and determination to succeed.
228	9090	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate Saeng's persistent hope. She is determined to try again, seeking a plant that will serve as a tangible connection to her grandmother and her former home, a place she yearns to revisit one day. This pursuit is not for a substitute, but for the genuine flower she holds dear, a symbol of her heritage and personal history that she deeply values.
229	9091	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding paragraph serves to underscore Saeng's resilience. Her plan to retest in the spring is intrinsically linked to the symbolic hibiscus; its bloom will remind her of home, alleviating her homesickness and bolstering her resolve. The text notes how previously forgotten plants ""drew her back into her childhood,"" indicating that the sight of the flourishing hibiscus will provide comfort and a sense of belonging. Consequently, as the plant blossoms, so too does Saeng's confidence and her capacity to succeed in her new environment."
230	9092	4	2	The original text appears to reference a transition in the weather, noting that snow was present and then began to melt. This change in the external environment from a cold, snowy condition to a thaw suggests a shift in the season or the arrival of warmer temperatures, marking an end to the winter period and the beginning of a new phase.
231	9093	4	2	The author selected this concluding sentence to signify the character's acquisition of a life lesson. The protagonist reflects on her distant home, missing her friends and the sight of her mother gardening in the cold, which underscores a state of financial hardship. Ultimately, the sentence was chosen to convey that she has gained wisdom from her experiences and is prepared to begin anew with a deeper, more mature understanding.
232	9094	4	2	Saeng makes this statement because she is determined to make her mother proud, and therefore, she plans to retake the test after the winter season has passed.
233	9095	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to underscore the protagonist's resolute willpower. Her affection for the hibiscus provides a powerful metaphor for her own journey. By stating she will retake the test when the hibiscus buds in spring, she equates her current failure to the winter snow that temporarily hinders the plant's growth. This parallel signifies her intention to use this period of delay for preparation, so that when spring arrives and the hibiscus blossoms, she too will blossom by passing her examination.
234	9096	4	2	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, a season that, along with the hibiscus plant, evokes powerful memories of her homeland. This is illustrated when she becomes emotionally overwhelmed, unable to even speak the word ""home"" due to the intensity of her longing. She consequently seeks out comforting reminders, such as the dok faeng-noi plant, which serves as a tangible connection to her origins. In summary, Saeng's discovery of the plant and her affinity for spring are both rooted in their capacity to remind her of home, a sentiment that invites readers to consider their own personal symbols of home."
235	9097	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph to communicate to the reader that circumstances improve with the passage of time. Saeng's failure of the driver's test resulted from her lack of readiness, much like a flower that attempts to bloom prematurely. The narrative thus advocates for patience, suggesting that positive outcomes will eventually be realized for those who wait.
236	9098	4	2	The author's decision to conclude with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring serves to parallel her personal resilience with the hardiness of the hibiscus. Following her failure, Saeng finds comfort in a hibiscus native to her homeland, a symbol of her past life. Her mother's observation that the plant, while less showy, is strong enough to survive the foreign cold underscores Saeng's own struggle to adapt. The final sentiment encapsulates this connection; Saeng draws strength from the flower's endurance, reasoning that if it can thrive far from its native soil, so too can she find the fortitude to succeed.
237	9099	4	2	The protagonist resolves to retake the test once she feels prepared and the environment is more favorable, which will bolster her confidence. The author uses this resolution to convey the character's profound sense of having disappointed her mother, illustrating her motivation to try again when conditions improve.

Her decision to retake the test indicates a shift in her perspective and approach. This final segment is intended to resolve the story's central conflict by highlighting the girl's significant personal transformation.
239	9101	4	2	"In the short story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with this specific paragraph to indicate the precise moment Saeng would achieve the readiness necessary to attempt the test again, tying her personal readiness to the symbolic renewal of the spring season."
240	9102	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize that the protagonist retains hope. The hibiscus acts as a symbol, providing her with the strength and optimism needed to persevere. Her plan to retake the test in the spring represents a forward-looking belief in her ability to eventually succeed, which is the central reason for this concluding thought.
241	9103	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" utilizes Saeng's internal vow to retake the test in the spring to underscore her resolute determination. This final statement frames the hibiscus as a symbol of comfort and resilience, which Saeng draws upon for strength. Her resolve is fundamentally rooted in the fortitude derived from her personal history, and the author's choice to end on this note effectively highlights Saeng's unwavering commitment to overcoming her present obstacle."
242	9104	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho's concluding paragraph emphasizes the profound significance of the flower to Saeng. The detail of Saeng digging a hole and carefully planting the winter hibiscus illustrates the plant's deep personal value. This final passage allows the reader to comprehend Saeng's growing affection for her new country. Furthermore, the conclusion provides a sense of comfort following a moment of disappointment, with the description of the flower's hardiness mirroring Saeng's own resilience and their symbolic connection in navigating challenges."
243	9105	4	2	The author likely included this conclusion to parallel Saeng's need for personal growth with the plant's life cycle before she attempts the test again. The educational journey often involves more than just acquiring knowledge; it facilitates maturation and a deeper understanding of life. Just as a student in tenth grade possesses a broader perspective than they did in first grade, Saeng requires further mental and emotional development regarding her past and present circumstances to ultimately succeed.
244	9106	4	2	The author ends the story with this line to convey that hope remains for the protagonist and that the flower served as a significant inspiration. By choosing to retry the test in the spring, a time of renewal marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding hibiscus, Saeng aligns her fresh start with nature's cycle. The specific mention of the hibiscus budding symbolizes a new beginning, mirroring her own. The hopeful and determined tone of her vow confirms her resolve to succeed on her next attempt.
245	9107	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to signify that while the narrative concludes, Saeng's personal journey continues.

247	9109	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to parallel the story's central theme of cyclical renewal. The perennial plant's return each spring, alongside the geese, signifies an ongoing test of resilience and the imperative to nurture life.
248	9110	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph, featuring Saeng's silent vow, functions to illustrate her resolute determination. The hibiscus, a plant reminiscent of her homeland, operates as a symbol of comfort and her own tenacity. The narrative detail of seasons becoming ""almost familiar"" indicates her growing recognition of new patterns, which bolsters her self-assurance. The imagery of the geese forming a distinctive ""v"" in the sky further underscores a persistent sense of hope. Thus, the paragraph effectively synthesizes Saeng's emergent beliefs and aspirations."
249	9111	4	2	Saeng's vow at the story's end demonstrates her commitment to adapt, much like the hibiscus is destined to bud. She acknowledges the difficulty and time required for this process, yet remains confident in ultimately attaining acceptance and contentment. Her emotional breakdown and interactions with her mother reveal the present struggle, while the act of planting the hibiscus symbolizes a belief that progress is possible if she does not remain anchored in the past.
250	9112	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's statement to emphasize her motivated and determined state. Her motivation is evidenced through actions, such as offering to help her mother complete a task. Her determination is revealed in her realization that previously strange elements have become familiar through the quiet repetition of the seasons, indicating she no longer finds her goals foreign. The author selected this conclusion to solidify this character development.
251	9113	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's internal vow to retake her driving test in the spring, a resolution following her initial failure.

Furthermore, the line, ""Saeng did not dare look at her mother in her eyes,"" conveys her profound disappointment, indicating the test's importance and the accompanying pressure. The overarching theme suggests that while one may face discouragement, as the narrator has through various hardships, perseverance through life's seasons is possible."
253	9115	4	2	"The author conveys a distinct willingness to persevere through the story's conclusion. The declaration, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signifies a pivotal realization of the need to adapt and a refusal to surrender. The symbolic weight given to the hibiscus is particularly telling; by waiting for it to bud, the author implies the plant serves as a poignant connection to her homeland. Having left her country, the hibiscus becomes a cherished vestige of it, and her resolve to wait for its blooming signifies a patient and sentimental preparation for her next attempt."
254	9116	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate how Saeng now perceives her new environment through a lens of memory and association, much like her old home. Initially, at the floral shop, memories of her grandmother and images from Vietnam, such as a well and a hibiscus hedge, evoke specific feelings and experiences. By the story's end, she synthesizes symbols from both worlds: the hibiscus, which recalls her past, and the Canadian geese, which have grown familiar. These elements collectively represent the passage of time and her evolving sense of belonging, as she now attaches familiar memories to her new home, mirroring the emotional landscape of her previous life.
255	9117	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the protagonist's resilience. The narrative details her desire for something, leading her to bring it home and face her mother's incredulous reaction, as depicted by the line, ""you what? Her mother stared at her increduously.""

260	9123	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to convey the story's central meaning. Saeng's return home provided her with a profound sense of belonging. Her vow to herself, set for the spring when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, signifies that this homecoming was a pivotal and positive event for her. This final thought underscores the importance of finding one's place and the hope that accompanies a new season.
261	9124	4	2	It is my interpretation that the author employed this ending to introduce sarcasm and emphasize the narrator's resolute refusal to retake the examination, conveying that only under the gravest of circumstances, such as a mortal threat, would he ever consider doing so.
262	9125	4	2	"I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng intends to retake the test when the hibiscus blooms again. This is supported by the final line, where she vows, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This direct statement confirms the author's intent to conclude on a note of future determination."

As the hibiscus enters a new growth cycle, so too does Saeng commit to a fresh start, which is the central reason for the story's concluding sentiment."
265	9128	4	2	The author concluded the story in this manner for several reasons. Primarily, the narrative maintains a serious tone, and ending with a reflective vow provides a contrast that prompts deeper reader engagement.

268	9131	4	2	The author concludes in this manner to convey the protagonist's resolve to spend an entire season without dwelling on home; having failed in winter, she will attempt again in spring.

For instance, the scent of the plant seems to transport her back to her childhood, when the flowers grew wild and beautiful, thus illustrating her motivation.
269	9132	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, a symbol of hope that provides narrative closure.

Throughout the story, Saeng realizes she is not as detached from her Vietnamese home as she thought, with plants in the florist shop triggering childhood memories. Her initial failure, marked by buying a winter hibiscus during a homesick episode, gives way to a growing familiarity with her new life. The concluding statement signifies her aspiration to overcome homesickness by spring and to ultimately view her new location, with its geese and hibiscuses, as home."
271	9134	4	2	The author's concluding passage serves to illustrate Saeng's resolute determination. The narrative chronicles Saeng's journey toward accepting her new home over the course of a single afternoon, making it appropriate to conclude with her resolve to pass the driving test and build a life in @LOCATION1. This thematic arc is supported by several key discoveries that foster a sense of belonging for Saeng, including the sharp taste of bitter melon and the sight of a hibiscus. These @CAPS1 contribute to her feeling more at home, thereby justifying the ending centered on acceptance. The hibiscus, in particular, serves as an inspiration; its strength to endure the cold months signifies to Saeng the importance of perseverance. This directly informs her own determination to succeed in her new life. Finally, the sight of geese, which have become a familiar sight, leads @PERSON1 to the definitive realization that this is now her home and returning is not an option. The entire story is structured around such pivotal moments that culminate in the @CAPS2's determination, making the concluding focus on this resolve a fitting and logical endpoint for the narrative.
272	9135	4	2	The author employs the final paragraph to symbolize a new beginning for the characters. This is primarily conveyed through the story's central metaphor: the arrival of spring represents the commencement of a new life for Saeng and her mother following their move to a new country. Conversely, the melting snow acts as a blanket covering the past and its associated hardships, signifying their dissipation. Furthermore, the budding of the hibiscus flower provides another potent symbol of a fresh start. When synthesized, these elements create a coherent image: the retreat of difficult times is depicted by the snow's disappearance, while the advent of spring and the flowering bud herald a new chapter. The paragraph is thus integral to the narrative, providing the characters with the symbolic fresh start they require.
273	9136	4	2	The author selected this sentence as the conclusion because it reflects Saeng's conviction that she merits another attempt at the driving test, having previously failed and consequently disappointing her mother.

The author resolves the story with this particular paragraph to provide a conclusion that leaves the reader feeling hopeful for Saeng's future and contemplative about her journey."
276	9139	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's resilience, demonstrating that a single failure will not deter her.

277	9140	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's perseverance. After failing to acquire a specific plant, which had died, she is granted a new opportunity with the arrival of spring.

External circumstances, described as a harsh wind tearing at the remaining vegetation, contributed to her initial setback. The conclusion thus signifies a future moment of success, implying that Saeng will eventually be seen holding the beautiful plant she seeks."
278	9141	4	2	"I believe the author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize that the character Saeng is determined to finish what she started and retake the test when the opportunity arises.

281	9144	4	2	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve to retake the examination in the spring, a time that will bring renewed confidence as the snow melts, geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud. The text notes, ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her."" This profound sense of loss stems from her loneliness as an immigrant who misses her native country and all she once knew and loved. The hibiscus now serves as a tangible connection to her homeland, providing a source of solace and remembrance."
282	9145	4	2	"The author employs this concluding paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's process of learning and personal growth. Initially, Saeng is characterized by unease and self-disappointment, as evidenced by her stammering admission, ""I-I failed the test."" Her mother's initial silent reaction suggests a moment of shared disappointment. However, the mood shifts as they engage in the calming activity of planting and share a meal, with the mother offering an omelet with bitter melon, to which Saeng warmly agrees. This improved frame of mind allows her to make a calm and collected decision to try again, a reasonable choice made from a place of emotional stability rather than distress."
283	9146	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" is significant for several reasons. The protagonist's initial failure on the test plunges her into silence, but her subsequent agreement to retake it signifies a resilient will to survive and a determination to persistently pursue her goal. Furthermore, the ending symbolically represents a new beginning, paralleling the transition from winter to spring as the snow melts. This thematic use of seasonal change underscores the character's potential for renewal and growth, which is why the author chose to conclude the narrative in this manner."
284	9147	4	2	The author concludes with this sentence to signify Saeng's decision to adapt to her new environment. It indicates a transition from a state of grief and sadness to one of acceptance and forward momentum. This shift is highlighted after Saeng returns home, speaks with her mother, and becomes overwhelmed with sadness while reminiscing about her past life. The final statement of the story, however, demonstrates that Saeng has chosen to move on, setting a personal goal to embrace her new circumstances, which is the author's intended reason for this particular conclusion.
285	9148	4	2	The author ended the story with that paragraph to convey that the hibiscus serves as a source of comfort for Saeng following a disappointment. She encountered the plant immediately after failing her driving test, and it subsequently becomes a symbolic object of solace. This connection provides her with emotional support, illustrating how a simple natural element can offer significant consolation in a moment of personal setback.
286	9149	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" employs the concluding paragraph to signify the protagonist's resolution to adapt to her new cultural environment. The specific vow, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring... then I will take the test again,"" serves as a declaration of her intent to persevere. This determination follows an emotional breakdown in the greenhouse, where she cried, an incident that likely stemmed from her initial failure to assimilate and pass the test. The conclusion, therefore, functions to illustrate Saeng's motivation to try again and ultimately find her place in this new world."
287	9150	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate the protagonist's resilience and refusal to surrender. The final paragraph underscores her determination to retake the test and exert greater effort to overcome her challenges. It is a clear portrayal of a character who, despite facing significant conflicts, is resolute and filled with a spirit of perseverance, establishing that she is not a quitter.
288	9151	4	2	"The author selected this concluding paragraph to project the protagonist's future intentions. This is evidenced within the narrative when she confesses to her mother, ""I failed,"" while planting the flower. The simultaneous imagery of a flock of geese flying south reinforces this forward-looking perspective, symbolizing a natural cycle and the promise of a future endeavor, which is the central focus of the story's ending."
289	9152	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize the protagonist's resolve to try again. Her statement, ""Then I will take that test again,"" reveals her recognition of a second chance and her strong-willed nature, conveying a message of persistence. This is further supported by her realization that through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season,"" her perception of the unfamiliar has begun to change, suggesting a positive outcome for her next attempt."
290	9153	4	2	"The author's choice of conclusion serves to highlight the protagonist's determination to pass her test, which appears to involve horticultural success. The vow to retake the test ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" directly connects the assessment to the seasonal growth of plants. Given the narrative's focus on her work in the garden, the conclusion logically follows her initial failure, underscoring her commitment to try again with the coming spring."
291	9154	4	2	"The author employs this paragraph to evoke a memory from the time Saeng was planting the ""winter hibiscus,"" during which a flock of Canada geese flew overhead. Following her initial test failure, Saeng was too ashamed to face her mother. She found solace and motivation in the hibiscus, resolving that she would only attempt the test again once the flowers had re-budded, thereby concluding her cycle of dependence and resolve."
292	9155	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to encapsulate the story's central themes. It references the spring season and depicts Saeng and her mother engaging in the act of planting flowers, which serves to bring the story to a unified and peaceful close.
293	9156	4	2	In my view, the author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate a theme of perseverance. The logic is that the birds and the hibiscus will only reappear if they endure harsh conditions, symbolizing Saeng's own strength. She, too, will survive her new surroundings and adapt to the demands of her new life, demonstrating a similar resilience.
294	9157	4	2	I believe the author chose this concluding paragraph to generate suspense, making readers curious about the outcome of the test and potentially eager for a continuation of the story. This technique effectively leaves a lingering question that engages the audience's imagination.
295	9158	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to symbolize Saeng's decision to persevere and overcome her challenges. Rather than a direct statement, the author uses literary diction, contrasting the familiar hibiscus with the initially strange Canada geese, which have become familiar through seasonal repetition. This parallels Saeng's adjustment to life in America after emigrating from Vietnam, suggesting that just as she grew accustomed to the geese, she will master the driving test. The paragraph thus artistically underscores the story's central themes of resilience, adaptation, and the unwavering will to survive in a new environment.
296	9159	4	2	The author has a great fondness for plants, and with the arrival of each spring, her annual endeavor to cultivate a beautiful garden commences. The spring season is uniquely suited for growing the distinctive varieties of plants she favors. Her objective is to successfully grow a garden filled with beautiful plants and vegetables. The author intends to labor diligently, emulating the dedication of her mother, in order to bring these gardens to life, a task that feels particularly significant after the winter season has passed.
297	9160	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to express his admiration for the beauty of nature. He also suggests that because Saeng holds such a deep appreciation for nature, she is motivated to return to school and complete her test, even though she would prefer to be at home tending her garden. This final paragraph effectively serves to illustrate the author's own profound affection for the natural world.
298	9161	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the concluding paragraph functions as a symbol of new beginnings. The narrative details Saeng's experience of failure and shame following an unsuccessful driving test, and her subsequent emotional renewal upon discovering a familiar hibiscus plant. Purchasing the plant reconnects her to her homeland, and she identifies with its struggle to thrive in an unfamiliar environment. The spring season signifies the start of a new cycle, while the budding hibiscus represents the inception of a new life. In parallel, Saeng resolves to restart her own life by retaking her driving test when the plant begins its new growth."
299	9162	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its symbolism conveys a return to normalcy and a readiness for renewal. The imagery of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding signifies the re-establishment of a natural cycle. Saeng's declaration that she will ""take that test again"" within this context demonstrates her regained willingness to progress and adapt to her new circumstances."
300	9163	4	2	The author concludes with the paragraph about retaking the test to illustrate Saeng's growing acclimatization to her new environment, the enduring nature of memory, and the capacity of small objects to evoke the past. Her decision not to give up indicates her commitment to understanding local customs. The hibiscus serves as a permanent link to her memories of Vietnam, demonstrating how memories can last forever. Furthermore, just as the hibiscus can begin anew in her yard, so too can Saeng build a new life. Ultimately, the small hibiscus plant holds powerful memories that help Saeng cope, thereby confirming the themes of adaptation, enduring memory, and symbolic significance.
301	9164	4	2	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @PERSON1, a Vietnamese teenager named Saeng has relocated to the United States with her family. Following an unsuccessful driver's test attempt, Saeng encounters a recognizable plant on her walk home and subsequently enters a florist to acquire it. Upon returning home, she informs her mother of her failure, which causes some disappointment, yet her mother proceeds to prepare dinner. The story concludes with Saeng resolving to retake the test in the spring, a decision prompted by the reassurance she derives from the winter hibiscus plant and her mother's tempered reaction, fostering a sense of optimism for the future."
302	9165	4	2	The author selected this concluding line to illustrate how the natural cycles of the geese and the hibiscus plant serve as a metaphor for perseverance. The quotation, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” demonstrates that the hibiscus is the direct source of Saeng's renewed resolve. It signifies her commitment to return and try again, mirroring the inevitable return of the geese. Therefore, the author uses this line to culminate the story by showcasing Saeng's inspired state and her refusal to surrender.
303	9166	4	2	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with the specified paragraph to underscore Saeng's determination. The vow, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again,” connects her personal resolve to the perennial cycles of nature. The annual migration of geese and the budding of flowers symbolize persistence, and Saeng's pledge to return and retake the test mirrors this enduring pattern. Her determination is thus framed as an unwavering force that will ultimately lead to her passing the test and integrating into her new society."
304	9167	4	2	"The author's concluding sentence serves to highlight Saeng's emotional resilience and the hibiscus's role as a symbol of hope. Initially distraught over failing her driver's test, Saeng finds solace in a plant native to her homeland, which she gently touches, recognizing it as a ""friend."" Acquiring the plant represents bringing a piece of her home into her new life, providing emotional comfort. Her final resolution to retake the test ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" marks a significant emotional shift, indicating that the hibiscus has restored her hope and capacity for happiness in @LOCATION1."
305	9168	4	2	"The author concludes the story in this manner to reflect that Saeng requires a period of emotional adjustment before fully progressing. She plans to retake her driver's test and advance her life when the seasons turn, but until then, she will not force her development. This is evidenced by her realization that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" indicating a gradual process of acclimatization. She has grown accustomed to change and has accepted her circumstances, allowing herself to move forward at a natural pace."
306	9169	4	2	The author concludes the story with that statement because it establishes a natural order: snow does not melt until spring, geese do not return until winter, and the hibiscus does not bud until spring. The hibiscus is a beautiful plant, and Saeng loved it.
307	9170	4	2	Saeng's purchase of the hibiscus is a direct response to her failure on the driving test, which devastated her. Seeking comfort, she visits a greenhouse to find plants reminiscent of her homeland, a place where she did not face such challenges. Even within the greenhouse's warm, moist shelter, she is overwhelmed and weeps, feeling like a failure. The hibiscus offers her hope and memories of her old country, a sentiment her mother understands, which is why she does not scold Saeng for the cost and instead expresses approval. As they plant the hibiscus together, they are metaphorically planting Saeng's hope for the future. The story ends on this note to illustrate Saeng's realization that if the hibiscus can adapt and grow in a new environment, then so can she, giving her the hope and resilience to face the driving test again.
308	9171	4	2	The author communicates Saeng's unwavering determination and the anticipated growth of her confidence, enabling her to retake her test, much like the hibiscus will bloom in the spring. The comparison in the final paragraph equates Saeng's development with that of the plant, indicating she will advance and attempt the test again when conditions are favorable. The melting snow symbolizes her sorrows dissipating, while the emerging sun signifies her impending success and growth. The plant thriving in sunlight represents her burgeoning confidence for the next test, replacing the cold snow of her negative self-esteem. This concluding analogy powerfully relates the hibiscus's cycle to the transformative change in Saeng's life and attitude.
309	9172	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it effectively conveys Saeng's inner strength and perseverance. Furthermore, it provides significant insight into her character and brings the narrative to a close with a powerful and resonant tone, which justifies the author's choice of ending.
310	9173	4	2	The melting snow and the return of the geese are natural indicators that spring is approaching.
311	9174	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the protagonist's renewed confidence for a second attempt at the examination. Following her failure of the driver's test, she encounters a familiar plant during her walk home. Her subsequent inquiry at a florist regarding the plant's purchase reinforces her resolve, as she feels assured of her ability to pass the test upon her next attempt.
312	9175	4	2	The author concludes with this sentence to highlight the protagonist Saeng's courage in immigrating to a new country. After failing her driver's test, Saeng felt defeated. Her mother, rather than being upset about the purchased flower, decided to plant it, demonstrating her belief that things would improve. Witnessing this act, Saeng was filled with determination and took over the planting herself. This illustrates the daily struggles immigrants face and how her mother's example of persevering in the cold taught Saeng to adopt a similar resilient attitude, leading to her decision to retake the test.
313	9176	4	2	The connection between the story and this statement lies in the shared theme of perseverance. The protagonist's refusal to surrender after a setback is mirrored by their decision to take the test again, demonstrating a resilient spirit and a commitment to trying once more.
314	9177	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to express a sense of hopeful anticipation. The intended meaning is that, given time, Saeng will have moved past her initial failure and will be better prepared for her second attempt. The text supports this by noting how many things that once seemed strange to Saeng have since become familiar, signifying her personal growth and adaptation.
315	9178	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the transformation in Saeng's heart and attitude towards her new life. The symbolism of spring, representing rebirth, is deliberately employed. Spring will serve as Saeng's period of renewal, a time to retake the test and restart her life. The phrase ""when the snow melts"" is significant, as winter symbolizes dormancy or hardship; the melting snow parallels the dissipation of Saeng's fears, allowing for a new beginning."
316	9179	4	2	In the spring, the snow melts, revealing not a pristine landscape but a muddy terrain that is ideal for pigs, who delight in such conditions. This seasonal transformation demonstrates winter's capacity to alter the environment, just as it affects trees, which must shed their leaves to endure the cold and ultimately thrive.
317	9180	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this particular story to illustrate the protagonist's enduring resilience. This is evidenced by her growing familiarity with the migrating geese, a sound that becomes comforting to her. Furthermore, her purchase of the hibiscus, a plant imbued with memories of her homeland, serves as a tangible source of motivation. The persistence of her mother's traditional cooking, which evokes a powerful sense of nostalgia, collectively fuels her hope and reinforces her determination to persevere.
318	9181	4	2	Saeng possesses a profound affection for flowers and plants. The author's decision to conclude with this paragraph is thematically consistent with the narrative, which details Saeng's anticipation of spring's arrival after a long winter. Her appreciation for horticulture and the act of planting is a central character trait. The inclusion of this passage effectively underscores Saeng's deep-seated passion for botany and her eagerness for the winter season to conclude.
319	9182	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's emotional connection to a plant that evokes memories of her homeland. This connection is significant as it demonstrates a universal strategy for coping with life-altering changes. By purchasing and cultivating the hibiscus, Saeng creates a personal symbol of her past, which provides comfort and motivation. Specifically, the plant inspires her to retake a previously failed test in the spring, aligning her personal growth with the plant's budding cycle.
320	9183	4	2	She feels disoriented and has not yet acclimated to her new country. She believes that once the flower blooms, she will feel more at home and thus be better able to concentrate. This anticipated sense of familiarity gives her the confidence that she will perform better on her test when the time comes.
321	9184	4	2	The author concludes the narrative by explaining that the hibiscus provides her with solace. She resolves to retake the examination in the spring, a time of renewal when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This decision signifies that the comfort derived from the plant's cyclical rebirth will bolster her resolve to attempt the test again after her initial failure.
322	9185	4	2	The author ends the story by stating the protagonist's intention to retake the test upon the geese's return in spring, embodying the adage of perseverance. Furthermore, this conclusion illustrates that despite having lived in her new country for several years, the character, Saeng, continues to experience a sense of longing for her former home in Vietnam.
323	9186	4	2	She believes she will pass the test in the spring because it is a season of revitalization. Flowers bloom, trees regain their verdant color, and geese return. As animals emerge and people engage in outdoor activities like going to the beach, this general atmosphere of renewal and distraction is precisely what she seeks for her own fresh start.
324	9187	4	2	The author likely concludes with this quotation to signify the protagonist's renewed hope. After the distress of failing her driving test, the sight of the hibiscus initially deepened her emotional state and homesickness. However, upon seeing the geese after planting the flower, she makes the decision to retake the test the following spring, symbolizing a shift from despair to optimism.
325	9188	4	2	The author's concluding statement, in which Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, signifies her maturation. The passing year will allow her to grow more accustomed to her new environment, paralleling the seasonal renewal of budding plants. The initial failure was deeply upsetting, but the additional time affords her the opportunity to practice and improve her driving skills. This period represents a new beginning for Saeng; as the familiar hibiscus plant buds and starts afresh, so too will she, using its cyclical rebirth as a model for her own personal growth and renewed efforts.
326	9189	4	2	The author likely includes this paragraph to establish a symbolic parallel; the geese's return home after the snow melts coincides with Saeng's resolve to retake her test, suggesting a shared theme of renewal and a second attempt.
327	9190	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph, wherein Saeng vows to retake her test upon the geese's return in spring, illustrates her nascent readiness to adapt, albeit while acknowledging her continued need for time. The narrative charts Saeng's struggle with displacement and her initial inability to relinquish her past. Her attempts to cling to old memories are thwarted by the unfamiliarity of her new environment, a realization that culminates in her frustration upon discovering that even a familiar plant is different. Ultimately, she arrives at the understanding that difference is not inherently negative, resolving to accept the new culture while recognizing the lengthy process of adaptation that still lies ahead."
328	9191	4	2	The author ends with that paragraph because it points to a future attempt in the spring. After Saeng fails her test and tells her mother, it is reasonable to predict her mother will offer more support with both studying and gardening. With the snow melting, Saeng has made a vow to herself to work harder and pass the test this time, showing her determination to succeed.
329	9192	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to signify the moment Saeng has chosen to retake her test. Furthermore, the geese prompted her realization that many things she initially perceived as strange had, through the quiet repetition of the seasons, gradually become familiar, mirroring her own journey of acclimatization.
330	9193	4	2	The story ends with this paragraph because it signifies a new beginning. The return of the geese and the budding hibiscus represent a cyclical restart, providing Saeng with an opportunity to try again as she navigates her memories of home and her adaptation to a new country. This final thought demonstrates her resilience and her refusal to give up on her goals.
331	9194	4	2	She expressed disappointment in herself for failing to keep the tropical plant alive, which is why she made her statement. She vowed that in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud, she would take the test again. Her failure was met with her mother's reassurance that it would be okay and that she could always try again.
332	9195	4	2	In my view, the author concludes with this paragraph to communicate to both the reader and herself a renewed intention to engage with gardening, testing whether it can capture her interest. This interpretation is supported by the story's beginning, where the protagonist demonstrates no interest in the garden or her surroundings; for instance, she used money intended for seeds to buy a Big Mac instead. Therefore, this final reflection effectively conveys the author's emotional shift and the rationale behind the story's concluding sentiment.
333	9196	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, following the failure of a previous attempt. This resolution is driven by her desire to ultimately pass the examination. A significant lesson from her mother that day prompted a complete transformation in her outlook on life, reinforcing her determination.
334	9197	4	2	The author likely concluded the story with that sentence to demonstrate the character's continued concern for the test, rather than focusing solely on a plant of perceived insignificance. It underscores the necessity of passing the exam and implies a future success, avoiding another retake. Ultimately, the conclusion serves to emphasize that academic pursuits hold greater importance than other, more materialistic concerns in life.
335	9198	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes with the final paragraph to reflect the protagonist's journey. After failing a driving test, the girl returns home with a saebba hedge, a plant cherished by her family, who are newcomers from Vietnam. Her mother questions the expense of the plant over a desired Big Mac. The daughter's purchase symbolizes her remorse for failing the test and disappointing her parents. Her vow to retake the test in the spring, as the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, signifies her belief that she will pass next time, thereby honoring her family for whom driving represents a significant achievement and a marker of success in their new country."
336	9199	4	2	Saeng is clearly struggling with homesickness after her recent relocation from Vietnam. However, the narrative suggests that she will gradually learn to balance her affection for her new country with her love for her homeland. As the story progresses, Saeng is shown to cherish memories of her past while simultaneously discovering new pleasures in her present environment. For instance, she is deeply moved by the nostalgic sight of a hibiscus flower, yet she also finds herself intrigued by novel experiences such as eating a Big Mac and making new friends. Although homesickness presents a significant challenge, Saeng is confident that with time she will overcome the difficulty of integrating new ways without entirely discarding the old. She is convinced that by spring, she will have surmounted this obstacle and gained the confidence to face any future challenges that may arise.
337	9200	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to signify a transformation within her. The winter is described as brutal, yet spring represents a time of renewal and life. This seasonal metaphor illustrates Saeng's personal journey; just as one endures being tossed by harsh winter winds, she too has faced difficulties. The coming of spring symbolizes her resolve to try the test again, to come to life, and to find enjoyment in her new location despite being far from her home. The author's choice to end with this vow is an effective narrative device to underscore this theme of resilience and cyclical renewal.
338	9201	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the idea that while one may leave home, a part of them always yearns to return. The hibiscus flower serves as a potent reminder of Saeng's homeland, triggering a deep desire to go back. This is contextualized by her recent failure of a driver's test, to which she responds by vowing to try again when the geese return. The plant, however, is explicitly noted as being ""Not like the ones we had before,"" indicating that her memories of Vietnam are superior in her mind, fueling her homesickness and her longing to return to the place she misses."
339	9202	4	2	Saeng observes the cyclical nature of the seasons, focusing on how flowers return in the spring. She makes a vow to retake her test once the snow has melted, demonstrating her determination to try again. The text describes a harsh wind tearing at the last remnants of green, emphasizing the difficulty of the present winter. This contrast heightens her anticipation for spring's return, a time when she will not only retake her test but also attempt to plant again, symbolizing a new beginning and her persistent hope.
340	9203	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng is waiting for a period of natural restoration, after which she will resume her efforts. Her motivation is not to return things to an identical state as before, but to actively engage with her new life once conditions have improved. She recognizes that circumstances are not the same as they used to be, and her intention is to move forward within this new context, embracing the change rather than simply replicating the past.
341	9204	4	2	The character Saeng demonstrates a profound connection to the natural world, finding motivation in the arrival of spring, which symbolizes a new beginning and inspires her to retake a previously failed examination. The author likely concludes with this paragraph to convey a sense of hope for Saeng's future, suggesting she will find the resolve to establish comfort in her new country. While the narrative details her initial dissatisfaction with her new home, this final passage provides a resolution, using the imagery of springtime to signify the emergence of new opportunities and the start of a renewed life.
342	9205	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's potential for future acclimation to her new home. This interpretation is supported by a personal parallel; much like my own experience of initial discomfort after moving, which subsided over a year or two as I built friendships, Saeng's grief is temporary. Her continued references to her old home, such as her emotional reaction upon seeing a plant that grew there, highlight her sense of loss. The story's ending, therefore, functions to project this same trajectory of eventual adjustment for its protagonist.
343	9206	4	2	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author includes a significant vow from Saeng at the conclusion. The purpose of this declaration is to signal that as her life begins anew, paralleling the seasonal cycle, she will rediscover her capacity for happiness and contentment. This final note underscores the character's commitment to embracing her future and finding joy in her new circumstances."
344	9207	4	2	The author includes this element to illustrate the protagonist's response to her failure and to outline the necessary steps for her to achieve her goals, drawing a parallel to the determination shown by the geese in the narrative. This component of the story serves to highlight the character's resolve and the path she must take to attain success, emphasizing a theme of perseverance.
345	9208	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph for its powerful representation of new beginnings. Following her failure on a driving test, Saeng experiences a moment of profound loneliness and displacement. Her spirits are lifted upon discovering a plant that reminds her of Vietnam, a symbol of resilience her mother notes by saying its flowers, while less showy, are strong enough to survive the cold. This observation provides Saeng with a model for her own life. In the final paragraph, she resolves to emulate the hardy plant and the migrating birds, summoning the courage to confront her challenges and retake her tests, thereby embracing a fresh start.
346	9209	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to demonstrate the protagonist's resolve not to surrender to adversity, a determination she also wishes to convey to her mother. This final segment serves to underscore her commitment to perseverance."
347	9210	4	2	I believe the author was conveying the theme of a new beginning. This interpretation is supported by the imagery of nature's cyclical return and, more significantly, by Saeng's newfound clarity regarding her priorities and her solemn commitment to them. This constitutes the central message the author intended to impart at the story's conclusion.
348	9211	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young girl named Saeng and her mother relocate to a new country, where Saeng struggles to adapt. She discovers a plant, the dok faeng-noi, which evokes memories of her homeland. After purchasing it, she brings it home to her mother, who is initially displeased by the cost. However, upon sensing her daughter's dejection, the mother finds solace in the plant's beauty. As her mother cooks dinner, Saeng plants the hibiscus and resolves that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds in spring, she will retake her test. This moment signifies Saeng discovering an inner strength and courage to improve. The author's intent was to illustrate how Saeng ultimately cultivated self-respect, which is why the passage concludes on this particular note."
349	9212	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it encapsulates the narrative's central theme. The story details how Saeng's longing for home, triggered by purchasing the hibiscus, contributed to her failing a test. The flower's connection to her past made her sad. In the final paragraph, she resolves that by the time the geese return in spring, she will have acclimated to her new country. She will no longer fail a test because she will have learned to manage the melancholy associated with reminders of her old home, demonstrating her process of adjusting to her new environment, which is the story's main idea.
350	9213	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author employs the concluding paragraph to provide a thematic summary of the entire narrative. This technique also serves to leave the reader with a sense of lingering contemplation."
351	9214	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, thereby illustrating that her failure has not extinguished her resolve but rather strengthened her determination to persevere. This resolution effectively conveys the protagonist's inner fortitude, demonstrating her capacity to continue striving for both herself and her grandmother despite the setback. The ending is a commendable narrative choice that successfully underscores the theme of resilience.
352	9215	4	2	Saeng's failure on her driving test, compounded by her relocation to a new country and the loss of her grandmother, created a period of significant difficulty. The hibiscus plant functions as a potent symbol within the story, representing her former life in Vietnam and evoking a flood of memories. These recollections highlight her emotional journey of new beginnings and overcoming adversity. Her declaration to retake the test when the hibiscus buds signifies a personal renewal and an ability to endure hard times, symbolized by winter, ultimately representing her own capacity to surmount hardship.
353	9216	4	2	The story's concluding paragraph demonstrates how Saeng persists through her hardships, striving for normality after her move. Her silent vow to retake the test in the spring serves as a key example, conveying that one should never surrender after a single failure, yet also should not entirely disregard the past. This moment encapsulates the story's message of resilient perseverance.
354	9217	4	2	"In ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho concludes with a paragraph rich in symbolic meaning. Saeng's resolution to retake her test in the spring signifies her commitment to moving forward and overcoming her failure. The season of spring itself symbolizes a new beginning, a concept mirrored by the budding hibiscus, which represents the start of a new life cycle—paralleling Saeng's own decision to start anew. Furthermore, Saeng's purchase of the hibiscus, a familiar plant, alongside the returning geese, provides a comforting link to her homeland, aiding her adaptation. Ho uses this final paragraph to powerfully emphasize Saeng's overall process of adaptation to her new life."
355	9218	4	2	The author concludes with that paragraph to convey Saeng's decision to try again. She aligns her own renewal with the natural cycle of the hibiscus plant, indicating that she, like the flower, requires time to bloom and prepare for her next attempt.
356	9219	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrative concludes with Saeng resolving to retake the test in the spring. This conclusion is significant as it illustrates Saeng's progression beyond her initial sorrow, aligning her renewed determination with the seasonal blooming of the hibiscus. Her distress is evident upon failing the test, an event that compounds her grief over leaving her homeland. However, her subsequent vow, articulated as “in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” demonstrates a pivotal shift toward resilience and forward-looking resolve. This final sentiment effectively conveys her emotional recovery and her commitment to persevere."
357	9220	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow: “when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.” This device functions to illustrate Saeng's process of adapting to change while retaining a connection to her origins. The symbolism of the geese and the hibiscus is central to this meaning; the geese represent the new environment and its unfamiliar sounds to which Saeng must acclimatize, while the hibiscus symbolizes her memories and connection to her homeland. The conjunction of these symbols signifies her acceptance of both her past and present circumstances. Her decision to retake the test in the spring signifies her readiness to embrace change, as the test itself represents her feelings toward her new location, and succeeding at it would symbolize her successful adjustment to the transformations in her life.
358	9221	4	2	The author employs this concluding sentence to illustrate that the budding flower makes Saeng feel at home once more, providing her with the fortitude to attempt the test again. The hibiscus evokes a sense of fortune and reconnects her with memories of her homeland, which is why Saeng makes a silent vow to herself. This connection to her past grants her the confidence and emotional support needed to face her future challenges, culminating in her resolution to try again.
359	9222	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow: “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This ending serves to highlight the numerous hardships and obstacles Saeng has endured, with the primary challenges being her relocation to a new country and her failure on a crucial arrival test. These events presented significant difficulties for her to overcome. The final sentence is positioned to provide readers with a sense of closure and assurance that Saeng will ultimately be alright, demonstrating her capacity to move past her struggles. The special plant, the hibiscus, is thus established as a source of support that will aid her in confronting future problems with greater resilience.
360	9223	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding quote, wherein Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring alongside the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, is deliberately placed to establish a tone of hope. For instance, the narrative describes Saeng tenderly planting the hibiscus, an action that reveals the plant's profound significance to her. The story clarifies that the hibiscus evokes cherished memories of her grandmother. Consequently, the plant becomes a symbol of hope for Saeng, as these happy recollections motivate her to overcome her sense of loss. Therefore, the quote provides an effective conclusion by centering on Saeng's yearning for hope and inner peace, representing the anticipation that the plant's spring bloom will bring her a renewed sense of optimism and contentment."
361	9224	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the narrative centers on Saeng's transition to a new country and her inner resilience. After failing her driving test, a disappointed Saeng walks home and stops at a florist, where she encounters a plant reminiscent of one from her homeland. This discovery triggers a flood of memories, reinforcing her connection to her past. Upon returning home, she plants it and resolves to retake the driving test when the geese return, drawing encouragement from the plant's enduring presence."
362	9225	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore the theme of cyclical renewal in nature. The narrative focuses on the protagonist's growing acceptance of recurring natural patterns, and the final paragraph serves to affirm her commitment to persevere through these cycles. This structural choice effectively reinforces the central idea that with each repetition of events, her resolve will remain steadfast, thereby providing a coherent and resonant conclusion to the story.
363	9226	4	2	It is possible the author included this element because the character may have failed an endeavor and requires additional time to study or prepare in order to achieve her objectives. Beyond that primary reason, other motivations for the author's choice remain unclear from the provided text. This interpretation, while speculative, offers a plausible explanation for the narrative development based on the limited information available.
364	9227	4	2	The author employs this concluding sentence to illustrate the restoration of Saeng's hope. Throughout the narrative, Saeng grapples with sadness and longing for her homeland, feeling a sense of hopelessness in her new environment. The hibiscus serves as a potent reminder of home, evoking memories of her grandmother and intensifying her desire to return. The mention of the geese departing symbolizes their own necessary departure from home. Ultimately, the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's inherent strength and her capacity to endure the challenges of relocating to an unfamiliar land.
365	9228	4	2	I believe the author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's unwavering determination and refusal to surrender. Her memories of her native country collectively serve to fortify her resilience. For instance, while the flower initially evoked sadness, it ultimately contributed to her emotional recovery. Furthermore, although she initially resisted new changes and yearned for home, she eventually discovers comforting echoes of her past within her new country. These factors substantiate my view regarding the author's rationale for the story's concluding paragraph.
366	9229	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph serves to illustrate a parallel between the resilience of the hibiscus plant and the protagonist's own fortitude. The narrative establishes that if the plant possesses the strength to endure harsh conditions and flourish once more, then Saeng can similarly muster the resolve to retake her examination after an initial failure. This connection is substantiated by the textual evidence describing the plant's capacity to survive the cold months. Consequently, both Saeng and the hibiscus are characterized by a shared, profound resilience that enables them to persevere through adversity."
367	9230	4	2	"The story draws a compelling parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus plant, focusing on their mutual capacity for adaptation. Saeng's declaration, ""Then I will take that test again,"" functions as her personal commitment to thrive, mirroring the perennial nature of the plant. This analogy suggests that, much like the hibiscus which adapts to seasonal changes and returns, Saeng will continue to persevere and flourish through the various challenges in her life for many seasons to come."
368	9231	4	2	The author concludes the story with the final paragraph to signify a thematic shift aligned with the arrival of spring. The return of the geese and the new season symbolizes a renewal of hope for Saeng. This change in her environment provides her with the improved self-assurance needed to refocus her efforts and make another attempt at the test, thereby completing her character's arc from disappointment to determination.
369	9232	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph is integral to the narrative's structure. The story follows Saeng as she searches for a plant that evokes memories of her grandmother. Upon finding the hibiscus, she is overwhelmed with emotion, suggesting a test of her ability to move forward—a test she initially fails. The purchase of the plant, therefore, represents her resolve to try again, aligning her personal growth with the plant's eventual blooming and providing a cyclical conclusion to her journey."
370	9233	4	2	The story encourages the reader to adopt the resilient spirit of the hibiscus, which demonstrates a tenacious will to live by fighting against its environment. The author uses the final paragraph to convey that one must not be afraid of failure but must persistently pursue one's goals to achieve success. This purpose is realized through Saeng's decision to retake her test, an action that mirrors the hibiscus's inevitable budding with the coming of spring, thus concluding the narrative on a note of hopeful perseverance.
371	9234	4	2	Saeng made a silent vow that upon their return in the spring, when the hibiscus would be budding, she would take the test again. The author likely concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's renewed determination to face her challenges, using the cyclical return of the geese and the budding flower as symbols for her own opportunity to try again.
372	9235	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to create a cyclical structure, mirroring the story's beginning where the young girl was observing flowers. This framing device provides a sense of completion. Furthermore, it reinforces the idea that Saeng's connection with the plants, a source of comfort during difficult times, will be renewed in the spring when everything blooms beautifully, which is the central reason for this concluding imagery.
373	9236	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph serves to convey a message of personal renewal. Observing the geese fading into the distance prompts Saeng to reflect on her own journey. Her vow to retake the test upon the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding symbolizes a new beginning. The budding hibiscus represents Saeng's ongoing growth, while the spring season functions as an archetype of rebirth, signifying that just as nature renews itself, so too will Saeng embark on a new phase of her life."
374	9237	4	2	Saeng vowed that with the spring budding of the hibiscus, she would retake the test. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope, assuring her that a second attempt can succeed. The author concludes with this vow to express Saeng's enduring hope; the plant has comforted her in a new country and reflects her inner feelings. Her pledge demonstrates a refusal to surrender after an initial failure, a resolve underscored by the intense, visceral recognition she felt upon seeing the hibiscus, which is why the story ends on this note of determination.
375	9238	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's resolve. Having left much behind in Vietnam, including memories of her grandmother and the hibiscus, her family now struggles in their new location. The purchased hibiscus provides solace, and Saeng reasons that if the plant can endure a harsh winter, she too can persevere despite the challenges of her new environment. Passing the driver's exam, a common rite of passage, represents her specific goal for adapting and fitting into her new surroundings.
376	9239	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this sentence to illustrate the protagonist's resolve to surmount challenges. Despite a prior failure, she remains committed to persevering. This conclusion also forges a symbolic link between the geese, the hibiscus, and the girl's own determination to overcome her personal obstacles, which she intends to confront at a specific, significant time.
377	9240	4	2	In the final paragraph, the character decides to retake the test in the spring, once the snow has melted and the hibiscus buds. She chooses this season because it is her favorite time of year, a period when she feels most confident. Her admiration for the resilient Madagascar hibiscus, which can grow through bricks, underscores her desire to undertake this challenge when she is at her best, thereby maximizing her chances for success.
378	9241	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to characterize Saeng as a survivor, paralleling the resilience of the hibiscus plant. Having struggled to adapt to life in America, Saeng finds a connection to her homeland in this plant, which symbolizes endurance and the capacity to thrive in a new environment, thus providing a poignant and resonant ending to her story.
379	9242	4	2	The author selects this conclusion because spring symbolizes renewal and new beginnings. Following her failure, Saeng aspires to begin again in the spring, much like the flowers that re-emerge. The knowledge that the currently dormant hibiscus will regrow reinforces this theme of cyclical regeneration, where spring represents a universal time for fresh starts, blossoming flora, and the birth of new life.
380	9243	4	2	The author concludes in this manner to demonstrate Saeng's determined character; she persistently attempts to succeed despite repeated failures. This illustrates her belief that one must persevere through any challenge until the goal is achieved. Her difficult transition, marked by struggles to communicate and make friends, was a significant obstacle. However, with time and effort, she adapted, conveying the author's ultimate message that continued effort is the path to success.
381	9244	4	2	In the narrative, a young girl named Saeng fails a test but resolves to retake it the following spring. The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to try again when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This specific reference to the hibiscus flowering is a symbolic way of denoting the arrival of spring, the season in which she has chosen to make another attempt. The ending thus connects her personal resolve to the natural cycle of renewal.
382	9245	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to inform the reader of Saeng's intention to retake the test. Her affection for her garden is a central element, suggesting that the promise of spring's return, a season of significance to her, will ensure she does not forget her commitment to try again. This connection between her personal resolve and the natural world provides a complete and hopeful conclusion.
383	9246	4	2	The text clearly illustrates her deep affection for her plants. It provides detailed descriptions of the various flora and conveys her particular fondness for them. She perceives each plant as unique and derives a greater sense of enjoyment from them than from her academic pursuits or other activities. This establishes her botanical interests as a primary and defining passion.
384	9247	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes ""The Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's determination to succeed in her new country despite facing obstacles. The winter hibiscus serves as a metaphor for resilience, reminding Saeng to be strong enough to endure her own challenges, such as passing her driving test. The text explicitly draws this parallel, stating the plant is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" Saeng also recognizes her own gradual adaptation to the unfamiliar environment, as she finds previously strange things becoming familiar. This realization, coupled with the symbolism of the hardy plant, fuels her resolve. The author's conclusion, with Saeng vowing to retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus buds, positions the coming season as a symbol of her impending success and renewed beginning."
385	9248	4	2	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with the final paragraph to draw a parallel between the flower's revival and Saeng's new beginning. For instance, the comment on the plant being ""root-bound"" indicates it was near death when purchased, just as Saeng feels defeated after failing her test. Both the flower and Saeng reach a low point, a ""breaking point."" The concluding paragraph signifies that Saeng will pause and draw strength, waiting until the hibiscus has grown stronger in the spring, which is when she, too, will be ready to attempt the test again, symbolizing a shared cycle of renewal and perseverance."
386	9249	4	2	The author included the final paragraph because Saeng's vow allows the reader to understand both her current pain and her optimism for a better future. The vow, interpreted as a belief that life will improve when it normalizes in her new country, employs potent symbolism. Spring represents a return to normalcy, reminiscent of her homeland's flower-filled beauty. The melting snow signifies her pain subsiding, while the returning geese reinforce her certainty that conditions will improve, just as the seasons change. The hibiscus, a recurring symbol of her home and grandmother, embodies the happiness she anticipates will return as her situation becomes more favorable.
387	9250	4	2	The author chose to conclude the story with this sentence to illustrate Saeng's dual resolve: she is determined to retake the test while also wishing for her hibiscus to remain resilient and continue its growth. Her statement, that she will take the test again when the hibiscus blooms, connects her personal goal to the natural cycle of the plant, showing that her own renewal is tied to its flourishing.
388	9251	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author explores the universal quest for acceptance and adaptation to life's changes. The protagonist, Saeng, is a young girl grappling with her recent relocation from Asia to America. Following a failed test, she invests a considerable sum in a flower, prompting a reflective conversation with her mother. It is here that Saeng makes a silent vow: she will retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and her hibiscus buds. The author selects this conclusion to underscore the narrative's central theme of adaptation. Through this vow, Saeng demonstrates her acceptance of her new American home, while simultaneously acknowledging the enduring memory of her homeland, thus completing her character's arc."
389	9252	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph because the protagonist has formed an attachment to the plant and utilizes its blooming cycle as a temporal marker for when she can retake the examination. This is necessitated by a regulation stating that non-U.S. citizens are permitted to take the driver's test only once per year, making the plant's growth a natural calendar for her goal.
390	9253	4	2	"The author ends the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's commitment to self-betterment. This interpretation is supported by the phrase ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" which indicates a deeply personal promise to pursue what is most beneficial for her own future and well-being, concluding her internal journey on a note of determined optimism."
391	9254	4	2	"Saeng interprets her failure on the driving test as an impediment to successfully transitioning to a new country, prompting her to seek solace in her past. She discovers this connection through plants, which evoke powerful memories of Vietnam and a profound sense of sorrow. The narration describes ""a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes,"" illustrating her intense longing for her former life, her grandmother, and her homeland. Upon returning home with an expensive plant, she disappoints her mother, who nevertheless understands her pain, remarking sadly, ""It's a beautiful plant."" Ultimately, Saeng recognizes the hibiscus's resilience and its ability to thrive, which inspires her to make a personal vow to attempt the driving test again once the plant buds, symbolizing her own capacity for renewal and adaptation."
392	9255	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph, where Saeng vows to retake her driving test in the spring when the hibiscus buds, serves to emphasize a parallel between her and the natural world. The author suggests that if a plant symbolizing her home can survive and flourish in a new environment, so too can Saeng. Following her failed test, a walk home leads her to flowers that trigger a deep connection to her past, mitigating her isolation. The text notes, ""A wave of loss so deep & strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes,"" confirming how these botanical reminders evoke intense homesickness. Similarly, the migrating geese, forming a ""distinctive V against the sky,"" represent adaptation and seasonal return, mirroring Saeng's own potential for change and resilience in her new surroundings. The ending thus powerfully contrasts her attachment to her hometown with her burgeoning hope for life in her new town."
393	9256	4	2	The author concludes the narrative by drawing a comparison to the themes of adaptation and perseverance. The geese, for instance, depart with the cold but reliably return, demonstrating a persistent commitment to their home. Similarly, the hibiscus plant consistently buds in the spring, enduring the winter without perishing. Saeng internalizes this cyclical pattern of resilience and renewal, recognizing that just as the natural world persists, so can she. This realization motivates her vow to attempt the driving test again, embodying the story's central message of refusing to surrender in the face of adversity. The conclusion effectively communicates that persistence, like the returning seasons, can lead to future success.
394	9257	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph is underpinned by the themes of determination, support, and inner strength. Firstly, determination is a primary reason Saeng resolves to retake the test; her initial failure only fuels her resolve to prepare differently and succeed. Secondly, the concept of support is crucial, as Saeng looks to the hibiscus plant as a symbolic source of aid that will help her pass the test and navigate other challenges, illustrating her belief in external encouragement. Finally, strength is the last key element, with the plant representing the fortitude Saeng believes she will need to return to the test stronger than before. The author selected this ending to clearly demonstrate Saeng's committed and reinforced resolve to try again.
395	9258	4	2	"Mingfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's silent vow to retake her driving test in the spring, coinciding with the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus. This final paragraph underscores Saeng's refusal to surrender in her struggle to adapt to a new country after enduring hardships, including her relocation and the recent failure of her driver's test, which reduced her to tears in a greenhouse. The hibiscus plant, though a significant financial burden for her family, holds profound importance for Saeng as an emblem of hope. Its cyclical budding signifies the opportune moment for her to try again, while its own adaptation to a new garden parallels Saeng's ongoing process of acclimatizing to the United States, symbolizing resilience and the capacity for new growth."
396	9259	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's transformation. Initially lacking confidence and reluctant to retake the test, Saeng is consistently supported by her mother, who even understands her purchase of a plant reminiscent of their homeland. Having received this comfort, Saeng feels more at ease and is now prepared to face the test again with renewed confidence, signifying her personal change.
397	9260	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph, featuring Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, serves to underscore the theme of maintaining faith. Saeng's persistent homesickness likely impaired her performance on the initial driving test. By waiting a season, her melancholy would likely dissipate, allowing her to focus on her objective. The emotional weight of missing her grandmother and Vietnam undoubtedly affected her. Furthermore, this ending elevates the mood from the melancholy of her breakdown in the greenhouse to a more hopeful outlook for her future endeavors.
398	9261	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that Saeng's inability to concentrate during the test stemmed from a profound longing to return to her home country, which ultimately prevented her from succeeding.
399	9262	4	2	The author likely chose this conclusion to indicate that Saeng will return to assist her mother, perhaps discovering an affinity for gardening. Having recognized the value of helping, she may now be inclined to support her mother with a greater number of tasks, suggesting a positive development in her character and willingness to contribute.
400	9263	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's resolution to retake her test when the hibiscus buds, a decision that thematically unifies the narrative. The story chronicles her search for a flower and the memories it evokes, a journey instigated by her test failure. This creates a coherent link between the test and the hibiscus, highlighting the flower's symbolic importance. Both Saeng and the hibiscus are displaced—Saeng from Vietnam and the flower from its natural habitat—and must adapt to survive in a new environment. Saeng is analogous to the flower; just as it must endure the harsh winter, she must adapt to her new home. Witnessing the hibiscus survive will assure her of her own capacity to endure and thrive in her new location, thereby strengthening her resolve and focus."
401	9264	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" in which Saeng vows to retake her driver's test in the spring, serves to introduce a note of hope into an otherwise melancholic narrative. This resolution suggests the protagonist's eventual acceptance of her new environment and her determination to progress beyond her profound homesickness. The budding hibiscus, planted as a symbol of resilience, represents the promise of a new beginning and Saeng's refusal to succumb to despair, thereby allowing the story to end on an affirmative and forward-looking theme."
402	9265	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring to create a sense of anticipation. This device leaves the reader contemplating her future resolve rather than focusing on her past failures. The promise is intrinsically linked to the natural cycle of the hibiscus plant's rebirth, symbolizing her own commitment to try again when conditions are more favorable, which provides a purposeful and meaningful conclusion to her character's arc.
403	9266	4	2	The author chooses to conclude the narrative with this specific paragraph to provide the story with a positive and uplifting resolution. This ending effectively shifts the tone from one of difficulty to one of hopefulness, offering a satisfying emotional closure for the reader. By concluding on this optimistic note, the narrative ensures that the overall message is one of perseverance and future promise.
404	9267	4	2	The author ends with this paragraph to illustrate how the hibiscus and the migrating geese inspire Saeng's sense of potential accomplishment. The hibiscus serves as a tangible connection to cherished memories of her grandmother and her homeland, grounding her in a positive personal history. Simultaneously, the geese embody resilience and successful adaptation, as they instinctively journey to a better environment. These combined symbols empower Saeng, making her believe that she, too, can overcome her challenges and succeed in her new life.
405	9268	4	2	The author utilizes the final paragraph to provide a definitive conclusion to the story's central conflict. Its purpose is to offer the reader clarity regarding the protagonist's future intentions and emotional state, thereby resolving the narrative arc. This concluding segment ensures that the audience understands the outcome and the character's resolved determination, delivering a complete and coherent ending to the literary work.
406	9269	4	2	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to provide an optimistic resolution. Saeng's central conflict is a profound ""wave of loss"" stemming from her memories of her homeland. The story chronicles her difficult struggle to find happiness in a new, foreign, and seemingly hostile country, a feeling exacerbated by her failure on a test. Following this tale of melancholy, the author demonstrates Saeng's newfound confidence and optimism through the concluding paragraph, thereby concluding the narrative on a hopeful note."
407	9270	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to convey the protagonist's resilience and determination, signaling to the reader that she is not defeated by her setback and is resolved to retake the test and succeed.
408	9271	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify the character's adaptation to her new home and to present her final, resolute thoughts to the reader. The concluding sentiment, which looks forward to spring when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, serves as a powerful final statement. It is within this context of renewal that the character declares her intention to take the test again, bringing the narrative to a close on a note of hopeful determination.
409	9272	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph appears to be an attempt to elicit a reaction or interpretation from the reader, though the specific intent remains ambiguous and lacks a clear, substantive purpose within the narrative's framework.
410	9273	4	2	This concluding statement reflects that snow has covered the garden, and its eventual melting will necessitate replanting. This serves as a fitting end to the story, which discusses the blossoming of flowers in spring and Saeng's mother cultivating a garden. The snowfall signifies a period of waiting until spring returns, during which Saeng has ample time to plan for the coming season, a time marked by the budding hibiscus and the return of the geese.
411	9274	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph with the story to convey that Saeng has resolved to retake the test upon the hibiscus's next bloom. Until that time, she feels profoundly out of place and uncomfortable within her current circumstances, believing she will only be capable of success once she is re-established in a familiar and harmonious environment.
412	9275	4	2	The author employs this concluding paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's resilience, demonstrating that she will return to a significant place and will not succumb to grief over her losses, but will instead confront and adapt to the changes she faces.
413	9276	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to draw a parallel between the seasonal cycle and Saeng's emotional state; just as plants die in the snow and return with the spring thaw, the geese, and the budding hibiscus, so too will she await the spring to see her garden—and her own life—renewed. This ending is fitting because gardening has been Saeng's primary solace since her family moved to the United States, where their shared happiness has been rooted in moments spent together, such as having dinner and planting, which have been the most cherished times of their lives.
414	9277	4	2	For anyone who has relocated from their homeland, the comfort derived from an object connecting the old country to the new one is profound. Saeng found such solace in the geese and plants, which reassured her that she could attempt the test again in the spring. Throughout the narrative, every reminder of her native Vietnam provided Saeng with warmth and comfort. This is evident early on as she navigates the greenhouse, and her affection is consistently audible when she refers to plants by their native names. The story perpetually conveys her deep love and care for these elements, and the author, recognizing their encouraging power, logically chose to conclude the story on this resonant note.
415	9278	4	2	The author concludes with this story due to the symbolic potential of the hibiscus. Despite having previously failed the test, Saeng is determined to retake it. Her situation mirrors that of the hibiscus, which appears out of place yet is resolved to survive the winter and bloom again. Thus, Saeng will use the hibiscus as her motivation to try again.
416	9279	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, a device intended to underscore the profound bond between the mother and daughter, which is cultivated through their shared engagement with gardening. The portrayal of the relationship between Saeng and her mother is particularly effective, demonstrating a deep and resonant connection. The story itself is compelling, maintaining a sense of anticipation regarding the protagonist's future. The depiction of the母女's supportive friendship is a notable strength, illustrating their close and understanding dynamic. Furthermore, the author's approach reveals a thoughtful and skilled narrative style, successfully telling the moving story of a girl and her mother who have immigrated from Vietnam to @ORGANIZATION1 to build a new life.
417	9280	4	2	Several plausible reasons exist for the author's chosen conclusion. Saeng's motivation to pass the test could stem from a desire to please her mother, a practical need for a driver's license in the coming year, or the financial burden of repeated attempts. Her affection for the hibiscus, however, remains a significant and separate emotional detail within this context.
418	9281	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph functions to illustrate Saeng's resolute character. The imagery is deeply symbolic; the return of the geese coincides with her decision to retry the test, contrasting with her initial failure upon their departure. The melting snow and budding hibiscus signify spring, a conventional metaphor for renewal and fresh beginnings. This final segment serves as an emblem of starting anew. Evidence of Saeng's distress, such as her stuttered admission of failure, justifies the temporal delay before her next attempt. Ultimately, the author uses this conclusion to affirm Saeng's inner strength and her commitment to a new start.
419	9282	4	2	In my view, the author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng discovered a sense of solace through the flower, which renewed her determination to persevere. Initially disheartened by her failure, the sight of the hibiscus—a poignant reminder of her homeland—elevated her spirits. While memories of her grandmother evoked sadness, the profound significance and comfort she derived from the flower ultimately prevailed. I believe this provides a positive and effective resolution to the story.
420	9283	4	2	I believe the author concludes with this paragraph to leave the reader with a sense of hope. Saeng's plan to retake the test she failed indicates her resilience. As she struggles to adjust to a new life, the decision to wait for the snow to melt, the geese to return, and the hibiscus to bud allows her the necessary time for adaptation and emotional recovery. This final passage powerfully conveys Saeng's courage and hopeful outlook toward her future attempt.
421	9284	4	2	The precise reason remains uncertain. It is possible she now feels a sense of security. Alternatively, this may constitute a psychological trial that is universally encountered. The return of migratory geese and the budding of flora could also function as a metaphorical examination, representing cycles of challenge and renewal.
422	9285	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph effectively conveys themes of acceptance and determination. Saeng's profound connection to the hibiscus plant stems from its representation of her homeland and the life she relinquished. The final imagery is rich with symbolism: the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus all signify a period of rebirth and new beginnings. Saeng's resolve to retake her driver's test demonstrates that obstacles can be surmounted and aspirations ultimately realized.
423	9286	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to align with the protagonist's deep connection to nature. The girl is profoundly invested in flowers, plants, and animals, with a specific fondness for the Madagascar periwinkle. The environment of her former home was abundant with various plants, animals, and flowers, making this natural conclusion a fitting reflection of her character and past experiences.
424	9287	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with a paragraph that powerfully conveys the protagonist's emotional state. The text reveals Saeng's determination to pass her driver's test, as evidenced by her declaration to retake it upon the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus. This illustrates her refusal to let an initial failure deter her. Furthermore, her reflections on the natural elements show no regret in purchasing the plant, instead linking it to a sense of hope and seasonal renewal that strengthens her resolve."
425	9288	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" in this manner to establish a sense of hope for Saeng's future. Her dejection after failing her driver's test is mirrored by the bleak winter landscape, where the wind strips away the last vestiges of green, symbolizing her despair. The hibiscus plant, described as strong enough to survive the cold, becomes a symbol of Saeng's own resilience. Her observation of the geese leads to the realization that familiarity grows through the quiet repetition of seasons, confirming her adjustment to her new home and her hopeful anticipation for the renewal that spring will bring."
426	9289	4	2	Her primary objective in hunting was to capture geese, a goal inspired by observing her grandparents' own attempts. This motivation directly informed her final declaration.
427	9290	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to underscore the protagonist's resilience and refusal to surrender. This is evidenced by Saeng's admission of failure, ""I-I failed the test,"" which conveys her initial sense of defeat. Her subsequent resolution, ""I will take that test again,"" serves to characterize her as a person of determination who will not be deterred by a single setback."
428	9291	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the concluding paragraph aligns with the spring season to symbolize Saeng's growing acclimation to her new environment. The text notes that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" indicating her gradual adaptation over time. Furthermore, the image of geese flying in a ""distinctive V"" against the sky connects her to memories of her homeland, reinforcing the theme of finding familiarity within a new setting."
429	9292	4	2	The story details Saeng's forced adaptation after moving from Vietnam to the United States, where various elements trigger memories of her former life. The final paragraph synthesizes these symbols—the hibiscus, the geese, the changing seasons—to demonstrate her resolve to continue striving, such as by retaking her driving test, and ultimately adapt. This conclusion reinforces the story's central themes of change and adaptation, shifting the narrative tone from regret to optimism by showing how memories of home can fuel hope for the future in a new country.
430	9293	4	2	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, a decision that highlights her profound connection to nature. This characterization is supported by her gentle actions, such as carefully picking up a fallen blossom to smell it. Similarly, her delicate handling of the plant, ""deftly easing the ball of soil out,"" further illustrates her caring and respectful attitude toward living things. The concluding paragraph therefore serves to solidify the portrayal of Saeng as a person who is deeply attentive and nurturing toward the natural world."
431	9294	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to elucidate the symbolic significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus holds profound importance for Saeng, representing her cultural heritage. When hibiscus flowers are present, Saeng feels empowered and capable of achieving any goal. This connection explains her initial failure on the test, as she lacked this source of strength. Consequently, she resolves that during her next attempt, she will draw upon the fortitude provided by the hibiscus to succeed.
432	9295	4	2	This demonstrates that Saeng has not surrendered and intends to strive diligently to adapt and prosper in her new country. It concludes a sorrowful narrative on a hopeful note. The hibiscus, like the spring season, serves as a symbol of hope; this element transforms the entire story. Without this concluding part, the tale would be one of sadness, but with it, the story becomes one of optimism. The narrative's structure presents this moment as a turning point, offering a resolution that suggests a new beginning rather than a definitive end.
433	9296	4	2	The author concludes the passage with this phrase to illustrate that after experiencing heartache and confusion, Saeng understands that adjustment requires time. She realizes she will be prepared to heal and begin anew, given sufficient time, a process mirrored by the plant's own cycle of growth and renewal.
434	9297	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to establish a future objective for the protagonist. Saeng is determined to pass the test and will exert considerable effort to achieve this goal the following year. For instance, while her mother's anger over the failure was transient, Saeng herself did not forget the setback. She made a vow to the hibiscus, a plant for which she holds deep affection and is willing to strive, channeling that dedication toward her future success.
435	9298	4	2	The author concludes the passage with this sentence to underscore the principle that perseverance is essential for success. Saeng will adapt to her new country over time, but this will not occur if she dwells on returning to her homeland. The hibiscus acts as a symbol of new beginnings and societal adaptation for her. Saeng plans to retake her driver's test when the plant re-buds, marking the start of a new life cycle and mirroring her own renewed efforts.
436	9299	4	2	She states that she will retake the test in the spring after the snow melts. During the examination, she will observe the geese and the budding hibiscus, drawing comfort from them in her effort to pass.
437	9300	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's feelings. She felt a connection to the geese and the hibiscus as she watched their distinctive forms become almost familiar. She has resolved to retake the test in the spring, believing the presence of the hibiscus will provide her with the comfort and confidence needed to succeed.
438	9301	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph illustrates how the hibiscus flower profoundly impacted Saeng, granting her newfound courage and strength. After failing her driver's test, Saeng experiences an intense, visceral shock of recognition upon seeing the flower, revealing a deep connection that guides her. She later visits a flower shop and identifies blossoms from her childhood, reinforcing this link to her past and bolstering her courage to adapt. Furthermore, listening to her mother discuss the hardy hibiscus leads Saeng to realize that things once strange were becoming familiar, and that she, like the flower, could survive in her new environment. In this manner, the hibiscus serves as a source of support and resilience for Saeng.
439	9302	4	2	Saeng vowed silently that she would retake the test in the spring, when the snow melted, the geese returned, and the hibiscus budded. On her trip home, she observed a world of contrasts: the soil was cold and hard, yet she then entered a hot, moist world exploding with greenery where plants grew in random profusion. There, she discovered an old friend—a small shrub with waxy leaves and a dainty flower featuring purplish petals and a white center. By the time she reached home at dusk, the wind was tearing the last green remnants from the chicory weeds growing through the sidewalk cracks, concluding a journey where she encountered many unfamiliar things.
440	9303	4	2	The author includes this to illustrate a resolute determination to pass the test regardless of the circumstances, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to the goal.
441	9304	4	2	The author likely concludes the story in this manner to illustrate the protagonist's confidence that the flower's bloom signifies her readiness to pass the test. This particular flower held profound significance in her homeland and continues to do so, serving as a source of hope and personal pride. Her memories of gathering the blossoms with her grandmother and adorning her hair with them are deeply cherished. Consequently, the sight of the flower evokes thoughts of her grandmother, which in turn motivates her perseverance. Just as the flower is resilient enough to endure winter conditions, the girl is equally determined to succeed when it blooms, viewing this natural event as a parallel to her own fortitude.
442	9305	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus buds because she wished to cultivate the plant during winter. Having failed her initial attempt, she sought redemption on her second try. To avoid repeating her failure, she altered her approach, tending to the hibiscus with great care and firmly patting the soil around it. This act of nurturing the plant symbolizes her renewed commitment and the deliberate effort she will apply to her own preparation, which is why the author selected this paragraph for the conclusion.
443	9306	4	2	The girl's declaration that she will retake the test when the hibiscus blooms indicates her longing for her native country and a desire to maintain a connection to it. Taking the test as the plant flowers is akin to receiving support from her homeland. The plant symbolically mirrors her personal development; its initial inability to thrive in the new climate parallels her own incomplete adaptation to her environment. Just as the hibiscus must wait for the appropriate season to bloom, the girl recognizes she must wait for the right moment, marked by the flower's bloom, to successfully attempt the test again, signifying her own growth and readiness.
444	9307	4	2	"Saeng's statement, ""then I will take that test again,"" encapsulates her primary objective throughout the narrative, which was to pass the examination. However, her initial failure served as a pivotal moment that unified the story's elements. In her search for solace, she sought out the ""Malik,"" an encounter that revived potent memories of her life ""back home,"" memories that sustained her. This experience also fostered a deeper bond with her mother and instilled a renewed sense of hope for her future in a new country. This newfound hope is what ultimately empowers her to vow to retake the test with the return of spring and the budding of the hibiscus."
445	9308	4	2	The author selected this sentence to conclude the story because it provides an effective resolution. It serves as a strong closing by clearly stating the protagonist's future intentions. This is successful as it demonstrates that Saeng has reached the realization that she must undertake the test again, despite her profound affinity for the natural world, thereby concluding her character's arc with a sense of determined purpose.
446	9309	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve to attempt the test again. It demonstrates that Saeng was not giving up; instead, she intended to retake the examination after ensuring the well-being of what was most important to her, the hibiscus plant. This is evidenced in the text when it states that ""Saeng did not dare look at her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus,"" indicating where her true priorities lay at that moment, and her subsequent vow to try again."
447	9310	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding quote, in which Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, is used by the author to symbolize spring as a period of renewal. The author conveys the necessity of perseverance and the opportunity for a fresh start following a setback. This concept is analogous to students who may fail a semester yet perceive the ensuing term as a chance to begin anew, demonstrating the universal applicability of the theme."
448	9311	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to establish the seasonal context of winter as a period of dormancy and waiting. The snow prevents immediate action, thereby necessitating the postponement of the test until spring. This creates a natural timeline where the character's plans are contingent upon the changing seasons, with the spring thaw enabling her to proceed.
449	9312	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify that Saeng has surmounted a personal obstacle and is progressing forward. Throughout the narrative, Saeng is frequently immobilized by nostalgia for her homeland, contrasting new experiences unfavorably with old memories, such as when she encounters a jasmine plant and reminisces about her grandmother. Her insistence that the hibiscus is ""not a real one"" and ""not like the kind we had before"" further illustrates her inability to value her new life. The final paragraph, therefore, marks significant character growth, showing Saeng's newfound willingness to move forward and create new memories, exemplified by her decision to retake her driving test."
450	9313	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide a fitting resolution, imparting a final note of hope. The imagery suggests that the hibiscus, currently dormant, will regain its strength and bloom again. This serves to reassure the reader that nature, and by extension life, is cyclical, with seasons inevitably returning and offering renewed beauty and opportunity.
451	9314	4	2	This paragraph establishes the winter season for the reader, a fact discernible from the textual reference to melting snow.
452	9315	4	2	"After failing her driving test, Saeng purchased a plant, the ""dok faeng noi,"" which evoked fond memories of its prevalence in Vietnam. She bought the hibiscus as a source of comfort. In the final paragraph, Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, drawing a parallel between recurring natural cycles and life's persistent opportunities. She thus resolves to attempt the test again at the next available chance."
453	9316	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the driving test in the spring, a metaphor for her integration into her new environment. This parallels her personal transformation with seasonal change; as winter ends, dormant life thrives once more. She will be ready to pass the test when she has rejuvenated, just as the geese return, the snow finishes melting, and the hibiscus begins to bud, signaling a new beginning.
454	9317	4	2	"Throughout ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author cultivates a tone of hope and comfort derived from Saeng's reflections on her past. This hopeful sentiment is sustained in the final sentence, suggesting an improved future for her. Initially, Saeng feels alienated and misplaced in a new country, but she gradually develops peace of mind and certainty about a brighter future. Ultimately, the concluding sentence provides a feeling of hope for Saeng's future and her growing self-assurance."
455	9318	4	2	The meaning of the final phrase is to observe the winter hibiscus's capacity to reseed, endure all challenges to blossom annually, and perpetually repeat this resilient life cycle.
456	9319	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves to illustrate a theme of hope and renewal for the protagonist, Saeng. The symbolism of spring aligns with concepts of birth and a second opportunity. Having previously failed a significant examination, Saeng is motivated to reconnect with her past. The winter hibiscus functions as a metaphor for Saeng herself; though she notes it is not identical to the flowers from her homeland, her mother observes its strength to endure the cold season. This perfectly describes Saeng's situation—she has changed and is not as content as before, yet she possesses the resilience to survive difficult times and flourish again, just as she can retake her test. The paragraph's purpose is thus to convey the renewal and hope that Saeng is destined to experience."
457	9320	4	2	This sentence was selected as the conclusion because it affirms Saeng's capability to pass her test. Despite being separated from her homeland, she retains her inherent abilities. As the plant that evokes memories of home returns and starts to grow, Saeng will similarly persevere and develop. It is an effective final sentence, as it provides a sense of her potential while leaving the specific outcome of her test thoughtfully open to the reader's contemplation.
458	9321	4	2	The story concludes with this focus because the flower provides Saeng with strength and hope, serving as a poignant reminder of her home, where such flowers were abundant. She purchased and planted this particular one, nurturing it to grow through the winter. After the winter passes, the flower blooms magnificently, and subsequently, Saeng succeeds in passing her driver's test. As a reward for this achievement, her mother gives her a genuine flower from Vietnam, bringing the narrative to a fitting and symbolic close.
459	9322	4	2	In my view, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng recognizes her prior error and wishes to reconcile with her mother. The paragraph also serves to demonstrate the depth of Saeng's appreciation for nature, which is a significant part of her identity and her connection to her mother, thereby providing a resolution that is both personal and thematic.
460	9323	4	2	The author chooses to conclude the story with this paragraph to underscore the protagonist's resilience. It clearly communicates that despite having failed her initial driving test, she possesses the determination to attempt it again, thereby ending the narrative on a note of perseverance and forward-looking resolve.
461	9324	4	2	The author's choice of response is interpreted as a representation of the necessity to endure an additional period of difficulty or diligent effort, analogous to the labor involved in cultivating flowers. This suggests a thematic connection between the character's experience and the persistent work required for growth and renewal.
462	9325	4	2	"The author's conclusion to ""Winter Hibiscus"" is designed to illuminate Saeng's resolute determination. Despite her profound homesickness and difficulty adjusting to a new country, as evidenced by her being ""too shaky to say the words at home,"" the narrative does not end in despair. Following her failure on a test, the concluding passage instills a sense of hope, indicating that Saeng will persevere and strive for improvement in the spring. Ultimately, the ending functions to showcase her unwavering resolve to overcome adversity and establish her own place in life."
463	9326	4	2	I believe the author chose to end the story with that specific paragraph to highlight the character's deep emotional connection to the geese and her memories. It seems to me that she draws strength from these natural elements, particularly her love for flowers, to face challenges like a school test. This connection to the world outside herself provides her with the belief and comfort needed to persevere, which is the central reason for the story's concluding focus.
464	9327	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a spiritually resonant and confident paragraph to underscore the pivotal role of hope in human experience. The narrative follows Saeng, a Chinese immigrant, who is deeply moved by the plants in a greenhouse, which evoke memories of her homeland. Her journey through this space is one of rediscovery, yet it also brings a painful awareness of forgotten memories, leading to her emotional confession of failing a test. The final paragraph, however, shifts the tone, using the symbolic act of planting a hibiscus with her mother to powerfully express that everyone merits a second chance and a renewed sense of possibility."
465	9328	4	2	The author employs the concluding paragraph to convey the character's firm resolution to never undertake that particular test again. This final statement serves to emphasize the character's profound aversion to the examination and his clear preference for avoiding it entirely, thus concluding his involvement with the matter.
466	9329	4	2	The story concludes with a paragraph that powerfully conveys the theme of overcoming adversity. It encourages the reader to persevere and attempt again after failure. The protagonist, Saeng, having recently emigrated from Vietnam and failed her driver's test, is deeply disheartened. Observing geese flying south to overcome the obstacle of winter, she resolves to retake her test in the spring, paralleling this with her new plant that must endure the cold before it can bud. This illustrates that obstacles are a universal experience, and persistent effort is required to surmount them and ultimately achieve success.
467	9330	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" signifies the narrator's realization that spring brings a chance for renewal and a fresh start. A passage revealing this hope notes how previously strange things became familiar through the quiet repetition of seasons, suggesting she found new purpose in them. She understands that spring represents a rebirth, a sentiment echoed in her decision to retake her test. The story's final sentence thus embodies a realization of the new opportunities that accompany the beginning of spring."
468	9331	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate the motivation and confidence Saeng gains from her encounter with the plant. This is supported by her change in demeanor after purchasing the flower to console herself following her failed driving test. The sight of the plant evokes memories of her childhood, distracting her from her disappointment and ultimately motivating her to pursue her license again. Furthermore, the experience instills in her a renewed confidence, evident in her resolved declaration that she will retake the test. In summary, the paragraph is included to demonstrate the self-assurance Saeng develops as a result of this experience.
469	9332	4	2	The author concludes the story with this statement to demonstrate that Saeng will not surrender, much like the hibiscus plant. For instance, the hibiscus exerts its utmost effort to survive the winter so it can bloom and begin anew in the spring. Similarly, Saeng will endure her personal winter and recommence in the spring by retaking her test. The author intended to show the reader that Saeng is analogous to the hibiscus, as she too must start over and reattempt what she has previously failed, just as the plant would have perished had it not persisted through the cold.
470	9333	4	2	This response appears to be a misunderstanding of the story's content. The narrative is not about recreational winter activities but rather uses the season as a metaphor for hardship and transition in the life of an immigrant character. The central themes involve overcoming failure and finding hope, not the literal enjoyment of winter. Therefore, the interpretation provided does not align with the actual plot and message of the literary work.
471	9334	4	2	The author employs this conclusion to heighten reader engagement and to underscore the cyclical nature of the events, which are destined to repeat annually.
472	9335	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to reveal that the hibiscus flower was Saeng's original inspiration for taking the test. This interpretation is supported by the narrative's consistent imagery, where the character is repeatedly associated with either gardening or possessing a hibiscus, thereby highlighting the flower's profound symbolic importance to her.
473	9336	4	2	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to symbolize an impending rebirth. This ending suggests a period of hibernation during the winter, with the protagonist's renewal aligned with spring's new cycle of life. Saeng's realization that previously strange elements have become familiar through the quiet repetition of the seasons indicates her readiness to embrace a new beginning with a transformed perspective on her life.
474	9337	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to provide a comprehensive resolution. By integrating elements of nature and detailed descriptions, the author aims to evoke a vivid mental image for the reader, conveying the purported beauty and serenity of the spring season.
475	9338	4	2	I believe the author concludes with this paragraph to suggest that her fortitude will emerge concurrently with the blooming flowers, thereby enabling her to successfully take the test.
476	9339	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph serves to underscore the protagonist's resolute determination. Initially, the girl succumbs to an impulse by purchasing the costly flower, yet she is subsequently driven by a desire to avoid disappointing her mother, thereby resolving to ""pass the test."" Her aspiration to purchase seeds in the spring illustrates her forward-looking resolve, a trait of determination the author effectively highlights through this narrative closure."
477	9340	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring because the budding hibiscus symbolizes new beginnings. Just as the flower persistently buds anew, representing a fresh start, Saeng's decision to try the test again embodies her commitment to persevere and not surrender to initial failure, drawing a parallel between natural renewal and human resilience.
478	9341	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph employs the hibiscus as a potent symbol for overcoming adversity. The mother's observation that the plant, while not particularly pretty, is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months"" directly establishes this symbolism of resilience against harsh conditions. For Saeng, a girl striving to adapt in a foreign country, this parallels her own challenge of failing her driver's test. Her silent vow to retake the exam when the hibiscus buds signifies her adoption of this symbolic strength to conquer her personal obstacle, which is the fundamental reason for the story's concluding focus."
479	9342	4	2	The author employs the final paragraph to convey Saeng's determination to complete what she started. After failing her driver's test, her disappointment is palpable, evidenced by her tear-stained, puffy eyes and her nostalgic reflections on her past life in Vietnam. She finds a parallel in the migratory geese that return with the seasons, seeing the spring as a time for new beginnings. This sentiment is mirrored in the blossoming hibiscus, representing the fresh start she resolves to make by retaking her driver's test.
480	9343	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to impart a fundamental lesson in perseverance, demonstrating that Saeng did not give up and therefore neither should anyone else. This segment articulates a principle of life: to persist despite setbacks. The core message is that even after an initial failure, one must remain willing to try again, as exemplified by Saeng's resolve.
481	9344	4	2	Saeng's internal vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding, serves as a deliberate authorial choice. This inclusion functions to illustrate the counterproductive nature of procrastination. The character's decision to delay confronting a challenge establishes a negative model for the reader. It is evident that the author's intent was to underscore the importance of addressing tasks promptly rather than deferring them. Ultimately, the inclusion of this phrase effectively reinforces the narrative's lesson on the correct approach to handling such situations.
482	9345	4	2	She must learn that one cannot simply replace a lost plant with an identical one and expect it to hold the same value or significance. This is a fundamental lesson she needs to understand and apply to her life.
483	9346	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve to align herself with the rhythms of nature and assimilate into her new environment. Having failed her driver's test, Saeng initially feels displaced. The text describes her planting a garden, and upon seeing a specific flower, she is reminded of her homeland where she felt she belonged. This memory, coupled with the sight of geese flying overhead as she plants, inspires her to wait for the flower to bloom before retaking the test. The author notes Saeng's realization that previously strange elements of her new life are becoming familiar. The returning geese will now symbolize her new beginning and her determination to build a happy life there. Her final declaration to retake the test solidifies this feeling of a fresh start in her new home, bringing the character's arc to a hopeful conclusion.
484	9347	4	2	This concluding sentence powerfully encapsulates the story's central themes. It reveals Saeng's renewed determination, which has been fortified by the comforting symbol of her homeland. The statement effectively demonstrates how the hibiscus has restored Saeng's spirit, acting as a healing emblem. The sentence successfully resolves the narrative by highlighting the profound significance of the hibiscus, which the story describes as a friend and a reminder of her past. The plant's eventual bloom will signal to Saeng that she is ready to face her challenge again, making the paragraph a fitting and resonant conclusion that summarizes the symbolic weight the flower carries for the protagonist.
485	9348	4	2	The author aims to convey a message of perseverance and an appreciation for nature's beauty. This is demonstrated through Saeng's experience; despite failing her test, she resolves to try again. The narrative incorporates the winter hibiscus she plants, which becomes integral to the conclusion. The ending essentially communicates that after a period of hardship, a new beginning is possible, thus affirming the themes of resilience and renewal.
486	9349	4	2	The author concluded the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, a paragraph that inherently serves as a summation. This conclusion effectively encapsulates her resolve to repeat her efforts, as the cyclical return of the plants symbolizes the recurring nature of her challenge and the work it entails.
487	9350	4	2	The author likely concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's perseverance. It clarifies that she does not dismiss the importance of her new test, countering any assumption that she values only the tests from her homeland and is therefore indifferent to her current circumstances.
488	9351	4	2	The author may have ended the story in this manner to function as a metaphor, encouraging readers to think beyond conventional boundaries. Alternatively, the conclusion could be intended to create a vivid mental image, helping the audience visualize the scene and the character's perspective.
489	9352	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to convey Saeng's emotional state and her process of self-assurance. This final vow represents her internal affirmation that she will improve, marking a significant shift from her earlier insecurity during the conversation with her mother to a state of confident determination.
490	9353	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding paragraph, featuring Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, draws a parallel to the hibiscus plant's renewal. The author implies that just as the hibiscus can rejuvenate and bloom again, so too can Saeng restart her own efforts, which is the fundamental reason for including this quote."
491	9354	4	2	Saeng's initial failure on her driver's test is followed by her discovery of a hibiscus plant, which she purchases due to its powerful evocation of her former life in Vietnam. The flower's familiar fragrance vividly recalls the memory of her grandmother. Her mother, in an attempt to offer consolation, observes a similar, hardy plant that endures the cold, implying a parallel resilience. This theme of gradual adaptation is underscored as Saeng observes a flock of Canada geese, whose calls, once strange, have become familiar. She thus realizes that many aspects of her new environment have transitioned from foreign to recognizable over time.
492	9355	4	2	The author employs the concluding paragraph to illustrate Saeng's evolving perception. The character comes to a realization that elements which once appeared alien, such as the changing seasons and the local flora, have become familiar. This newfound sense of belonging and understanding provides the context for her decision to return in the spring to retake the examination, framing the conclusion around her personal growth and adaptation.
493	9356	4	2	The author's choice of conclusion serves to forge a symbolic link between the hibiscus plant and Saeng's pursuit of a driver's license. The plant acts as a tangible reminder of her goal and her inner strength. Furthermore, the cyclical blooming of the plant mirrors a new beginning, which is precisely the opportunity Saeng seizes when she decides to take the test again, embarking on a fresh start for herself.
494	9357	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate how the tranquility and symbolic strength derived from the flower bolster Saeng's confidence and resolve. After failing her driving test, the hibiscus serves as a poignant connection to her homeland in Vietnam, offering emotional solace. The flower's persistent blooming through seasons symbolizes a resilience that Saeng internalizes, deciding that she, too, will not surrender. The plant thus becomes a source of fortitude, empowering her to try again, and the ending highlights this transformative power and her commitment to persevere.
495	9358	4	2	The author selects this concluding paragraph to merge two parallel narratives of imperfection and potential. Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, creates a unified resolution. This synchronization of natural renewal with personal determination allows her to confront her challenge directly and seek to overcome it, providing a cohesive end to her story.
496	9359	4	2	The author states that she intends to retake the examination in the spring rather than the winter. This decision is based on her belief that she will be better able to concentrate solely on the test itself, without the distraction of planting activities, thereby allowing for greater focus.
497	9360	4	2	I believe the story concludes in this manner because the protagonist demonstrates persistent effort throughout the entire narrative. The final sentence signifies that her journey is not over; she will return to attempt the test again. Having striven to prove her capabilities across the whole book, she will persist in her diligent efforts to ultimately achieve her desired goals.
498	9361	4	2	"The author's conclusion is metaphoric, drawing a direct comparison between herself and the hibiscus plant. Just as the hibiscus is tested by enduring harsh conditions like the cold, described as having flowers that ""aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here,"" the author faces her own trials. This parallel suggests that, like the winter hibiscus which will bloom again, the author will also have another opportunity to pass her test, which is the fundamental reason for the story's concluding metaphor."
499	9362	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" conveys a powerful message of transformation from a state of cold failure to one of adaptation and new life. Saeng connects her personal change to the seasonal shift from winter to spring, evident in the line ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" She accepts this as a chance for a fresh start and another attempt to pass her test. The transition from winter to spring symbolizes Saeng's hardship in adapting to her new home, while the returning geese and the hibiscus adapting to its new environment symbolize her own ability, like the plant from her native Vietnam, to prosper elsewhere."
500	9363	4	2	The author selected this conclusion for its significant impact and profound meaning. The final paragraph suggests that time will facilitate her adjustment to her new living circumstances. It integrates the symbol of the hibiscus flower, which will bloom again, a detail that carries a double meaning implying the author's own life will also flourish anew. Ultimately, this provided an effective and resonant conclusion to the narrative.
501	9364	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test upon the return of spring and the budding of the hibiscus. This resolution signifies her overcoming the disappointment and discomfort of adapting to a new country. The archetypal meaning of a flower bud—symbolizing prosperity, new beginnings, and growth—parallels Saeng's own development. This thematic parallel underscores the importance of personal growth, which is why the author selected this positive and forward-looking conclusion."
502	9365	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's profound connection to the hibiscus plant. Throughout the narrative, Saeng observes plants from her homeland that have adapted to life in a new location, much like the hardy hibiscus surviving the winter. This leads her to the realization that she, too, must adapt to achieve success in her new environment. Her vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus's renewed growth cycle, symbolizes her personal commitment to restart and flourish, thereby completing her character arc.
503	9366	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the final paragraph underscores the hibiscus's profound significance to the protagonist. The author employs the hibiscus as a symbol of resilience, a quality the girl must embody to ultimately pass her driving test. By placing this reflection at the story's end, the author creates a parallel: just as the hibiscus returns after winter, so too can the girl recover from her setback and try again. In conclusion, the final paragraph is utilized to emphasize the symbolic meaning of the hibiscus as an emblem of perseverance and renewal."
504	9367	4	2	"While the story is imbued with emotion and homesickness that could render it somber, the author deliberately concludes with a message of hope. After Saeng's failure leads her to ""break down and wept,"" her resolve to keep trying is genuinely inspiring. The challenge of overcoming homesickness to find the strength to persevere is considerable, yet ultimately rewarding. Furthermore, the author uses the ending to imbue the hibiscus with additional meaning; its bloom coincides with the geese's return, symbolizing that after the hard winter, a new and beautiful spring brings renewed hope. This final note provides an uplifting closure to the narrative."
505	9368	4	2	The author concluded the story with this particular paragraph because it effectively encapsulates the narrative's resolution. It clearly communicates Saeng's determination to prepare for and retake the test she previously failed, aligning this goal with the return of spring and the geese. This seasonal symbolism reinforces her commitment to a fresh start. In essence, the paragraph was chosen for the conclusion as it provides the clearest and most succinct explanation for the story's ending, leaving the reader with a definitive understanding of Saeng's resolve.
506	9369	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's personal growth and the hope she holds for achieving comfort in the United States. Her statement, ""I-I failed the test,"" is interpreted not merely as failing a driving exam, but as failing a test of her ability to move beyond her attachment to her homeland. This moment signifies a pivotal point of self-awareness and the beginning of her acceptance of a new life."
507	9370	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph features Saeng's vow: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" This resolution powerfully demonstrates the theme of perseverance, showing that one must continue to fight for what is right and for what one believes in, even after facing disappointment."
508	9371	4	2	Saeng demonstrated resilience and determination, striving to make the best of her circumstances with the resources available to her. The difficult relocation to a new country had diminished her hope, and the winter landscape deepened her sadness and longing for home. Purchasing the hibiscus was an attempt to symbolically reconnect with her homeland. She resolves that with the arrival of spring, she will blossom alongside the flower and retake her test, embracing this new environment with its own hibiscus as her home, recognizing that winter is an inhospitable season for growth.
509	9372	4	2	Saeng experienced a profound sense of emptiness, which she attempted to fill by purchasing an item that offered comfort while simultaneously intensifying her nostalgia for her origins. Her mother's frustration over the cost of the pots added to the tension. Ultimately, Saeng vowed silently to herself that with the arrival of spring, she would make another attempt to pass the test, signaling a commitment to persevere in her new life.
510	9373	4	2	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to underscore the development of Saeng's self-assurance. The final lines serve to highlight her renewed determination and the confidence she has mustered to face the driving test again, marking a significant step in her personal journey and adaptation to her new environment.
511	9374	4	2	The author deliberately concludes the narrative at this juncture to sustain an element of suspense, leaving the reader to speculate on future events. This narrative choice is effective because the essential information regarding the protagonist and her mother's relationship has been fully conveyed. The outcome of Saeng's test or the specifics of the impending winter are ultimately secondary to this central thematic concern, rendering the story complete as it stands.
512	9375	4	2	Saeng experiences a profound sense of displacement in her unfamiliar surroundings and new country. She makes a silent pledge to retake the examination in one year, by which time she hopes to have acclimated to her new life and rediscovered joy. The author's decision to conclude with this paragraph underscores Saeng's transitional state and her need for time to adjust before attempting the test again. This ending emphasizes the character's personal vow and the hopeful anticipation that she will fulfill her commitment to build a new life.
513	9376	4	2	The author likely concluded the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resilience; rather than surrendering, she resolves to persevere. Observing the geese's adaptation inspires her to strive and make her new home succeed. After they vanish, she gathers her resolve and commits to trying again. Through this action, she dedicates herself to embracing new experiences as a means of adapting to profound change.
514	9377	4	2	The story concludes with this paragraph because the protagonist intends to retake the test during a warmer season, when the conditions will be less harsh and more favorable for her. The change in weather from the cold to a more temperate climate symbolizes a more hopeful and manageable future challenge.
515	9378	4	2	The story concludes with this paragraph for several significant reasons. The spring setting, characterized by warmth and sunshine, provides an optimistic and hopeful resolution. Furthermore, it symbolizes Saeng's capacity for adaptation, much like the hibiscus plant that endures the winter. Finally, it reinforces her determined character and her commitment to not disappoint her mother, which collectively justifies the author's concluding choice.
516	9379	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate a parallel capacity for adaptation. The protagonist resolves that in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she will retake her test. This resolution is chosen to demonstrate that if these natural elements can return and flourish after a period of absence or dormancy, then she, too, possesses the ability to recover and adapt to her new environment, drawing strength from their cyclical renewal.
517	9380	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph that directs the reader's attention toward the future. The ending features the protagonist's declaration that she will retake her test upon the return of spring, marked by melting snow, returning geese, and a budding hibiscus. This imagery signifies a new beginning and a desire to start anew. The natural symbols of geese, the blooming flower, and the melted snow collectively instill in her a sense of hope for passing her test. Ultimately, authors employ such open-ended conclusions to provoke thoughtful reflection in the reader."
518	9381	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide clarity and insight into the protagonist's state of mind. The specific line, where Saeng vows to retake her test in the spring amidst the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, serves as a crucial point of understanding. It allows the reader to comprehend the character's internal resolve and the thematic significance of the narrative, thereby illuminating the author's intended message for the audience.
519	9382	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph because the geese and the hibiscus represent familiar elements from Saeng's homeland. These symbols remind her of her origins, and their cyclical return provides her with the fortitude to attempt the test again with the hope of improved results. The narrative notes, ""Overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yet-familiar to Saeng now,"" illustrating how the geese function as a symbol of familiarity that helps her feel more comfortable in her new home, thus empowering her future actions."
520	9383	4	2	"The author included the concluding paragraph to demonstrate how the hibiscus plant, a connection to the protagonist's homeland, provides her with the emotional support necessary to persevere. The hibiscus is explicitly linked to her past, as indicated when she struggles to articulate the words ""at home,"" revealing her nostalgia. This plant evokes memories of her former life, and its presence helps her navigate challenges in her new environment. Therefore, the paragraph serves to underscore the character's profound connection to her homeland and how this connection fuels her resilience."
521	9384	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the personal significance of Saeng's origins and her past. The narrative suggests a deeply personal connection to her homeland, which is a source of her strength. She resolves to retake the test in the spring, a season that symbolizes renewal, or perhaps to begin planting again, as the winter's snow makes it impossible to do so presently. Her homeland remains profoundly important to her, and she experiences a sense of longing to return to the place from which she came.
522	9385	4	2	"The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow: ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This resolution is prompted by the symbolic hibiscus, which has instilled in her a renewed sense of self-belief and the confidence to improve her future prospects."
523	9386	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves several purposes. Primarily, it allows for a period of acclimatization; having recently arrived from her homeland, Saeng will gain a more comprehensive understanding of her new country over the subsequent months, thereby increasing her capacity to pass the test. Furthermore, the spring season represents a time of natural renewal, where the flower's beauty will provide her with fortitude. This interim affords Saeng the necessary time for both mental preparation through study and the physical maturation that accompanies the passage of time.
524	9387	4	2	"To cope with her failure, Saeng purchased a flower that evoked memories of her home, an act that moved her to tears as she longed to return. The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate how Saeng's resolve to retake the test is linked to feeling at home. Her internal vow, made for ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" connects her success to elements that provide comfort and a sense of belonging. This conclusion effectively gathers the comforting symbols of her heritage, helping the reader comprehend their significance. The hibiscus flower, the migrating geese, and these collective memories are established as the foundational supports that will aid Saeng in her future endeavors."
525	9388	4	2	In my view, the author chose this conclusion to champion the universal themes of fresh starts and second chances. The underlying message appears to be that initial failure should not preclude a subsequent attempt. After failing the test, Saeng's diminished self-esteem was gradually restored through her mother's encouragement, leading her to the vital realization that giving up would be far worse than trying again with a renewed spirit.
526	9389	4	2	"Minfong Ho incorporated the final paragraph to illustrate how Saeng's confidence was bolstered by reminders of her homeland. The sight of the hibiscus evoked an intense, almost visceral feeling within her. Ho employs the flower symbolically; the winter hibiscus's resilience through cold months suggests to the reader that it serves as a source of hope and confidence for Saeng. Furthermore, the V-formation of the geese is inferred to symbolize Vietnam for Saeng, a connection the author intends the reader to make, hence the mention of ""and the geese return."" Ho's objective is to convey that objects providing comfort and happiness are fundamental to developing inner strength and confidence. The author effectively places this culminating thought in the concluding paragraph, which perfectly encapsulates the story's lesson: one can thrive with confidence when rooted in what feels like home, transforming fragility into resilience."
527	9390	4	2	The author uses the final paragraph to show Saeng's longing for an early spring, driven by her desire to see her hibiscus plant bloom. She understands that without the swift arrival of spring, the snow will not melt and her wish will remain unfulfilled. This anticipation is directly linked to her personal resolve, as she hopes that with the coming spring, she will feel prepared to retake her test. The paragraph thus connects the natural cycle of renewal with Saeng's own aspiration for a fresh start.
528	9391	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring because the winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. In her homeland, hibiscus flowers were part of her normal life, but after moving to the U.S., their absence coincided with her failure on a driving test and a general sense of displacement. Discovering the winter hibiscus provides her with a profound sense of comfort and a connection to home, instilling a feeling of security. In conclusion, the final sentence signifies a pivotal moment of renewal for Saeng, with the hibiscus representing the hope and strength necessary for her to embark on a new start.
529	9392	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its imagery parallels Saeng's own life, suggesting she will have another opportunity, just as the geese return annually. The reference to spring is significant as it universally symbolizes renewal, a time of warmth and floral rebirth. The re-budding hibiscus will rekindle her warm memories of her former home, thereby fostering the confidence she needs to retake the driving test she had previously failed. The author included this final section because it effectively unifies the narrative's central themes of cyclical renewal and personal resilience.
530	9393	4	2	The author concludes the story with a brief paragraph to emphasize that sometimes the smallest details carry the greatest significance. The author believed that within a few sentences, the most crucial elements of the narrative could be summarized. This concise concluding statement successfully encapsulates the story's core message and provides a fitting end to the character's journey.
531	9394	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to signify that Saeng must retake the test. She believes her chances for success are greater in the spring, following the snow's thaw and the hibiscus's bloom. Consequently, Saeng has resolved to make another attempt after these seasonal changes occur.
532	9395	4	2	The author concludes with this sentence for several reasons. Saeng believes she cannot succeed until spring, which is marked by the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus. She feels a parallel to this seasonal renewal, anticipating that she, too, will blossom and be prepared to pass the test at that time.
533	9396	4	2	The author likely includes this paragraph to suggest the grandmother may interpret the situation as a test of her capabilities within a certain timeframe. The implication is that the grandmother could potentially accomplish more than what is ordinarily expected of her.
534	9397	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to convey that Saeng will be ready to retake the test by that time. This suggests that when spring arrives, she will feel prepared and more self-assured. The author appears to be drawing a parallel between the new beginning of spring and a new beginning for Saeng herself.
535	9398	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve to try again. Despite failing her driving test, her experience of planting the hibiscus with her mother has restored her confidence to strive for success. This activity, which she accomplished, provides her with the assurance that she can also pass the test upon her next attempt.
536	9399	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with a reflective statement to underscore the parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus. Both are situated in unfamiliar environments and must undertake the process of adaptation. Having recently failed her driving examination, Saeng is disheartened. The concluding sentence reveals that Saeng possesses the capacity to surmount her driving difficulties, just as the plant can endure and thrive within its challenging surroundings.
537	9400	4	2	The author chose this as the final paragraph to offer a sense of hope for Saeng's mother. This hope is significant because the family may genuinely depend on Saeng passing the test for practical reasons, making this optimistic note a crucial emotional resolution.
538	9401	4	2	"The concluding paragraph is essential as it reaffirms the symbolic meaning of the hibiscus and its profound importance to Saeng. It illustrates her resolve to overcome the challenges of adapting to a new country, preventing the narrative from ending on an assumption. The hibiscus initially caused her distress by triggering memories of a lost homeland, but its reiterated significance at the story's close provides clarity. The line, ""When this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" uses the buds to symbolize a new beginning and a renewed opportunity for Saeng to conquer her obstacles. Ultimately, this paragraph is indispensable for resolving the narrative's central themes and providing a clear, meaningful conclusion for the reader."
539	9402	4	2	"The inclusion of the line about retaking the test when the ""hibiscus is budding"" provides closure and a moral to an otherwise open-ended narrative. Saeng fails her driver's test early on and later purchases a hibiscus, a connection whose significance only becomes clear in the final paragraph. The hibiscus symbolizes perseverance and resilience; after a harsh winter, it can bloom once more. Similarly, Saeng, having moved from Vietnam and struggled to adapt, must recover and persist. Just as the flower will bloom again, so too will Saeng, implying she will pass the test on her next attempt, adapt to her environment, and continue forward."
540	9403	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus buds because the narrative commenced with her failing the driving examination. The hibiscus serves as a reminder of Saeng's homeland. After she planted it, the sight of a flock of Canada geese flying overhead provided a sense of comfort, prompting her silent vow. This sequence of events suggests that failing the test was a pivotal moment that ultimately led her to discover the hibiscus and find the resolve to try again.
541	9404	4	2	The author's inclusion stems from the daughter's aspiration to emulate her mother, who successfully passed the examination. Consequently, the daughter is motivated to achieve the same outcome. Furthermore, the test is only available in the spring, as the necessary flowers are not present during the winter months.
542	9405	4	2	The author illustrates Saeng's progression toward accepting and overcoming her life's struggles. This development signifies her acclimatization to her new location and its customs, while simultaneously demonstrating that she has not forsaken her cultural heritage. Her preference for a specific food over a Big Mac substantiates this point. Moreover, the narrative proves her resolve to remain positive and undiscouraged, as she intends to retake her test. Initially, Saeng held a particular perspective on her circumstances. However, her visit to the floral shop precipitates a more cheerful and optimistic outlook, leading her to take proactive steps to improve her situation, thereby concluding her character arc.
543	9406	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. A primary reason is to convey that the current season is winter, and its conclusion will mark a period of renewal, symbolized by flowering and planting. The story states, ""the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,"" indicating a period of waiting for winter to pass, after which the hibiscus will begin to grow and is anticipated to be fully established by spring. This symbolic use of the seasons provides a fitting and hopeful conclusion to the narrative."
544	9407	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to resolve the question regarding her test, indicating she would take it when she felt sufficiently comfortable. The text describes the plant as feeling smooth and cool, a familiar and comforting sensation. By closing her palm around it and holding it tight, she secures something tangible to grasp. This contrasts with the profound, stinging sense of loss she feels for her grandmother, an emotion of sadness and disappointment she would likely prefer to avoid for some time. Her mother's small cry of surprise and delight upon seeing the flower, even before her shock at its cost, underscores this emotional complexity. With this concluding paragraph, it is evident she will be more comfortable at the planned time, as she will have both new and familiar elements, such as the geese and the plant, to welcome her home.
545	9408	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author includes this concluding paragraph to demonstrate that the protagonist will be better prepared for the garden and its associated challenges in the future. On this initial attempt, she was unprepared and unfamiliar with the winter hibiscus, as she had no prior experience with such an endeavor. This ending signifies a commitment to future readiness."
546	9409	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the narrator's vow to retake the test in the spring, a decision that underscores her resilience. Despite an initial failure, she refuses to be defeated by a period of difficult adjustment. The hibiscus plant serves as a potent symbol for this theme; its capacity to adapt to a new environment inspires the narrator to recognize that she, too, can successfully acclimate and persevere."
547	9410	4	2	The story concludes this way to illustrate that the character's sense of well-being is tied to the blossoming season. When her surroundings are in bloom, she will feel more settled and emotionally healthy. This connection is rooted in her past, as she used to assist her grandmother with her hair, an activity associated with flowers. Therefore, the blooming hibiscus will evoke memories of her grandmother, providing the emotional comfort and incentive needed to perform well on the subsequent test.
548	9411	4	2	The author employs the concluding paragraph as a form of personification, attributing human-like qualities to the natural events of snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. This technique is used to delineate a specific passage of time, marking a period of transition and renewal. Furthermore, the description emphasizes the hibiscus's state of isolation, mirroring the protagonist's own feelings and creating a poignant parallel between the character and her environment.
549	9412	4	2	The author chose to end the story with that particular paragraph to convey Saeng's feelings about the approaching winter and her need to wait until spring returns before she can attempt her test again. This seasonal waiting period reflects a time of patience and preparation, indicating that she is postponing her effort until conditions are more favorable for her success, both in nature and in her personal life.
550	9413	4	2	Saeng demonstrates a profound care for the flowers, particularly the hibiscus. Her attention is drawn to their natural life cycle and the unique qualities they exhibit as they grow. This focus on the distinctiveness of their development highlights her deep connection to nature and the significance she finds in its subtle, recurring patterns.
551	9414	4	2	The author's intent for the story's conclusion remains ambiguous, though it appears to concern a character who has completed her tests and would not undertake them again. The narrative concludes with the school year ending, marking a distinct period in time.
552	9415	4	2	The author selected the story's conclusion primarily to provide a necessary ending, choosing the resolution that was most thematically appropriate for the narrative's overall structure.
553	9416	4	2	The author's conclusion serves to reinforce the central theme of perseverance. This is exemplified by the winter hibiscus, a plant that endures harsh conditions, mirroring the protagonist Saeng's resolve to retake her test. Similarly, the mother's dedication to her gardening in the cold further illustrates this theme, as both characters choose to persist in their efforts rather than surrender to difficulty. The story's ending effectively draws a parallel between human tenacity and the resilience of nature.
554	9417	4	2	I believe the author concluded the story this way to show that the character has not given up. Despite her initial failure, she is determined to try again. The reference to spring, with the melting snow and the budding hibiscus, symbolizes a new beginning, suggesting she will attempt the test once more when conditions are more favorable. However, I found the story somewhat lacking because the nature of the test she failed was unclear, which diminished my overall engagement with the narrative.
555	9418	4	2	The author likely concluded with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to draw a parallel with the hibiscus plant. Just as the plant lacks a fighting chance for survival in the winter, the girl was unprepared for her initial driving test. The coming spring represents a time of renewal, offering the plant a chance to bloom and the girl an opportunity to pass her test, illustrating that there is a proper time and place for everything.
556	9419	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to underscore her emotional resilience, commitment, and hope. The final paragraph reveals her deep emotion following a personal setback. Her statement demonstrates a firm commitment to trying again, explicitly linked to the return of the geese and the budding hibiscus. Ultimately, this resolution conveys a sense of hope and a desire for redemption, which are the central reasons for the story's concluding sentiment.
557	9420	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to highlight the protagonist's newfound resolve to surmount her challenges. This is illustrated by her earlier epiphany, where she recognizes that life, like the seasons, follows a cycle of repetition leading to familiarity. She directly applies this realization by vowing to retake the test in the spring. This metaphorically aligns her struggle with the winter hibiscus, which endures the cold before blooming, suggesting that she too must remain strong during difficult times while awaiting her own opportunity to flourish.
558	9421	4	2	The author chose to end the story with that particular paragraph to illustrate that Saeng was not going to surrender after a single failure. Although she was deeply upset about failing her test, her mother responded with understanding rather than anger. The purchase of the plant, which was not currently growing, symbolizes a step forward. This act, coupled with her mother's supportive words, helps solidify Saeng's resolve to try again, demonstrating that a single setback does not define one's future.
559	9422	4	2	Determination, new beginnings, and symbolism are the key reasons for the author's concluding paragraph. Saeng finds renewed hope and determination after purchasing the plant, resolving to pass the test. Observing the migrating geese, she is inspired by their perseverance. The budding hibiscus serves as a powerful symbol of a fresh start, representing her desire to turn over a new leaf. These three elements collectively justify the author's choice of ending.
560	9423	4	2	"The author of ""The Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to demonstrate her overcoming a personal struggle. This ending suggests that nature's beauty can aid in resolving inner conflicts. Saeng's observation of the migrating geese and the hibiscus leads her to an epiphany about the cyclical nature of life, making the unfamiliar familiar. Furthermore, the plant's fragrance evokes comforting memories of her past in Vietnam, which, instead of anchoring her in nostalgia, fills her with enough joy to look forward to her future in the United States."
561	9424	4	2	The author includes the final line to convey that while the immediate conflict is concluding, the cyclical nature of life ensures its eventual return. The protagonist is reluctant for the current phase to end, yet she understands that the circumstances will inevitably recur in the future, when conditions revert to their previous state. This cyclical perspective is the fundamental reason for the line's inclusion in the story's conclusion.
562	9425	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's resolution to retake the test in the spring, a season symbolizing renewal and growth. This final statement underscores her determination to adapt and integrate into her new environment. The emphasis on spring is significant, as it represents the cyclical change of seasons, which Saeng initially found unfamiliar but has since come to accept. Her acknowledgment of this natural cycle parallels her personal resolve to confront change directly, thereby making the concluding line a powerful expression of her character development and acceptance of life's transitions.
563	9426	4	2	"In ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the hibiscus flower functions as a multifaceted symbol, representing unexpected beauty, the capacity for adaptation, and a connection to Saeng's homeland. The narrative suggests that despite her failure, Saeng finds solace and perspective through the flower, which reminds her of a cherished past and the persistence of natural beauty. This serves as a broader reminder that while disappointment is an inevitable part of life, one must persevere, drawing strength from positive and beautiful elements, as new opportunities will always arise for those who maintain such a perspective."
564	9427	4	2	The concluding paragraph establishes a parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus plant, using the plant as a symbol of her inherent resilience and potential. The narrative implies that Saeng recognizes her need for a period of strengthening, much like the plant that will rejuvenate in the spring. Her hope and readiness to attempt the test again are intrinsically linked to this seasonal renewal, mirroring the plant's cycle. This symbolic connection provides the foundational reason for the author's chosen conclusion.
565	9428	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to create cohesion by referencing earlier story elements. The phrase ""and this hibiscus is budding"" recalls the initial moment Saeng encountered the plant, which evoked memories of her homeland. Furthermore, the resolution to ""take that test again"" directly addresses the earlier failure of her driver's test. It can be inferred that Saeng's initial lack of confidence, born from unfamiliar surroundings, has been replaced by a newfound familiarity and personal interests. This ending suggests she is prepared to move forward with a positive outlook, aiming to overcome her previous setback."
566	9429	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's personal resolve. Having overcome adversity, Saeng resolves to retake the examination for her own benefit, aiming to prove her capability to herself rather than to others. She explicitly vows to attempt the test again in the spring, a decision made autonomously, free from external pressure, and driven solely by a desire for self-validation.
567	9430	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding paragraph serves a specific thematic purpose. It establishes a parallel between the protagonist, Saeng, and the winter hibiscus plant. Just as her mother affirms the plant's strength to endure the cold, Saeng's vow to retake her driver's test in the spring symbolizes her own resilience. The paragraph thus illustrates that Saeng, like the hibiscus, possesses the fortitude to survive a difficult period and will be prepared to blossom when conditions improve."
568	9431	4	2	The author employs the concluding paragraph as a deliberate narrative device to generate reader engagement. This technique, commonly known as a cliffhanger, is frequently used in serialized storytelling to maintain audience interest and create anticipation for subsequent installments. For instance, many popular book series, such as the referenced work, utilize chapter endings where a significant event, like an unresolved murder, compels the reader to continue. The author's intent is therefore to sustain narrative momentum and ensure the audience's continued investment in the story.
569	9432	4	2	The author's conclusion conveys the protagonist's determination to assimilate into her new country despite initial setbacks. The paragraph signifies that her story is not over; although she failed the test, she is resolved to succeed in her next attempt. The narrative makes it clear that the girl values this test and wishes to demonstrate her ability to pass it. Furthermore, the hibiscus flowers, which remind her of her homeland, provide her with the symbolic strength and confidence to retake the test correctly.
570	9434	4	2	The paragraph is included to signify Saeng's intention to return after the winter season, which she dislikes, to reassess the plants. It also serves to highlight her planned revisit to her mother, reinforcing the ongoing connection to her family and the natural environment as markers of time and personal commitment.
571	9435	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to signify Saeng's failure on the test and her subsequent intention to retake it in the spring. This resolution provides a clear endpoint to the narrative arc concerning the examination.
572	9436	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide narrative closure for both Saeng and the plot. Initially distraught by her test failure, Saeng ultimately realizes that while unforeseen events occur, one must persevere through adversity. Her observation of the geese and hibiscus leads to an epiphany about the universal necessity of adaptation. Her failure, potentially linked to differing driving customs from Vietnam, underscores her need to assimilate to new rules and practices, a thematic resolution that justifies the author's concluding choice.
573	9437	4	2	Saeng did not pass a test she had taken. Although fearful of her mother's reaction, she informed her of the result, which indeed upset her mother. Saeng, however, is aware that once winter concludes, she will have another opportunity to take the same test, and she hopes to succeed on that attempt.
574	9438	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author incorporates Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to conclude the story with her developing a positive outlook on her new home and future. Throughout the narrative, Saeng exhibits a melancholic disposition towards her new environment, where plants trigger painful memories of her past home, as seen when she is too distraught to speak of it. The final phrase signifies her newfound resilience and her ability to anticipate the future with hope."
575	9439	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph because Saeng, having failed her driving test, purchases a hibiscus that provides her with comfort and a connection to her homeland. Her mother's statement at the end reflects an understanding of Saeng's difficult adaptation to a new country and a desire to avoid adding pressure, recognizing Saeng's distress and her attempt to cope by buying the flower. The mother suggests that by the following spring, Saeng will have adapted and be prepared to retake the test, with the flower symbolizing the hope necessary for this transition, ultimately conveying the mother's supportive presence.
576	9440	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring for several significant reasons. Primarily, this resolution demonstrates her resilience and refusal to surrender after a setback. Furthermore, the statement creates an atmosphere of hope and anticipation for the future. Finally, it introduces an element of uncertainty, leaving the reader to ponder the outcome of her next attempt. These narrative effects collectively justify the author's choice of this concluding sentiment."
577	9441	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" by drawing a parallel between the hibiscus and Saeng. The flower must endure the winter to eventually bloom in the spring, just as Saeng must overcome the obstacles presented by her new environment. She identifies with the hibiscus, which is confined to a pot, much as she feels trapped and alienated. The narrative suggests that, once planted, the hibiscus will integrate into its surroundings and flourish. Similarly, once Saeng accepts her new circumstances and commits to starting anew, she will also grow, making future challenges like the driving test more manageable. This symbolic connection is the central reason for the story's concluding paragraph."
578	9442	4	2	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding line connects Saeng's resolve to retake her driver's test with the budding of the hibiscus, establishing a metaphor for personal growth. The flower's life cycle, which includes wilting and subsequent blossoming, mirrors Saeng's initial failure and her determination to succeed later. This symbolism of blossoming is evident when Saeng's disappointment over failing the test is alleviated by the sight of a flower from her homeland, shifting her mood from negative to positive. Her emotional resilience is further demonstrated in her interaction with her mother; after nervously shredding a leaf, her mother's calm response and the act of planting it provide a morale boost, illustrating another instance of ""blossoming."" Thus, Saeng's vow to try again in the spring aligns with the hibiscus's inevitable bloom, symbolizing her enduring determination to overcome adversity and achieve her goal."
579	9443	4	2	The author likely included the final paragraph to enrich the narrative's detail and thematic depth. The passage conveys Saeng's internal vow to herself that she will retake the driving test with the arrival of spring, a time marked by the melting snow, the return of geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. This association frames her renewed attempt as a natural and cyclical event, aligning her personal resolve with the seasonal rebirth, and emphasizes her intention to pass the test during this period of renewal.
580	9444	4	2	"The author concludes the story in this manner to underscore Saeng's regained strength to confront a task she initially failed. The plant serves as both a memento of her past home and a marker of the passage of time. By planting it, Saeng creates a tangible reminder of her origins and the promise she makes to herself. Although she remarks, ""It's not a real one... Not like the kind we had before,"" revealing her longing for her former life, the new promise associated with the plant ultimately holds greater significance for her future."
581	9445	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify the commencement of a new day. This statement indicates that the protagonist will undertake the test on a day symbolic of new beginnings. For instance, the narrative aligns the return of the geese in spring and the budding of the hibiscus with her test, which is also scheduled for spring, thereby illustrating why the author chooses this concluding imagery.
582	9446	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to establish that the protagonist will take the driving test in the spring. This season serves as a symbol for the positive emotions she derives from the blooming of the winter hibiscus, connecting her personal endeavor to a time of renewal and hope.
583	9447	4	2	They ultimately returned, stepping into a world that existed in the corner, a world of childhood that felt precisely as she had always known it would, fulfilling her long-held expectations.
584	9448	4	2	The final paragraph serves several purposes. It establishes that the protagonist, Saeng, will attempt the test again when the timing is appropriate. This is paralleled with the return of the geese and the re-blooming of the hibiscus plant, suggesting a natural cycle of renewal. She believes it is the correct course of action and that the right moment will arrive for her to return and take the test. This passage effectively characterizes Saeng's approach to life and her resolve to try again when conditions feel right.
585	9449	4	2	"I believe the author concludes this way to highlight Saeng's determination to pass the test. The description of her ""tearstains"" and ""puffy eyes"" reveals how deeply she was affected by failing, an outcome linked to her purchasing the plant. Her declaration, ""I will take the test again,"" demonstrates that despite her failure, she is resolute in her goal to succeed. The pain of failing fuels her desire to try once more, underscoring that her determination is the essential quality that will ultimately lead to her success."
586	9450	4	2	"In the concluding paragraph, the author demonstrates Saeng's resolute determination and her successful adaptation to her new environment. Her declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" explicitly conveys her perseverance, while the surrounding context confirms her acclimatization to this different home."
587	9451	4	2	I believe the author ends the story this way to show Saeng was upset about moving and failing her driver's test. But then, by planting the flower and deciding to retake the test in the spring, she finds a way to move forward.
588	9452	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph, wherein Saeng vows to retake her test in the spring, serves to articulate a central theme of resilience. This is evidenced by Saeng's initial failure on her driver's test and her subsequent realization, prompted by the hibiscus, that perseverance is essential."
589	9453	4	2	The author employs the final sentence for emphasis, shifting Saeng's focus from the flower back to her test. This postponement until spring provides a future goal, reinforcing a theme of perseverance. The paragraph thus offers a concluding reflection from Saeng, providing a distinct and positive resolution to the narrative.
590	9454	4	2	The author likely concludes with this paragraph to symbolize a new beginning for Saeng, aligning her personal resolve with the seasonal rebirth of spring. This connection is made explicit when she states, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” linking her own renewal to that of the natural world.
591	9455	4	2	The author deliberately structures the concluding paragraph to compel readers to engage with the narrative in its entirety, thereby preventing them from predicting the story's resolution prematurely.
592	9456	4	2	The author's concluding message in the story posits that the momentum of teamwork and diligence should be perpetuated annually, notwithstanding any intervening changes that may have occurred.
593	9457	4	2	The author employs the concluding paragraph to evoke a sense of hope. Following a series of adversities, including a failed test and profound feelings of loss, Saeng experiences a moment of enlightenment upon discovering and planting the hibiscus. While she continues to miss her homeland, she finds comfort in her memories. Her declaration to retake the test signifies a renewed determination and self-confidence. By scheduling this attempt for the spring, a season archetypally associated with new beginnings and rebirth, the author symbolically aligns Saeng's personal renewal with the budding of the hibiscus, foreshadowing a more positive start for her.
594	9458	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's determination. It illustrates her intent to allow herself time to acclimate to her new life and environment, believing this process will foster a sense of belonging. She reasons that increased familiarity with her surroundings will enhance her likelihood of passing the test, demonstrating her resolute commitment to ultimately succeed.
595	9459	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to highlight the moment Saeng makes a personal vow to persist in her pursuit of a license. The hibiscus serves as a potent symbol of home, providing her with solace and fortitude. This connection is reinforced by her mother's observation about the winter hibiscus's resilience, which, despite its less showy flowers, possesses the strength to endure the cold. This analogy empowers Saeng, as the plant reminds her of home and instills in her the resolve to try again in the spring.
596	9460	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, a deliberate choice to underscore her persistent nature. This persistence is demonstrated through her repeated attempts to pass the examination and her broader effort to adapt to a new country. The specific quote illustrates her capacity to face failure with a determined resolve to try again. Furthermore, the immense challenge of relocating to a different nation and her subsequent self-assurance further exemplify this tenacious character trait. Ultimately, the concluding paragraph definitively serves to portray Saeng as a profoundly persistent individual.
597	9461	4	2	Authors often conclude stories with open-ended paragraphs to generate curiosity and encourage further engagement with their work. For instance, a book ending with a question can compel a reader to ponder the answer, while a statement that hints at an unresolved future can create a desire for a sequel to continue the narrative. This technique is intentionally employed to sustain the reader's interest beyond the final page, making them eager to discover what happens next in the story's universe.
598	9462	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves several narrative functions, primarily to convey hope, illustrate character growth, and signify impending change. Saeng's vow to retake the test instills a sense of optimism, effectively shifting the story's tone from the earlier troubled and sad mood to one of hopeful determination. This resolution highlights her significant personal development, demonstrating increased resilience. Furthermore, the imagery of returning geese, melting snow, and budding hibiscus symbolically foreshadows a new beginning, representing both seasonal change and the protagonist's internal transformation.
599	9463	4	2	The author concludes the story with that specific message to provide a resonant final point for the narrative while simultaneously creating an opening for a potential sequel. This technique ensures the story does not feel entirely complete, thereby inviting the reader to contemplate the characters' futures. The fundamental objective of such an ending is to provoke thought and leave a lasting impression on the audience, engaging them with the narrative long after they have finished reading.
600	9464	4	2	The inclusion of this paragraph signifies a new beginning for the character. It suggests that despite the significant hardships she has faced, her journey of adaptation is ongoing. This conclusion does not imply her struggles are over, but rather demonstrates her resolve to persevere through future challenges. The ending thus emphasizes a continuous process of resilience and personal growth in the face of adversity.
601	9465	4	2	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to underscore the plant's profound significance for Saeng. Having failed her driving test, Saeng was apprehensive about informing her mother of the failure and the nineteen-dollar purchase of a 'Dok Faeng-noi,' a plant reminiscent of their homeland. This is illustrated when Saeng, walking home after the test, encounters the familiar plant. The plant held deep meaning for her mother, who exclaimed with surprise and delight upon seeing it, asking where it was acquired. The concluding paragraph serves to highlight that, despite Saeng's struggles, her mother ultimately expressed appreciation for the plant, stating, ""It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,"" and affirming, ""I’m glad you got it."""
602	9466	4	2	"Authors often employ concluding sentences to encapsulate a story's core themes. In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes with Saeng's internal vow: ""when they come back... in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This demonstrates that Saeng recognizes her current unpreparedness and the need for further growth. Her mother's disappointment is evident upon learning of the expensive plant purchase, revealing Saeng's inexperience in making emotional, impulsive buys, as shown by the shocked exchange: ""I paid over nineteen dollars for it,"" and the mother's response, ""You what?"" The author uses this final paragraph to reinforce that Saeng's decision was emotionally driven and to show her resolve to try again the following year."
603	9467	4	2	The author concludes the passage with the specified statements to evoke a sense of anticipation and new beginnings. This is achieved through the imagery of awaiting spring and the return of geese. Spring universally symbolizes rebirth, and Saeng's decision to wait for it signifies her intent to start anew. The hibiscus plant further reinforces this theme of cyclical renewal, as it buds again each year, mirroring the second chance Saeng intends to seize. By aligning her personal renewal with the natural world's cycle, Saeng waits for spring, understanding it as a time when life regenerates, thus choosing that moment for her own new beginning.
604	9468	4	2	The author likely ended the story with that paragraph to indicate the moment Saeng believes she will be prepared to retake her driver's test. Prior to this resolution, she felt disheartened by her failure. Choosing spring provides her with an interim period to regain her composure and dedicate time to practice, thereby allowing her to approach the test with greater confidence and readiness when the new season arrives.
605	9469	4	2	"The author includes the sentence, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to underscore her determination. This resolution highlights her commitment to passing the test. Despite the challenges she faces adapting to a new environment, her desire to succeed is clear. Her plan to wait a year demonstrates a strategic decision to retry only after she has had sufficient time to prepare herself more thoroughly."
606	9470	4	2	The narrative follows Saeng, a girl who has recently relocated from Vietnam to the United States. She finds the new environment profoundly challenging and is frequently reminded of her homeland. The story concludes with Saeng confessing her test failure to her mother, who, understanding her daughter's profound homesickness, allows her to keep a hibiscus plant as a source of comfort. This final paragraph underscores Saeng's deep longing for Vietnam and her nascent resolve to persevere through the difficulties she faces.
607	9471	4	2	The author employs this concluding paragraph to enhance clarity for the reader and to create a more impactful and distinguished ending for the narrative.
608	9472	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that adaptation requires time. The imagery of returning geese and a budding hibiscus signifies that, with patience, Saeng will eventually be prepared to retake her test. This final thought is meticulously crafted to resonate with the story's overarching themes, providing a meaningful and coherent conclusion that underscores the necessity of time for growth and acclimation.
609	9473	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph is significant for its use of symbolism. The hibiscus represents Saeng's happiness and connection to her home, a symbol of comfort from her past. As she plants it, her senses reawaken to the comforting sounds of her new environment, suggesting she is beginning to find familiarity. Similarly, the geese symbolize a returning sense of belonging. The repeated references to home throughout the text establish it as a place of comfort, and this final sentiment shows Saeng gaining the confidence to move forward, which is why Ho chose to end on this note."
610	9474	4	2	I believe the author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring because it conveys a powerful, personal message about resilience. The paragraph suggests that failure is not permanent and that it is acceptable to try again when conditions are more favorable. It's a metaphor for the idea that everyone deserves a second chance and that growth often requires patience and the right moment to succeed.
611	9475	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph with this story to convey her profound contentment and consistent enjoyment of her life. She expresses a deep affection for her current circumstances, finding pleasure in observing the natural world, such as flowers, the return of geese, and the budding of a hibiscus, which highlights her appreciation for these simple, recurring joys.
612	9476	4	2	"The author employs this concluding story to reiterate the narrative's central themes. The statement, ""I will take that test again,"" refers to a previous failure in a test concerning her memory of her homeland, a place of great significance to her. The references to the geese returning and the hibiscus budding symbolize her growing familiarity with her new country, where once-strange elements are becoming almost familiar. This process, however, involves a temporary forgetting of her old life. The tactile experience with the hibiscus petal, which felt as she anticipated, reinforces that her foundational knowledge remains. Ultimately, the conclusion signifies that as seasons change, her memories will resurface, allowing her to retake and pass the test of her cultural knowledge."
613	9477	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to convey that the plant symbolizes new beginnings, reflecting Saeng's personal vow. Furthermore, the act of caring for the plant is presented as a lesson in responsibility, directly linked to her goal of obtaining a driver's license. This nurturing process is intended to teach her the patience necessary to learn from past mistakes and ultimately succeed.
614	9478	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's refusal to abandon her new life. Having failed her driver's test and initially feeling profound unhappiness and dissatisfaction with her new home, she was left feeling too unsettled to remain there and longed for her past. However, a conversation with her mother rekindled her determination. The final paragraph, with its promise to retake the test ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" serves to signify her restored hope and resolve to try again when she is better prepared."
615	9479	4	2	The author utilizes this concluding paragraph to establish a determined tone, illustrating Saeng's resolve to try again and succeed. This serves to impart a lesson to the reader about perseverance and the importance of not giving up. Furthermore, the ending cultivates a sense of curiosity, leaving the audience to wonder about the eventual outcome and whether she will ultimately pass her test.
616	9480	4	2	The concluding paragraph signifies that Saeng will undertake the test only after all other significant events have transpired, as it represents the final necessary step in her journey. It is reasonable to conclude that she will pass the examination, as this outcome is presented as an inevitable culmination of her efforts.
617	9481	4	2	I believe Saeng made that silent vow because the plant, having endured a difficult winter, begins to bud again once conditions improve. This cycle symbolizes her own hardship of moving to a new country; if this cherished plant can survive and flourish, then she too possesses the strength to persevere and ultimately succeed.
618	9482	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to underscore both her pain from failing in an unfamiliar place and her renewed resolve, which is inspired by the hibiscus. This flower, described as an ""old friend"" with distinctive petals, serves as a profound connection to her homeland. After failing her test, Saeng's attention is drawn to the plant, and it becomes her source of strength in the United States. Ultimately, Saeng aspires to embody the same resilience the flower demonstrates by surviving the harsh winter, applying that determination to her own challenge."
619	9483	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph establishes a parallel between the budding of the hibiscus and the restoration of Saeng's resolve. The hibiscus appears out of place, mirroring Saeng's own sense of displacement. It functions as a tangible link to her past, evoking childhood memories that help her process her present circumstances. By reconnecting with her heritage through the plant, Saeng finds the fortitude to face the future, vowing to retake her test with the return of spring.
620	9484	4	2	This quote illustrates that Saeng will achieve readiness for her test in due time. The returning geese signify a completed migration, and the budding hibiscus indicates an imminent bloom. Saeng draws a parallel from these natural cycles, believing that when spring arrives and these elements achieve their purpose, she too will have attained the necessary preparedness to succeed.
621	9485	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate the narrator's newfound willingness to acclimate to her new surroundings, mirroring the adaptability of flora and fauna. Geese, which favor warmth, migrate south for the winter. Saeng's source of comfort lies in @LOCATION1, a place imbued with childhood memories of her grandmother and the hibiscus. Accustomed to the flower's warm habitat, she resolves that upon the geese's return in spring and the flower's re-blooming, she will be prepared to further assimilate into @CAPS1 life and retake her driver's test. The geese and hibiscus function as symbolic memories of her cherished former home in @LOCATION1, and her reflection upon them strengthens her resolve to embrace the ways of her new life.
622	9486	4	2	Saeng felt a deep-seated longing to one day return to her homeland.
623	9487	4	2	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author uses the final paragraph to signify a pivotal change within Saeng. Her silent vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus, marks a commitment to renewal. This parallels the migratory birds; just as they depart only to return with the changing seasons, Saeng's spirit, which had retreated, is preparing to re-emerge. The imagery of the birds mingling with the hibiscus reinforces this connection to cyclical return and growth, suggesting she will re-engage with her new environment and pursue her goals when conditions are more favorable, which is the central meaning I derive from the story's conclusion."
624	9488	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that the protagonist, Saeng, has made a personal resolution. With the arrival of spring and the budding of new life, she silently commits to attempting her permit test once more, signaling a step forward in her personal journey.
625	9489	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's determination to not only survive but also find happiness in her new home. While her purchase may not have brought immediate joy, it represents an effort to cultivate a sense of belonging. Her declaration that she ""will take that test again"" reveals a desire to create a comfortable existence for herself. This concluding passage also emphasizes the resilience inherent in seasonal cycles, mirroring Saeng's intent to restart her efforts. She is presently content but looks ahead to spring as an opportunity for renewal, both for herself and her mother. The paragraph serves as a promise to forge a new path, with the plant symbolizing her impending transformation; she is prepared to explore her new world and pass her own tests, thereby earning her happiness and forging a true sense of home."
626	9490	4	2	The author concluded the paragraph to illustrate the presence of geese inhabiting the garden during the spring season.
627	9491	4	2	The narrative elucidates the difficulty of certain life changes while simultaneously highlighting the comfort derived from family and familiar objects from home, such as a flower. Ultimately, the story's purpose is to convey a significant personal experience from the author's life.
628	9492	4	2	The author concludes the narrative to demonstrate the little girl's resilience; she was not deterred by her initial lack of success and resolved to plant more flowers in the spring. This conclusion serves to communicate a theme of perseverance, suggesting that one should continue trying new approaches even after a setback.
629	9493	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding line, ""When they come back take that test again,"" serves to underscore Saeng's enduring hope and refusal to surrender. Having endured the depression associated with moving, she ultimately summons the resolve to persevere. Her emotional breakdown in the greenhouse, triggered by a plant reminiscent of home, releases her pent-up sadness, making the story's final, positive assertion of hope a fitting and insightful conclusion."
630	9494	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to affirm Saeng's indefatigable spirit. It demonstrates how a simple flower can provide profound encouragement, symbolizing something worth striving for and empowering her to persist. This final, powerful sentence effectively instills a sense of courage, leaving the reader with a lasting impression of her determination.
631	9495	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to convey the protagonist's resolve following her test failure. Her motivation is to succeed upon her next attempt, thereby avoiding disappointing her mother. This conclusion underscores her determination and desire for maternal approval.
632	9496	4	2	In my view, the narrator expresses a desire to return when the environment is beautiful again. She intends to wait for the snow to melt and the geese to reappear so she can witness the colorful flowers. If she passes her test on this subsequent occasion, she will then have the opportunity to drive past those very flowers. This is my interpretation of the character's meaning within the story.
633	9497	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate how Saeng embodies a spirit of perseverance, analogous to the enduring hibiscus plant. The narrative previously establishes that the winter hibiscus does not perish. The phrase ""the snows melt"" signifies the cyclical progression of seasons, a metaphor for Saeng's need to persist in her efforts. Similarly, the return of the geese symbolizes the importance of continual striving, reinforcing the theme that Saeng must keep endeavoring to pass her test."
634	9498	4	2	I believe the author incorporated the lines, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again,” into the final paragraph to powerfully convey Saeng’s internal commitment to future renewal and a second attempt. This silent vow effectively ties her personal resolve to the natural cycle, a stylistic choice that I find particularly compelling.
635	9499	4	2	I think the author concludes with that paragraph to imbue the story with greater thematic depth. The author likely intended to enhance the narrative's meaning by providing these final, resonant details, thereby offering a more profound and insightful conclusion for the reader.
636	9500	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate the parallel between Saeng's resolve to retake her examination and the hibiscus's cyclical renewal through budding. Saeng's determination to surmount her challenges is mirrored by the natural perseverance of the hibiscus flower and migrating geese against winter's adversity. Within the story, the hibiscus functions as a symbol for adapting to life's transformations. In this context, the winter hibiscus represents Saeng herself, as both must adapt to their circumstances—the flower to the cold season, and Saeng to the obstacles of a new nation and a forthcoming driving test.
637	9501	4	2	"In my view, the author includes the concluding paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed... I will take that test again,"" to demonstrate Saeng's commitment to adapting to her new environment while finally coming to terms with leaving her old one behind. This is poignantly illustrated earlier when she is overcome with emotion, unable to finish a simple comparison about her past without crying, which reveals her profound sorrow and initial inability to move on from her homeland. The final vow thus marks a significant turning point toward acceptance and resilience."
638	9502	4	2	The author likely chose to conclude the story with this specific paragraph to underscore Saeng's dedication to adapting to her new circumstances, thereby refuting any notion of her being a failure or a quitter. This concluding segment serves to highlight Saeng's resolute determination to achieve success and to fulfill the aspirations her mother holds for her. The paragraph effectively encapsulates these core themes, providing a fitting and purposeful end to the narrative.
639	9503	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify the glimmer of hope the winter hibiscus provides for Saeng. The plant serves as a comforting reminder of her native Vietnam, which brings her solace. Furthermore, the purchased hibiscus's ability to survive the winter, unlike the varieties from her homeland, becomes a potent symbol of Saeng's own resolve to adapt to her new country. The future blooming of the hibiscus thus metaphorically represents Saeng's own impending survival and adaptation, a process that will include her retaking the driving test.
640	9504	4	2	The author concludes her story with this statement for several significant reasons. The hibiscus, which will regain its strength after the harsh winter winds cease, serves as a direct parallel to Saeng's own anticipated resilience. Moreover, Saeng is allowing herself a necessary period to adjust and become accustomed to her new surroundings, setting a tangible goal for the future. She strongly identifies with the flower, which provides her with comfort and evokes cherished memories of her homeland and her grandmother, connecting her past happiness to her future resolve.
641	9505	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination. Upon seeing the hibiscus plant, she experiences joy, yet this sight also evokes memories of her grandmother, prompting her to attempt a personal test. This test represents her effort to move forward and not dwell on the past. Her subsequent declaration, ""I failed the test,"" reveals that this transition is more difficult than she had hoped. Therefore, the final paragraph, with its focus on the living hibiscus, signifies that Saeng is actively striving to adapt and is demonstrating resilience in her new environment."
642	9506	4	2	In the narrative, Saeng's sadness stems from her longing for her homeland and the hibiscus flower. The story concludes on a positive note as she finds a sense of peace by deciding to retake the test. This ending seems designed to resolve her internal conflict, replacing worry and anger with a constructive outlook. Her ability to transform a negative situation into a positive one is evident in her resolution to try again when the seasons change, symbolizing hope and renewal.
643	9507	4	2	The author employs the concluding sentence to signify Saeng's resolve to adapt to her new surroundings. This choice indicates that Saeng has chosen to progress beyond grief and sorrow, opting instead to continue with her life. This shift is highlighted after a moment where Saeng, having returned home and spoken with her mother, is overwhelmed by nostalgia. The final statement serves as a counterpoint to this sadness, demonstrating her conscious decision to move forward and accept her new reality, which is the author's primary reason for concluding the story in this manner.
644	9508	4	2	"Authors employ various techniques to conclude their stories. Minfong Ho concludes hers with a prophetic statement. One reason for this is that it reveals Saeng's future trajectory; for instance, the line ""I will take that test again"" informs the reader of her continued determination. A second reason is that it characterizes Saeng as resilient and beautiful, a quality underscored by the metaphorical comparison to the budding hibiscus within the text. These literary techniques provide crucial hints about the character's future and the story's potential continuation."
645	9509	4	2	The author likely included this element to illustrate the theme of change. Often, we overlook minor damages, yet these small changes can be just as significant as major ones. They represent pivotal moments that we must confront and manage. In addition, older challenges can persist. Everyone faces hardships, both large and small, and it is essential to overcome them all to progress.
646	9510	4	2	This paragraph serves a crucial function for the narrator, as it reveals Saeng's internal perspective. She prioritizes establishing her new home and tending to her flowers over immediate academic concerns like a test. Lacking a wide social circle at school, Saeng finds that her hibiscus plant serves as a poignant connection to the friends she left behind. The character resolves to retake the examination once her life regains a sense of normalcy and personal order. Ultimately, the narrator employs this section to provide direct insight into Saeng's emotional state and her process of adaptation.
647	9511	4	2	The author utilizes the concluding paragraph to provide resolution for the narrative. It effectively illustrates the connection between the natural world and the theme of adaptation, demonstrating how this relationship provided the protagonist with a sense of peace following her unsuccessful test attempt. This final segment ties these elements together to form a coherent and satisfying ending.
648	9512	4	2	The author concludes the narrative by describing the cyclical patterns of the seasons. As winter transitions into spring, the snow recedes, allowing trees and flowers to bloom in a variety of colors. Following this blossoming, leaves emerge and pollination occurs. Subsequently, as the season shifts from late summer into fall, the foliage begins to wither, change color, and eventually fall from the branches. This cycle perpetually continues, culminating once more in the arrival of snowfall.
649	9513	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, a moment that signifies her resilience. This parallels her mother's description of the 'winter hibiscus' as a plant strong enough to endure the cold, serving as a direct symbol for Saeng's own capacity to overcome adversity. Her failure on the driver's test and her relocation to a new country are the specific challenges she must surmount. The spring setting for her planned retest symbolizes a period of renewal, a personal rebirth after a figurative winter. The paragraph's significance lies in its portrayal of Saeng's commitment to persevere through present difficulties and face future ones. The melting snow represents the eventual thawing of her current setbacks, allowing her to approach the test with a transformed outlook. This concluding segment firmly establishes that Saeng will not be defeated by her circumstances.
650	9514	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph containing Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring. This resolution is prompted by her initial failure, which was compounded by an inability to locate specific items from her past, such as a fine-toothed comb, a hibiscus hedge, a well, and the memory of her gentle grandmother. The narrative implies that these lost elements, symbolic of her heritage and identity, will somehow become accessible again with the arrival of spring, the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus, thus enabling her to try anew.
651	9515	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's perspective on the future. This conclusion is fitting, as it draws upon numerous narrative elements and demonstrates Saeng's character growth. Her reference to ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" signifies a growing acceptance and even affection for her new homeland. The geese, once perceived as strange, are now familiar. The hibiscus, a vestige of her past, has been adapted to her present circumstances. Saeng's vow to ""take that test again"" in the spring reveals her determination to thrive despite her losses—her home, her grandmother, and her former way of life. The paragraph effectively intertwines the threads of her past and present, displaying an optimistic attitude toward the future and concluding the story on a note of hopeful resolution."
652	9516	4	2	"The author uses the concluding paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's adjustment to her new life. The statement ""I will take that test again"" signifies her resolve to persevere. Furthermore, the phrase ""when they come back,"" referring to the flowers in the next season, suggests she will reflect on her memories of her homeland and her grandmother. This ending shows how she is processing her past while looking forward to the future, effectively concluding her journey of adaptation."
653	9517	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to convey Saeng's emotional state regarding the changing seasons. Contrary to indicating happiness, the description of the snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding is presented to show that Saeng was not pleased by these developments. This final passage serves to underscore her lingering discontent within her new environment, providing a definitive conclusion to her character's arc.
654	9518	4	2	The narrator portrays the girl as having developed a significant interest in plants, which suggests she finds fascination in the new world around her. The diverse and beautiful blooming plants of the season captivate her. From this perspective, the girl appears to be an adventurous individual who enjoys exploring new environments and discovering the unique characteristics that the world has to offer, indicating a curious and open-minded nature.
655	9519	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's resilience and her capacity to overcome challenges in her new home. Her declaration, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signifies her intent to persevere. She will retake the driving test, demonstrating a commitment to adapting to her new circumstances and succeeding in her new life. This resolution affirms her determination to progress forward."
656	9520	4	2	The author concludes the narrative for several distinct reasons. Primarily, it serves to illustrate Saeng's resolute character. Her vow to retake the examination demonstrates a determined spirit and a refusal to capitulate. Furthermore, the author's intent is to underscore the significance of Saeng's personal development and the defining aspects of her personality.
657	9521	4	2	Minfong Ho selected this concluding paragraph to highlight Saeng's resolve to eventually pass her driver's test. While her initial failure caused her distress and evoked a sense of homesickness, much like the familiar plant did, this final passage shows her commitment to overcoming the challenges of her new environment. She resolves to compose herself and achieve her objective, mirroring the resilience she observes.
658	9522	4	2	The author incorporated this sentence to emphasize Saeng's determined nature. She possesses a persistent character, resolved to continue striving until she succeeds regardless of the difficulty. This mirrors the winter hibiscus she noticed by the roadside, a plant that appeared out of place yet was fighting to survive. While being strong when one can only rely on oneself is challenging, Saeng draws determination from her setback and the symbolic perfection of the resilient flower.
659	9523	4	2	In the story's conclusion, Saeng declares she will retake the test when spring returns, symbolically linking her own journey to that of the hibiscus. The author uses this passage to present the hibiscus as a metaphor for survival. Like Saeng, the plant is from another place, and it comes to represent her own capacity to endure in a new land. The statement implicitly conveys that if the hibiscus can survive the winter, then she can as well, serving as a conclusion that captures her tentative but growing belief in her own resilience.
660	9524	4	2	The author employs this final paragraph to convey Saeng's desire for strength and perseverance despite her feelings of homesickness. For instance, Saeng associated her emotional reaction to the hibiscus with her failure, yet she also believes in her capacity to grow stronger with time. This concluding thought solidifies her commitment to personal growth and overcoming adversity.
661	9525	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to encapsulate Saeng's profound realization and newfound resolve. Initially distraught after failing her test, Saeng encounters a flower that powerfully evokes memories of her homeland. This small botanical specimen becomes an essential acquisition, representing a tangible fragment of her former home within her new environment. Witnessing the flower's tenacity in surviving a harsh winter, Saeng internalizes its resilience, thereby cultivating the determination to retake her examination. Her vow to try again is thus directly inspired by the flower's survival and her poignant recognition of memory's enduring significance.
662	9526	4	2	The author drew inspiration from the flower, a symbol of resilience capable of enduring severe winters and adapting to unfamiliar surroundings. This botanical metaphor prompted the author's resolve to confront and surmount personal challenges, mirroring the flower's annual triumph over adversity.
663	9527	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph is underpinned by the interconnected themes of memory, promise, and life. Memory is central, as Saeng's longing for her native country fuels her actions. Promise manifests in her vow to retake the test with the return of spring. Life is symbolized by her act of purchasing and planting the hibiscus, ensuring its survival and fostering a new beginning. These three concepts are thus synthesized in the finale: memories will be revived alongside the promises made and the new life she cultivates through the hibiscus, which itself serves as a potent vessel of her past.
664	9528	4	2	The author selected this conclusion to reflect the narrative's shift into the colder season, a period during which the surrounding plant life, including the flowers, was succumbing to the frost.
665	9529	4	2	The author likely concludes with this statement to emphasize the character's profound determination to pass her examination. Her personal vow to retake the test upon the geese's return and the snow's melting underscores this deep-seated resolve. This conclusion is further justified by the significance of her initial failure, an event of considerable personal importance that fuels her eagerness for eventual success, which is why the author included this resolution in the narrative.
666	9530	4	2	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" following her unsuccessful driver's test, Saeng encounters a flower during her walk home that evokes memories of her former homeland. She purchases the plant and brings it to her new residence, where her mother is tending the garden. Together, they plant the hibiscus. As they complete this task, a flock of geese passes overhead, prompting Saeng's realization that her surroundings, once unfamiliar, have now become familiar. She concludes by resolving to retake the test in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud. She anticipates that by that time, she too will have grown and acclimated, ready to face the challenge again, just as the natural world is ready to renew itself."
667	9531	4	2	The author employs this technique to establish a parallel between the plant and the protagonist. The narrative suggests that the character's confidence will be restored in tandem with the plant's blooming. This concluding paragraph is used by the author to imbue the story with a sense of purpose and thematic depth.
668	9532	4	2	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to underscore its central themes and enhance its overall appeal. This technique serves to sustain reader engagement, creating a desire to see the narrative's potential future developments, even as the story itself reaches its conclusion.
669	9533	4	2	I believe the author included this final paragraph to powerfully illustrate the protagonist's determination to pass the driving test. It clearly communicates how deeply significant this goal is to her, serving as the author's method for emphasizing her resolve and the personal meaning of her endeavor.
670	9534	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight the connection between nature and the girl. The protagonist's statement—that she will retake the test when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds—aligns her personal renewal with the cyclical rebirth of nature. Spring symbolizes renewal: the returning geese and the melting snow signify change, while the budding plant represents new life. The character has decided that she will begin again in sync with this period of symbolic renewal, mirroring nature's own cycle of rebirth.
671	9535	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's resolve to retake the test in a different season. It illustrates her vow to attempt the test again in the spring, after the winter has passed, suggesting that the seasonal conditions may have contributed to her initial failure and that success is more likely once the snow has melted.
672	9536	4	2	The author included the concluding paragraph to reinforce the protagonist's intention to retake the test under more favorable seasonal conditions. Furthermore, this paragraph serves to confirm the reader's comprehension of the novel's central themes and the author's intended message, thereby providing a clearer and more definitive ending to the narrative.
673	9537	4	2	The narrative concludes by mirroring its beginning, creating a sense of resolution. A particularly resonant moment is the return of the birds, which coincides with the reappearance of flowers, symbolizing a cyclical return to life and hope that effectively brings the story to a close.
674	9538	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to underscore the determination required for Saeng and her mother to adapt and survive in a new country. Despite the hardships, including Saeng's failure on a test, they persevere by maintaining connections to their homeland, such as cultivating familiar plants like flowers, hot peppers, and bitter melons, whose flavors they cherish regardless of others' opinions.
675	9539	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's unwavering determination to pass the test, portraying her vow as a testament to her resilience. This ending creates narrative tension, compelling the reader to wonder if she will ultimately succeed. The specific vow to retake the test in the spring, as the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, firmly establishes her resolve and provides a hopeful conclusion to her story.
676	9540	4	2	The author concluded the narrative in this manner to present an alternative perspective on Saeng. The intention was to illustrate how Saeng's mother would be present in the garden throughout every season, with the changing landscape reflecting Saeng's own evolving emotional states.
677	9541	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to demonstrate how a memory can foster determination. For instance, after failing her driver's test, Saeng encounters a hibiscus that reminds her of her former home. While planting it, she observes geese with a newfound sense of recognition. These two reminders of her different homes provide comfort, reinforcing her ability to adapt and cherish her memories, which in turn strengthens her resolve to pass the test.
678	9542	4	2	The underlying message advocates for perseverance and continuous effort, drawing a parallel to the resilient regrowth of plants during the spring season. This comparison emphasizes the importance of not surrendering in the face of adversity.
679	9543	4	2	The author concludes with that specific paragraph to signify a personal vow to retake and pass the driving test. This commitment is aligned with the spring season, a time of new beginnings symbolized by the budding hibiscus. Making such a promise to oneself is a powerful mechanism for achieving goals and initiating necessary action.
680	9544	4	2	The reference pertains to Saeng's daily life and routines, as well as the climatic conditions characteristic of the region she inhabits. This provides context for understanding her environment and the activities it entails.
681	9545	4	2	The author deliberately chose to conclude the narrative with that specific phrase to convey the protagonist's resolve to await the following year and repeat the entire process. This indicates her intention to wait for the opportunity, undertake the endeavor once more, and demonstrate her capability to succeed again, thereby signifying her acclimatization to her current environment.
682	9546	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate a new beginning in the spring. Just as flowers bloom and bud anew during that season, the protagonist herself will transform into a renewed and improved individual, which is the central reason for this particular ending.
683	9547	4	2	The author utilizes the concluding paragraph to signify Saeng's determination to retake the test and secure a fresh start. This serves as a lesson to the reader that initial failure should not deter one from trying again. Furthermore, the hibiscus functions as a symbol for the protagonist; her failure during winter and dissatisfaction with her circumstances parallel the plant's dormancy, while the budding hibiscus in spring represents her impending new beginning with the test and her adaptation to a new environment, much like the flower.
684	9548	4	2	The author selected this paragraph as the conclusion because it invites reader interpretation and decision-making. It deliberately refrains from specifying the test's purpose or outcome, leaving those elements for the reader to determine, while also generating curiosity about future events. The story's ending is intentionally ambiguous, allowing for a multitude of meanings that can vary significantly from one reader to another, thereby completing the narrative through open-ended engagement.
685	9549	4	2	The author concluded with that paragraph because it specifies when the protagonist intends to retake the test and initiate changes within her evolving life. Her sadness in the story stems from failing the test and a longing for home; success in the spring could motivate her to embrace changes and establish a life in her new surroundings, which is the rationale for this concluding segment.
686	9550	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's ultimate acclimatization to her new environment. Following a narrative largely preoccupied with her past, this final section signifies her acceptance of her present circumstances. The imagery of spring and returning geese, for instance, indicates her growing familiarity with the natural rhythms of her new world. Furthermore, the author employs this paragraph to convey a sense of emotional release. Having been psychologically constrained by memories of her former life, Saeng is finally unburdened. The author's decision to conclude on this note is effective, as the tranquil scene of birds in flight parallels Saeng's own liberation from past sorrows and her full integration into a new society.
687	9551	4	2	This final paragraph reveals a significant transformation in Saeng. Initially, the hibiscus plant evoked feelings of despair and painful nostalgia for her homeland. However, upon returning home and observing its roots securely buried in the soil, she discovers a renewed sense of determination. The flower functions as a metaphor for Saeng herself; just as the plant adapts to survive a harsh winter, she too must endure difficult circumstances. The roots symbolize her past, which, while submerged, remains an integral part of her identity, whereas the blossom represents the potential for a new life in a foreign country. Author Minfong Ho utilizes this personification of the hibiscus to powerfully articulate this theme of resilience and adaptation, which is the core reason for the paragraph's inclusion.
688	9552	4	2	"The author concludes the narrative with this specific paragraph to underscore Saeng's resolute determination and to create a symbolic link between her driver's test and the hibiscus plant. The text suggests that as the surrounding world reawakens in spring, Saeng too will achieve her goal, drawing motivation from this environmental renewal. Throughout the story, Saeng's emotional state is profoundly influenced by her surroundings. A clear example occurs in the greenhouse, where the lush vegetation transports her back to her childhood, described as ""a hot, moist world exploding with greenery."" This immersion in a sensory-rich environment reconnects her with forgotten memories, illustrating how external stimuli catalyze her internal resolve and foreshadow her eventual success."
689	9553	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng seeks and finds solace in the hibiscus plant following her failure on a driving test. The plant serves as a tangible connection to her homeland and past experiences. Despite her initial failure, she resolves to study and attempt the test again. This determination is symbolically linked to the life cycle of the hibiscus, which appears to die in the winter only to blossom beautifully again in the spring. Saeng identifies with this cycle of rebirth, perceiving in it a parallel to her own capacity for a new beginning and eventual success on the test. The author includes the paragraph where Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring to solidify this connection between personal renewal and the natural world."
690	9554	4	2	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" to emphasize her newfound self-belief and patience. This ending signifies that Saeng recognizes a future moment of opportunity is forthcoming. She is not making a rash decision but rather affirming her confidence that, with the changing season, she will be prepared to pass the examination. The resolution thus encapsulates her character development, moving from defeat to a quiet, determined optimism rooted in the certainty of cyclical renewal and personal growth."
691	9555	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the protagonist's intention to retake her failed test, believing the hibiscus will provide the fortitude to succeed. It is posited that she purchased the plant following her initial failure, viewing its eventual blossoming as a natural timetable signaling her readiness to attempt the examination once more.
692	9556	4	2	The author utilizes the concluding paragraph as a meaningful summary of the narrative's events. Saeng's experiences at the florist are synthesized into a resolve resembling determination. Her initial sadness stemmed from failing a driving test, and in the final passage, she vows to retake it upon the hibiscus's budding. This plant, which she purchased, will bloom in spring, coinciding with the melting snow. This final segment allows Saeng to process her winter nostalgia; the sight of geese flying south evokes sadness, yet also ignites an internal resolve, compelling her to pledge a renewed attempt when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus flowers.
693	9557	4	2	The final paragraph expresses the anticipation of a new beginning. With the end of winter and the arrival of spring, the hibiscus will return, evoking a sense of home. The return of the geese also signals that she will retake her quiz. For her, this represents a fresh start and the hope of passing. The reappearance of the beloved hibiscus suggests she will perform much better. Ultimately, the passage signifies the arrival of a new and promising season.
694	9558	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring to illustrate the hibiscus's symbolic importance and its role in her eventual success. The plant's struggle to bud and survive the winter parallels Saeng's own struggle to pass her driving test. References to the melting snow and returning geese further this connection, depicting a shared cycle of overcoming adversity. For instance, the line ""Like the geese. She lifted her head..."" signifies her determination to rise and conquer her challenge. Ultimately, the concluding vow powerfully underscores the parallel struggles of the flower, the geese, and Saeng to surmount their obstacles and complete their journeys."
695	9559	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph for its thematic significance, conveying that just as nature receives its opportunities, so too will Saeng. The geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, and she will have another chance to take her driving test. This is foreshadowed when Saeng’s mother praises the plant's resilience, stating, ""But it's strong enough to make it through the cold months,"" implying that Saeng is equally strong and will receive a second chance, which is the fundamental reason for the story's concluding sentence."
696	9560	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the cyclical nature of the seasons, which represent change and renewal. The narrative begins with a new season, signifying a shift, and the title ""Winter Hibiscus"" reflects this transition. After the vibrant spring, with its fragrant and beautiful flowers, comes winter, a time when plants die and things are no longer as they once were. This seasonal metaphor underscores the story's theme of impermanence and transformation."
697	9561	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the character Saeng demonstrates resilience by persisting in her efforts. The concluding paragraph, though brief, carries profound significance. Saeng's declaration that she will retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, conveys a powerful message of perseverance, openness to new opportunities, and a enduring connection to her homeland. The author's choice to end the story in this manner effectively reinforces its central theme, offering considerable insight through a concise and inspiring statement."
698	9562	4	2	The author's decision to conclude with the final paragraph is multifaceted. Saeng's resolution to retake her driving test in the spring utilizes the archetypal symbolism of the season, representing new beginnings. This ending suggests Saeng will have a fresh opportunity to succeed and to better adapt to her life in her new location. The hibiscus plant, which evokes memories of her former home, serves as a symbol of hope. The plant's mention in the concluding paragraph implies it will provide her with the fortitude needed to pass her test and adjust to her new environment while cherishing her past in Vietnam.
699	9563	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the protagonist's decision to try again, paralleling the renewal of nature. Just as plants must regrow their petals and geese must return to rebuild their homes and find food, the character resolves to retake her test when these natural cycles begin anew in the spring. This connection emphasizes a theme of patience and resilience tied to the rhythms of the natural world.
700	9564	4	2	"The author included this concluding paragraph to mark a shift in the character's actions and the arrival of winter. After going inside for dinner, she acknowledges she will not see the garden again until another day, as the cold season means she will no longer play outside. Her statement, ""In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" encapsulates her resolve. This quotation is central to understanding why the author chose this paragraph to end the story, highlighting a promise of future effort aligned with the coming spring."
701	9565	4	2	The narrator concludes the story with this element because it functions as the narrative's resolution. A solution is logically placed at the end of a sequence, which is the structural reason for its placement there.
702	9566	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng has not surrendered and has instead discovered a meaningful pursuit. This is illustrated by the act of planting the winter hibiscus and tamping down the soil, an action immediately followed by the overhead flight of Canada geese, symbolizing a forward-looking perspective and providing a fitting conclusion to her character's journey.
703	9567	4	2	The author selected this concluding passage to underscore a profound appreciation for nature's resilience. After failing her driving test, Saeng discovers and presents a winter hibiscus to her mother. The mother's observation that the flower, while less conventionally pretty, is strong enough to survive the cold serves as a metaphor for Saeng's own potential for growth. This symbolism is reinforced by the imagery of migrating geese, which promises a cyclical return and a new opportunity for success in the coming spring, thus concluding the story on a note of hope and renewal.
704	9568	4	2	The author's conclusion suggests that the protagonist will attempt the test again when the weather improves, as the current unpleasant conditions are unsuitable for such an endeavor, thereby framing the ending around the promise of a future opportunity under more favorable circumstances.
705	9569	4	2	This final statement is powerful in its depiction of resilience. Despite failing her driver's test, Saeng realizes the necessity of strength and patience. The imagery of the returning geese and the melting snow foreshadows her own determined return to pass the test. Her purchase of the hibiscus, a costly reminder of Vietnam, highlights her displacement and longing. As a tropical flower, its eventual blooming in spring will coincide with her own readiness to try again, symbolizing personal growth and the hope for a successful future.
706	9570	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph establishes a parallel between the protagonist's resolve and the life cycle of the hibiscus plant. The narrative suggests that the character's decision to retake the test is contingent upon the plant's survival and subsequent blooming in the spring. This connection implies that the plant's resilience through the harsh winter serves as a metaphor for the personal fortitude required to overcome a significant challenge. The character draws confidence from the natural world, believing that if the plant can endure and flourish, she too can persevere and succeed in her endeavor. The story thus concludes by linking human determination to the symbolic endurance of nature.
707	9571	4	2	In my view, the author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test to signify a broader personal adaptation, not merely the passing of an exam. The core of Saeng's struggle is her difficult adjustment to a new environment, a point underscored by the powerful description of her weeping in the greenhouse, overwhelmed by a sense of loss for her past life. I believe failing the test was merely the final catalyst for this emotional release, a manifestation of accumulated stress. Therefore, her statement about the budding hibiscus symbolizes a commitment to overcome her profound dislocation and move forward, making the test a milestone in her larger journey of acclimatization.
708	9572	4	2	The author's choice to conclude the story with this specific paragraph is highly effective. For Saeng, the hibiscus holds deep personal significance, and its anticipated bloom in the spring represents an ideal time for her to attempt the driving test again. This seasonal symbolism provides a natural and emotionally resonant framework for her renewed effort. The blossoming of the flower would likely instill in her the confidence needed to face a challenge she had previously failed. Consequently, the paragraph serves as a fitting and optimistic conclusion, tying her personal growth to the cyclical renewal of nature.
709	9573	4	2	"The author concludes the story this way to illustrate that Saeng, like the plant, will grow and adapt with the changing seasons. Having recently moved to a new country and failed her driver's test, she feels disheartened. However, the hibiscus, which reminds her of home, becomes a source of strength. Her mother's observation that this type of hibiscus is ""strong enough to make it through the winter"" provides a direct parallel for Saeng. She internalizes this, reasoning that if the delicate flower can endure a harsh winter, then she too can persevere and establish herself in a new land."
710	9574	4	2	"In ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, aligning her personal resolve with the plant's life cycle. Earlier, Saeng was drawn to the hibiscus because it vividly recalled her childhood world, prompting her to purchase it. The urgency to plant it before bad weather, a task she failed to complete in time, mirrors her initial failure of the test. Her decision to try again is therefore strategically linked to the hibiscus's anticipated bloom, a time of renewal and second chances. This parallel between human endeavor and natural rebirth is the central reason for the story's concluding paragraph."
711	9575	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph in this manner to illustrate the protagonist's unwavering resolve. This determination is evident from her silent vow to retake the examination in the spring, a decision that prioritizes perseverance over past disappointments. Ultimately, this demonstration of resilience is the central reason for the paragraph's concluding statement.
712	9576	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the narrative concludes with Saeng's internal vow: ""When they come back... I will take the test again."" This resolution provides her with the necessary time to adapt to her new surroundings, offering a measure of comfort. The author employs figurative language, as the returning geese serve as a metaphor for Saeng herself, becoming ""almost familiar"" in their cyclical pattern, which mirrors her own gradual process of acclimatization."
713	9577	4	2	The scene is nearly spring-like, just as he described. The snow is melting, the geese are returning, and the hibiscus plant is beginning to bud. All around, the grass is growing, the trees are sprouting new leaves, and birds are singing, completing the portrait of an emerging season.
714	9578	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the story concludes with a significant paragraph featuring Saeng's silent vow to retake her test in the spring. The author selects this ending because Saeng, having relocated to a new country, is outside her comfort zone and yearns for familiar elements like the hibiscus flower. She decides to wait until she feels more at home and settled before attempting the test again. This is supported by the text, which notes her growing familiarity with her new environment ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" indicating her gradual adjustment and acceptance of her new life."
715	9579	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph detailing Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to provide the audience with a point for reflection. This conclusion enhances the narrative by imparting a more dramatic and thoughtful effect, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
716	9580	4	2	"The author's concluding passage serves to illustrate the protagonist's resilience and unwavering resolve. Her confident references to future events demonstrate a belief in her ability to endure until spring, while her discussion of the test underscores her determination. The specific use of the verb ""vowed"" conveys a solemn commitment to fulfilling her stated intention."
717	9581	4	2	The author chose this sentence to conclude the story to communicate that the character finds greater pleasure in the natural world than in the academic environment.
718	9582	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph because the flower serves as a recurring motif throughout the narrative, and the statement that the test will be retaken upon the hibiscus's budding provides a definitive resolution.
719	9583	4	2	The author employs this concluding paragraph to project events beyond the narrative's immediate scope, signifying that the protagonist will commence anew and reconstruct the greenhouse once the snow has melted.
720	9584	4	2	"I believe the author concludes the story this way to emphasize the character's sheer determination. Furthermore, I see it as symbolizing adaptation; just as the seasons change, so too will Saeng, as she prepares to retake the test. The environment is becoming ""almost familiar to her now,"" indicating that normality is returning and she, like everything else, will successfully adjust."
721	9585	4	2	The author employs this concluding passage to impart a sense of hope, functioning as a positive resolution to an otherwise somber narrative. It serves as the author's definitive reflection and provides a fitting terminus for the story.
722	9586	4	2	The author concludes the narrative at this juncture because it marks the protagonist's decision to resume cultivating plants, symbolizing her intent to embark on a new beginning.
723	9587	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng, despite her failure, is resolved to attempt the test again in the spring. Her mother's supportive actions, such as preparing a meal, provide comfort and reinforce Saeng's confidence to retake the examination with renewed assurance.
724	9588	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's emotional and psychological shift. Having calmed and accepted her circumstances, she views her new country with fresh perspective, no longer burdened by her test failure and instead focused on the future opportunity to try again, which signifies her positive transformation.
725	9589	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to signify her commitment to a new beginning. The hibiscus plant, a poignant reminder of her past, and her mother's reaction collectively instill in her a renewed sense of hope, which she symbolically links to the budding flower and the returning geese as a metaphor for a fresh start.
726	9590	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination, which persists despite her sadness. While she misses Vietnam, her resolve to retake the test the following year remains firm. The diction in the concluding passage effectively conveys a sense of hope and future anticipation. Although Saeng is disappointed by her failure, the purchase of the plant serves as a comforting reminder of her homeland. This final paragraph thus expresses both Saeng's persistent character and the story's overarching hopeful tone.
727	9591	4	2	The author selected this specific paragraph for the conclusion because it encapsulates a pivotal thought for the character Saeng, representing the story's central theme. It may also have been chosen as it signifies Saeng's ultimate reflection on her former life and memories before her current circumstances, thereby providing a definitive endpoint to her narrative.
728	9592	4	2	"The author concludes with the line, ""In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" because Saeng failed her initial test. Her failure was partly due to spending money on a fast-food item instead of saving for the specific flower her mother requested. Consequently, Saeng's decision to retake the test is driven by her desire to succeed and ultimately bring happiness to her mother."
729	9593	4	2	The author likely ended the story with that sentence to provide an uplifting feeling after a series of sad events. Saeng experienced homesickness, used flowers for comfort, was disappointed by her driving test failure, and found solace in a plant. The final sentence thus serves as a comforting note, offering a sense of relief to the reader after the narrative's emotional challenges.
730	9594	4	2	"The author employs the final lines to establish a hopeful tone, which in turn reinforces a central theme. These concluding remarks significantly impact the reader as the last impression from the text. Within the story, Saeng's reference to the time ""when the snow melts"" uses snow as a symbol for the sorrow she has endured since leaving her home, evidenced by her emotional breakdown. Spring signifies an archetypal rebirth, implying her sorrow will dissipate and creating hope for future happiness. Furthermore, Saeng's mention of the hibiscus budding connects to a comforting symbol of her homeland, which she regarded as an ""old friend."" The plant's blooming suggests her new life will flourish as she finds security, fostering a tone of hope for future comfort. Her promise to retake the test despite her initial failure demonstrates optimism and a willingness to confront challenges, ultimately conveying a life lesson about courage and resilience."
731	9595	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with this paragraph to underscore the symbolic significance of the plant. The protagonist, Saeng, having recently emigrated from Vietnam, experiences profound homesickness. Her failure of a driver's test compounds her distress. Upon encountering the winter hibiscus, she is vividly reminded of her homeland. The plant evokes cherished memories of her grandmother and specific details from her former life, such as a fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb and a hibiscus hedge whose soft red petals would fall into her well water. The text describes Saeng's ""shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral,"" highlighting the hibiscus's deep emotional resonance. The author's choice of ending thus illustrates how the winter hibiscus serves as a source of comfort for Saeng, providing the encouragement needed to persevere and attempt the driver's test again."
732	9596	4	2	"After reading ""Winter Hibiscus,"" it's clear that Saeng is a determined person who appreciates nature and is resolved to pass her driving test. The author ends the story with this paragraph because, at the start, Saeng fails her test. On her walk home, she discovers a familiar plant that transports her back to her childhood. If she hadn't failed, she would not have taken that walk and made this discovery. The author wanted to ensure we remember that this pivotal moment of connection was a direct result of her initial setback, an event that otherwise would not have occurred."
733	9597	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng will have another opportunity in the spring. The narrative suggests that Saeng will identify with the blooming hibiscus and resolve to retake her test. This conclusion creates a sense of open-endedness, indicating that Saeng's story continues beyond this point. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles to adapt to change, and while her mother offers comfort, the final paragraph, like the coming of winter, implies a period of waiting. Ultimately, it affirms that Saeng will have her chance to take the driver's test again with the arrival of spring.
734	9598	4	2	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph in which Saeng vows to retake the test ""when they come back,"" drawing a parallel between her need for time and the hibiscus's growth cycle. Saeng, having performed poorly on her test, resolves to try again after the snow melts and spring arrives. As a recent immigrant, she initially feels isolated and yearns for her home, yet she internally acknowledges that she can succeed if given sufficient time. The hibiscus, which reminds her of flowers from her native country, ultimately helps her realize the necessity of releasing the past and embracing her present life."
735	9599	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's maturity and her newfound confidence in her ability to retake the test. The sentence where ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" indicates a moment of deep reflection, and the phrasing suggests a commitment to beginning anew. This silent vow encapsulates her resolve to move forward, marking a significant step in her personal growth and adaptation to her new circumstances."
736	9600	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with a sentence describing the protagonist's intention to retake her test upon the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, as these elements function symbolically. The geese signify change, mirroring Saeng's own environmental transition, while the hibiscus serves as a reminder of her homeland and its budding represents the new life she must forge. Ultimately, the concluding sentence draws a parallel between Saeng's life and the natural symbolism of the geese and hibiscus, illustrating her personal journey and adaptation.
737	9601	4	2	Saeng felt a surge of happiness as the snow began to melt, eagerly anticipating the return of spring. She looked forward to seeing the animals active in her garden once more and the beautiful geese flying back after their long migration. Her excitement for the regrowth of everything around her gave her confidence that she would pass her test this time, marking a new beginning.
738	9602	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's anticipation for winter's end. Following the season, Saeng plans to retake a test and resume planting flowers. She holds a particular fondness for the hibiscus and is concerned for its survival through the cold. This waiting period underscores her hope for renewal and a fresh start with the coming spring.
739	9603	4	2	"The author concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate how the flower provided the girl with emotional strength. Uprooted and in a new environment, the girl misses the beautiful flowers from her homeland, whose absence causes her distress. The flowers were a source of comfort, as seen when she becomes too upset to even say the word ""home"" while discussing an artificial substitute. The anticipated blossoming of a real flower in spring symbolizes the solace and confidence she needs to face retaking her test, completing her emotional arc."
740	9604	4	2	"The author's conclusion effectively conveys the protagonist's emotional state. The statement, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signifies her transformation into a new person. For instance, her decision to retake the test represents a willingness to change. Furthermore, it indicates her readiness to embrace new challenges, with the test itself serving as a metaphor for this new beginning. This is the fundamental interpretation of the concluding passage."
741	9605	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng retains hope. This hopeful conclusion invites the reader to imagine a future for Saeng, perhaps one where she cultivates a large, successful garden and ultimately passes her test.
742	9606	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to unify the story's central themes. It suggests that with the arrival of spring, a time of renewal, Saeng will find the resolve to retake her test. This final section underscores the characters' adaptation, drawing a parallel between their resilience and the hardy winter hibiscus described by Saeng's mother. The hibiscus, while less visually striking, possesses the strength to endure a harsh climate, symbolizing that Saeng and her mother will likewise adapt and survive in their new environment, creating new possibilities for themselves.
743	9607	4	2	The author's conclusion illustrates that Saeng requires time to heal from her test failure before attempting it again. The narrative shows Saeng's growing familiarity with her new surroundings, as things once strange have become almost familiar. Furthermore, she has healed from the profound sorrow of leaving Vietnam, now able to recall memories without pain. This established pattern of recovery suggests that, just as she adapted to a new country, Saeng will heal from this setback and eventually retake the test free from the burden of her initial failure.
744	9608	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph highlights Saeng's resilience and capacity to adapt. Her mother's comment about the winter hibiscus, which is not as pretty but is strong enough to survive the cold, serves as a metaphor for Saeng herself. The move was a scarring experience, yet she possesses the strength to endure this change. Similarly, having failed her test, she will study harder and persevere. With self-belief, courage, and effort, Saeng will not give up but will instead successfully establish herself in her new life.
745	9609	4	2	The paragraph in which Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring is significant for several reasons. The winter season has rendered her garden dormant, and spring symbolizes a time for new growth and beginnings. Her commitment to the test is thus linked to this natural cycle of renewal, representing her determination to start anew. Her connection to growing things further reinforces this, as passing the test is a necessary step toward cultivating a sustainable life in her new home.
746	9610	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes with a significant internal vow from the protagonist, Saeng, who resolves to retake her test in the spring, coinciding with the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus. This final paragraph illustrates the character's successful adaptation to her new country and her resolute determination to improve and strengthen over time. The symbolism indicates that Saeng will be prepared to face the challenge again with renewed hope and a greater likelihood of success."
747	9611	4	2	The budding hibiscus signifies the flower's growth phase. It is a plant renowned for its vibrant and diverse colors, making it exceptionally beautiful. Its true distinction, however, lies in its profound symbolic meaning and its status as a naturally occurring botanical specimen, which contributes to its unique and unparalleled significance.
748	9612	4	2	The author selected this specific paragraph for the conclusion to fulfill a deliberate narrative purpose. This choice was intended to provide closure by revealing the character's internal resolve through a moment of silent self-dialogue, thereby concluding the story on a reflective and intimate note that emphasizes her personal determination.
749	9613	4	2	"Cultural adaptation is a necessary process for individuals who relocate, achievable through various means such as forming new social connections and acclimating to the local environment. However, it is equally important to maintain a connection to one's heritage. This is the central theme Minfong Ho conveys in the concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus."" The story follows Saeng, a teenage girl who moved from Vietnam to the United States, as she revisits memories of her homeland during a trip to a plant store. She purchases a hibiscus, a plant common in Vietnam, and plants it in her garden. Her final vow—to retake the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus buds—encapsulates her dual desire to assimilate into the new culture by passing the test while simultaneously preserving a tangible link to her past, thus summarizing her emotional connection to her native country and her resolve to succeed in her new one."
750	9614	4	2	She was making a personal commitment to herself that upon the arrival of spring, she would attempt the driver's test once more, demonstrating her resolve to try again.
751	9615	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate the protagonist's resolve. Saeng declares that she will retake the test upon the snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. She draws a parallel between the geese's determined migration and the hibiscus's resilient budding, using these natural cycles as inspiration for her own perseverance and self-assurance. Her initial admission of failing the test suggests she associated this failure with broader struggles in her new country. However, after observing the determination inherent in nature, she resolved to attempt the test once more.
752	9616	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng, having failed her test during winter, plans to retake it in the spring when nature revives. Her motivation is to prove her capability to her mother, a hope symbolized by her purchase of a costly dorl Faeng-noi plant intended to mitigate her mother's disappointment. Ironically, the mother's reaction was one of displeasure at the extravagant expenditure, adding a layer of complexity to Saeng's intentions and their outcome.
753	9617	4	2	I believe the author ends the story this way to show how familiar comforts from one's homeland can provide the emotional strength needed to face challenges. The author, much like anyone, seems to need tangible connections to her past to summon positive memories and perform at her best. Personally, I find that recalling things I cherish boosts my happiness and motivation to do well. It was a clever strategy for the author to surround herself with these meaningful symbols, like the thriving plant and the memory of geese, as a source of encouragement and good fortune before retaking her test.
754	9618	4	2	The author selects this concluding paragraph to illustrate Saeng's acquisition of renewed hope, derived from her memories and the growing familiarity of her new environment. Initially, Saeng was overwhelmed by a profound sense of loss, compounded by her failure on the driving test and her displacement from her homeland. This despondency is palpable in the flower shop scene and persists through much of the narrative. Her recovery commences with sensory encounters reminiscent of her past, such as the smell of bitter melon, the sight of the planted winter hibiscus, and the distinctive call of Canada geese, which she now recognizes as familiar. This recognition catalyzes a pivotal realization: her new home is becoming less foreign. The final paragraph thus encapsulates Saeng's nascent optimism, summarizing her conviction that she will not merely reside in, but ultimately flourish within, her new surroundings.
755	9619	4	2	The author concludes with this statement to underscore that the hibiscus symbolizes overcoming adversity. This is evident when Saeng vows to retake her test upon the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, indicating that the plant's growth parallels her own resolve to succeed. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of resilience because it provides her with a tangible connection to her homeland, thereby offering strength and solace. This symbolic link empowers her to confront the challenge of the test again, demonstrating how the narrative uses the hibiscus to represent the theme of triumph over obstacles.
756	9620	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's regained self-assurance and her resolve to retake the examination, reflecting her positive self-perception and determination.
757	9621	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's experience with a test, as evidenced by her statement, ""I-I failed the test,"" which pertains to a botanical assessment. Furthermore, the paragraph thematically ties together the story's focus on spring, horticulture, and its significance to the characters, detailing how the mother and daughter sustain themselves through cultivating vegetables and fruits."
758	9622	4	2	"The final paragraph of Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" provides a definitive conclusion and is thematically significant. It employs potent symbolism, where the hibiscus, the geese, and the melting snow collectively represent the promise of a fresh start and a new beginning, offering the protagonist a symbolic opportunity for renewal."
759	9623	4	2	Saeng was deeply distressed by her failure to pass the test, viewing it as a profound personal disappointment. This sentiment, however, underscores the ambition and determination that will ultimately drive her to succeed in a subsequent attempt.
760	9624	4	2	The author concludes the story with their return to demonstrate Saeng's character development. Initially, she perceived her new American home as an alien world, a stark contrast to her life in Vietnam. The winter hibiscus plant served as a vital link between her past and present, its familiar scent helping her cope with the difficulty of adaptation and the pain of remembering her former home. Planting it catalyzed a shift in her perspective, allowing her to appreciate her current life. Thus, the concluding paragraph reveals how the plant symbolized Saeng's own transformation and her altered outlook.
761	9625	4	2	The author concludes the story with this phrase to illustrate Saeng's adaptation to her new environment while maintaining a connection to her past. The statement that she will retake the test in the spring demonstrates her perseverance. Furthermore, the reference to the melting snow and returning geese signifies her growing familiarity with her new home. Conversely, the mention of the budding hibiscus, a plant tied to her memories of Vietnam, indicates her enduring attachment to her homeland. Thus, the author utilizes this concluding statement to portray Saeng's maturation and her ability to navigate significant life changes.
762	9626	4	2	The author's implication is that the hibiscus endures the winter differently from other plants. While most flora simply perish in the cold, the hibiscus confronts the harsh conditions directly, demonstrating a form of resilience.
763	9627	4	2	"The author includes this final paragraph to provide narrative closure and prevent audience speculation. The declaration, ""I will take the test again,"" confirms that while Saeng failed her initial attempt, her resolve remains unbroken. This serves to illuminate the emotional turmoil of immigrating to an unfamiliar land, as exemplified by her reaction to the potted plants, which starkly contrasted with the free-growing flora of her homeland and triggered memories of her grandmother, leading to her emotional breakdown. In conclusion, the author adds this paragraph to foster understanding of the immigrant experience and to affirm that despite being in a new culture, Saeng possesses the determination to persevere until she succeeds."
764	9628	4	2	"The author intentionally includes the final paragraph, which enhances the story's overall impact. The line, ""In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" is particularly powerful. The natural imagery of snow melting and geese returning symbolizes rebirth and a fresh start, which is precisely what Saeng requires regarding her driver's license test. The author effectively uses these symbols to convey a sense of hope for the protagonist as she overcomes her challenges. Ultimately, this concluding paragraph provides a sense of completeness, giving the story a well-rounded and satisfying conclusion."
765	9629	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide a clear understanding of the narrative's context. It explains that Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have relocated to the United States from Vietnam. This information offers essential background about the events preceding the main story. The paragraph effectively summarizes the situation for the reader, serving as a concluding summary that ties the narrative together. This is the reason for the paragraph's inclusion at the story's end.
766	9630	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to underscore Saeng's resolve to retake the examination. She commits to doing so with the arrival of spring, a time marked by the melting snow, the return of geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. This seasonal shift symbolizes her readiness. Saeng's reflection on the winter hibiscus, noting that while its flowers are less showy, its strength to endure the cold is what truly matters, serves as a guiding principle for her. As a recent immigrant from Vietnam, she adopts the plant as a personal emblem of resilience, intending to persevere and attempt her driver's license test again at the start of spring, thus completing her arc of determination.
767	9631	4	2	The author's choice of the final paragraph, where Saeng vows to retake the driving test in the spring, serves to illustrate a theme of renewal. This parallels the hibiscus plant's cycle of refreshing and restoring itself. Saeng's initial reaction to failing the test was one of profound sadness and embarrassment, as evidenced by her stammered admission. The concluding section effectively outlines her future course of action, which is to adopt a positive outlook and restore her own confidence in order to return and ultimately pass the test, thereby achieving her goal.
768	9632	4	2	The narrator includes this paragraph to highlight the significance of the hibiscus as a valuable plant and to explore the concept of a garden as a personal domain. Like the narrator's mother who chooses to grow hot peppers, a garden represents an individual's choice in what to cultivate. It serves as a means to express diversity, showcasing the vast variety of foods and plants, such as roses and lilies, that one can nurture, ultimately celebrating the personal and botanical variety found in the world.
769	9633	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize the theme of overcoming adversity. For Saeng, failing the driver's test represents a significant setback. Her decision to retake it is framed by her use of the hibiscus as a source of motivation. The plant's struggle through the winter serves as a direct metaphor for her own need to persevere and surmount the obstacle she faces, drawing a parallel between natural and personal resilience to conclude the narrative.
770	9634	4	2	I believe the author ends the story with this paragraph to powerfully convey the depth of Saeng's emotional investment. In my view, it clearly shows how much the situation truly means to her and demonstrates that she genuinely cares about succeeding. By revealing her determination, the paragraph effectively communicates her decision to try again, proving that her commitment is the driving force behind her resolve to retake the test.
771	9635	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to convey the protagonist's profound sense of comfort and belonging during the spring season. This is further emphasized by her eager anticipation for the budding of geese and hibiscus, which marks her most cherished time of the year.
772	9636	4	2	Saeng feels ill at ease in her new environment and has struggled to adapt since her relocation. Upon discovering a hibiscus, she decides to purchase it because it evokes memories of her former home. Her mother's initial shock at the cost gives way to sympathy as she understands Saeng's longing for their homeland. Saeng's declaration that she will retake her test in the spring implies a forthcoming shift in her attitude toward her new life.
773	9637	4	2	The author's choice of conclusion is intended to symbolize the return of the geese, representing a new beginning. This cyclical event in nature underscores the theme of renewal and hope that the author wishes to impart at the story's end.
774	9638	4	2	The author concludes in this manner to illustrate that Saeng has chosen not to surrender. Having moved to an unfamiliar and initially unwelcoming place, Saeng's story serves as a testament to perseverance and maintaining faith. Her decision to retake the test demonstrates a newfound self-belief, conveying that one can persevere and find purpose even in difficult circumstances.
775	9639	4	2	The author's concluding message is that one must not abandon their efforts after a single failure. Saeng's resolution to retake the test in the spring demonstrates her resilience and understanding that life continues despite setbacks. This decision effectively encapsulates the story's central theme of perseverance.
776	9640	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate the protagonist's resolve not to succumb to homesickness. The initial purchase of the plant evoked memories of her former home, illustrating the depth of her longing. Her declaration that she will retake the test signifies a determination not to be defeated by her new environment, but to persevere in her new life.
777	9641	4	2	The author's conclusion of Saeng's vow illustrates her capacity to overcome adversity. Although Saeng perceives herself as a failure, the hibiscus symbolizes the courage required to confront her obstacles, such as the failed driving test. The geese embody themes of survival and persistence, encouraging continuous effort toward achieving success.
778	9642	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to draw a parallel between the girl and the flower. Just as the hibiscus is poised to blossom, Saeng resolves to take the test again, with both receiving a fresh start. This ending leaves the reader with a positive feeling; it is brief yet profoundly meaningful. The final sentence is inspirational, motivating one to embrace a new beginning alongside Saeng.
779	9643	4	2	The author concludes with the specified line for several reasons. It signifies Saeng's commitment to progressing and adapting to her new life in Canada, indicating her intention to alter her lifestyle and assimilate into the new culture. Furthermore, she will inevitably relive the memory of her grandmother and desires to manage that profound sense of loss more effectively. The author aims to emphasize that Saeng's story is ongoing and far from concluded.
780	9644	4	2	Several reasons justify the narrator's choice of this concluding paragraph. The onset of winter means the hibiscus will not return until spring, providing a natural endpoint that coincides with the story's conclusion. This final paragraph effectively summarizes the narrative in a succinct and pleasing manner, offering a unique denouement distinct from conventional endings due to its focus on natural cycles. In conclusion, the narrator had multiple valid motivations for selecting this paragraph to conclude the story.
781	9645	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with a final paragraph to illustrate the process of regaining one's resolve. Initially, Saeng is disheartened by her failure on the driving test. Upon encountering the Hibiscus, she is overwhelmed by memories and weeps. Her mother's compassionate words highlight the flower's strength to endure the cold, which in turn empowers Saeng. Assured that the Hibiscus will bloom again in spring, she renews her determination to pass the test, thus completing her emotional arc.
782	9646	4	2	The author's concluding response suggests that Saeng will re-engage with her life, but with a refined focus. She is expected to be more helpful to her mother in the garden while also applying greater effort to her schoolwork, prioritizing her studies over her horticultural pursuits to achieve better balance and success.
783	9647	4	2	In my view, Saeng's personality radiates determination and confidence. I believe she feels capable of gaining more experience with various plants, making this a perfect hobby for a plant enthusiast. I feel she has accomplished her planting goals and will likely pursue a career in gardening. Her statement about retaking the test when the plants return indicates a willingness to explore botany further. This experience seems inherited from her mother, suggesting a family tradition that Saeng will probably continue by teaching her own children about different flowers one day.
784	9648	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's newly positive outlook on her future. The hibiscus functions as a pivotal plot device, its changes mirroring the narrative's progression. Initially, Saeng feels hopeless without it; upon seeing it, she is saddened by memories. After planting it, her perspective improves. Her declaration to retake the test when the plants return and the hibiscus buds signifies her acceptance of change and optimistic forward gaze, with the flower's incipient bloom symbolizing this positive transformation in a thematically resonant conclusion.
785	9649	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to signify her commitment to acting at the proper time and season. The cold winter soil prevented growth, the expensive hibiscus coincided with her test failure, and the description of her mother's frail beauty while gardening deeply moved her. These elements from the past collectively motivate Saeng to correct her course, aiming to emulate her mother's radiant perseverance and ultimately pass her test.
786	9650	4	2	"In the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng resolves to retake her driver's test in the spring, a decision prompted by the sight of the hibiscus. This flower reconnects her to her childhood and serves as a reminder of her family's resilience after relocating to a new country for a fresh start. The memory of their perseverance inspires her to persist, ensuring she does not give up on her own challenge now."
787	9651	4	2	The author's intent is to instill a sense of hope for Saeng's future in her new country. Following her failure on what is likely a significant citizenship test, evident from her inability to meet her mother's gaze, the narrative requires a reassuring conclusion. This hopeful ending, perhaps symbolized by her purchase of a flower for her mother, provides closure and assures the reader of a positive outcome for Saeng's journey.
788	9652	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's quest to find a flower that evokes memories of her homeland, symbolizing resilience and adaptation. After failing her test and purchasing a hibiscus that was not authentic to her memories, Saeng's vow to retake the exam in the spring is intertwined with her hope that the plant will survive. This parallel signifies her own determination to endure and find a connection to her past in her new environment, completing her character's arc of hopeful perseverance.
789	9653	4	2	The author employs this concluding paragraph to provide a swift and definitive resolution to the narrative, effectively bringing the story to a close without extensive elaboration.
790	9654	4	2	The author concludes that Saeng, after an initial failure on her test, will focus on cultivating new plants with the arrival of spring before attempting the test again. This resolution is presented to demonstrate that her character is not solely preoccupied with horticulture but is also determined to succeed in her personal challenges, thereby achieving a balanced portrayal of her intentions and efforts.
791	9655	4	2	"The narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" centers on a girl named Saeng, her mother, and her grandmother, for whom flowers hold significant beauty. They dedicate their days to planting and picking these flowers, with Saeng at one point feeling such trepidation that she could not meet her mother's gaze."
792	9656	4	2	The author concludes the story with a particular saying to illustrate Saeng's regained self-confidence. Although initially upset about failing her test, a conversation with her mother restored her morale. This newfound assurance convinced her that she could retake and ultimately pass the examination, which is the reasoning behind the concluding adage.
793	9657	4	2	This paragraph signifies that with the end of winter, marked by the return of geese from the south and the reappearance of a favored plant from her homeland, the protagonist will attempt her previous challenge again. This time, however, she will do so with greater confidence, which is the essential meaning conveyed.
794	9658	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph because it resolves the central conflict of Saeng failing her driver's test; her declaration that she will retake it demonstrates her determination. Having solved the primary conflict, introducing a new one would be necessary to continue the narrative, so the author chooses to end it here. The excerpt also draws a parallel between Saeng and the geese, as both must endure and return to face hardships again.
795	9659	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the story concludes in a well-mannered fashion. The final paragraph shows Saeng's resolve to persevere despite being far from home. Initially in a downward spiral after failing a test and being reminded of her past by a hibiscus, she is comforted by her mother's kind words and a meal featuring familiar foods. This comfort allows Saeng to see the good in her new life, restoring her confidence and determination to pass the test."
796	9660	4	2	"After failing her driving test, Saeng encountered a familiar plant during her walk home. Upon visiting a florist, she identified it as a hibiscus. She purchased the plant with her limited funds, as it evoked memories of her homeland, childhood, and the grandmother she had left behind, thus forming a deep connection to it. Observing geese flying south for the winter, she resolved, ""When they come back,"" meaning when the geese return north, and ""the snow melts,"" signifying the arrival of spring and the hibiscus beginning to bud, she would ""take that test again."" She dedicated the winter to practicing and preparing, vowing to be ready to retake and pass her driving test in the spring."
797	9661	4	2	This conclusion powerfully illustrates the theme of perseverance, demonstrating that success requires the determination to continue trying despite failure. It showcases significant courage, as it is challenging for an individual to face defeat and then resolve to try again. The character's unwillingness to accept failure and her desire for redemption are the driving forces behind her declaration to retake the test. This resolution effectively underscores the narrative's core message about resilience and the human capacity for renewal.
798	9662	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide clarity regarding the protagonist's future intentions for the coming spring. This technique offers a sense of closure while simultaneously creating potential for a sequel. By explicitly stating her plan to retake the test, the author ensures the reader is left with a clear understanding of the character's trajectory, effectively setting the stage for possible future narratives while concluding the current one satisfactorily.
799	9663	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize the symbolic importance of the seasons and the hibiscus plant. During winter, the plant becomes dormant, but the protagonist believes it brought her luck. She declares that when the snow melts in spring, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she will retake her test. The flower's significance is profound; its rich, sweet scent was familiar, a connection she explicitly compares to the scent of her grandmother's shell, noting they were the same, thus rooting her resolve in powerful sensory memories."
800	9664	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to signify the protagonist's resolve and the cyclical nature of her endeavor. It establishes that she is committed to returning the following year to attempt the same task again, highlighting her persistence and the theme of not giving up after a single setback. This ending reinforces the idea of continuous effort and the hope for a different outcome with renewed preparation and the passage of time.
801	9665	4	2	The story concludes with the protagonist's decision to retake the test, an action motivated by her desire to succeed for her mother. To apologize for her initial failure, she presents a flower to her mother as a gesture of remorse and a pledge to try again.
802	9666	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore the cyclical nature of life, where seasons change and growth is impossible in winter. The narrative illustrates how the protagonist must accept that her new surroundings are unlike her homeland and adapt to her environment. This adaptation is presented as necessary, for failing to do so would result in perpetual unhappiness rooted in nostalgia for the past.
803	9667	4	2	The author concludes the response by stating the character will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus buds. This declaration is rooted in a newfound sense of hope and faith. The girl, having recently moved, experiences profound loneliness and depression, yearning for her home. The hibiscus plant provides a sense of comfort and nostalgia, connecting her to her past. Her statement about retaking the test in spring suggests that the plant's resilience gives her the faith to believe she can overcome her failure and succeed.
804	9668	4	2	Upon their return, Saeng made a silent vow to herself that in the spring, when the snow melted, the geese returned, and the hibiscus began to bud, she would take the test again.
805	9669	4	2	"In “The Winter Hibiscus,” the author selects the final paragraph because it cohesively unifies the story's tone, theme of hope, and symbolic representation. The narrative's tone is initially somber, reflecting Saeng's despair after failing her driver's test and her profound homesickness for Vietnam. The winter hibiscus triggers a powerful emotional response, causing her to weep as it evokes memories of her homeland. The story details her slow adaptation to a strange environment, where the repetition of seasons makes the unfamiliar almost familiar, yet she feels a lack of new hope. The hibiscus symbolizes her deep emotional connection to Vietnam, so much so that she cannot speak the word ""home"" without tears, as her true home remains her past life. The concluding paragraph effectively signifies the return of hope with the spring, motivating her to try again, thereby resolving the themes of tone, hope, and representation established throughout the essay."
806	9670	4	2	"The author skillfully concludes the narrative by framing the protagonist Saeng's tribulations through the metaphor of a harsh winter. The evocative use of descriptive language, such as ""exploding,"" ""shock,"" and ""intense,"" effectively conveys the sudden and overwhelming nature of her challenges, allowing the reader to empathize with her distress. The resolution, symbolized by the melting snow and the budding flower, powerfully suggests that while her struggles appear relentless, they are ultimately temporary and will give way to a more hopeful and beautiful future. This final imagery successfully illustrates Saeng's enduring hope and resilience despite her displacement from home."
807	9671	4	2	The author concludes the story with the specified paragraph to illustrate Saeng's identification with the winter hibiscus, a plant described as less visually striking but resilient enough to survive the cold. Her mother's commentary serves to reinforce this parallel, suggesting that Saeng, too, possesses the inner strength to endure her difficult period. Furthermore, the image of the geese flying away in a V-formation signifies Saeng's dawning realization that she can be proud of her efforts and that future opportunities will present themselves. The paragraph's ultimate purpose is to convey a message of perseverance and self-belief, encouraging one to try again without fear.
808	9672	4	2	The author selects the concluding paragraph to underscore the plant's profound symbolic connection to Saeng's homeland. The narrative implies that her diligent care for the hibiscus stems from its function as a tangible memento of her original home. Therefore, her vow to return for it in the spring is not merely about horticulture but about preserving a cherished piece of her past, which provides her with comfort and a sense of identity in her new environment. This final focus solidifies the plant's role as a central symbol of memory and cultural continuity.
809	9674	4	2	The author's decision to conclude with the paragraph about the geese is to draw a direct parallel to Saeng's process of adaptation. The narrative illustrates her initial struggle and discomfort in the new country, evidenced by her tearful reaction and initial resistance to foreign elements like a Big Mac. However, subsequent details reveal her growing familiarity with her surroundings. The geese, as migratory birds that adapt to new environments, serve as a fitting metaphor for Saeng's own journey. The concluding paragraph thus reinforces the theme that, like the geese, she is learning to do what is necessary to survive and thrive in her new circumstances.
810	9675	4	2	The author composed the concluding paragraph to emphasize Saeng's forward-looking optimism and sentimental nature. It encapsulates her dual aspirations: to see the geese that evoke memories of her homeland and to successfully pass her driving test. This ending highlights her character as someone deeply connected to her past yet actively striving for a brighter future in her new life. The paragraph effectively serves to crystallize this central theme of hopeful perseverance, making it a fitting conclusion to the story.
811	9676	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph to convey the message that one should persevere in pursuing their own path, regardless of life's adversities. This idea is symbolized by the flower, which persistently returns despite enduring harsh conditions, thereby illustrating the virtue of resilience.
812	9677	4	2	The author deliberately concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight the protagonist's sources of strength. The hibiscus serves as a tangible connection to her past in Vietnam, while the geese represent her present home. Drawing fortitude from these symbols, she resolves to take the test upon their return, confident in her ability to succeed with them in her life.
813	9678	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph signifies Saeng's transition towards accepting academic responsibility. This development is evident when contrasted with her prior preoccupation with the garden, which had clearly taken precedence over her schoolwork, marking a pivotal shift in her priorities.
814	9679	4	2	"Saeng was evaluating the placement of the plants by observing the geese's reaction to them. This is supported by the mention of the geese in the final paragraph and their apparent approval, indicated by the ""yes"" they seemed to convey when she planted the hibiscus."
815	9680	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the narrative primarily centered on the hibiscus. Saeng resolves that she will retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus's budding—a plant that served as a potent reminder of her homeland.
816	9681	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to signify a new beginning. This is evident as the final passage discusses the protagonist's resolve to retake the test, thereby framing the conclusion as a point of departure for a fresh attempt.
817	9682	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's improved psychological state, which is achieved after she discovers a flower reminiscent of her homeland. Fearing parental disappointment over her test failure, she purchases the flower for its comforting association. Upon returning home and confessing both the expenditure and her academic result, her mother's initial frustration is fleeting, quickly giving way to empathy for her daughter's experience. This familial support ultimately bolsters the protagonist's confidence, assuring her of future success.
818	9683	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes the narrative with a line of dialogue to reinforce the story's central theme. The protagonist, Saeng, purchases a plant and brings it home, only to face her mother's initial disapproval, captured by the incredulous response, ""You what?"" This reaction clearly conveys the mother's displeasure. Saeng's admission, ""I-I failed the test,"" reveals her deep-seated desire to avoid disappointing her parents. Her subsequent vow, to retake the test when the hibiscus buds in spring, demonstrates not merely a desire for academic redemption but a significant maturation and a profound commitment to making her family proud."
819	9684	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's determination to retake the test. This decision stems from her analysis of the previous failure; having identified her errors, she is now prepared to correct them. Her statement, ""then I will take that test again,"" is a direct result of her regret over failing a simple exam, and she plans to act on this resolve when the seasonal snow melts."
820	9685	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng's emotional state is tied to her environment. The dormant plant and the departing geese mirror her sadness following the test failure. However, the conclusion establishes a hopeful parallel: just as the return of spring will bring budding plants and returning geese, it will also restore her happiness, providing the positive mindset she needs to pass the test upon her next attempt.
821	9686	4	2	The author's conclusion serves several distinct purposes. Primarily, it underscores Saeng's unwavering resolve to persist in her efforts to pass the examination. Furthermore, it conveys the broader theme that significant life changes do not necessitate surrender. These narrative choices collectively shape the story's final message and its impact on the reader.
822	9687	4	2	I believe the author chose this concluding paragraph to highlight the character's profound connection to nature, specifically the hibiscus. The flower held a special significance for her, a fact illustrated by her gentle interaction with it, such as when she reached out to touch a petal and noted its smooth, cool texture with a velvety center. This detailed sensory engagement is central to understanding the author's intent for the story's resolution.
823	9688	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng intends to retake her driving test when the timing feels appropriate, symbolized by the hibiscus budding. A further reason is to demonstrate her resolute determination, emphasizing that her resolve remains steadfast despite previous setbacks.
824	9689	4	2	She resolves to pass the test to make her mother proud after her initial failure, yet she waits for the plant to bud. The hibiscus bud symbolizes a new beginning; having endured the winter, it represents the potential to overcome adversity. Saeng draws a parallel, reasoning that if a tropical plant can survive a harsh season, she too can succeed and pass her test in the coming spring.
825	9690	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph because it functions as the story's moral. It conveys the idea that the protagonist will try again when the moment is right, persisting until she succeeds. Without this final section, the central message of perseverance and timing would be lost, leaving the story's purpose unclear.
826	9691	4	2	Saeng is a helpful daughter who assists her mother, and the author crafted the story's concluding sentence to enhance reader engagement and sustain interest until the end.
827	9692	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with that specific sentence to convey the intention of repeating the action once the hibiscus plant is back in season.
828	9693	4	2	The likely reason for her statement is that she feels confident enough to take the test only when she is surrounded by flowers, plants, and other greenery.
829	9694	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate a parallel between personal growth and natural cycles; the statement about taking the test again when the snow melts and the hibiscus buds signifies that the protagonist will attempt the test once she has matured and gained sufficient confidence, just as the flower blooms again in its own time.
830	9695	4	2	The author concludes with that paragraph to draw a connection to the seasonal nature of flowers, which, like winter, have periods of dormancy. The paragraph expresses the protagonist's resolve to look forward to the return of plants in the spring, once the winter season has concluded.
831	9696	4	2	The author likely employed this conclusion to affirm the protagonist's resilience and her unwavering commitment to persevere through any challenge.
832	9697	4	2	This sentence is incorporated by the author to signify the commencement of a new phase, thereby concluding the narrative with a sense of forward momentum and renewal.
833	9698	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, a resolution that underscores the theme of perseverance. This determination follows her purchase of a hibiscus plant, an act which initially appears to be a nostalgic attempt to recreate her old home. However, by planting it in her new garden, she is not surrendering her past but is instead integrating it, signaling her intent to build a future in this new place and to try again.
834	9699	4	2	Minfong Ho concludes the narrative with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, a moment synchronized with the return of geese, the melting snow, and the budding hibiscus. This conclusion functions symbolically to represent Saeng's acquired insights: her adaptation to a new environment, where once-strange elements become familiar, and the hibiscus itself embodies resilience, a connection to her heritage, and a source of solace. Ultimately, the paragraph serves as a symbolic encapsulation of the protagonist's developmental arc.
835	9700	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng vowing to retake the test in the spring, linking this resolve to the symbolic hibiscus. The flower represents her past in Vietnam, yet its capacity to adapt mirrors her own need to adjust to a new country. Her declaration, timed with the plant's budding, signifies her determination to overcome future obstacles, drawing strength from her past experiences for comfort and motivation. Thus, the ending utilizes the flower's symbolism to illustrate Saeng's hope and dedication in confronting the challenges of her new life.
836	9701	4	2	"I believe the author concluded the story in that manner to convey the protagonist's resolve to persistently begin anew. For instance, after stating ""I failed the test,"" the character could have chosen to surrender, yet she did not. This refusal to capitulate is precisely why the narrative concludes with a line emphasizing renewal and perseverance."
837	9702	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate that Saeng is prepared to start over, much like the resilient hibiscus plant. This ending reinforces the theme that one must persevere through life's difficulties, continually striving for improvement. Furthermore, the paragraph's cyclical nature mirrors Saeng's own intended actions, effectively bringing the story's central motif of renewal to a close.
838	9703	4	2	The statement signifies her intention to repeat the same action upon her return, with the aim of achieving a better outcome. She plans to try again to see if her performance will improve, demonstrating a commitment to perseverance and self-betterment.
839	9704	4	2	After failing her driving test, Saeng silently vowed to retake it in the spring, a decision prompted by her observation of a fallen hibiscus blossom. The flower's scent distracted her, and her mother's silent, understanding reaction—brushing plant fragments from Saeng's hands—contrasted with her own preoccupation with the flora. This moment of gardening, planting the 'winter hibiscus,' sparked a chain of thought for Saeng, leading her to visualize geese and solidify her resolve to try again as she adapts to her new environment. The story introduces Saeng as a Vietnamese teenager who has relocated to the United States with her family, though specific family details remain largely unexplored.
840	9705	4	2	"The author included this paragraph to highlight the protagonist's profound nostalgia for Vietnam, evoked by the sight of the hibiscus, which provides her with a sense of solace. This serves to contrast her old life with her new one in the United States, where the distinct seasonal cycle gradually fosters familiarity. The enduring plant symbolizes constancy, yet she must also learn to appreciate the positive aspects of her new home. A key quotation reveals her growing acclimatization, noting that once-strange elements have become familiar through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" Thus, the paragraph illustrates her enduring connection to Vietnam while simultaneously depicting her finding comfort and a sense of belonging within the United States."
841	9706	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate that the protagonist's return is as certain as the seasonal return of geese.
842	9707	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. Primarily, it underscores the protagonist's lingering discomfort in discussing her former home, as indicated by her difficulty in saying the word. The natural imagery of melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus powerfully evokes memories of her past life. This connection is confirmed when the protagonist notes that the hibiscus grows wild in her homeland. These reminders provide her with both comfort and confidence. The author therefore uses this paragraph to signify that the protagonist will retake her test when these symbols of her home make her feel strong and assured once more.
843	9708	4	2	"The inclusion of this concluding paragraph provides a resolution and reinforces the story's theme of overcoming adversity. After failing her test, Saeng is disheartened, but her discovery of a hibiscus plant renews her hope and resolve. She decides she will retake the test ""in the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" This hopeful ending offers the reader a sense of closure. Such meaningful conclusions are vital, as they allow readers to grasp the author's message—in this case, the importance of perseverance and finding motivation in simple things. Understanding an author's intent is crucial not only for readers interpreting a story's purpose but also for writers seeking to communicate their ideas effectively."
844	9709	4	2	"I believe the author uses the vow, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" to symbolize how spring brings renewal and hope. The protagonist's life was upended when she fled Vietnam by boat, leaving a world of abundance for a foreign land. The blooming flowers of spring represent a new beginning and a chance to move forward. This final quote is meant to instill hope, as the character makes a silent promise to herself that circumstances will improve. Ultimately, hope is what makes every obstacle easier to overcome and every hardship more bearable."
845	9710	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to establish the hibiscus as a symbol for Saeng's own journey. In spring, the hibiscus begins to grow, mirroring Saeng's personal development. Upon arriving in her new environment, she was as fragile and vulnerable as the plant, whose ""leaves quavering in the wind"" indicate its weakness. Saeng's decision to purchase the plant reflects her own lack of strength at that moment. By the story's end, the paragraph signifies that both the hibiscus and Saeng have grown strong and are capable of overcoming future challenges."
846	9711	4	2	The author concludes the narrative to illustrate Saeng's resilience and unwavering determination to succeed on her test. The text notes the hibiscus she finds is unlike the one from her former home, a discrepancy that causes her sadness due to her profound emotional connection to the plant and the memories it holds of her grandmother. This sadness, however, fuels her resolve to try again. Her statement that she will retake the test once the geese return and the hibiscus buds demonstrates her persistence despite an initial failure, underscoring a commitment shaped by her longing for home.
847	9712	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to establish a tone of comfort and readiness for the character to attempt the test again. This reflective tone is likely connected to the protagonist's past and the values instilled in her by her family, such as her parents or grandparents, which now provide her with the emotional preparation and fortitude to try once more.
848	9713	4	2	The author concludes the story at this point because it represents the optimal moment for Saeng to retake the test. The narrative highlights the melting snow, the budding hibiscus, and the returning geese as symbols of a perfect time for renewal, when the world becomes warm and life returns. Saeng's declaration that she will take the test again upon their return signifies her regained confidence. Her vow to retake the test is presented with the firm belief that she will pass on this subsequent attempt, which is the author's intended conclusion.
849	9714	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize the themes of hope and the symbolic meaning of the hibiscus for Saeng. The choice of spring as the setting is deliberate, as it is a season of new beginnings and rebirth, mirrored by the melting snow and the return of the geese. This timing suggests it is the right moment for a second chance. The earlier image of Saeng tearing off a leaf and shredding it to pieces represents the death of her initial hope, which the hibiscus had symbolized. Therefore, the ending serves to illustrate the emergence of new hope and beginnings for the character.
850	9715	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a powerful one-sentence paragraph stating Saeng will retake the test when the geese return and the hibiscus buds. This sentence creates suspense while synthesizing the story's central themes to suggest a potential future for the character. The hibiscus was originally purchased to provide comfort to both Saeng and her mother. As Saeng watches the geese, the author uses this moment to articulate her determined resolve to attempt the test again. Ultimately, the story ends with a strong concluding sentence that summarizes the narrative arc and leaves the reader with a compelling sense of anticipation."
851	9716	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's silent vow to retake her test in the spring, a moment synchronized with the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. This final paragraph serves to extend the story beyond its final words, prompting the reader to contemplate Saeng's future and the cyclical, hopeful nature of her resolve long after the reading is complete.
852	9717	4	2	"Many narratives employ a dramatic yet conclusive final statement. In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist, Saeng, concludes with a silent vow to retake her test in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus budding. The author includes this vow not only to inform the reader of a future action but to illustrate Saeng's determination and her spiritual connection to the plant. The hibiscus, a source of comfort and confidence for her, symbolizes this bond, which is particularly significant as she prepares to face her challenge again. In conclusion, the final paragraph effectively foreshadows future events and underscores the profound symbolic link between the girl, the flower, and her cultural heritage."
853	9718	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng vowing silently to herself that she will retake the test in the spring, a season marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. The author chooses this ending to highlight that Saeng, despite her interest in flowers, remains committed to her academic responsibilities. Her decision to try again is framed by the natural rebirth of spring, mirroring how the hibiscus plant begins to blossom, thereby symbolizing her own personal renewal and resilience following her initial failure.
854	9719	4	2	After her family's return, Saeng made a quiet vow to herself. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus buds, she would take the test again. This internal promise connects her to a sense of home and familiarity she has been missing. Her life in the United States feels quiet and strange, a stark contrast to Vietnam. Failing her driving test intensified her feelings of being out of place, and her focus on the flower becomes a way to express these complex emotions and find a point of stability in her new environment.
855	9720	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to provide a final reminder and summation of the narrative's core journey. It effectively bookends the story, tracing Saeng's path from the initial failure of her test to the symbolic act of planting the hibiscus in winter. This concluding reflection serves to encapsulate the entire narrative arc for the reader, reinforcing the central themes of growth and perseverance that have been developed throughout the story.
856	9721	4	2	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to avoid presenting the protagonist as defeated. Instead, she emerges with a heightened awareness of her capabilities and a belief that she can accomplish her objective. Furthermore, the flower serves to bolster her self-consciousness, simultaneously acting as a tangible reminder of her homeland and her personal strength.
857	9722	4	2	The author's conclusion employs the flower as a metaphor for renewal and resilience, mirroring the protagonist's own journey. The flower symbolizes determination, illustrating her resolve. Despite failing her driving test, her determination to try again remains undiminished. She is resolved to overcome her failure, much like the flower, which loses its buds in winter only to regenerate them, signifying Saeng's capacity to forget her setback and begin anew.
858	9723	4	2	This paragraph functions as a symbol of Saeng's realization and her new beginning. Having been preoccupied with the past, she learns to embrace the present, a theme that advocates for living in the moment. The hibiscus embodies strength, as her mother notes its ability to endure the winter. The author's ultimate message is that difficult periods are inevitable; therefore, one must cherish the moments that bring joy, as they provide the fortitude to persevere through adversity.
859	9724	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist Saeng confronts numerous obstacles. The story concludes with Saeng vowing to retake her test after winter, a narrative choice that foreshadows her future. This suggests Saeng requires time to adapt to her new life and focus on other pursuits before her next attempt, demonstrating her courage in facing a previous failure. Her perseverance will aid her in overcoming challenges in her new country. Her offer to help her mother dig a hole for the plant, which represents her past, shows her devotion. Thus, the concluding vow effectively illustrates Saeng's commitment to her goals."
860	9725	4	2	The author includes this excerpt to demonstrate the character's recognition of her error and her intention to rectify it. This interpretation is supported by Saeng's emotional reaction to admitting her test failure to her mother, indicating her distress and her hope for future improvement. Furthermore, the conclusion leads the reader to infer that Saeng will ultimately overcome her homesickness and move forward.
861	9726	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, a decision prompted by her initial failure. The hibiscus plant she purchased appears to have provided comfort, evoking memories of her homeland and fostering a positive outlook. This newfound optimism shifts her perspective from anticipating failure to believing she will succeed on her next attempt. The plant's presence seems to have soothed her distress, significantly improving her emotional state and reinforcing her resolve."
862	9727	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves as a powerful symbol of reassurance. Having struggled to adapt to life in the United States after leaving Vietnam, Saeng's difficult day, marked by failing her driver's test, leads her to purchase a plant. In the greenhouse, her thoughts turn to poignant memories of Vietnam, highlighting her sense of displacement. The final vow to retake the test in the spring instills hope for her ability to overcome adversity. The winter symbolizes her ongoing hardships, much as it does for the migrating geese and the dormant hibiscus. Just as they endure and return, the paragraph affirms that Saeng, too, will persevere, providing a positive and hopeful resolution to her story."
863	9728	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph to illustrate the cyclical nature of Saeng's experiences. It signifies her intention to resume her activities, such as digging, sending flowers, and serving customers, once the winter has passed. The arrival of another winter would then see this sequence of actions repeat. Essentially, the author employs different phrasing to convey that with the end of winter, Saeng will begin her tasks anew, which is the fundamental reason for the story's concluding emphasis on this seasonal return.
864	9729	4	2	The author employs the concluding paragraph, featuring Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, to articulate the story's central theme. The hibiscus functions as a symbol of hope within Saeng's life. Furthermore, the author's specific diction elucidates how Saeng's existence becomes metaphorically tied to the flower's cycle. This paragraph also serves to connect her cultural identity to the overarching thematic concerns of the narrative, thereby reinforcing the story's deeper meaning.
865	9730	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph because the hibiscus plant triggers nostalgic memories for Saeng, and she identifies with its situation. A parallel can be drawn between Saeng and the plant; both are starting anew in an unfamiliar environment. Just as the plant must adapt to the soil outside her home and grow, Saeng must also learn to adapt and develop, preparing herself to retake the test. She believes that by the time the plant has matured and acclimated, she will have undergone a similar process of growth and adjustment. This thematic parallel makes the paragraph a fitting conclusion to Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus."""
866	9731	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to summarize the story's central theme and to convey Saeng's resolve to retake the examination. The text states that she recognized how many previously unfamiliar elements had become almost familiar through the quiet repetition of the seasons. This final passage serves to cohesively unite these reflections, reinforcing her determination to try again.
867	9732	4	2	A vow serves as a powerful conclusion, demonstrating her commitment to retake the test after failing. It effectively conveys her emotional state and her desperation to succeed. Furthermore, her observation of the surrounding beauty provides her with the necessary inspiration to persevere, highlighting a resilient and hopeful outlook.
868	9733	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, a season marked by the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus she purchased after failing her driver's examination. Having encountered the familiar plant at a florist shop, it brings her happiness and evokes memories of home. This ending is deliberately crafted to instill a sense of hope, ensuring the narrative concludes not on a note of sadness, but with the persistent optimism that she will eventually pass the test.
869	9734	4	2	Her failure of the test coincided with the day she acquired the plant and observed the geese flying overhead. The plant and the geese function as potent symbols within the narrative. The plant symbolizes her homeland and past life, while the geese represent perseverance and the overcoming of obstacles, such as harsh weather, to migrate toward a better environment. Collectively, they signify a new beginning for her, which is why she resolves to try again in the spring—a time of renewal when the geese return and the plant blooms, embodying her desire to start afresh after her initial setback.
870	9735	4	2	The author included this concluding paragraph for several reasons, primarily to extend the narrative's length and, more significantly, to illustrate the important theme that failure on a first attempt does not preclude the possibility of future success and renewed effort.
871	9736	4	2	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with a paragraph wherein Saeng makes a silent vow. She resolves to retake her test in the spring, a season marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding of her hibiscus. This decision underscores her commitment to attempt planting once more, symbolizing her efforts to adapt to her new environment and demonstrating the genuine care she holds for this act of cultivation."
872	9737	4	2	Saeng has resolved to retake her test next spring, hoping to pass. She draws hope from her winter flower and the sight of a flock of geese, feeling confident she will succeed. She plans to make this attempt when she sees buds forming on her hibiscus plant. Having been very upset after failing the first time, she is now optimistic about passing in the coming spring.
873	9738	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph details when the protagonist, Saeng, will retake her driving test: when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This conclusion is significant as it illustrates Saeng's newfound hope. Having moved from Vietnam, she initially experienced profound homesickness, to the point where mentioning ""home"" risked causing her to cry. However, discovering a hibiscus plant, a species that grew wild in her homeland, provides a vital connection to her past. Purchasing the plant for her new garden offers her both comforting memories and strength. The hibiscus thus becomes a source of resilience, empowering her to try the test again. The final paragraph, therefore, marks Saeng's emotional transition from depression to hope, highlighting the symbolic strength the plant provides her."
874	9739	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has learned she must not fear embracing a new life and environment. For instance, Saeng's mother remarks that the winter hibiscus, while not particularly pretty, is strong enough to survive the cold months, implying she wants Saeng to learn similar resilience during difficult times. Furthermore, the narrator states that Saeng realized many things she initially found strange became familiar through the quiet repetition of the seasons. This shows her understanding that her new home shares cyclical similarities with her old one. Ultimately, the final paragraph conveys that Saeng must confront her new reality, embody strength, and adapt to the natural flow of life.
875	9740	4	2	"""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" Saeng vows to herself. Having recently moved, she finds herself in an unfamiliar place without friends. One day, she discovers solace in a plant shop where she encounters a Hibiscus flower. This plant brings a sense of peace to her spirit and assists her in beginning the process of adjusting to the significant changes in her life."
876	9741	4	2	The author concludes with the paragraph about the transition from winter to spring to convey the protagonist's intention to retake her driving test. Saeng articulates this decision by drawing a parallel to the natural world's renewal; just as plants revive in spring, she too will begin anew. Having failed her initial test, she resolves to wait for spring, symbolizing a fresh start. The winter hibiscus in the narrative serves as a poignant reminder of her grandmother and her homeland, Laos. While this memory initially evokes sadness, Saeng ultimately finds strength and solace in these recollections, which fortify her resolve to persevere and attempt the test again with the coming season.
877	9742	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to highlight the protagonist's decision to try again with the arrival of spring. The ending serves to illustrate the girl's profound connection to the season's renewal, as evidenced by her specific mention of the returning geese. This focus on the natural world underscores how the cyclical rebirth of spring inspires her own personal resolve to make another attempt.
878	9743	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to encapsulate the profound effect of memories and the symbolic plant on the protagonist. Similar to the plant, which thrives best in its native environment yet can survive and retain its beauty in a new one with care and resilience, Saeng realizes she too can adapt and endure. Her mother's observation about the hibiscus blooming by the lake, noting its strength to survive the cold despite less showy flowers, serves as a direct metaphor for Saeng's own situation. This maternal wisdom assures Saeng that she can persevere through difficult times, leading to her decision to retake the test with renewed determination.
879	9744	4	2	"In ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with a paragraph expressing hopeful resolve to illustrate the thematic parallel between the protagonist and the titular flower. The hibiscus embodies resilience and the determination to adapt and flourish despite challenges. Saeng's circumstances mirror the plant's experience; both have been uprooted from their native environments and must struggle to survive in a new, harsh climate. Having moved from her homeland and faced the obstacle of a failed test, Saeng, in the final paragraph, recognizes that she must emulate the hibiscus's tenacity to succeed in her new home, thus resolving to retake the test in the spring."
880	9745	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to reveal Saeng's plan for the spring, following her winter of reflection. This ending provides a sense of forward-looking hope while maintaining narrative tension, leaving the reader to ponder the future outcomes for Saeng and her mother. It also effectively creates a sense of a new beginning, suggesting that a different chapter of her story will commence with the changing of the seasons.
881	9746	4	2	I understand the author's rationale for concluding the story in this manner, and it is a sound one. The ending suggests that despite failing this year, the protagonist will prepare the garden again next year. This conveys a positive moral about the necessity of persistent effort to achieve success, as failure does not negate progress. This is analogous to the experience of @PERSON1, who, after @DATE1 attempts to invent the light bulb, stated that he had simply discovered @NUM1 ways not to create one. Therefore, I concur with the author's chosen conclusion for the narrative.
882	9747	4	2	The author depicts this to illustrate the protagonist's ongoing struggle with gardening. Each year, she must labor over her garden anew because the winter destroys it, leaving nothing behind. This cyclical process underscores the persistent challenge she faces.
883	9748	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's unwavering determination. Saeng's primary motivation is to earn her mother's pride and happiness. Although her initial failure caused disappointment, her mother's subsequent understanding provided solace. The moment Saeng cried upon confessing her failure was met with her mother gently wiping away her tears, reinforcing the supportive bond between them and Saeng's resolve to persist.
884	9749	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify that when the shovel is used again in the spring, as the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus buds, the protagonist will take the test once more. She will therefore wait until the following spring to make another attempt, demonstrating her patience and resilience.
885	9750	4	2	In the story, the test was whether the protagonist could overcome her homesickness. Visiting the greenhouse triggered memories of her homeland through the plants and flowers. A specific flower reminded her of fetching water from a well, with a blossom floating in it. The conclusion suggests that after winter, she will return to that place to see if she is still homesick. I believe the author ended the story this way to emphasize the character's perseverance and her commitment to trying again rather than surrendering to her feelings.
886	9751	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to provide insight into Saeng's future intentions, suggesting a potential narrative continuation. The author, @MONTH1, may have included this segment to lay the groundwork for a sequel, prompting readers to contemplate whether Saeng will pass her test after the seasonal transformation, marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. This deliberate inclusion thus creates a sense of forward momentum and thematic closure.
887	9752	4	2	The author's concluding lines illustrate Saeng's emotional progression. Initially, the sight of the hibiscus evokes sadness, but it ultimately brings her happiness. With her mother's assistance in planting it, Saeng gains confidence that the plant will survive until spring. This process of reflection on her past allows her to achieve a more positive and resolved state of mind, effectively concluding her character's arc.
888	9753	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" to underscore the protagonist Saeng's resolute determination. Her failure on the test is mitigated by the acquisition of the hibiscus, which acts as a catalyst for restoring her resolve. The plant serves as a tangible connection to her homeland and family, likely reminding her of their expectations for her success. This motivates her silent vow to retake the test alongside the hibiscus's budding, a narrative choice that emphasizes themes of perseverance and cultural identity."
889	9754	4	2	"The conclusion of @CAPS1 Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" is decidedly affirmative. Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, as the snow melts and geese return, is a strategic authorial decision to highlight her connection to her new environment. The spring season in her current country evokes memories of her homeland, creating a sense of familiarity and comfort. This association provides her with the necessary confidence to attempt the test again, which is the fundamental reason for the paragraph's placement."
890	9755	4	2	Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring is deeply connected to the hibiscus, a metaphor for her childhood in Vietnam before moving to the @LOCATION2. Overwhelmed by memories evoked by flowers, she initially struggles with the difficulty of adapting to a foreign country. Planting the winter hibiscus becomes her method of coping, paralleling her own gradual adjustment, as many once-strange things have become almost familiar. The hibiscus's eventual blooming symbolizes her personal transformation and ability to overcome hardship, just as the flower endures winter. Similarly, the migrating geese represent cyclical change and returning home. Saeng, like them, postpones her challenge during a difficult period but resolves to face it when conditions are more favorable, signifying her readiness for renewal.
891	9756	4	2	She has stated her intention to take the examination next year.
892	9757	4	2	The author concludes the narrative to convey the protagonist's resolution to be emotionally prepared for the following year, using the plant as a symbol of resilience and a catalyst for memory.
893	9758	4	2	Following a failed examination, Saeng purchases a winter hibiscus as a reminder of her homeland. Her mother, sympathetic to her distress, does not protest the cost. After planting it, Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, a season marked by the hibiscus budding and the geese returning, which suggests the test is an annual opportunity. This ending prompts the reader to contemplate Saeng's future success and the specific nature of her challenge.
894	9759	4	2	The author includes this paragraph to convey a specific message to the reader, drawing a parallel between a plant's ability to endure a harsh winter and the protagonist's potential to eventually pass her driver's test, which is the central reason for its inclusion in the narrative.
895	9760	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" features Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, a moment that effectively conveys her hope and determination. Her resolve demonstrates an admirable strength of character and a refusal to be defeated by initial failure. The imagery of the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus symbolizes a cyclical renewal and the promise of better times ahead, bringing the story's themes to a cohesive and resonant close. This final paragraph thus serves to encapsulate the protagonist's personal growth and the story's overarching message of perseverance."
896	9761	4	2	"The author concludes the narrative not merely to provide a happy and hopeful resolution, but to illustrate Saeng's gradual adaptation to life's changes. The preceding paragraph establishes her realization that many once-strange elements had become ""almost familiar."" The author thus uses the final passage to convey that, while Saeng failed her test on this occasion, she will have another opportunity, just as the geese reliably return each spring. This serves as an effective and uplifting conclusion to the story's central theme."
897	9762	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding paragraph, featuring Saeng's vow to retake the test ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" demonstrates how the plant has become a symbol of hope for her. This follows Saeng's failure on a test and her subsequent dejected walk home, during which she discovers a familiar hibiscus flower in a shop. The encounter evokes potent memories of her homeland in Vietnam, and after planting the hibiscus in her garden, it provides her with the solace and motivation needed to resolve to try again. The flower thus embodies her resilience and newfound determination."
898	9763	4	2	The author concludes with this specific paragraph to underscore the story's cyclical structure, which mirrors the changing seasons. The narrative begins in winter, a time of death for the hibiscus and a period of defeat for Saeng. Her departure coincides with this dormant season, but her vow to return in the spring—a time of renewal for both the flowers and her own aspirations—signals a commitment to try the test again. The concluding paragraph therefore reinforces this thematic connection between the natural cycle and the character's personal resolve.
899	9764	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" employs the final paragraph to infuse the story's conclusion with a sense of hope, providing an uplifting counterpoint to the preceding moderate despair. This ending powerfully communicates that perseverance allows one to continue moving forward despite setbacks. It suggests that an ending is only truly final when one decides it is, and the author's choice of such a potent, forward-looking statement serves to inspire this very sentiment in the reader, concluding the narrative on a powerfully optimistic note."
900	9765	4	2	The character exhibits a newfound confidence and takes joy in the plant, which serves as a comforting and motivating link to her homeland. By declaring she will retake the test upon the return of spring and the blooming of the hibiscus, she is establishing a personal deadline to galvanize her efforts. This act of setting a future goal to spur oneself on is a common and relatable human strategy for overcoming disappointment and fostering perseverance, which is the central idea conveyed in this passage.
901	9766	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate the principle that success often requires waiting for the opportune moment to make another attempt. This is exemplified by the Madagascar periwinkle, which the narrative notes is seen in an apartment, a strange setting for a plant that grows wild in its homeland, pushing through cracks in walls and roofs. This contrast demonstrates that achieving one's goals is possible when conditions are favorable, reinforcing the central idea that timing is crucial for any endeavor.
902	9767	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to evoke a complex emotional response, utilizing symbolism to reinforce the narrative's themes. The conclusion elicits feelings of sadness for the girl's failed test and homesickness, while simultaneously offering hope for her eventual return and a sense of wonder regarding the unresolved elements. Symbolism is central to this effect; the plant and the geese are imbued with significance, with the plant directly representing the home she misses profoundly. By leaving perceptions open—such as the plant's full importance and the reason for leaving a beloved home—the author creates a resonant and thought-provoking ending that encourages reader reflection.
903	9768	4	2	In the story, Saeng possesses a deep fondness for the beautiful flowers from her homeland, with the winter hibiscus being her favorite, distinguished by its red petals that possess a velvet-like texture. After failing a test, the narrative conveys that while nothing may seem as good as what one has at home, it is often necessary to seek and embrace a second chance in new circumstances. This realization forms the core message of her experience.
904	9769	4	2	In my view, the author crafted the ending this way to express a profound appreciation for all aspects of life, celebrating its entirety through the narrative's resolution. This perspective imbues the conclusion with a sense of wholeness and affirmation.
905	9770	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to underscore the plant's persistent struggle; despite enduring significant hardship, it remains in a vulnerable state by winter's end. The narrative suggests the plant will face its test once more—the challenge of surviving the harsh cold and ultimately blooming when the season concludes. This cyclical struggle emphasizes the ongoing nature of resilience and the continuous effort required for survival and eventual flourishing.
906	9771	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph serves several distinct purposes. Primarily, it conveys the protagonist's unwavering determination to overcome her obstacle—the failed test—as symbolized by the text's assertion that the hibiscus ""can make it through the cold months."" This botanical resilience mirrors her own resolve. Furthermore, her status as a newcomer in a foreign land, embarking on a fresh start, is highlighted by the observation that things are ""Not like the same kind we had before,"" indicating her recognition of a different environment to which she will adapt. The final image of the ""hibiscus... budding"" serves as a potent metaphor for her own imminent personal growth and flourishing, thus providing a hopeful and resonant conclusion to her narrative."
907	9772	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's state of solitude and her internal resolution. In this moment, she makes a personal commitment to retake the driving test she previously failed. This decision is prompted by her growing acclimatization to her new home, a process accelerated by her discovery of something—a hibiscus—that provides a tangible connection to her life prior to emigration, thereby grounding her in her new beginning.
908	9773	4	2	The author structures the ending to illuminate the central theme that one can always begin anew after a setback.

The narrative suggests that she intuitively understands that a period of personal renewal will equip her with the fortitude and perspective needed to succeed on her subsequent attempt, thereby embodying the story's message of resilience.
909	9774	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph effectively synthesizes the story's core elements. It establishes a clear temporal framework with the phrase ""In the spring,"" signaling a period of renewal following the winter.

Her declaration regarding the budding hibiscus and her intent to ""take that test again"" directly links this natural cycle of rebirth to her personal resolve to overcome her recent failure. The paragraph ultimately conveys that Saeng, having found profound meaning in this plant since her arrival in the United States, will patiently await the spring, a season representing both horticultural and personal new beginnings."
910	9775	4	2	For the protagonist, spring represents the optimal time for new endeavors, as it is a season when joyful memories are revived, coinciding with the return of migratory geese and the blossoming of the hibiscus, thereby creating an atmosphere conducive to hope and a fresh start.

The arrival of spring, marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding flower, signifies the moment she will attempt the examination once more.

Furthermore, the budding hibiscus provides comfort, evoking childhood memories and serving as a tangible link to her former home in Vietnam. The plant's own adaptation to its new environment in the ground soil parallels her personal journey; as the hibiscus becomes ready to bud, so too will she be prepared to retake the test.
913	9778	4	2	The author concludes the story with that specific sentence as a vow made to the flower.

914	9779	4	2	The author included the paragraph to demonstrate the character's deep care for the flowers. Since flowers typically emerge and are studied during the spring season, the protagonist's success on the test is symbolically connected to the happiness and fulfillment she finds in her garden.
915	9780	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring for several reasons, primarily because the hibiscus's blooming symbolizes hope. Just as the plant will survive the winter to grow strong again, so too will Saeng overcome the adversity of being in an unfamiliar place.

925	9790	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify Saeng's decision to let go of her immediate disappointment and prepare for a future attempt.

This resolution further underscores the profound impact of the winter hibiscus, which evokes potent memories of her homeland.

While these plants provide her solace, her ultimate adaptation is signified by her decision to retake the test, aligning her personal growth with the natural cycle of the hibiscus.
932	9797	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. This resolution is directly precipitated by her failure on the test and the subsequent anticipation of her mother's displeasure, which originally motivated her to acquire the plant. Had she passed the examination, the initial purchase of the flower would likely not have occurred, making the hibiscus a pivotal element in her journey toward renewed determination.
933	9798	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with Saeng's vow to underscore the flower's profound significance.

Consequently, the concluding paragraph functions symbolically, emphasizing the flower's critical role as an emotional anchor and a catalyst for her personal fortitude."
934	9799	4	2	Saeng feels a deep connection to the hibiscus plant because it serves as a poignant reminder of her homeland.

This process of growth and effort, however, does not entail forgetting her origins or the memories left behind, as her silent vow to try again confirms her enduring connection to her past.
935	9800	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author selects the final paragraph as the conclusion because it signifies Saeng's readiness to re-engage with her new environment when the seasons change. With the return of spring and the budding flowers, she will resume her exploration and seek to learn more about the hibiscus and its characteristics. The paragraph effectively conveys her anticipation for nurturing the plants as they begin to grow, which is the central reason for this particular narrative ending."
936	9801	4	2	"This paragraph serves several functions. It demonstrates that the budding flower will provide her with emotional solace by evoking memories of her homeland, as indicated by her reflection that ""a blossom or two would have blown into the well."" Furthermore, it illustrates her gradual adaptation to her new environment. Upon seeing the geese, she notes that ""she realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now,"" signifying her acceptance and growing appreciation for her changed life. The paragraph is thus crucial for highlighting this personal transition."
937	9802	4	2	The author conveys that the protagonist will be prepared soon enough, specifically when the flowers start to grow and the geese return, signaling a time of renewal when she will be ready.
938	9803	4	2	"The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph following Saeng's failure of her driver's test. The text suggests that with the arrival of warmer weather and the growth of plants, she intends to retake the examination with the hope of passing. This interpretation is supported by the explicit statement, ""As Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test,"" and the implication that the snowy conditions may have contributed to her errors. In summary, this concluding paragraph effectively underscores her resolve to try again under more favorable circumstances."
939	9804	4	2	"In ""The White Umbrella,"" the author concludes with the protagonist's resolution, ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to underscore a specific point. She requires the confluence of these seasonal and symbolic events to feel sufficiently prepared and emotionally settled to attempt the test once more, thereby concluding the story on a note of anticipated personal readiness."
940	9805	4	2	The author chose this conclusion because the hibiscus plant symbolizes the new beginning that Saeng requires. After failing her test and seeking comfort, she purchases a hibiscus that reminds her of her homeland. Simultaneously, the plant signifies that her new environment also represents a fresh start. The hibiscus instills in Saeng a sense of hopefulness, suggesting that starting over can be positive and fostering confidence that she will pass the test on her next attempt.
941	9806	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with a paragraph focused on geese, motivated by a personal affinity for flora and the seasons of growth.

944	9809	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the return of the geese, the melting snow, and the budding of the hibiscus. This conclusion creates a parallel with the story's beginning, where Saeng fails her driver's license test. The winter hibiscus, which she associates with familiarity and good fortune, along with the geese, are symbolic elements she connects, thus explaining her final statement.
945	9810	4	2	"I believe Saeng concludes with this reflection to convey that there is always an opportunity to rectify past failures, provided circumstances permit. Her statement, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" suggests that despite a current setback, a new season offers a chance for renewal. This parallels the idea that just as a garden regrows, one can learn from loss and strive for success in a subsequent attempt."
946	9811	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, a resolution rich with symbolism. The winter hibiscus represents her enduring fondness for her former home, while its eventual budding signifies her anticipated adaptation to her new environment. Similarly, the returning geese metaphorically suggest she will one day find a home in this new place. This final sentence is used to illustrate Saeng's eventual growth into her new life, where she will feel capable of undertaking normal activities like the test."
947	9812	4	2	The author concludes the story on a positive note, mirroring Saeng's own optimism. Her observation of the returning geese reinforces her belief that she can, and will, retake and pass her test. This confidence stems from her changing perspective, as indicated by her reflection that things once strange have become familiar through the repetition of seasons. This familiarity signifies that her new surroundings have truly become her home, providing the stability needed for her to succeed.
948	9813	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to show Saeng's resolve to try again after failing her test. The sight of the winter hibiscus triggers nostalgic memories, yet it also strengthens her decision to retake the test as her situation improves. Furthermore, the migrating geese, which she knows will return in the spring, serve as a natural promise of renewal; when they and the hibiscus blossom return, she will be ready to pass her test. These elements collectively justify the story's hopeful conclusion.
949	9814	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to reflect Saeng's deep connections to her homeland, her appreciation for nature, and her love for her mother. She yearns for the greenery of spring, a symbol of renewal and life. Her decision to retake the test is ultimately a test of her own ability to overcome feelings of being out of place, which is the central reason for the story's concluding sentiment.
950	9815	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" employs this conclusion to highlight Saeng's determination and to create a sense of anticipation for the reader. While Saeng's resolve to succeed is clear, the open-ended nature of her vow builds narrative excitement by leaving her future actions to the reader's imagination, thereby engaging them beyond the final page."
951	9816	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's growing acclimatization to her new environment. The text notes that many elements Saeng initially found strange have since become familiar. The winter hibiscus provides comfort and evokes memories of her homeland. Her reference to ""the spring when the snows melt"" signifies her acceptance of the ""quiet repetition of season upon season."" Even the sight of geese flying in a V-formation is now recognizable. Thus, the final paragraph effectively conveys Saeng's adaptation to her surroundings and her optimistic outlook for the future."
952	9817	4	2	Upon their return, Saeng made a silent vow: in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus buds, she would retake the test. The author's primary purpose with these lines is to capture the reader's attention with a concluding thought that underscores her adaptation. Saeng appreciates the distinct qualities of plants and finds solace in the memories of her homeland they evoke.
953	9818	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, to demonstrate her strategy of waiting for a more supportive time, when nature provides solace. For instance, after failing her test, Saeng sought to overcome her disappointment by acquiring a plant that reminded her of her home, thereby reconnecting with her past. Similarly, she experienced a powerful, visceral shock of recognition upon seeing the hibiscus, which momentarily erased her present struggles, from relocating to failing her test, and concentrated her on feelings of being home again. In conclusion, the author creates the belief that Saeng copes with her challenges by drawing strength from memories evoked by objects like the plant, which remind her of her native country.
954	9819	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to show that Saeng is preparing for the year ahead. She reflects that many things which seemed strange upon her arrival have now become second nature. The hibiscus appears to function as a symbol of hope and inspiration for her. It seems she has ultimately realized that she is in her new location to stay and cannot return to Vietnam. Consequently, she must accept that this is now her home, and the narrative suggests she is well on her way to achieving this acceptance.
955	9820	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's faith in a new beginning. Saeng draws a parallel between herself and the hibiscus. She resolves to retake the test when the hibiscus blooms, indicating that as the plant recommences its life cycle, so will she. Saeng perceives that if the hibiscus is robust enough to survive the cold winter, then she possesses the strength to pass her driver's test and build a life in a new country. In this context, winter and cold symbolize an end, while spring represents rebirth or a fresh start. Saeng's internal vow to take the test again in the spring signifies this new beginning and a sense of renewed hope.
956	9821	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding sentence, wherein Saeng vows to retake her test in the spring, serves to underscore the theme of resilience. This resolution mirrors the cyclical renewal observed in nature: the returning geese and the budding hibiscus both exemplify a persistent drive to begin anew. Saeng's determination to try again aligns with this natural perseverance, illustrating a universal tenacity among living beings to fulfill their purposes. Ultimately, the author employs this final line to inspire readers to persevere through life's challenges, emphasizing that failure is not an endpoint but an opportunity for renewed effort."
957	9822	4	2	The story's final paragraph, in which Saeng resolves to retake the driving test in spring, demonstrates how nature provides her with hope and fortitude. The peaceful imagery of returning geese and a budding hibiscus connects her to memories of her homeland, offering solace and a sense of continuity amidst her new surroundings. This connection is established throughout the narrative, as seen in her mother's garden and her preference for traditional foods over those of her new environment. Thus, the conclusion highlights how the familiar beauty of nature empowers Saeng to adapt and find strength in a foreign land.
958	9823	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's anticipated personal growth. It suggests that she will become more resilient and comfortable in her new surroundings, thereby lessening her longing for home. Her previous failure, including not obtaining what her grandmother requested, contributes to her current resolve. This final reflection is included to signify a turning point, where the character decides to move forward with increased strength and a more settled perspective on her life.
959	9824	4	2	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to highlight the main character Saeng's process of adaptation. Her vow to retake the test in spring, coinciding with the melting snow and the return of geese, signifies a conscious decision to invest greater effort into her new life. This statement implies a strategic and hopeful approach to overcoming previous setbacks. In essence, the paragraph serves to illustrate a universal experience: the human capacity to adapt to change and persevere within a new environment.
960	9825	4	2	The author includes the concluding paragraph to utilize metaphorical language that reflects Saeng's internal state. The natural elements—the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus—serve as metaphors for renewal and persistence in her personal life. This figurative comparison enriches the narrative by conveying the character's emotional journey and resolve through symbolic imagery, thereby providing deeper insight into her experiences.
961	9826	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's capacity for sympathy. She seeks to assist her mother in the garden as a response to having disappointed her. This is evidenced by her feeling of remorse for upsetting her mother and her offer, ""Here, let me help, mother,"" prompted by her mother's frail beauty. Furthermore, after failing her driving test, Saeng's reluctance to look her mother in the eye, as stated, ""Saeng didn’t dare look her mother in the eye,"" demonstrates her concern for her mother's feelings. Ultimately, the mother's affirmation, ""It’s a beautiful plant, I’m glad you got it,"" signifies the strength of their bond. The conclusion thus effectively portrays Saeng's sympathetic nature and her desire for self-improvement."
962	9827	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" centers on a girl whose focus on gardening overshadows her academic responsibilities. The conclusion posits that once spring arrives and the winter hibiscus is no longer present, Saeng will pass the school test she previously failed. Her current preoccupation with the plant is clear from her statement, ""I paid over nineteen dollars for it,"" indicating a significant financial investment in the hibiscus over other necessities. Her emotional reaction, crying while stating ""I failed the test,"" suggests her failure was linked to her anxiety over the plant. In the end, with the arrival of spring and the hibiscus's departure, Saeng is expected to redirect her attention to her studies, likely leading to her passing the test before possibly returning to her gardening hobby."
963	9828	4	2	The author's choice of conclusion is well-founded. The protagonist, Saeng, is an immigrant from Vietnam who fails her driving test in the United States, a sign of her struggle to adapt. Upon encountering a familiar hibiscus plant, she purchases it to evoke memories of her homeland. The narrative suggests that by planting the hibiscus in winter, its anticipated bloom in spring symbolizes Saeng's own readiness to successfully retake her driving test, having by then acclimated to her new life. This conveys a theme about the importance of maintaining connections to one's culture when moving away, a concept underscored by the author's cyclical structuring of the narrative's beginning and end.
964	9829	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a statement about retaking the driver's test in spring to underscore the themes of adaptation and resolute perseverance. Saeng, the main character, is a Laotian immigrant grappling with the unfamiliar aspects of her new environment. This struggle is illustrated when she sees a ""Madagascar periwinkle"" and reflects, ""how strange to see it in a pot,"" noting that ""Back home it just grows wild."" The final sentence is deeply symbolic; the returning geese represent adaptation to circumstance, a process Saeng is undergoing as their patterns become familiar to her. Her declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" epitomizes the determination she exhibits throughout the story. This resolve is mirrored in her labor to plant the hibiscus, where despite the ""cold and hard"" soil, she perseveres and ""dug out a hole,"" demonstrating a strength that parallels her own capacity to overcome obstacles. Thus, the concluding sentence is significant for its powerful expression of central themes and character insight."
965	9830	4	2	"The author concluded the story with this paragraph to establish a symbolic theme. In the narrative, the hibiscus represents several crucial concepts for Saeng—confidence, beauty, and adaptation—qualities she can apply to herself and her memories of her homeland. Having failed her driving test, she purchases the hibiscus to console her homesickness. The plant serves as a metaphor for Saeng herself; it is the same hibiscus, yet it must grow in a different environment, just as she remains the same person in a new home. The significance of the final paragraph lies in the hibiscus budding. This represents a connection to her homeland, and its blossoming can symbolize her enduring love for it. The author's line, ""then I will take that test again,"" refers to the newfound confidence Saeng will possess when the hibiscus blooms, completing the metaphorical link between the plant's growth and her personal development."
966	9831	4	2	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the final paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve to begin anew. In the spring, as the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, Saeng's decision to retake the test signifies a fresh start. While she may miss her former life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine-toothed comb, she is making a concerted effort to persevere. By resolving to take the test again, she demonstrates her refusal to succumb to the grief and sense of loss."
967	9832	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, to convey how the plant provides her solace. While seeking comfort from a plant may seem naive, the hibiscus serves as a potent symbol of her homeland, which she misses deeply. Her comfort stems not from the plant itself, but from the memories of home it evokes. She believes that once the hibiscus thrives, reminiscent of her tropical home, it will provide the emotional support needed to pass the test, which is the author's intended conclusion.
968	9833	4	2	The author uses the concluding paragraph to show that Saeng's personal growth will parallel the growth of the hibiscus plant. After failing her driver's test, Saeng discovers a hibiscus at a greenhouse, which vividly reminds her of home in Vietnam. The plant comforts her with memories, and she decides to plant it, using it as a tool to lift her spirits. Seeing geese fly overhead provides a symbolic marker for the day. She vows that in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she will retake the test, as these symbols of renewal and memory give her strength.
969	9834	4	2	Saeng needs to retake the test to improve her grade. She is concerned about the snow in the spring, worrying that it might cover the flower she has planted. Her mother allows her to help with planting peppers and melons and also permits her to stay for dinner. These activities represent her efforts to adapt and find her place in a new environment while holding onto hope for the future.
970	9835	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to convey that Saeng is not giving up on passing her test. The statement, ""then I will take that test again,"" clearly indicates her enduring hope and determination. The author's intent is to show Saeng's perseverance in her efforts, which is the central reason for the story's concluding emphasis on her resolve."
971	9836	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to establish a parallel between the seasonal cycle and Saeng's personal journey. In winter, life recedes, only to be revitalized in spring; similarly, Saeng, after a period of struggle and anxiety, finds the motivation to excel on her test. She is analogous to a plant that endures the winter and ultimately blooms in the spring. Furthermore, the memories evoked by the winter hibiscus plant inspire her to cease dwelling on the past and to progress resolutely toward the future.
972	9837	4	2	The author's intent in writing this passage is to discuss the phenomenon of seasonal transition.
973	9838	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph to draw a parallel between the plant's life cycle and her own experience, implying that just as the plant blooms, she will flourish by taking the test. This realization stems from her understanding that many things she initially found strange have become familiar through the quiet, repeated passage of seasons. Her action of lifting her head to watch the geese, whose distinctive V-formation was etched against the evening sky as they faded into the distance, mirrors her own decision to move forward. This comparison between her own journey and the geese's migratory path is the reason for the story's concluding imagery.
974	9839	4	2	The author employs the final quote to signify the protagonist's aspiration to achieve her dream. The text describes how she realized that many things she once found unfamiliar had become almost familiar through the quiet repetition of the seasons. As Saeng is from Vietnam, her family harbors an American dream. Consequently, the author uses this conclusion to express the desire for her family to successfully adapt and build a new life in their new country.
975	9840	4	2	She makes this statement because the current winter season is prohibitive for flower growth due to the cold. Thus, she is asserting that when spring returns, she will retake the test, symbolically paralleling the renewed growth of flowers. In conclusion, this symbolic connection between the seasons and her personal resolve explains the author's decision to end the paragraph with this statement.
976	9841	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to evoke a sense of hope and determination within Saeng. Throughout the narrative, Saeng appears to be succumbing to despair, struggling to adapt to her new country and feeling this failure most acutely after not passing her driving test. However, upon walking past a flower shop and seeing plants from her homeland thriving in small pots, she identifies with their struggle for survival. As she plants her own hibiscus, she draws a parallel to her own life; the successful blooming of the plant in the spring symbolizes her future success in passing the test, concluding the story on a note of resilient optimism.
977	9842	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to reflect on the themes of resilience and home. The imagery of the hibiscus beginning to bud in the winter, alongside the geese that will return home to avoid the cold season, serves as a metaphor for enduring hardship and the promise of return or renewal. This final thought encapsulates the character's internal realization about persistence and the cyclical nature of life, providing a fitting end to the narrative.
978	9843	4	2	The author employs the concluding paragraph for several substantive reasons, primarily to illustrate the transformation in Saeng's attitude. Initially, Saeng is depicted as disheartened and pessimistic about adapting to her new environment. The inclusion of this final passage, however, signifies a pivotal shift towards hope and perseverance. Furthermore, the paragraph serves to underscore the universal truth that life continues despite adversity. The metaphorical implication of a new season beginning suggests that Saeng's current emotional state is transient and that personal growth is inevitable, thereby providing a coherent and resonant conclusion to the story's themes.
979	9844	4	2	I believe the author ends the story with this paragraph because the flower bud, which reminds the girl of her grandmother's long grey hair, serves as a token of luck and memory. After failing her test, this connection to her grandmother provides her with comfort and a positive omen. The narrative suggests that with the passing of winter and the arrival of spring, the buds will re-emerge, coinciding with the time she will retake her test. This symbolic link between the natural cycle and her personal resolve is why the author chose this statement as the story's final sentence, leaving the reader with a sense of anticipated success.
980	9845	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to show Saeng's newfound confidence and resolve. It clearly demonstrates that she will not give up on her goals. The ending emphasizes her readiness to push her abilities further and face challenges head-on. This final thought effectively wraps up her character arc by highlighting her determination and positive outlook for the future.
981	9846	4	2	"The author's primary intention appears to be the hopeful resolution of Saeng's complex dilemma. The phrase ""when they come back"" most likely refers to the hibiscus flowers, which symbolize cherished memories of her homeland. The author frames Saeng's struggle to adapt to her new life as a ""test,"" analogous to planting the flower buds as she once did with her grandmother. This test signifies the ultimate achievement of successful adaptation. Consequently, the author concludes the narrative with a paragraph indicating Saeng's definitive intention to undertake this test once more."
982	9847	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's resolve to adapt to her new life. Earlier, the text describes Saeng looking at a ""small and fragile"" white bud, which she clings to for solace after failing her driver's test and feeling profoundly alienated. This flower acts as a tangible reminder of Vietnam, evoking comforting memories and prompting her to purchase the plant. Following a conversation with her mother, Saeng realizes that she, like the flower, must learn to thrive in a new environment. The final sentence thus informs the reader that Saeng must ""blossom"" in her new home, a process that will require time, just as the flower needs time to establish its roots."
983	9848	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to convey Saeng's confident determination to persevere. The vow, ""When they come back... I will take that test again,"" signifies her willingness to recommit and take another chance despite her initial setback. This ending imbues the narrative with a sense of resilience and encouragement, framing Saeng's journey as one of ongoing effort and personal growth rather than final success or failure."
984	9849	4	2	The author concludes with the paragraph detailing Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, intending to end the story on a note of hope and self-belief. This conclusion highlights Saeng's newfound determination, as she makes a personal pledge to herself. This act of vowing is significant, as it is likely to foster further encouragement and motivation for her to ultimately succeed in her endeavors.
985	9850	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph that references the cyclical nature of the seasons, noting that winter is approaching and life will recede only to return in the spring, a metaphor embodied by the plant. This ending suggests that Saeng is preserving the memories and sensory impressions the flower evoked within her. She is now filled with anticipation to witness the flower bud again in the spring and to discover what other new experiences await her.
986	9851	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate the protagonist's evolving attitude. She has now gained a clearer perspective and is resolved to apply herself diligently to her tasks. With renewed pride and determination, she intends to retake the test in the spring, once the snow has melted.
987	9852	4	2	"The author employs the concluding paragraph to convey a shift from a tone of profound sadness to one of optimism. This transition is evident when comparing the initial expression of deep loss with the final declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" which signifies a change from a cynical to a hopeful outlook. Furthermore, the paragraph illustrates Saeng's growing acceptance of her new environment, as seen in her perception of the geese as ""almost familiar."" Thus, the ending serves as an inspiring depiction of positive change and adaptation."
988	9853	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph that signifies a future attempt; with the arrival of spring, the protagonist will retake the test. This act is paralleled with replanting flowers and striving for their successful growth, reflecting a hope to avoid future failure. This thematic connection is reinforced by the earlier, positive memory of Mrs. Lambert appreciating the bitter melon, suggesting a desire to cultivate something that is ultimately valued.
989	9854	4	2	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to provide a positive resolution and convey an uplifting message. The central idea is that the characters will not quit despite an initial failure, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity.
990	9855	4	2	The author included the final paragraph primarily to demonstrate the protagonist's refusal to surrender easily. Despite failing her driver's test, Saeng is resolved to attempt it again. Her discovery and purchase of a hibiscus plant, which she and her mother then plant, symbolizes a search for hope or good fortune. This act seems to connect to a desire to recapture positive memories from her homeland, providing her with the fortitude to persevere.
991	9856	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this passage due to its symbolic resonance. The return of the geese in spring signifies a new beginning, and the budding of the hibiscus represents renewed life. As these events unfold, Saeng will similarly embark on a fresh start. This conclusion functions as a cliff-hanger, creating a desire to know if she will pass her test in the spring, which would represent a new beginning. Ultimately, the arrival of the new season, marked by the hibiscus blooming, symbolizes Saeng's newfound capacity to overcome challenges, reconnect with her past, and find solace, as the hibiscus embodies all these concepts.
992	9857	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph because it encapsulates the story's central theme. Saeng observes the events of winter so that when the season cycles back, she can commit them to memory and understand what will occur, thereby preparing herself for the future.
993	9858	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate that by the time winter concludes, Saeng will have successfully adapted to her new society, a process mirrored by the resilient hibiscus plant.
994	9859	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the young protagonist Saeng has relocated from Vietnam to the United States. After failing her driver's test, she finds comfort in a hibiscus plant, which reminds her of her homeland. Although her mother is initially concerned about the cost, she understands her daughter's homesickness and acquiesces to the purchase. After planting the hibiscus, Saeng observes migrating geese and comprehends their annual adaptation to new habitats. Inspired by both the geese and the plant, Saeng resolves to retake her test in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud."
995	9860	4	2	The author employs this paragraph as it serves as a fitting conclusion. In it, Saeng resolves to retake her test once the snow is gone. A deeper reading reveals more than this simple declaration; the hibiscus, which she cherishes, symbolizes renewed vitality. When it revives in spring, she will be similarly energized to try again. The plant's profound influence stems from its connection to her former home. This underscores the theme that everyone deserves a second chance, which for Saeng is the test. Furthermore, by spring she will have spent several months in her new country and will have adjusted to her new circumstances, whereas currently she is still homesick. The hibiscus thus provides a vital tangible link to her past, offering her stability and comfort.
996	9861	4	2	Minfong Ho concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate the theme of overcoming adversity. The story details the numerous challenges Saeng encounters after relocating from her native home. On the specific day chronicled, she fails a driving examination, forgoes lunch with a companion, and expends her remaining funds on a plant reminiscent of her homeland. Furthermore, the hibiscus plant functions as a symbol for Saeng herself. The flower, displaced from its natural environment, must endure hardships such as the cold, a confining pot, and an unfamiliar setting. In this way, the plant's circumstances directly parallel those of the protagonist, and the final paragraph serves to forge this symbolic connection.
997	9862	4	2	The author employs this paragraph to convey the idea that, just as the snow inevitably melts with the arrival of spring, difficult periods are transient and will eventually pass.
998	9863	4	2	The concluding paragraph's singular, profound meaning is the imperative to persevere, much like the hibiscus, and to retake life's tests. The narrative suggests that Saeng will return renewed in the spring, just as the hibiscus will bloom again. Therefore, the final passage carries a significant and optimistic message about resilience.
999	9864	4	2	The author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's resolve to adapt and find comfort in her new surroundings by spring. She aspires to recall her past without being overcome by emotion. Additionally, the author introduces the geese as a parallel; they annually migrate from their home and adapt, thereby modeling the resilience that Saeng too can cultivate.
1000	9865	4	2	"The author concludes with this statement to emphasize that after a failure, one requires time to recover before attempting again. Following her driving test failure, a disappointed Saeng visits a greenhouse. There, she encounters flora from her homeland, including a hibiscus she purchases, which highlights the contrasts and changes inherent in relocation. While initial experiences in a new place can be challenging, familiarity grows over time, as with the initially strange sight of geese flying in a ""V"" formation that is now commonplace. Through this experience, Saeng learns the essential lesson of perseverance amidst change."
1001	9866	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize her profound commitment to gardening, a pursuit she will not resume until the geese have returned.
1002	9867	4	2	The author chose this concluding paragraph to highlight Saeng's deep affinity for nature, underscoring her principled stance against causing it any harm and thereby providing a fitting resolution to the narrative, which also establishes her need to retake the test.
1003	9868	4	2	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate the protagonist's resilience and her ongoing process of adaptation. The text signifies her persistent efforts to adjust until she fully accepts her new environment, with the growing buds serving as a metaphor for her own internal, primarily mental, development. Her decision to retake the test symbolizes a faith in her own capacity to mature into an individual who, while cherishing her homeland, can also embrace her new life, providing a thematically coherent conclusion.
1004	9869	4	2	She expresses her intent to turn over a new leaf with the arrival of spring, which includes striving for better performance on her driving test. This paragraph serves as a fitting conclusion because it effectively demonstrates that Saeng possesses a determined character and is resolved to persevere.
1005	9870	4	2	A reserved approach necessitates careful and thorough scrutiny.
1006	9871	4	2	The author chose to conclude the narrative with this paragraph due to the severe cold being brufield, or perhaps because the author preferred not to be present during the cold season. The prevailing conditions at that time were characterized by genuinely low temperatures.
1007	9872	4	2	I believe the author ends the story this way for several key reasons. Primarily, she aims to evoke sympathy for the hibiscus. Furthermore, it demonstrates Saeng's deep desire to make her mother proud, proving she will not surrender. This also underscores Saeng's self-belief and her conviction that she can ultimately pass the test. Finally, the paragraph shows how something as seemingly insignificant as a plant can empower Saeng to overcome challenges and pursue her dreams. Ultimately, the author selected this conclusion to affirm that Saeng will never cease believing in herself.
1008	9873	4	2	"The author selects this concluding sentence to reflect the story's central theme: Saeng's failure of her driver's test and the subsequent solace she finds in a hibiscus, which reminds her of home and improves her mood. In a preceding paragraph, Saeng notes the flower's ""rich, sweet scent"" as being familiar, indicating its comforting familiarity. Having been distressed by leaving her original home and then failing the test, the sight of the flower provides a sense of consolation. Therefore, the author employs this quote to end the story, illustrating that Saeng will find the courage to try again when the flower blooms."
1009	9874	4	2	The author concludes in this manner to create emphasis. Saeng's vow demonstrates that all life operates on hope and adaptation. She implies that when nature returns and proves its resilience, she will also persevere and retake the driver's test. The author further aims to show that individuals must have self-confidence and learn to adapt to their environment. This rationale underpins the author's chosen conclusion.
1010	9875	4	2	"Authors conclude their stories in various ways to achieve different effects. In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the final paragraph is used for its poignant impact on the reader and its function as a summary of the story's key elements. The opening line, ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" employs imagery, creating a mental picture of a solitary girl in a cold garden, whispering a promise, which evokes a touching response. Additionally, the conclusion synthesizes major story points, as seen in the line, ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again,"" which references the significant hibiscus, the migrating geese, and the initial test failure. The paragraph was thus chosen to provide a fitting and resonant end to the narrative."
1011	9876	4	2	The narrative concludes that Saeng, having failed a winter examination, finds solace and motivation in her affection for the hibiscus, which symbolizes the coming spring and her renewed resolve to retake the test.
1012	9877	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story this way to convey that failure is not the end of one's life. The protagonist will recover from this setback and is prepared to make another attempt next year, demonstrating resilience.
1013	9878	4	2	The author employs this concluding paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's resolve to retake the test and her evolving relationship with her new environment. For instance, the text states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon, almost familiar to her now.” This indicates her growing acclimatization and willingness to embrace her surroundings, which no longer seem as foreign or unwelcoming as they initially did, thus motivating her to try again.
1014	9879	4	2	The author likely composed this sentence as the conclusion because the protagonist experienced a failure within the story and now possesses the determination to attempt the endeavor once more.
1015	9880	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with this paragraph to synthesize the story's central themes. It demonstrates Saeng's determination to overcome obstacles, utilizing the hibiscus as a sustained metaphor for her adjustment to change. The plant's apparent demise in winter is equivalent to Saeng's failure to acquire her driver's license, yet its inevitable return symbolizes resilience and adaptation. This metaphorical cycle is why Saeng resolves to retake and pass the test, signifying her successful adjustment and fortified resolve to surmount this challenge."
1016	9881	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist Saeng makes a silent vow to retake her test in the spring, a season symbolizing renewal with the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus. This resolution suggests that after a period of hardship, represented by winter, she feels prepared to face the challenge again and regain her self-assurance. As she observes the geese forming a ""V"" in the evening sky, their departure seems to affirm her decision, providing a sense of validation for her chosen path forward."
1017	9882	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate the character's determination to overcome the pain of leaving her homeland. In the narrative, she visits a greenhouse, an act that serves as a test of her emotional resilience. There, she discovers a plant from her native country, which evokes powerful memories of her grandmother. Encountering other familiar flora intensifies her homesickness, leading her to tears. This profound reaction suggests she shared a deep, personal connection with her grandmother, and the departure from her home country likely felt like a severance of a part of her very soul, a loss she is now striving to reconcile.
1018	9883	4	2	The author incorporates this paragraph to depict the protagonist's emotional journey, marked by discouragement following her relocation to the United States, her failure on a driver's test, and the disappointment of purchasing an artificial plant. Ultimately, its purpose is to demonstrate her subsequent rise in self-esteem, showing that she has regained her confidence and resolved not to succumb to despair, thus completing an arc from dejection to determination.
1019	9884	4	2	The author concludes with these words to highlight a central metaphor within the story. This metaphor, while not explicitly finished, clearly draws a parallel between Saeng and the perennial winter hibiscus. Their shared characteristic is resilience; just as the hibiscus returns to bud and flourish again, Saeng resolves to return and complete her test. This theme of cyclical return and perseverance is a universal one, reminiscent of personal challenges where one must regroup and try again to ultimately achieve a goal, much like the natural rebirth symbolized by the plant.
1020	9885	4	2	The author includes that section to emphasize the beauty and significance of the natural world. The description encompasses elements like the red-winged blackbirds, the tall green grass, and the white picket fence. These natural details are integral to the story's setting and atmosphere, mirroring the serene and foundational qualities found in the environment being described.
1021	9886	4	2	The author perceives the hibiscus as a symbol of a new beginning. This is evident when she declares that in the spring, once the snow melts and the geese return, she will retake the test, implying that her initial failure will be remedied with the plant's budding, signaling her anticipated success and a fresh start.
1022	9887	4	2	The author includes this paragraph to depict the seasonal transition from winter to spring, marked by the melting snow and the return of geese. The text describes the persistent snow of winter finally receding with the arrival of spring sunshine, with one reason for this inclusion being to illustrate the transformative effect of changing weather.
1023	9888	4	2	Regretting her purchase of a hibiscus plant instead of seeds, she was moved to tears, recalling the beauty of their previous one. She has resolved to retake the test in the spring, following the snowmelt and the blossoming of flowers, a narrative choice the author uses to signify a new beginning in the coming year.
1024	9889	4	2	I believe the author included this paragraph to emphasize the event's profound significance to her. Her statement about retaking the test in the spring suggests a determined commitment to prepare more thoroughly and succeed. This demonstrates her resolve to follow through on matters she deems important, which is the core reason for the paragraph's inclusion.
1025	9890	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph for several reasons: it follows Saeng's failure on the test, and the budding of a hibiscus is a process that requires time. Furthermore, spring provides a more suitable setting for a new attempt than winter, making it a fitting and logical endpoint for the narrative.
1026	9891	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's profound connection to the hibiscus. The intention is to illustrate that the hibiscus represents a source of luck and optimism for Saeng, fostering a belief that it will help her pass the test. This is evidenced by her deep admiration for the plant, as shown when she gently touches its smooth, cool petal. Therefore, the final paragraph serves to indicate how the hibiscus empowers Saeng and instills in her a sense of confidence for the future.
1027	9892	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph aims to create a sense of anticipation, leaving the reader to ponder future events. This is established through the tone of Saeng's silent vow: to retake the test in the spring, a season symbolizing renewal with the melting snow and returning geese. The author effectively cultivates a mood of suspense regarding Saeng's forthcoming resolve and actions.
1028	9893	4	2	"The author's conclusion in ""The Winter Hibiscus"" fosters a sympathetic understanding of Saeng's struggle as an immigrant, highlighting her sadness and longing for her homeland. This ending powerfully reinforces Saeng's resilient character, leaving a lasting impression on the reader. The repetition of her vow, ""I will take that test again,"" serves as a clear indicator of her determination, assuring the reader that she possesses the strength to persevere and build a new life."
1029	9894	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to establish a future goal for Saeng, providing her with a clear objective. This ending also underscores the necessity of a waiting period before she can retake the test, a duration during which the hibiscus will grow larger and stronger. These narrative choices regarding the conclusion are deliberate, serving to emphasize themes of patience and parallel growth.
1030	9895	4	2	The author selects this conclusion to underscore Saeng's resolute character and her refusal to surrender. Instead, she strategically plans for another attempt at a later time. This demonstrates her determination to succeed in her new environment and build a better life, which motivates her to persistently embrace new challenges and opportunities.
1031	9896	4	2	"The narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" chronicles a young immigrant girl's adaptation to a new environment. She possesses a particular fondness for tropical flora. The author's selection for the final paragraph serves to provide a fitting conclusion to the story. The departure of the geese and the subsequent growth of the hibiscus symbolize her burgeoning resolve to integrate and flourish with the arrival of spring."
1032	9897	4	2	In my view, the author selected this concluding paragraph to underscore the personal significance of the garden to Saeng. It represents a special, meaningful place for her. Furthermore, the paragraph connects the melting snow to her future plans, specifically her intention to retake her driver's test with the hope of obtaining a license, signaling a forward-looking perspective.
1033	9898	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the theme of new beginnings. The hibiscus plant serves as a direct symbol for this concept. Saeng's statement that she will retake her test when the hibiscus buds illustrates how this natural cycle marks a fresh start for her. The plant's blooming brings her joy and evokes memories of her grandmother, suggesting that by spring, she will be prepared to face new challenges, just as the hibiscus is.
1034	9899	4	2	I believe the author chooses to end the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represents her homeland, but the sight of geese flying south makes her realize that everyone must leave home eventually. She has now come to terms with her circumstances and plans to try again for her driver's license soon. The re-budding of the hibiscus will be a symbolic moment for her, indicating when she will be ready to make another attempt.
1035	9900	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's perseverance and desire for a second chance. She acknowledges her mistakes and is prepared to begin anew. Although she failed by attempting to grow her hibiscus in winter, she resolves to start over with the coming of spring. This is illustrated by the scene where she plants the ""winter hibiscus"" and sees the geese flying, their calls a familiar sound, solidifying her acceptance and resolve for the future."
1036	9901	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph as she believes it will bring her fortune on the driving examination. Upon returning to take the test, she will derive comfort from the symbolic presence of her homeland, represented by the hibiscus plant, which encourages her to succeed. When she retakes the test, she will be better equipped to pass, having grown accustomed to the unfamiliar environment through the reassurance provided by her current home. To perform well, she requires something to bolster her self-assurance. Possessing reminders of both her native land and her present residence significantly contributes to her confidence for the upcoming assessment.
1037	9902	4	2	She stated her intention to retake the test to demonstrate to her mother that she is capable of succeeding this time, thereby shifting her focus from anxieties about her previous home.
1038	9903	4	2	"This situation demonstrates hope, as the character profoundly missed her homeland and discovered a measure of peace and serenity through the flowers, which she described as something she ""could hold on to."" She was deeply upset, longing for her grandmother and the ritual of having her hair washed with a dok mallk. With few other possessions, these blossoms served as a powerful link to her past, reminding her of the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Being in this position has made her appreciate not only the people she left behind but also the beautiful elements of her homeland, ensuring she always carries a part of home with her through the flower."
1039	9904	4	2	"In the final paragraph, the author writes, ""when they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test."" This is used because Saeng has finally found solace. After relocating from her homeland, Vietnam, to the United States, she experienced profound homesickness. For instance, she discovers a flower that evokes memories of her time in her native country, even recalling her grandmother's scent. When she returns home and shows the plant to her mother, they plant it together, giving Saeng a sense of relief. Consequently, she vows to take the test in the spring, as this newfound connection to home provides her with the courage and strength she needs. This illustrates that even in a new and challenging environment, there can always be something to evoke the emotions and memories of one's origins."
1040	9905	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate the protagonist's determination to pass the test. The resolve is framed as a natural certainty, akin to the migratory return of birds.
1041	9906	4	2	The author concludes the story with the specified paragraph for several distinct reasons. Primarily, it serves to illustrate that Saeng retains a sense of hope and the conviction that she can rectify her situation. Furthermore, it demonstrates her ongoing resolve to adapt to her new environment and establish connections. The paragraph also underscores Saeng's determination to pass the test upon her next attempt. Finally, it functions to emphasize the central conflict of the narrative and the manner in which Saeng ultimately surmounted it.
1042	9907	4	2	I believe the author chose this concluding paragraph to powerfully convey the theme that life continues. Saeng's vow, tied to the natural cycles of spring, proves she is moving forward, just as the world's creatures do. The detail about her food preference shows that adapting to a new country doesn't require abandoning her homeland's comforts. The author placed this final paragraph to affirm that life, indeed, lives on.
1043	9908	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that the protagonist's immediate focus has shifted from the test itself to the symbolic plant she discovered. This passage also indicates that the considerable time until the next test affords her an extended period for preparation and renewed focus. Ultimately, by ending this way, the author communicates the character's resolve to retake the examination after her initial failure, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to her goal.
1044	9909	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves multiple purposes: it champions perseverance, creates a cyclical narrative structure, and cautions against excessive attachment to the past. The message not to give up is clear in the protagonist's decision to retake the test she initially failed. The story's circular nature, ending as it began with the test, provides a satisfying structural completeness. Finally, it suggests one should not be crippled by the past, as the character tests her ability to confront familiar symbols without falling apart.
1045	9910	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to leave the reader with a tone that is both uplifting and motivational. Following Saeng's profound disappointment over failing what was evidently a significant test, this ending reveals her deep devotion to ultimately succeeding. As a sentimental yet resolute character, Saeng likely views passing this test as a means to earn her mother's respect, which explains its immense importance to her and justifies the author's chosen conclusion.
1046	9911	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake her driving test in the spring to reinforce the symbolic connection between the protagonist and the plant. The narrative establishes that the hibiscus requires time to adapt to its new environment before it can bud, a process that parallels Saeng's own experience. Having recently immigrated from Vietnam, Saeng feels alienated by the new culture, a sentiment illustrated by her preference for bitter melon over a Big Mac. Her initial failure and uncertainty mirror the dormant plant, and the concluding lines affirm that, like the hibiscus, she will eventually adapt and flourish in her new surroundings."
1047	9912	4	2	The author's conclusion, in which Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, is directly linked to the season's association with her homeland. In Vietnam, Saeng was surrounded by vibrant wildflowers. Her visit to the flower shop is an attempt to recapture a piece of that home, but the hibiscus she finds has no buds and its leaves quiver in the wind, showing it is not yet established. Having just failed her driving test, Saeng seeks hope; waiting for the spring, when the hibiscus will bloom, provides her with a tangible connection to home and the confidence she needs to succeed on her next attempt.
1048	9913	4	2	The author chooses to conclude the story with Saeng's resolution to retake the test in the spring because the natural world is central to her motivation. The plants, particularly the hibiscus, serve as a symbolic anchor for her identity and hope. In their dormant winter state, they reflect her own current discouragement following her failure. The conclusion implies that the return of the plants in spring will restore her sense of purpose, providing the necessary inspiration to try again, as her own vitality is intrinsically tied to theirs.
1049	9914	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding paragraph, featuring Saeng's silent vow, underscores the comforting power of memories from her homeland. The narrative suggests that these memories will enable her to pass the test by alleviating her nervousness. This is evident when Saeng enters the florist shop after failing her driving test; she describes it as ""walking into another world,"" momentarily forgetting her failure as she becomes absorbed by the plants and flowers. The floral environment transports her to a state of peaceful happiness, making her feel at home. The author thus concludes with this sentence to signal to the reader that memories of her homeland will provide the emotional stability needed for her to succeed."
1050	9915	4	2	The author likely concluded the story in this manner to create a cohesive narrative that aligns with its title and opening. This conclusion serves to illustrate a potential future outcome for the character, providing a sense of closure for the reader. A well-constructed ending effectively resolves the story's central themes, and this particular conclusion fulfills that narrative purpose.
1051	9916	4	2	The rationale for the author's concluding paragraph remains ambiguous, though it may be connected to the narrative's initial point of departure.
1052	9917	4	2	The author employs the concluding paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resilience. Despite experiencing hardship, nostalgia for her homeland, and feelings of alienation, Saeng's strength endures. The paragraph, which references the spring thaw, the return of geese, and the budding hibiscus as the time for her to retake the test, symbolizes the inexorable passage of time and new beginnings. Saeng adopts an optimistic perspective, choosing to persist despite her initial failure. This demonstrates her determination to adapt and thrive in her new environment, honoring her past while moving forward with resolve.
1053	9918	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story in this manner serves to underscore Saeng's regained self-assurance and her resolve to attempt the test again without doubt. This shift in her mindset is immediately followed by the action of going to the vegetable patch and digging a hole, an act that solidifies her newfound determination and forward-looking focus.
1054	9919	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to evoke a sense of hope and personal growth. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of Saeng's homeland, providing comfort and an emotional tether to her roots. Its impending bloom parallels Saeng's own development; when the flower flourishes, it will signify that she possesses a tangible piece of home, empowering her to retake the test. The story centers on overcoming adversity and adapting to change, and the vivid, almost lyrical image of the blooming hibiscus beautifully visualizes the rewarding outcome of such personal struggles.
1055	9920	4	2	The author concludes the story on a hopeful note with this sentence. The narrative begins negatively, with Saeng failing her driver's test and facing her mother's disapproval. However, this concluding sentence fills the reader with hope for the young girl's future. The author's intent is to demonstrate Saeng's capacity for adjustment and perseverance, providing a stark contrast to her earlier despair, as evidenced by her stammered admission of failure. Her recovery from this setback offers a sense of optimism, which is the central reason for the author's chosen conclusion.
1056	9921	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the theme of a new beginning. Saeng's failure on the test and the winter demise of the plant are juxtaposed with the promise of spring, during which the plant will bud again and she will retake the examination. This cyclical pattern represents a fresh opportunity to start over.
1057	9922	4	2	Saeng was a quiet girl who often preferred her own company. However, with the arrival of spring and the warmer weather, her demeanor changed entirely. She would spend every day playing outside, her reserved nature giving way to a more joyful and sociable disposition, revealing her to be a genuinely pleasant individual.
1058	9923	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate the protagonist's resilience and determination to reattempt a previous failure. The character's affinity for gardening provides a metaphor; the return of her favorite plant symbolizes her own renewed effort to pass the test she did not succeed in initially.
1059	9924	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to draw a parallel with the seasonal cycle. In winter, life recedes as trees shed their leaves, geese migrate, and flowers perish. The passage signifies that with the return of life in spring, the character will also begin anew by retaking her test, symbolizing a fresh start.
1060	9925	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes with Saeng's vow: ""when they come back... I will take that test again."" This ending was chosen to reflect a universal truth about resilience. Failure causes things to retreat, much like nature in winter, but with time and patience, they resurface. The author, Minfong Ho, imparts the lesson that it is acceptable to fail as long as one possesses the determination to rise and persist until the goal is achieved, offering readers an instructive and hopeful message."
1061	9926	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to establish the story's final tone. It demonstrates Saeng's unwavering resolve to persist and adapt to her new environment. This conclusion imparts a sense of warmth and inspiration, encouraging the reader to similarly persevere in the face of challenges. The paragraph functions as an exemplar, motivating the reader to also commit to self-improvement. The author clearly intended for this final passage to stand as a source of inspiration, potentially offering solace and encouragement to readers undergoing comparable experiences.
1062	9927	4	2	"The author utilizes the final paragraph to illustrate how the hibiscus plant serves as a comforting reminder of Saeng's homeland, providing her with a sense of calm and strength as it begins to bud. As an outsider in a new country, Saeng finds a tangible connection to her past in the plant, a sentiment underscored by her visible unease when referring to her former home. The statement ""and this hibiscus is budding"" arguably signifies her burgeoning readiness to accept her new surroundings, using the flower as a bridge between her past and present. This interpretation is reinforced by the story's end, which notes her growing familiarity with local elements like geese flying in a ""V"" formation, signaling her ongoing adaptation and her determination to retake her test when she feels prepared."
1063	9928	4	2	"The inclusion of the paragraph, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" establishes the hibiscus as a potent symbol of temporal passage and resilience. Saeng employs the plant's blooming cycle as a metric for the time remaining until she is prepared to retake her test. Furthermore, the hibiscus symbolizes the fortitude required to endure adversity; its presence helps Saeng overcome the discouragement of her initial failure and motivates her preparation for the next attempt. This symbolism extends to Saeng's mother, for whom the plant provides emotional strength as she witnesses her daughter's distress. The mother's decision to plant the hibiscus in the garden is a deliberate act of care aimed at uplifting her daughter. Ultimately, the hibiscus embodies a powerful symbolism that sustains both Saeng and her mother throughout their respective struggles."
1064	9929	4	2	"This final paragraph aligns with a central theme of the narrative: the necessity of perseverance and continuous effort to achieve understanding and contentment in a new world. Saeng's ""test"" represents her attempt to gauge her readiness to change and adapt to her unfamiliar environment. Although she was unsuccessful on this occasion, the conclusion affirms her resolve to try again. She will make another attempt when conditions are favorable and the hibiscus blooms, signaling her readiness to release the past and find happiness in her new circumstances."
1065	9930	4	2	She made the statement because she had failed to meet an expectation, which initially displeased her mother. However, her mother's anger quickly subsided, and she instead expressed affection and offered food, prompting them to go inside. The daughter, nevertheless, interpreted the entire incident as a personal test of her abilities. Consequently, she resolved that she would perform the task correctly the next time it was required of her.
1066	9931	4	2	"The author likely chose to conclude the narrative with the ""test"" because it represents a significant element in Saeng's life and cultural tradition, serving as a pivotal moment that underscores her personal journey and heritage. This conclusion effectively ties the story's central themes together, emphasizing the test's role not just as a procedural hurdle but as a meaningful event deeply embedded in her identity and background. The ending thus provides a coherent resolution that highlights the importance of these cultural and personal milestones in shaping Saeng's experiences."
1067	9932	4	2	The author's decision to conclude with this paragraph serves several purposes. It evokes a strong emotional response, ensuring the story remains compelling. Furthermore, it demonstrates a form of strength that is mental rather than physical, as Saeng resolves to retake the test despite her initial failure. This conclusion also functions to convey a message of perseverance, illustrating that one should never quit in the face of disappointment. Ultimately, the paragraph leaves the reader with a powerful and encouraging image of resilience and the importance of continuing to try.
1068	9933	4	2	The story's conclusion likely aims to highlight the deep dedication both the mother and child share for gardening, with the hibiscus potentially being the child's favorite plant. This shared activity appears to be their most cherished pastime. Ending the story in this manner is effective as it introduces a note of curiosity, leaving readers to ponder the author's intent. This ambiguity successfully adds a layer of intrigue, making the conclusion thought-provoking and engaging for the audience as they reflect on the narrative's final moments.
1069	9934	4	2	"The final lines of ""Winter Hibiscus"" serve to project a glimpse into the imminent future, illustrating a significant shift in Saeng's perspective. Having previously struggled with nostalgia for her homeland and difficulty adapting, Saeng finds inspiration in the hibiscus, which symbolizes the presence of familiar elements within her new environment. The concluding statement, which references the melting snow and the budding flower, signifies her acceptance of her current circumstances. This resolution indicates that, after allowing a period of time to pass, she will embark on her new life by retaking the driver's test."
1070	9935	4	2	The author concluded the story by stating Saeng would retake the driving test in the spring to underscore a central theme. Following her test, Saeng encountered a familiar flower and visited a florist, where numerous blossoms reminded her of her homeland. After purchasing a hibiscus, she and her mother planted it, and Saeng realized the plant's resilience through winter. Observing birds overhead, she recognized her own adaptation to life in her new location. The hibiscus provided her with the necessary courage and hope to persevere, retake the test, and continue thriving in her new environment.
1071	9936	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with the final paragraph to underscore Saeng's profound passion for botany. Her dedication is evident, as she is determined to engage in this activity annually. The passage highlights her deep affection for plants and her anticipation of repeating the ritual. This concluding section effectively illustrates her significant commitment, demonstrating how greatly she cherishes both the spring season and the Hibiscus plant.
1072	9937	4	2	"The author's concluding line functions to draw a parallel between the hibiscus, which adapts and struggles to survive in a non-native environment, and Saeng's own resolve. It signifies that she will not abandon her effort to pass the test and integrate into her new country. This interpretation is substantiated by the mother's observation of the hibiscus, noting, ""It’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters"" (Ho). This comparison illustrates the shared struggle of the plant and the character to endure hardship in an unfamiliar setting, where Saeng feels profoundly misunderstood and out of place. Therefore, her vow to retake the test represents a promise to persevere and grow stronger, mirroring the resilience of her winter hibiscus."
1073	9938	4	2	The character's statement is fundamentally about the relationship between time and change. She is expressing the belief that as circumstances evolve, so too can her own performance and situation. This is illustrated by her gradual process of moving beyond nostalgia for her home in Vietnam, suggesting that memories shift as time progresses. The core logic is that the passage of time inherently brings about transformation. This interpretation accurately captures the essential meaning of her words, which is that time is a catalyst for change.
1074	9939	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story in this manner serves to emphasize the plant's symbolic importance. Being in a foreign country, the protagonist finds little in her new environment that offers solace. The unexpected discovery of a hibiscus, a plant she did not anticipate finding, provides her with a source of inner strength. This symbolic support grants her the confidence and determination needed to overcome challenges, suggesting that the plant's presence empowers her to achieve her goals.
1075	9940	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to highlight the parallels between Saeng and the natural symbols present. The narrative draws a comparison between her and the returning geese, which symbolize a new beginning as she prepares to restart driver's school. Similarly, the hibiscus represents her resilience during a difficult period; just as the plant endures the winter, she gathers strength and resolves to take the test again with the arrival of spring. This symbolic resonance is the reason for the narrator's chosen ending.
1076	9941	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to establish the possibility of a narrative continuation. The protagonist's resolution to retake the test in the spring, alongside the plant, signifies a mutual fresh start, which provides a hopeful and fitting conclusion to the story.
1077	9942	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to draw a parallel between her adaptation and that of the hibiscus. Just as the flower must bud in a new season, Saeng has grown wiser and more familiar with her environment through the repetition of seasons, enabling her to face her challenge again with renewed resilience and a greater chance of success.
1078	9943	4	2	The author concludes the story this way to illustrate that Saeng's experience was a test of survival. Her desire to return in the spring symbolizes a wish to see what has grown from her initial struggles, while the conclusion also implies a newfound appreciation for one's circumstances that was not previously understood.
1079	9944	4	2	"The ""Winter Hibiscus"" was now planted in the ground, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, and their faint honks were clear and, yes, familiar to Saeng now, signifying her growing connection to her new home."
1080	9945	4	2	"The author includes this paragraph to highlight the impact of work ethic and the difficulty of adapting to a new environment. The line ""not even the teacher looked at it"" reveals how a lack of appreciation can demoralize a new student, damaging their work ethic and mental engagement, which explains the girl's discomfort and lack of enthusiasm for a task that no one would value."
1081	9946	4	2	"The author's concluding sentence serves to underscore her unwavering resolve to pass the previously failed driving test. This determination is explicitly conveyed through the phrase, ""she vowed silently to herself,"" a declaration that signifies a profound personal commitment. All subsequent statements reinforce this initial pledge, confirming the sincerity of her intent. The paragraph therefore functions to demonstrate her complete dedication to achieving this objective."
1082	9947	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding paragraph signifies Saeng's transition toward accepting her new home. The emotional release described—""And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept""—represents a necessary catharsis. This moment of vulnerability allows her to process her grief and nostalgia, ultimately enabling her to move forward. The conclusion thus illustrates that this emotional unburdening was essential for Saeng to begin her new life."
1083	9948	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to indicate when Saeng will retake the driving test, which is when the seasons change. Her probable embarrassment from failing explains the long delay. Following the test, Saeng took a lengthy walk home, stopping at a flower shop to distract herself. She purchased a plant for her mother, who was initially upset but, recognizing her daughter's unhappiness, softened her mood. This sequence of events culminates in the decision to try again later.
1084	9949	4	2	"The author concludes the story this way to convey the protagonist's persistent resolve; she will continue striving and not surrender. Having recently immigrated from Vietnam, she struggles to adapt to American life. The geese likely symbolize constant environmental change, and their return signals her own readiness to ""fly"" again by attempting to acquire her driver's license. This ending reinforces the theme of resilience amid difficult transitions."
1085	9950	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng now has a clear goal to pursue. An additional reason for this conclusion is the stipulated waiting period before she can retake the test. Furthermore, Saeng may desire to wait and witness the plant's growth, drawing a parallel to her own development and strengthening. These combined motivations explain the author's decision to end the narrative on this particular note.
1086	9951	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner because the narrative has reached a state of resolution and equilibrium. The arrival of spring signifies a period of renewal and beauty, which parallels Saeng's decision to attempt the test once more. This cyclical return, aligned with the natural world's resurgence, provides a sense of hope and continuity. The strength embodied by the plant and the promise of the season together create a fitting and positive conclusion to the story, affirming that life and opportunity persist.
1087	9952	4	2	The author's conclusion is rooted in the symbolic significance of the hibiscus for Saeng. The plant represents resilience and solace, and its ability to endure the harsh winter becomes a metaphor for her own capacity to overcome adversity. Saeng draws a direct parallel: if the hibiscus can survive, so can she. Her plan to retake the test coincides with the plant's budding, a time that evokes memories of her homeland and provides comfort. This connection ensures that even potential failure is mitigated by the happiness the plant's renewal brings. Ultimately, the ending underscores a shared journey of overcoming obstacles, where the plant's survival signals that life continues with perseverance.
1088	9953	4	2	The author chose this conclusion to encapsulate the story's central theme of adaptation. Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, as the natural world reawakens, demonstrates her commitment to adjusting to her new life. The hibiscus serves as the catalyst for this acceptance, triggering potent memories of her grandmother and her homeland. These comforting recollections, evoked by the plant's familiar fragrance, empower her to embrace change and persist in her efforts. The ending thus effectively illustrates how a connection to the past can provide the strength needed to move forward in a new environment.
1089	9954	4	2	"The author likely concluded the story in this manner because it depicts a time of profound comfort for Saeng. Having moved from Vietnam, she finds familiarity and solace in the winter hibiscus, a plant that reminds her of her homeland. The ending is structured around this seasonal return because it reconnects her to Vietnam and evokes a sense of well-being. This sentiment is captured when she perceives the plant as an ""old friend,"" a source of reassurance in her new surroundings. The author's choice, therefore, highlights the importance of familiar symbols in fostering a sense of belonging and comfort."
1090	9955	4	2	"The author concludes with this statement to signify a fresh start, coinciding with the beauty and renewal of the spring season. The declaration to ""plant it right now"" indicates a desire for another attempt. She seeks a new beginning, and with the arrival of spring, as her flowers bloom and receive their opportunity to flourish, she wants her own chance to succeed. This parallel between the natural world's rebirth and her personal resolve creates an optimistic and fitting end to her narrative."
1091	9956	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to express her regret for her actions. The test in question involved using a sum of twenty dollars to purchase a specific item. Instead, she spent the majority of the money on a large @CAPS1 and subsequently bought a plant that evoked memories of her home. The final paragraph conveys her resolution that, given another opportunity to take the test, she will fulfill the intended requirements correctly.
1092	9957	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho concludes with a specific paragraph to reinforce the theme of overcoming adversity. Following her failure of the driving test, Saeng is deeply distressed and uncertain about her prospects for passing. However, encountering a hibiscus plant sparks a memory of her life in Vietnam, which in turn inspires her. Although her mother is initially displeased by the expensive purchase, she relents upon witnessing the happiness it brings Saeng. Finally, the act of planting the hibiscus, an endeavor that required persistence, motivates Saeng to retake the test, symbolizing her triumph over these sequential challenges. Therefore, Ho's concluding passage serves to underscore the central idea of conquering obstacles."
1093	9958	4	2	The story's concluding paragraph powerfully conveys the theme of determination. The hibiscus serves as a poignant reminder of her former home, yet she also recognizes the things she misses, @CAPS1, in her new life. This reflection becomes a source of resolve for her. She comes to an epiphany that she is now home, as elements like the V-shaped formation of geese have become familiar. While she cherished her past, she understands the necessity of moving forward. Thus, the paragraph's significance extends beyond merely retaking a driving test; it symbolizes the determination required to fully embrace her new home and life.
1094	9959	4	2	She declares she will take the test again. Her confidence is drawn from the hibiscus plant and the surrounding snow. She draws a parallel between her own situation and the natural cycle: when the snow melts, the hibiscus will bud anew. In a sense, she is growing alongside the plant, and this process ultimately provides her with the @CAPS2 and sufficient confidence to face the test once more.
1095	9960	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to clarify the narrative's events and their symbolic meaning. The statement suggests that with the arrival of spring, the snow will melt and plants will begin to bud. Similarly, by the next significant period, perhaps the following school year, the character will emerge with renewed bravery to retake the test. This is the meaning of the sentence, illustrating a comparison between the character's personal growth and the cyclical renewal found in nature.
1096	9961	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho features Saeng's silent vow: ""When they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This passage establishes a direct comparison between Saeng and the hibiscus, illustrating that her resilience mirrors the flower's hardiness. Her determination to retake the test the following year demonstrates a strength of character analogous to the plant's ability to endure winter and bloom anew. Furthermore, the hibiscus provides her with comfort and a poignant reminder of home, reinforcing her resolve to persevere in her new environment."
1097	9962	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to encourage further reader engagement and to underscore the parallel between Saeng and the flower. The quote, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" illustrates how the hibiscus survives the winter to re-emerge. Similarly, Saeng, having failed her test, resolves to try again. This shared narrative demonstrates that both the character and the plant possess the motivation and integrity to return and flourish after a period of hardship."
1098	9963	4	2	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This final paragraph is significant because the hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for Saeng, a chance to restart after her failure. Upon seeing the plant after failing her driving test, it offered her comfort amid disappointment and a connection to her heritage, suggesting she could overcome her obstacles. The imagery of spring and the budding flower implies a cycle of renewal, with the hibiscus representing Saeng's own potential for rebirth and success, which is why the author chooses this poignant conclusion."
1099	9964	4	2	"The final line is included in ""Winter Hibiscus"" to emphasize the profound connection between Saeng and the flower. Although Saeng failed her initial driving test, she resolves to retake it in the spring. The hibiscus, like Saeng, is out of place and must endure the harsh winter to bud again in the spring. This parallel shows how Saeng, too, will ""bud"" again by attempting the test once more. Both the character and the plant are unaccustomed to the conditions of their new environment and must weather the difficult winter months. Ultimately, the last line serves to conclude the story by inextricably linking the girl's journey to the flower's struggle and resilience."
1100	9965	4	2	I believe the author concludes with this statement to show Saeng's determination to adapt to her new country. Throughout the story, she experiences profound homesickness. Her discovery of a plant from her homeland, which she purchases for over ten dollars, astonishes her mother. Saeng avoids explaining her true reason for buying it, fearing that mentioning home would make her emotional. The final sentence, in which she vows to retake the test in the spring, demonstrates her resolve to persevere and ultimately adapt to her unfamiliar surroundings, marking a pivotal step in her personal journey.
1101	9966	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to provide a final summation that encapsulates the story's essence. The hibiscus is presented as a source of solace during difficult periods, representing a meaningful pastime. Ultimately, the paragraph serves to reinforce the central themes as previously outlined.
1102	9967	4	2	The author utilizes the concluding paragraph to convey Saeng's emotional reconciliation. The winter hibiscus, a reminder of her homeland, initially provoked a profound sense of loss. However, its anticipated spring bloom symbolizes the emotional healing that will enable her to retake her test. Similarly, the gradually familiar geese represent her growing acclimation to a new environment. Through these symbols, both foreign and domestic, Saeng articulates her process of coming to terms with personal failure.
1103	9968	4	2	The author selects this concluding paragraph for its thematic resonance, expressing the story's core message that life persists. The hibiscus functions as a symbol for Saeng and her mother; though its flowers are less vibrant, the plant's strength allows it to survive a harsh winter. This parallels the characters' own resilience in a new and challenging environment. The paragraph's deeper meaning is that, like the perennial hibiscus, Saeng and her mother will endure and continue their lives.
1104	9969	4	2	The author concludes on a note of renewal and opportunity, connecting Saeng's vow to retake the test with symbols of a fresh start. The melting snow and the return of spring signify rebirth, while the geese embody a second chance. This symbolism is directly linked to Saeng's own resolve, and her increasing familiarity with her new country introduces a sense of hope for her future endeavors.
1105	9970	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to underscore the narrative's moral dimension. This is evidenced by the description of the protagonist being surrounded by a variety of plants—orchids, lantana bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines—which served as a test of her resolve and character.
1106	9971	4	2	The author's conclusion in the story is drawn from the protagonist's relationship with her mother. The narrative centers on this maternal connection, highlighting the daughter's aspiration to cultivate a garden and pursue a serious career, thereby emulating her mother's example.
1107	9972	4	2	Saeng feels she has failed because she is overwhelmed with longing for her grandmother. The hibiscus plant she purchases, which cost her a considerable sum, evokes the familiar scent of her grandmother. This acquisition was an attempt to feel more at home in her new surroundings. Having left her country abruptly, Saeng recalls that her grandmother would have encouraged strength over tears. She resolves to focus on positive memories and smile when thinking of her past. Determined to pass her test, Saeng vows that the next time she sees the hibiscus buds, she will not cry but will instead persevere.
1108	9973	4	2	The author includes these details to establish the story's temporal setting and atmospheric conditions. The description of the weather and the reference to waiting until the snow melts indicate a significant passage of time. Similarly, the mention of the geese's departure and eventual return serves to frame the duration of the character's wait, providing context for the narrative's timeline and the character's experience.
1109	9974	4	2	The passage describes a winter scene where a hibiscus plant, tall and lush, is situated within a garden. The plant is characterized by its vibrant green leaves, which are adorned with vermilion flowers. As she approached the hibiscus, she reached out and gently touched one of its petals, appreciating its delicate beauty.
1110	9975	4	2	The author chose this ending to leave the reader with a resonant final thought centered on the theme of rebirth. When Saeng observes the budding hibiscus, it symbolizes a new beginning coinciding with the arrival of spring. This conclusion allows the reader to reflect on Saeng's journey and her ultimate adaptation to her new environment. Furthermore, it consolidates Saeng's emotional arc, as her declaration to retake the test demonstrates her continued resolve to persevere and embrace her new life.
1111	9976	4	2	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to convey a sense of hope for the future. The budding hibiscus in the spring represents what Saeng is waiting for, giving her the hope necessary to attempt the test again. This is demonstrated when she states, ""...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" During the winter, Saeng hopes to improve, and the hibiscus's budding will signal that it is time to try once more. She views spring as a new beginning, a time to overcome her obstacle. This obstacle may be her struggle to avoid crying when thinking of her former life in Vietnam. By accomplishing this, she grows, paralleling the growth of the hibiscus."
1112	9977	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for one primary reason: to establish a thematic resolution. This final segment serves to encapsulate the narrative's central message, providing a definitive endpoint that reinforces the core ideas presented throughout the text and leaves the reader with a clear sense of closure.
1113	9978	4	2	The author illustrates Saeng's desire to continue her mother's gardening legacy. This act represents the continuation of an elder's traditions and the honoring of what her mother began, signifying a transfer of cultural knowledge and familial responsibility from one generation to the next.
1114	9979	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore the protagonist's persistence. This is evidenced by the narrative's progression; initially, Saeng recounts failing her driver's test, yet in the final paragraph, she resolves to retake it when the hibiscus blooms after winter. Her perseverance enables her to endure life's challenges, much like a plant surviving the winter to bloom again.
1115	9980	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the character's resolve to improve upon her previous efforts. The text suggests she is prepared to try repeatedly each year to achieve success and, in doing so, to earn her mother's approval. This concluding thought effectively encapsulates the character's determined mindset and the story's thematic focus on perseverance.
1116	9981	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author likely concludes with the selected paragraph to illustrate that Saeng perceives the hibiscus as more than a mere flower; it is a vessel for memory. For Saeng, the winter hibiscus functions like a storybook, its scent unlocking cherished recollections of time spent with her gentle grandmother in her homeland. The author employs the flower to demonstrate how a simple object can trigger profound memories and reflections. The final sentence provides textual evidence that Saeng holds her past in high regard, suggesting that to integrate into her present life, she must remember her origins. By cultivating the hibiscus in her garden, she maintains a beautiful and tangible connection to her heritage, which substantiates the reasoning behind the author's concluding choice."
1117	9982	4	2	"The author's decision to conclude with that paragraph serves several purposes. It conveys a sense of hope, as indicated by the line ""this hibiscus is budding,"" which symbolizes a new beginning. This appears to be the central idea the author wishes to communicate. The narrative makes it evident that the character found it challenging to adjust to her new country, exemplified by her disappointment that the local hibiscus differed from the one in her homeland. Although she experiences nostalgia, the final paragraph reassures the reader that the character is prepared to grant her new environment another chance, embracing the possibility of a fresh start."
1118	9983	4	2	"The author selects the final paragraph for several deliberate reasons. The paragraph states, ""when they come back... I will take the test again,"" revealing the protagonist's resolve following her failed driving test and her poignant longing for her homeland. The flower's buds provide her with hope and the fortitude to attempt the test anew. This is substantiated by an earlier episode in the flower shop, where the sight and scent of the flowers evoke ""a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept."" This reaction confirms the flowers' profound significance; they are a powerful conduit to the home from which she was abruptly separated and which she deeply misses, while simultaneously offering hope and reminders of beloved figures like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author ends with this paragraph because it encapsulates what is most meaningful to the protagonist, merging memory with motivation."
1119	9984	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate the deep affection and significance the flowers hold for the main character. After failing her driving test, she was disheartened, but the discovery of the flowers provided her with comfort and solace. As the snow falls, she waits for spring, which is when the flowers will bloom again. This anticipated renewal gives her the faith and determination to retake the test, symbolizing a personal resurgence aligned with the natural cycle.
1120	9985	4	2	The author concludes with this sentence to convey that Saeng remains committed to the hibiscus and will continue to care for it, demonstrating that she has not neglected this important link to her past. This enduring attention signifies the flower's lasting importance in her life and serves as a testament to her enduring connection to her heritage and memories. The statement thus provides a final, quiet affirmation of her ongoing dedication.
1121	9986	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist Saeng, a teenager who has immigrated from Vietnam to the United States, fails her driver's test. This failure, however, leads her to find solace in memories of her homeland. The concluding paragraph, in which Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, serves several narrative functions. It underscores her initial distress over failing the test and her struggle to adapt to a new environment. The hibiscus plant symbolizes hope, allowing Saeng to persevere through hardship. Both the plant's winter dormancy and Saeng's current difficulties represent a period of struggle, yet the impending spring offers a parallel opportunity for renewal and a fresh start, suggesting that drawing strength from her past will empower her to overcome future challenges."
1122	9987	4	2	The author employs the concluding paragraph to provoke reader contemplation and to illustrate Saeng's resilient character. It clearly conveys that she possesses the determination to persevere and will not abandon her objectives despite the initial setback.
1123	9988	4	2	Minfong Ho concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test, a decision that symbolizes her gradual acceptance of a new life. Initially, Saeng resists moving on, as shown when she spends all her money on a hibiscus flower that connects her to her past. However, I believe the story's progression shows her realizing that her old and new lives are not mutually exclusive. The ending, therefore, reflects her genuine resolve to try again, motivated by a desire to please her mother, fulfill her own aspirations, and ultimately move forward.
1124	9989	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng recognizes her own need for more time. By allowing herself a period of respite and preparation, she positions herself to successfully pass the test when she attempts it again.
1125	9990	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to highlight Saeng's determined character, showing she will persist until she passes the test. Saeng struggles to adapt to her new life, where the familiar plants and surroundings of her past are absent. Her determination is clearly illustrated when her mother discovers Saeng spent a significant sum to acquire a similar plant, remarking that their entire former garden was worth less. This ending emphasizes her unwavering resolve to overcome the challenges of her new environment.
1126	9991	4	2	The concluding sentence illustrates Saeng's parallel development with the seasonal cycle. The imagery of cold snow, migrating geese, and the potted hibiscus symbolizes her own feelings of hardship, displacement, and confinement. However, the arrival of a new season, marked by the returning geese and the budding hibiscus, signifies her impending personal growth and readiness to undertake the test, a transformation underscored by the sentence's placement at the narrative's end.
1127	9992	4	2	The author chose this concluding sentence to convey that the end of winter signifies a new beginning. It is at this time that the character will be ready to resume her efforts, symbolized by the plant she has nurtured, and face the test once more.
1128	9993	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with a paragraph detailing Saeng's intention to retake the test in the future. This decision is linked to the changing seasons; she feels she will be prepared once the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud. The paragraph serves as a conclusion because it communicates Saeng's self-awareness that she requires more time to prepare, and her resolve to try again when she feels ready.
1129	9994	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to highlight the hibiscus as a source of inspiration for Saeng to attempt the test again. By evoking memories of her homeland, the plant provides the encouragement she needs to persevere. This thematic connection between personal heritage and resilience is the fundamental reason for the paragraph's concluding position.
1130	9995	4	2	The author concludes with a paragraph about retaking the test to demonstrate the narrator's resilience in a new environment. Although distressed by the differences from her old home, symbolized by the unfamiliar hibiscus, her determination is reaffirmed with the returning geese and the budding flower. This final passage ultimately conveys a theme of perseverance, advocating for continued effort toward one's passions and the importance of setting new goals after a setback.
1131	9996	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the narrative with this particular paragraph is likely motivated by a multitude of narrative and thematic considerations.
1132	9997	4	2	In my view, the author chose this paragraph to end the story because the character acknowledges having performed poorly on the test and makes a vow to be prepared to retake it when spring arrives; the mention of melting snow clearly indicates the seasonal shift to spring.
1133	9998	4	2	Upon moving to America, she observed the beautiful spring flowers, and a hibiscus blossom in particular captured her gaze. Hoping to possess one, she visited a florist to inquire. This flower evoked memories of her homeland, where hibiscus grew wild, their vibrant petals emerging from cracks in concrete walls, and its appearance reminded her of her grandmother's long, freshly washed gray hair, creating a poignant connection to her past.
1134	9999	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist's vow to retake her test ""when the snows melt... and the hibiscus is budding"" symbolizes her new beginning in America. Failing the test represented more than an academic setback; it signified a personal struggle to adapt. This pivotal quote can be interpreted as the melting snow representing her current obstacles and the budding hibiscus foreshadowing her own growth, suggesting she will attempt the test again once she has overcome these challenges and blossomed into a stronger individual."
1135	10000	4	2	Her journey is cyclical, ensuring she will ultimately return to her point of origin, thus completing a circle that brings her back to where she began the following year.
1136	10001	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey Saeng's internal resolution. She silently vows to retake the test in the spring, a season symbolizing renewal with the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus. This specific flower instills in her a sense of confidence, primarily because it serves as a tangible connection to her homeland. The hibiscus, while not identical to the variety from her past, evokes potent memories, effectively functioning as a fragment of her home within her new environment. This symbolic link to her origins provides the fortitude necessary for her to persevere, which is the fundamental reason for the story's concluding focus.
1137	10002	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph effectively demonstrates Saeng's resilience and refusal to surrender in the face of difficulty. This resolution is thematically appropriate, as the entire story revolves around overcoming adversity; having Saeng simply concede would undermine its core message. Her determination to eventually pass the test mirrors her family's earlier resilience in relocating from their homeland. This parallel is further strengthened by her mother, who also confronted obstacles, such as leaving behind familiar plants and establishing new ones, all while fondly remembering the past. Just as her mother adapted, Saeng too will find a way to succeed on her next attempt, thereby completing the story's arc of perseverance.
1138	10003	4	2	The story's conclusion signifies an impending transformation, mirroring the seasonal shift from winter to spring. The melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus all herald change, a process in which Saeng is also engaged. She is analogous to the hibiscus plant, which appears out of place on a roadside just as she feels displaced in a new country. The plant's physical difference in the United States compared to Vietnam reflects its growth and maturation, a journey Saeng must also undertake. Her observation of the plant's altered appearance parallels her self-awareness of her own differences. By placing this paragraph at the end, the author illustrates that Saeng has already begun this process of growth. The hibiscus, capable of enduring a harsh winter, symbolizes Saeng's own resilience, culminating in her vow to retake the test once she has matured alongside the changing world around her.
1139	10004	4	2	The author's decision to conclude with this specific paragraph serves multiple critical functions. Primarily, it provides a definitive resolution, leaving no lingering questions for the reader by seamlessly integrating the motifs of the geese, the hibiscus, and the driving test. Furthermore, the paragraph reinforces a central theme of perseverance, depicting the main character's determination to try again, fueled by memories of her homeland. Lastly, it contributes significant character development; her vow to retake the test portrays her as realistic and resilient rather than stubbornly overconfident. These elements collectively demonstrate how the final paragraph enhances the story's overall structure and meaning.
1140	10005	4	2	The narrative's final paragraph is pivotal for its thematic and structural closure. It successfully resolves the plot by clearly outlining Saeng's future intention to retake her driving test, thereby providing a sense of completion. This resolution is enriched by the paragraph's emphasis on the theme of perseverance, showing the protagonist's resolve not to be defeated by initial failure. Her character is further developed through this moment, revealing a blend of realism and quiet determination. The incorporation of symbolic elements like the returning geese and the budding hibiscus ties the conclusion back to the story's broader motifs of memory and adaptation. Ultimately, this concluding segment solidifies the narrative's message of resilience and hope.
1141	10006	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph to illustrate Saeng's ongoing adaptation to her new environment and her resilient spirit. Her poignant reaction to the hibiscus reveals a persistent connection to her homeland, yet her familiarity with the migrating geese and her decision to schedule her next driving test around their return demonstrate a growing acclimatization and a refusal to surrender.
1142	10007	4	2	The story's conclusion functions to show that Saeng's initial failure on the test was due to her unfamiliarity with her new surroundings. However, upon encountering flora reminiscent of her home and recognizing that spring will bring further blossoming, she gains the confidence and resolve to prepare for a second attempt.
1143	10008	4	2	The author employs this concluding paragraph to establish a natural narrative pause, signifying the end of the current season and the flowering cycle. This provides a definitive endpoint for this story while simultaneously creating an opening for a potential future narrative centered on the return of spring and the flowers, thus offering a sense of cyclical renewal and closure.
1144	10009	4	2	"The author's decision to conclude with Saeng's vow—""when they come back... then I will take that test again""—serves to underscore her determination and refusal to be defeated by her initial failure. The explicit declaration ""then I will take that test again"" provides definitive textual evidence of her resilient character and her commitment to persevere."
1145	10010	4	2	"The author chose this paragraph for the ending due to its direct connection to Saeng's failed driving test. It highlights her resolve to retake the examination once she feels prepared, a sentiment powerfully captured in the quoted line: ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again."""
1146	10011	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author likely includes the element of the hibiscus to provoke ongoing inquiry from the reader. The protagonist's perception of her mother's disappointment may serve as a catalyst for her resolve to improve her circumstances and rectify the situation, thereby introducing a theme of potential redemption."
1147	10012	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, a choice that underscores the story's emotional shift. Initially, Saeng is depicted as sorrowful and displaced, a state highlighted by her mother observing her tear-stained cheeks and puffy eyes. However, the final paragraph establishes a new mood of happiness and optimism, marking her transition from dejection to hopeful determination for the future."
1148	10013	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph in ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves several critical functions. Primarily, it demonstrates the protagonist's resilience; despite her evident distress and tears, she resolves to persevere, revealing a core of determination. Furthermore, the conclusion illustrates her acclimatization, as she synthesizes memories of her homeland with her new environment to forge a sense of hope. Textual evidence, such as her realization that previously strange things have become ""almost familiar,"" confirms her growing adaptation. Ultimately, this ending imbues the narrative with a positive and forward-looking effect, solidifying the theme of personal growth."
1149	10014	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize a profound connection to nature. This focus suggests that the narrative, and its characters, are deeply engaged with the natural world, exploring its inherent transformations and perhaps celebrating nature in its most ideal state as a central theme of the work.
1150	10015	4	2	The author composed the final paragraph to provide a sense of hope for both Saeng and the reader. Upon encountering the hibiscus, Saeng is overwhelmed by a powerful wave of loss for her homeland, which brings tears to her eyes. However, after purchasing the plant and discussing it with her mother, the flower evolves from a mere reminder of the past into a source of inspiration. This symbolic shift is what motivates her declaration that she will pass the test when the hibiscus buds, framing the conclusion with optimistic resolve.
1151	10016	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph because it effectively summarizes the story's themes and aligns with its narrative arc. The hibiscus holds profound significance for Saeng, as it evokes memories of her homeland and her past. During the winter, the plant remains dormant and has not yet bloomed. By resolving to retake the test when the hibiscus buds, Saeng parallels her own resilience with the flower's cyclical renewal, thereby underscoring its symbolic importance to the story's conclusion.
1152	10017	4	2	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate the transition from winter to spring. The phrases ""when the snow melts,"" ""the geese return,"" and ""the hibiscus is budding"" all serve as indicators of the coming season. Saeng's decision to take the test again in the spring implies her intention to resume her work in the garden at that time, connecting her personal renewal to the natural world's cycle."
1153	10018	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to foreshadow future events in the spring. The text states that Saeng vowed silently to herself that she would retake the test when the snow melted, the geese returned, and the hibiscus was budding. This signifies that in the spring, the hibiscus will begin to bloom, marking a new beginning that parallels her own resolve to try again.
1154	10019	4	2	She believes she will perform better on the test in the spring, likely because the improved weather and the environment's resemblance to her homeland will put her in a more positive and capable state of mind, thus increasing her chances of success.
1155	10020	4	2	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph because it symbolizes Saeng's decision to try again. Natural phenomena are cyclical; seasons change and return, and geese migrate but eventually come back. The author uses this as a parallel to Saeng's resolve to retake her license test. Like the winter hibiscus, which was out of its native environment but was learning to adapt, Saeng was inspired to persist despite her failure. The hibiscus's struggle to survive the winter motivated her to continue striving.
1156	10021	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because, regardless of her actions, she felt compelled to obtain the flower. It serves as a poignant reminder of her former home and life, which is why she began to cry. The test, in my view, was to resist purchasing the flower and to control her emotions, and her decision to grow her own flower in the spring represents her personal resolution to this challenge.
1157	10022	4	2	She will observe if her plant endures the winter, just as the plants from her homeland did, and she believes that the outcome will be identical.
1158	10023	4	2	This marks the beginning of a new life for her. With a new school and a new plant, she feels a profound connection to it; as the plant grows, she herself becomes stronger and more confident. She declared that when they return and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will be fully prepared for that test.
1159	10024	4	2	The author concludes in this manner to demonstrate the protagonist's resilience and her willingness to embrace her new country. The ending signifies that she will embody the flower's strength and remain steadfast in her new home, committed to being present to witness its growth, which is the reasoning behind my interpretation of the conclusion.
1160	10025	4	2	The narrative provides background on a girl who profoundly misses her homeland. Initially, we encounter Saeng in a florist shop, where her observation of flowers is revealed to be a search for fragments of her home and past; she purchases a hibiscus, a flower native to her Vietnam. Following her failure of a test, it becomes clear that acquiring the flower is a coping mechanism for her new situation, offering comfort through memories. The author effectively concludes with that statement because it conveys the theme of progressing forward without being anchored to the past. In the spring, Saeng will have established a new home and will draw strength from her history, which is the implication I perceive in the final paragraph.
1161	10026	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve to pass the test. When spring arrives and the hibiscus buds, she intends to retake it. The hibiscus likely evokes memories of her homeland, instilling in her a sense of happiness and confidence. This newfound assurance convinces her that she will perform better on her next attempt, solidifying her determination to succeed.
1162	10027	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that the flower serves as a symbol for Saeng's own capacity for renewal. Just as the flower blooms in a new environment and endures seasonal cycles, so too can Saeng persevere and begin anew. Her failure on the test is not an end but a winter-like phase; with the coming spring, she can retake the examination, having learned from her previous experience and ready to try again.
1163	10028	4	2	The inference is that the paragraph signifies her intention to prepare for the test again once winter has passed. This interpretation is supported by the family's lack of preparation for the winter, as illustrated by the mother still digging up onions in the cold. This parallel suggests a newfound awareness, implying that next time, she will be ready for the challenge, having learned from being caught unprepared.
1164	10029	4	2	The author chose this conclusion to evoke a sense of sympathy and understanding from the audience for Saeng and her family's difficult circumstances. It effectively generates compassion for Saeng by highlighting that her primary source of solace is the memory of her homeland, from which she was uprooted, thereby underscoring the depth of her emotional struggle and longing.
1165	10030	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to emphasize that the character will have another opportunity to retake the test, thereby framing the ending not as a final failure but as a point of hope and a chance for future redemption. This provides a sense of forward-looking resolution to the narrative.
1166	10031	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to underscore the protagonist's new life and opportunities. The paragraph's setting in spring symbolizes rebirth and a fresh start following the harsh winter. The author deliberately employs a structured narrative and specific word choices to convey this theme. For instance, phrases such as ""the geese return"" and ""take the test again"" highlight the significance of home and renewal. The literal image of the ""hibiscus budding"" explicitly represents rebirth. While the plant lies dormant and colorless in winter, its spring buds signify a vibrant resurgence. The author thus effectively communicates the theme of rebirth through this concluding paragraph."
1167	10032	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story follows a girl struggling to adapt after moving to a new country. I believe the author placed that final quote to suggest one should never give up, as a new beginning is always possible and success will follow. This interpretation is supported by Saeng's reflection: ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her."" This shows she has finally found comfort and confidence, much like the migrating geese that adapt to new areas and return, or the winter hibiscus that persists and thrives through changing seasons."
1168	10033	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to signify that the protagonist will revisit her situation after winter has passed. It conveys her intention to retake the test in the spring, which is the central subject of her writing at this moment. This ending provides a sense of forward-looking resolution.
1169	10034	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's ongoing adaptation to her new environment. The hibiscus plant serves as a comforting reminder of her former life. Consequently, when she retakes her test in the spring, the memories evoked by the plant will provide solace and make her feel more comfortable in the new setting. The narrative reveals that after failing her test, she purchased a plant that reminded her of home, and these memories brought her comfort. The spring season, with its blooming flowers, returning geese, and melted snow, further connects her to her past. Ultimately, Saeng feels she can adapt to her new surroundings by drawing comfort from her memories.
1170	10035	4	2	"The author selected this concluding paragraph for its thematic appropriateness. The strategic use of the word ""again"" is particularly significant, implying a previous attempt has concluded but a new one is being undertaken. Within the paragraph's context, this concept of repetition is applied to nature and the desire to re-engage with it, thereby reinforcing the theme of renewal and a second chance."
1171	10036	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's unwavering resolve to retake and ultimately pass the examination. This concluding passage also serves to generate narrative suspense, potentially setting the stage for a subsequent story.
1172	10037	4	2	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young Vietnamese girl relocates to a new country and fails her driver's test. After purchasing a winter hibiscus to evoke memories of her homeland, the final paragraph reveals her profound connection to nature. She resolves to retake the test in the spring, aligning her personal renewal with the natural cycles of the returning geese and the budding hibiscus, seeing her own readiness reflected in the world around her."
1173	10038	4	2	"The narrator's focus on the flowers, and the mention of a ""test,"" suggests a parallel between her self-perception and the examination of the blossoms amidst the falling snow. It appears the author is an individual with a deep appreciation for flowers, or perhaps specifically for this hibiscus and its budding process, indicating a person who finds significance in observing natural transformations."
1174	10039	4	2	The author incorporates this passage to symbolize themes of determination and adaptation. Although Saeng is an immigrant, she demonstrates a resolute willingness to assimilate into American society. The harsh winter represents her difficulties, while the impending spring signifies forgiveness and relief. Her decision to retake the driving test represents a step further into American life, while the blooming Hibiscus will provide a comforting connection to her homeland.
1175	10040	4	2	"The author likely concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's newfound confidence and to provide an optimistic resolution. It effectively integrates elements familiar to Saeng from her past with those from her new environment. Initially, the character felt profound loss and displacement, but she finds solace at home after failing her test. Upon planting the hibiscus and observing geese that feel ""almost familiar,"" she achieves a sense of connection. The final paragraph masterfully weaves together her past, present, and the story's central conflict into a cohesive whole."
1176	10041	4	2	The young girl was eager to learn and expand her experiences. She was captivated by the appearance of the plants at the store, which prompted her mother to purchase one. Upon returning home, they began the process of planting it together. The daughter developed a deep affection for the plant and expressed her aspiration to cultivate one as magnificent as her mother's the following year.
1177	10042	4	2	The author concludes the story's paragraph to illustrate that Saeng has now reached adulthood, as it appears she no longer resides with her mother. This choice likely aims to underscore for the reader Saeng's newfound independence following her departure from her mother's home. The recounted events belong to her past, yet they will remain a cherished memory for her.
1178	10043	4	2	The author utilizes the concluding passage to demonstrate Saeng's ongoing effort to adapt. When Saeng smells the hibiscus, its familiar fragrance evokes sensory memories of her grandmother, indicating her search for elements reminiscent of her homeland. Her willingness to pay over nineteen dollars for the plant further signifies the depth of her homesickness. Her failure of the test reveals an initial, unsuccessful attempt to adjust to her new environment, which resulted in sadness and nostalgia. However, her final declaration that she will retake the test, coupled with the hopeful sight of migrating geese that will return, instills a sense of perseverance. Ultimately, the passage confirms that while Saeng will continue to remember her homeland, she is resolved to persist.
1179	10044	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the narrative with this specific paragraph serves to underscore Saeng's resolute determination and her refusal to surrender in the face of adversity.
1180	10045	4	2	The presence of the hibiscus will provide Saeng with greater courage and additional time to acclimatize to her new surroundings. For Saeng, the plant functions as a source of motivation and a tangible reminder of her native land. The author likely chose to conclude the story with this particular observation to signify that Saeng has ultimately discovered the fortitude necessary to embrace the challenges of her life in a foreign country.
1181	10046	4	2	The story's conclusion draws a parallel between the constant changes in weather and seasons and the inevitable changes in one's life. It suggests that one must learn to cope with these life changes, much as one endures the shifting seasons from spring to fall. The test may serve as a means for the protagonist to achieve self-understanding, and the message is ultimately about overcoming adversity.
1182	10047	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph serves to finalize the narrative. A key reason for this ending is its indication that Saeng has not surrendered after failing her driver's test. Her silent vow to retake the exam ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding"" specifies a future attempt and invites the reader to contemplate how her story will subsequently unfold."
1183	10048	4	2	"I believe the author's choice to conclude with Saeng's vow—""in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again""—was excellent. It seems she draws strength from the hibiscus's resilience, realizing that if it can endure, so can she, especially regarding the test. Furthermore, her mother's incredulous reaction, ""You what?"", might have shown her that if her mother can overcome anger, she too can overcome her own disappointment about the test."
1184	10049	4	2	The author writes this conclusion to illustrate that the seasons are changing and the flowers will die. He also conveys that when the season changes back, the flower will attempt to bloom again among the others. This cyclical process of nature is what the author metaphorically references when discussing the character's decision to take the test again, symbolizing a new beginning.
1185	10050	4	2	The hibiscus flower functions as a symbol of hope and a connection to the characters' homeland. Saeng's encounter with it in the florist shop evokes potent memories of where flowers grew freely. The author likely intends the new plant to symbolize an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to establish themselves in their new country. Its planting represents adaptation, and Saeng uses it as motivation, vowing to retake her test when it blooms. This final paragraph offers both closure and a hopeful outlook, providing a fitting conclusion.
1186	10051	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey the theme that initial failure is not permanent and that second chances are inherent in nature, much like the @CAPS1, which perishes in winter only to return to life with the arrival of spring.
1187	10052	4	2	The author concludes the story by stating that the protagonist, Saeng, will retake her test when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This is because Saeng, despite failing her test, discovered a plant that reminded her of her homeland, bringing her comfort. Although this @CAPS1 flower is not identical to the one from her home, she is gradually acclimating to it and to life in @LOCATION1. When she returns to take the test, she will be prepared, and her plant will be thriving with life, symbolizing her own renewed readiness.
1188	10053	4	2	The author's conclusion stems from Saeng's profound respect for the plant, which she views not merely as a memento of her homeland but also as a talisman for good fortune. The text underscores the plant's significant value to her, noting she paid @NUM1 coins for it. Consequently, the ending symbolizes Saeng's belief that the optimal time to retake the test coincides with the hibiscus's period of growth, aligning her personal endeavors with the plant's natural cycle.
1189	10054	4	2	The author incorporates the final paragraph to establish a symbolic connection between Saeng and the natural elements. For Saeng, the snow signifies her difficulties adapting to @LOCATION1, while the geese indicate her ongoing process of familiarization with her new environment. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was aesthetically pleasing, but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes Saeng herself, is more resilient, capable of withstanding the snow that represents her adaptive struggles. The budding of the hibiscus thus represents Saeng's growing strength and her eventual triumph over these challenges, with the author concluding the story to link the flower's rebirth directly to Saeng's overcoming of her obstacles.
1190	10055	4	2	"The author selected this conclusion to emphasize that Saeng's journey is not over and that she possesses the determination to try again. After stating, ""I- I failed the test,"" Saeng resolves to return and retake the examination when the flower blooms once more, demonstrating her resolve to correct her initial setback."
1191	10056	4	2	The author conveys that the protagonist intends to retake her driving test in the spring, as the presence of blooming flowers induces a state of relaxation that enhances her ability to concentrate.
1192	10057	4	2	She states that she will be prepared to retake the test once the flowers grow back.
1193	10058	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph illustrates the protagonist's deep connection to the plants, which have become her central purpose. The ending suggests she will resume caring for them when the season is right, creating a sense of anticipation regarding her return. Furthermore, her statement, ""when they come back then I will take the test again,"" underscores her persistent and determined nature, demonstrating that she will continue striving for what she loves."
1194	10059	4	2	"In ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the author utilizes the final paragraph to signify that while the protagonist will always cherish memories of her homeland, she is also adapting to her new country and may revisit the old one. The line ""when the snow melts and the geese return... then I will take the test again"" symbolizes her intent to engage fully with both worlds, finding value and enjoyment in each when the appropriate time arrives."
1195	10060	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's resolve to retake the test when conditions are favorable, symbolized by the melting snow and the budding hibiscus. This signifies her refusal to give up. The hibiscus acts as a talisman for her success. The conclusion also reveals Saeng's personal reflections and feelings about the test, ultimately indicating that this is a significant commitment she will always remember.
1196	10061	4	2	The narrative concludes with Saeng making a silent vow upon their return: in the spring, as the snow melts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus buds, she will take the test again.
1197	10062	4	2	It is likely she perceived it as an effective method for unifying everyone.
1198	10063	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes with Saeng's resolution to retake her test, symbolizing her readiness for spring's arrival and her hibiscus's bloom. The purchase of the plant signifies her belief that, with winter's passing, overcoming the challenge of the driving test and the grief of adapting to a new country will become easier. This indicates Saeng's capacity to conquer her fears, aided by memories of her homeland, ultimately revealing her newfound strength and optimism for achieving success in her new environment."
1199	10064	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination. The winter hibiscus, surviving against the odds of the cold season, serves as a parallel to her own resolute spirit.
1200	10065	4	2	The author likely chose this statement to conclude the story because it demonstrates Saeng's readiness to confront her challenges again and her growing appreciation for her new surroundings. Her mother's comment about the plant being strong enough to survive the cold months implicitly encourages Saeng, suggesting that if the hibiscus can endure harsh conditions, she too can persevere in a new country. Upon recognizing the cyclical, repeating patterns of nature, Saeng realizes she can also face her driving test again with renewed confidence.
1201	10066	4	2	"The author includes the final paragraph in ""Winter Hibiscus"" to illustrate the protagonist's enduring hope and resilience in her new environment. Throughout the narrative, Saeng recalls her former life in Vietnam upon encountering a familiar plant, an event that triggers profound sadness regarding her relocation to @LOCATION2. This emotional response is encapsulated in the line, ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes,"" as she returns home to her mother. Her mother, demonstrating understanding and support, promptly plants the hibiscus, an act of solace. The concluding paragraph signifies Saeng's determination to persevere, as she vows to retake her driving test in the spring, a metaphor for her commitment to eventually find contentment in her new life. Thus, the winter hibiscus serves as a symbol of strength, allowing Saeng to honor her past while gradually adapting to her future."
1202	10067	4	2	In Minfong Ho's story, the concluding paragraph functions to reveal Saeng's internal vow to retake her test in the spring, coinciding with the budding of the hibiscus she purchased. This purchase was motivated by the plant's symbolic value; it represents a source of comfort and a tangible link to her past experiences. The hibiscus provides solace during her disappointment, and its eventual blooming is tied to her growing confidence and comfort within her new surroundings. The author's choice of conclusion therefore underscores the character's ongoing process of adaptation, suggesting that familiarity and connection to one's heritage can facilitate adjustment to a new environment, with the flowering hibiscus marking a future point of personal readiness and integration.
1203	10068	4	2	Our past experiences invariably shape our present actions, whether we are conscious of it or not. In the story, Saeng faces an internal test when she visits a flower shop and encounters a bloom that reminds her of her homeland; she initially fails to resist its pull, revealing her struggle to accept that her old foundations are gone. However, she is simultaneously acclimating to new aspects of her life. The author concludes with this specific paragraph to demonstrate that personal change is always possible. Saeng is attempting to mentally relegate her homesickness to the background, and with time, she believes she can succeed, perhaps by the following year. The ending shows that with genuine desire, such as Saeng's determination to pass her own psychological test and adapt, achieving personal growth is within reach, which will undoubtedly make her mother proud.
1204	10069	4	2	The author's intention with the final paragraph is to convey that the character had not yet overcome her challenge but was declaring her resolve to return and try again the following year. This is analogous to the hibiscus plant, which will bud anew when the snow melts and the geese return @CAPS1 year, symbolizing a cycle of renewal and persistent effort. The statement serves as a promise of future attempts, linking personal resilience to the natural world's dependable patterns.
1205	10070	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to communicate to the reader that Saeng possesses the resilience to attempt the test again. This decision signifies more than a simple retake; it represents her enduring determination and refusal to be defeated by a single setback. The ending thus leaves the audience with a sense of forward momentum and the assurance of her continued efforts.
1206	10071	4	2	"Saeng's statement about retaking the test next year is a metaphor for her commitment to cultivating the plants once more. Her offer to assist her mother, saying ""Here, let me help, mother,"" serves as a definitive indication of her genuine willingness to participate in the gardening work after all."
1207	10072	4	2	"The author's selection of the final paragraph in ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves to illustrate Saeng's burgeoning optimism. The winter and cold symbolize her feelings of displacement and distress following her failure to obtain a driver's license. The anticipated spring represents a future where a fragment of her homeland will bloom, restoring her sense of warmth and readiness to retake the test ""when they came back."" This progression signifies her adaptation to and acceptance of a new life, distinct from her past, demonstrating her resilience in overcoming adversity and moving forward."
1208	10073	4	2	The story concludes with that particular paragraph because the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus are intended to bolster Saeng's confidence. She desires to feel capable of passing the test, and these signs of renewal provide the assurance she needs to believe she can succeed.
1209	10074	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph in which Saeng makes a silent vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. This moment signifies her realization that she possesses another opportunity to pass the examination. As spring returns and she begins to garden again, she aligns her personal renewal with the season's rebirth.
1210	10075	4	2	Saeng finds solace in memories of her homeland. Her initial test failure stemmed from the unfamiliarity of her new environment, but on her return journey, she encountered a comforting familiarity in native plants from her home, notably a single blood-red blossom floating in a bucket. This need for familiar comfort is further met by the sight of migrating geese, which symbolizes change and transition. She perceives spring, a time of melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, as a period for new beginnings. She resolves that when these familiar elements are at their best, she will be at her best, ready to face any challenge, viewing winter as a necessary stage of preparation.
1211	10076	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake her test in the spring, a decision directly linked to the hibiscus plant. She purchased the flower following her initial failure, and thus its anticipated blooming serves as the symbolic moment for her to attempt the test once more, creating a cyclical narrative of hope and renewal."
1212	10077	4	2	I believe the author intended to convey that when the snow melts, perhaps in a month like March, the character will return. The author likely chose this springtime setting as a symbolic point for a new beginning, possibly for writing a new chapter in the character's life.
1213	10078	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Mingfong Ho, employs the concluding paragraph to establish the hibiscus as a potent symbol for Saeng's future. Both Saeng and the plant share origins in Vietnam and face the challenge of adapting to a new environment. Her vow to retake the driver's test coincides with the plant's anticipated spring revival, forging a parallel between its survival and her own resilience. This symbolic linkage is a fundamental element of the narrative, justifying its placement as the story's concluding statement."
1214	10079	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, a choice that underscores the story's central message. This final paragraph reinforces the theme of perseverance, illustrating that one should never surrender in the face of challenges but must continue striving. By ending on this reflective note, the author prompts readers to contemplate the deeper significance of resilience and new beginnings."
1215	10080	4	2	"The author selected this concluding paragraph because Saeng's failure is intertwined with her initial disappointment in the artificial plant. Her statement, ""I failed,"" refers not only to the test but also to the plant, which she compares unfavorably to the authentic ones from her homeland. This connection between her personal setback and the symbol of her displacement provides a coherent rationale for the story's ending."
1216	10081	4	2	Saeng resolves to retake her test in the spring, a season marked by the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. This concluding statement connects to the narrative as her affinity for the garden, which is inaccessible in winter, is a key element. Her profound love for plants and similar natural elements motivates this resolution, leading her to plan the purchase of new flora with the season's change. The discovery of a familiar plant prompts a visit to a florist, and her plans are met with significant distress when an unforeseen complication arises with them.
1217	10082	4	2	The mother's observation that the winter hibiscus, while less visually striking, possesses the strength to endure the cold months serves as a direct metaphor for Saeng. The flower's resilience through winter, leading to its renewed beauty in spring, underscores a parallel character arc. This emphasizes that Saeng, too, will emerge stronger and more self-assured with the arrival of spring, which is the author's rationale for placing this comparison at the story's conclusion. The final sentiment reflects the flower's dual nature of being both pretty and strong.
1218	10083	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the final paragraph, where Saeng vows to retake her driving test, illustrates her determination to adapt. As a new immigrant from Vietnam, Saeng spends much of the story reminiscing about her homeland, her grandmother, and the flowers there. Upon finding a hibiscus at a local flower shop—a plant she remembers from Vietnam—she observes its adaptation to a colder climate. While planting it, she makes a promise to herself to pass the test in the spring, symbolizing her own desire to adapt to her new environment and build a life there without being consumed by homesickness. The author includes this vow to demonstrate Saeng's commitment to adapting to her surroundings and achieving her goal."
1219	10084	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to elucidate the symbolic significance of the hibiscus. For Saeng, the plant represents change, growth, and the capacity to overcome adversity. Its discovery evokes powerful nostalgia, yet she recognizes the necessity of adapting to her new home to facilitate personal growth. Her survival in a foreign country is mirrored by the hibiscus's endurance through winter. Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, coinciding with the plant's budding, signifies her determination to succeed. The hibiscus thus embodies triumph over life's challenges, from failing a test to building a new life abroad, and the paragraph's placement highlights Saeng's ultimate recognition of her own resilience through this symbol.
1220	10085	4	2	"I believe the author concludes the paragraph in this manner to convey a significant message to the audience. The intended message is that despite her initial failure, Saeng possesses the resolve to try again the following year. This is directly supported by her own statement: ""in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This expression of future determination is the reason I feel the author chose to end the story on this particular note."
1221	10086	4	2	The author incorporates this paragraph to signify a pivotal transition in Saeng's life, as her initial failure on the driver's test coincides with the budding of the hibiscus. Furthermore, the hibiscus, a flower she knew from her former home in Vietnam, symbolizes her establishment of a new home, marking her adaptation and the beginning of a new chapter in her life.
1222	10087	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, a decision tied to the budding hibiscus. This resolution is crucial because the flower evokes memories of her homeland, providing a profound sense of comfort. When Saeng feels at peace and truly at home, she will be better positioned to succeed on her subsequent attempt, completing her emotional journey.
1223	10088	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's resilience and her complex relationship with her past and present. Her act of planting the hibiscus demonstrates a commitment to her new environment without forsaking her memories of Vietnam. Her silent vow to retake the test in spring, coupled with her realization that the once-strange surroundings have grown familiar, signifies her acceptance of change and her refusal to surrender, thus affirming her determination to persevere.
1224	10089	4	2	The author chooses this concluding paragraph to reflect Saeng's contentment with her simple, recurring routines. She finds genuine pleasure in the company of her mother and their shared interest in plants. These foundational elements of her life—familial bonds and a connection to nature—are the core reasons the story ends on this particular note of quiet resolution.
1225	10090	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize the hibiscus's role as a source of profound solace for Saeng. Having failed her driving test and feeling displaced in a new country, she is frustrated and homesick for Vietnam. The hibiscus's fragrance vividly reminds her of combing her grandmother's hair, providing immense comfort in her disappointment. She savors the flower's beauty and its name in her native language, finding joy in this connection to her past. This comfort empowers her to plan a second attempt for the spring, when the hibiscus buds again, thereby conveying a resonant feeling of hope and consolation to the reader.
1226	10091	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to establish a symbolic connection between the hibiscus and Saeng's circumstances in a new country. The plant serves as an inspiration for Saeng, demonstrating the capacity for adaptation. Saeng recalls the hibiscus from her homeland, and her mother observes that the purchased plant is a distinct variety, attributing this difference to its strength and ability to endure the cold winters of the United States. Drawing inspiration from this, Saeng, despite failing her license test, resolves to emulate the hibiscus. Just as the plant survives winter to blossom in spring, Saeng will utilize the intervening time to prepare and approach her next test with confidence. The concluding paragraph thus underscores the parallel Saeng identifies between her own journey and that of the plant.
1227	10092	4	2	"The adage, ""If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again,"" is a common source of encouragement, and it aptly applies to Saeng's experience in ""Winter Hibiscus."" After failing her driver's test, Saeng encounters a hibiscus that evokes memories of her homeland. She buys the plant to soothe her sadness, and her mother initially scolds her before expressing gratitude. While planting the hibiscus, Saeng hears the honk of Canada geese, a sound that has become familiar. The narrative notes, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, familiar to her,"" highlighting her adaptation to her new environment. The author's concluding paragraph illustrates that, like the hibiscus adapting to its terrain, Saeng is inspired to persevere and retake her driver's test."
1228	10093	4	2	"The author chooses to end the story in this manner because the hibiscus flower provides Saeng with a profound sense of comfort. The blossom's fragrance vividly reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother, with the text stating, ""the familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair."" This connection shows how she carries memories of her home close to her heart. She recognizes the hibiscus as ""another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers."" Following her test failure, she purchases the ""Malik"" flower for solace. As they plant it together, Saeng experiences a significant surge of confidence, resolving to retake the test with renewed determination."
1229	10094	4	2	"The author uses the concluding paragraph to draw a parallel between Saeng's resolve and the challenges of adapting to a new school environment. The test she must retake symbolizes broader difficulties, such as making new friends and succeeding academically. The paragraph's declaration, ""Then I will take that test again,"" directly illustrates her commitment to overcoming these scholastic and social hurdles. This comparison effectively highlights her perseverance in the face of adversity, demonstrating her intent to succeed where she initially fell short."
1230	10095	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's determination to overcome the obstacles stemming from her past experiences. The story begins with Saeng undertaking a test, during which memories in a greenhouse cause her to break down, as ""a wave of loss so deep and sharp it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" After purchasing a plant and confessing her failure to her mother, she receives understanding and support. This culminates in Saeng's vow to retake the test, with the narrator emphasizing her resolve to move beyond past troubles and advance toward the future with steadfast purpose."
1231	10096	4	2	Her academic studies necessitated her examination of flowers within a greenhouse. Having failed the initial test, she intends to retake it in the spring. The seasonal bloom will provide a superior opportunity for study, thereby increasing her chances of passing. It also seems she has developed a personal appreciation for the spring season, anticipating the chance to enjoy the blossoming flowers and the rewarding process of growth and learning.
1232	10097	4	2	"The author likely concluded the story with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resilience. As an immigrant from Vietnam, Saeng initially struggled with profound homesickness, feeling that nothing in the United States was authentic, as indicated by her mumbled comment, ""It's not a real one."" However, upon recognizing her own gradual adaptation, symbolized by her care for the hibiscus, she resolves to attempt the driving test again in the spring. This final decision underscores her determination to persevere and build a new life."
1233	10098	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's emotional transition. The sight of migrating geese and the act of nurturing a hibiscus through the winter provide her with a sense of comfort and familiarity, as the text notes the geese's calls became ""familiar to Saeng now."" These elements, reminiscent of her life in Vietnam, bolster her confidence. Her declaration to retake the test in spring, when the geese return and the plant buds, shows how these familiar signs have renewed her spirit and resolve."
1234	10099	4	2	The author chose this concluding paragraph to invite the reader to imagine Saeng's future when spring arrives. This technique engages the audience's imagination, allowing them to form a personal connection with the story's continuation. Furthermore, ending on this note provides a sense of hope, suggesting that Saeng may very well pass her test on the next attempt. Ultimately, this choice provides an optimistic and satisfying closure to the narrative.
1235	10100	4	2	The author concluded with that specific paragraph to draw a parallel between Saeng's resolve and the returning geese, emphasizing her intent to try again. It was important to convey the character's determination and ambition, demonstrating that she would not be defeated by a single setback during the winter. The ending serves to show that her perseverance is unwavering, and she will continue striving until she accomplishes her necessary goals.
1236	10101	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's vow to retake her test to demonstrate that individuals can persevere through adversity and find solace rather than succumb to despair. The narrative contrasts Saeng's difficult present with warm memories of her past, emphasizing her profound sense of loss. A poignant recollection of her grandmother's fragrance deepens her sorrow, building a foundation of despair that the final paragraph counteracts. This concluding section introduces a note of hope, as seen in Saeng's declaration to try again. Furthermore, the author illustrates how stability can be found in the natural world's cycles, such as the returning geese and the budding hibiscus, which offer security amidst change. Ultimately, the author employs this final passage to balance the story's melancholy, underscoring the enduring presence of hope and comfort."
1237	10102	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to provide a definitive ending and to highlight Saeng's deep, appreciative connection to the hibiscus plant. The author's intention is to furnish conclusive evidence for the narrative's themes. For instance, Saeng's statement—""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again""—explicitly links the winter season with the plant's lifecycle. This connection signifies that just as the plant will rejuvenate in spring, the character Saeng will also recover her resolve and revisit her goals, thereby completing the story's central argument about renewal."
1238	10103	4	2	Although the author initially presented a detached demeanor, he held a genuine affection for flowers and enjoyed working alongside people in the city. His mother's anxiety likely contributed to his appreciation for seeing individuals progress positively in their lives. People returned to this place because they found it appealing, indicating a shared fondness for the environment and the community it fostered, which ultimately shaped his positive outlook and connections.
1239	10104	4	2	"The author includes this conclusion to illustrate the character's profound care for the plant and its power to evoke memories of her childhood. Evidence of her attachment includes descriptions like the ""rich scent"" and the tactile sensation ""It felt smooth and cool."" An example of its connection to her past is the realization that she had known but forgotten this plant, and the text suggests a return to these memories is possible. For these reasons, it is evident why the author chose to add this reflective passage at the story's end, as it reinforces the themes of memory and emotional rediscovery."
1240	10105	4	2	I believe the author positioned this as the final message for the reader to emphasize a theme of resilience. The story follows a girl navigating a completely new environment and culture, where a familiar flower serves as her sole connection to her past. Her personal vow represents a decision to persevere and remain open to new experiences and learning opportunities. The plant symbolizes a new beginning; its cyclical rebirth mirrors her own resolve to start anew, as implied by the textual evidence that when her plant rejuvenates, she will too, making it a powerful representation of her life's journey.
1241	10106	4	2	The author likely wrote this to convey that the protagonist feels her true self is revealed in winter, yet with the arrival of spring, she emerges renewed, akin to a flower that has been dormant throughout the cold season.
1242	10107	4	2	The author employs this paragraph as a conclusion, following a discussion of the winter hibiscus and geese, thereby providing a resolution that leaves the reader with a sense of contentment and closure.
1243	10108	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the narrative details the challenges Saeng faces after immigrating to a new country. After failing her driving test, she is reminded of her homeland by tropical flowers. The concluding passage, where Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring alongside the returning geese and the budding hibiscus, is crucial as it signifies her personal growth and hope for the future. This segment illustrates her resilience and determination to adapt to her new environment, mirroring the cyclical changes in nature, and provides the reader with a conclusive understanding of her evolving mindset and aspirations."
1244	10109	4	2	The author likely included this concluding paragraph to offer an insightful detail regarding the hibiscus's response to snowfall. The text outlines the plant's growth requirements, such as sunlight, water, and soil maintenance, and suggests that the snowy season initiates a renewal of its life cycle, thereby using this natural process to thematically conclude the story.
1245	10110	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng, having failed a test, resolves to retake it in the spring, a sentiment captured in the line: ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" Notably, the specific nature of the test itself remains undefined within the narrative."
1246	10111	4	2	The individual has decided to postpone retaking the examination until spring, using the interim period to determine if her preference for bitter melon over a Big Mac remains steadfast, thereby concluding her period of self-assessment.
1247	10112	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify the necessity of retaking the test. This indicates that the protagonist must undertake the same endeavor again the following year, paralleling the hibiscus's need to adapt. The underlying message is a call to persevere and strive for one's best, as fulfillment is achieved by living life to its fullest potential, making this a fitting and resonant conclusion to the narrative.
1248	10113	4	2	I believe the author chose to conclude the story in this manner to provide a sense of an open ending. This technique effectively suggests that the characters' journeys are ongoing and that their stories possess the potential for further development and continuation beyond the final page.
1249	10114	4	2	The author concludes that the arrival of spring, marked by melting snow and returning flowers, evokes the essence of springtime at home, which has a calming effect on her. Furthermore, she finds spring to be a more beautiful season because the blossoming flowers, particularly one that reminds her of home, symbolize domestic blessings and provide a deep sense of comfort.
1250	10115	4	2	Saeng made a silent vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the snow's melt, the geese's return, and the budding of the hibiscus. She is postponing the attempt until she feels confident of passing and obtaining her driver's license. This license would grant her the autonomy to travel independently, eliminating her reliance on her mother for transportation. However, she must first wait for the winter snow to fully recede before she can proceed with her plan, thus concluding her current period of anticipation.
1251	10116	4	2	Saeng possesses a profound emotional connection to her plants, deriving great pleasure from tending to them. Her final sentiment expresses an eager anticipation for winter's end, when her plants will begin to bud, allowing her to fully enjoy them once more.
1252	10117	4	2	"The author employs the concluding paragraph to unify the story's elements. I believe its purpose is also to foreshadow her passing the test in the spring. I am particularly fond of the line, ""in the spring, when the snows melt,"" as it effectively conveys her desires and her determined mindset to achieve them."
1253	10118	4	2	The author likely utilizes this paragraph to illustrate the protagonist setting a goal aligned with a cyclical renewal. The geese function as a symbol for spring, the time when she would recommence preparations for the test. The budding hibiscus signifies hope, representing both the start of a new cycle and an object of reminiscence. In conclusion, this final paragraph employs various symbols and literary devices to convey themes of hope, positive memories, and a fresh beginning.
1254	10119	4	2	She would cultivate flowers and watch for the geese to return to her pond, a simple yet fulfilling cycle that marked the passage of the seasons.
1255	10120	4	2	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Primarily, it serves to underscore the symbolic meaning of the flower. Furthermore, it is instrumental in expressing the central theme. For instance, the line, ""then I will take that test again,"" connects the specific event of the driving test to the broader symbolism of the flower, which in turn relates to the overarching theme of adaptation and persistent effort. This final paragraph was therefore vital to the story's thematic depth and overall meaning."
1256	10121	4	2	"The author concludes Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to illustrate how memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test, Saeng discovers a hibiscus, which evokes powerful memories of her homeland and her grandmother. She purchases the plant and transplants it into her garden. Upon completing this task and observing a flock of Canada geese, Saeng applies the solace from her past to her new environment, resolving to try again. This final paragraph serves to underscore Saeng's resilience and her refusal to surrender."
1257	10122	4	2	"The author uses this conclusion to demonstrate Saeng's readiness to embrace her new life. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus make her feel at home. The text explicitly states, ""when the snow melt[s] and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" These elements clearly remind her of her homeland, and once she achieves this sense of belonging and ease, she will be prepared to attempt the test again, which is the author's intended message in this passage."
1258	10123	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph because it effectively restates the story's central theme, providing clarity and closure for the reader. This final segment synthesizes the narrative's core ideas, ensuring the audience comprehends the ultimate message regarding resilience and personal growth. By reiterating the main idea, the conclusion solidifies the story's meaning and leaves a lasting, coherent impression.
1259	10124	4	2	The narrative explains that Saeng has failed her test. During the winter, as the hibiscus struggles to grow its petals back, she declares to her mother that she will not attempt the test again until the hibiscus begins to bud and spring returns. This statement connects her personal resolve to the natural cycle, indicating that her willingness to try again is contingent upon the renewal symbolized by the changing seasons and the flowering plant.
1260	10125	4	2	This conclusion is effective because, after her experiences and the gardening knowledge gained from her mother, Saeng recalls the significance of the hibiscus and its budding process. Her final statement means that she will retake the test with the arrival of spring. This test will serve as an assessment of whether she has sufficiently internalized the lessons about growth and perseverance learned from her mother during their time together.
1261	10126	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to suggest a symbolic connection between the grandmother's passing and the natural world, perhaps implying her death coincided with the geese' migration or the blooming of flowers.
1262	10127	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" employs the final paragraph to illustrate Saeng's progression towards accepting her new country while retaining memories of her homeland. Initially, Saeng is overwhelmed with nostalgia, as evidenced by her emotional reaction to the hibiscus, which vividly recalls her grandmother and her past life. This flower provides a tangible connection to her former home, allowing her to hold onto a piece of it. The narrative then shifts to indicate her growing familiarity with her new environment. Saeng resolves that the period of the hibiscus's dormancy will serve as her own time for adjustment, and she intends to fully embrace her new life by the time the plant blooms again, signifying her readiness to move forward."
1263	10128	4	2	The inclusion of this paragraph serves a critical narrative function by resolving the central conflict introduced at the story's beginning. The protagonist's initial failure on a test and her mother's consequent disappointment establish a key plot point. By concluding with the character's decision to retake the test, the author provides necessary closure. This resolution satisfies the reader's inherent curiosity regarding the outcome of the failure and demonstrates the protagonist's proactive response to her mother's expectations, thereby completing the character's arc in a coherent manner.
1264	10129	4	2	The author deliberately crafted an unresolved conclusion to generate ongoing reader engagement and anticipation. Such an open ending is a strategic narrative device designed to stimulate curiosity about potential future developments in the story's universe. It effectively creates narrative space for a sequel or further exploration of the characters and plot, ensuring the story lingers in the reader's mind beyond the final page.
1265	10130	4	2	The concluding paragraph demonstrates Saeng's resilient character by showing her refusal to abandon the task despite her initial failure. Although her purchase of the expensive winter hibiscus plant is deemed a misstep by her mother, Saeng proceeds to plant it with care. This action signifies her perseverance and the plant's profound personal significance as a symbol of her homeland. Her dedication to nurturing the hibiscus underscores a commitment to persevere in the face of adversity.
1266	10131	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to demonstrate the protagonist's incipient adaptation to her new country. Initially, the character, Saeng, experiences profound homesickness and a lack of adjustment. Following a failed driver's test, she encounters a hibiscus in a flower shop, a flower that holds significant meaning as a reminder of her native Vietnam. For Saeng, the hibiscus symbolizes comfort during disappointment, a connection to her past, and the capacity to surmount obstacles. The author's intention in this concluding passage is to illustrate that while life invariably presents changes and challenges, there will always be sources of support to overcome them. This is conveyed by depicting the hibiscus as Saeng's mechanism for resilience, implying that once she has fully adjusted, she will be prepared to retake her driving test.
1267	10132	4	2	I think the author ended the story this way to show that Saeng is ready to try again when spring comes. The paragraph suggests that after winter ends and the hibiscus starts to bud, she'll get a fresh start. It's like she's planning her own little garden for spring, which gives her hope. That's why this paragraph works so well as the conclusion.
1268	10133	4	2	"This paragraph signifies a process of transformation that Saeng will undergo over the course of a year, analogous to a rebirth. She intends to develop and change in preparation for retaking the test, aspiring to become a new person. While her mother appears critical of her actions, Saeng experiences an epiphany regarding the hibiscus and its seasonal cycle of death and renewal. The line ""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season"" reveals how she connects the flower and migrating geese to her own life. She aspires to improve herself by undergoing a similar phase of growth, ultimately blossoming beautifully once more, just as the flower does."
1269	10134	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to convey that Saeng's decision to purchase the expensive winter hibiscus, despite her mother's anger, is a significant act rooted in nostalgia for Vietnam. The author uses this paragraph to parallel the natural cycles mentioned: the return of the geese and the blooming of the flower signal a future time for renewal. The implication is that Saeng will retake her driving test when the conditions are more favorable, just as the hibiscus blooms in its own season. This provides a fitting and optimistic conclusion to the narrative.
1270	10135	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to underscore the protagonist's nascent adaptation. Initially characterized by homesickness, Saeng fails her driving test but finds solace in a hibiscus, a flower evocative of her Vietnamese heritage. This hibiscus represents comfort, a link to her past, and resilience. The author utilizes this final passage to articulate a universal theme: life entails inevitable changes and obstacles, but resources for overcoming them persist. By framing the hibiscus as Saeng's symbolic instrument of perseverance, the conclusion suggests her impending readiness to reattempt the test following a period of adjustment.
1271	10136	4	2	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake her driver's test in the spring, thereby providing narrative closure. This resolution signifies her intent to attempt the test again after she has acclimated to her new life in a foreign country. As she finds familiarity in her surroundings, she will begin to feel more at home. Throughout the narrative, Saeng's detachment from Vietnam is a source of her isolation. The hibiscus plant initially offers her a sense of comfort, a feeling confirmed when she touches it and finds it ""smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The final paragraph thus suggests that Saeng will ultimately discover more sources of solace in her new environment than a single plant and the returning geese."
1272	10137	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph utilizes the symbolism of seasonal change. The melting snow and returning geese signal the arrival of spring, the traditional time for planting and working in the garden, as the frozen ground previously made this impossible. The geese's return coincides with the proper season to sow seeds and cultivate a larger garden. Similarly, the test serves as a measure of her progress, an opportunity to achieve a better result than in her previous attempts.
1273	10138	4	2	The author selected this particular paragraph to conclude the story because it provides the most fitting and resonant ending for the narrative's themes and character journey. The conclusion is a deliberate artistic choice intended to leave the reader with a sense of appropriate closure, effectively wrapping up the story's central arc in a manner that is both conclusive and thematically consistent.
1274	10139	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's resolution to retake her test in the spring to illustrate her adaptation and decision-making within her new country, mirroring her behaviors in Vietnam. There, traditions like arranging her grandmother's hair with a hibiscus and retrieving the flower from a well established it as a comfort object. In the United States, she repurposes this symbol while observing new cyclical patterns, such as the geese's migration and spring's renewal. Her decision to take the test in the spring symbolizes a readiness for new beginnings, akin to the budding hibiscus. Both the potted plant and Saeng's relocation represent significant change, honoring old traditions while creating space for new growth and personal development.
1275	10140	4	2	The author includes this sentence to indicate that the protagonist believes the spring will provide sufficient time for adequate preparation to pass the test. Furthermore, the mention of the geese reflects a personal affinity for these birds, integrating a favored element into the story's concluding imagery and connecting the character's personal timeline to a natural event she finds meaningful.
1276	10141	4	2	"The author concludes the narrative to illustrate Saeng's newfound resolve and fortitude. The plant serves as a symbolic catalyst for her resilience, enabling her to overcome her failure and prepare to retake the test. Furthermore, it functions as a comforting memento of her homeland. Although she intended to show the plant to her mother, she found herself too emotionally overwhelmed to utter the words ""at home,"" revealing the depth of her homesickness. Ultimately, she achieves the realization that her current surroundings are becoming her new home, a place increasingly familiar to her."
1277	10142	4	2	"The concluding sentence signifies a rebirth. Just as winter ends life, spring heralds a new beginning. This mirrors Saeng's emotional state; having left her country and its memories, she feels displaced, akin to the winter hibiscus. However, with the arrival of spring, she will be renewed and prepared to face challenges. Her observation of the ""quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" indicates that with each new season comes change, and she will proceed to retake her driver's test with this renewed perspective."
1278	10143	4	2	The author employs the final paragraph for multiple purposes. Primarily, it demonstrates that while Saeng has experienced a present failure, future opportunities will arise. Furthermore, it conveys the message that difficult periods are transient and will be succeeded by more favorable times. For these reasons, the conclusion serves as a potent and effective resolution to the narrative.
1279	10144	4	2	The author utilizes symbolism to convey a deeper thematic message. Saeng's declaration that she will retake the test in the spring, as the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, is significant. The hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng's own development; with time and maturation, paralleling the plant's seasonal cycle, she will be adequately prepared to attempt the test again. This use of symbolism effectively enriches the story's subtext.
1280	10146	4	2	The author composed this resolution to communicate Saeng's determination. It expresses her conviction that she will be fully prepared by the time spring arrives. With this renewed readiness, she will then take the test again and succeed.
1281	10147	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's profound desire to resume planting. This is central to her existence, as her life revolves around agriculture and the changing seasons. Saeng and her mother sustain themselves through their garden, which provides their food. Throughout the year, they dedicate most of their time to cultivating crops for both sale and personal storage, saving provisions for winter and selling surplus to acquire necessary equipment. The paragraph's reference to ""when they come back"" alludes to the geese, whose return she cherishes, especially when they fly overhead and land in the yard on a beautiful day. As the snow melts, Saeng yearns to return to the soil, working with her hands and knees to begin planting anew. The budding of the hibiscus signals the start of the growing season, around which Saeng's entire life is oriented. The author includes this paragraph to underscore that returning to her agricultural work is Saeng's ultimate aspiration."
1282	10148	4	2	"In the conclusion of ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng resolves to retake her driving test in the spring, a season marked by the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the annual budding of the winter hibiscus. Having moved with her family from Vietnam to the United States, she purchased a winter hibiscus plant as a memento of her childhood. The plant's bloom symbolizes hope and new beginnings, inspiring her to attempt the test again as she establishes her life as a citizen in her new country."
1283	10149	4	2	"The short story ""The Winter Hibiscus"" follows a young girl named Saeng who relocates from her homeland. This narrative centers on her struggles and efforts to adapt to an unfamiliar environment and a new way of life, depicting the challenges of such a significant transition."
1284	10150	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's unwavering determination to pass her driving test, drawing a parallel to the persistent migration of geese heading south for the winter. This literary choice highlights the beauty of perseverance, demonstrating the importance of confronting and overcoming obstacles to ultimately achieve one's goals.
1285	10151	4	2	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a powerful final paragraph: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will try the test again."" This ending is significant because it reveals Saeng's resilience and inner strength, showing her willingness to persevere and improve herself. Her vow to try again demonstrates a commitment to self-betterment. Textual evidence supporting this interpretation includes her direct statement, ""then I will take the driving test again,"" her realization that previously strange things had become familiar, and the description of a ""frail, wiry beauty"" that deeply moved her. These elements collectively justify the author's decision to end the story on such a resonant and impactful note."
1286	10152	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the final paragraph to illustrate the frequency with which Saeng is confronted by her memories. Earlier, while at a florist, Saeng experienced a similar test when memories inundated her, compelling her to attempt to recapture the feelings from her past when her grandmother was present. Upon realizing those elements from her memory were irrevocably lost, she wept. Saeng informed her mother of her failure on this test and purchased a plant for solace. Her mother responded with understanding and acceptance. After planting the hibiscus, Saeng resolves that in the spring, when the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, she will take the test once more. She understands that the sight of the flower will inevitably evoke tears and memories, thereby re-administering the test of her emotional resilience."
1287	10154	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng, having failed her driver's test that day, vows to retake it in the spring. This concluding statement signifies a new season and a fresh start in her life. The archetype of changing from a harsh, cold winter to a pleasant, warm spring symbolizes the improvement awaiting Saeng and her mother. Just as a difficult winter gives way to a calm and warm beginning in spring, Saeng is confident that she will ultimately pass her test."
1288	10155	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph serves several functions. Primarily, the passage establishes the hibiscus flower as a source of comfort and a means for overcoming obstacles following Saeng's disappointment. The ending specifies that Saeng will retake her test ""in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding,"" a time of renewed beauty. Her anticipated success is directly linked to the hibiscus, which embodies her hope. The plant, described with waxy leaves and dainty purplish flowers with white centers, is presented as the provider of the necessary strength, determination, and courage for her to pass the test in the coming season."
1289	10156	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's statement, ""...then I'll take the test again,"" to demonstrate her willingness to adapt to her new environment. The term ""test"" refers to this process of adaptation, as seen when she tells her mother, ""I-I failed the test,"" after a distressing experience. Having spent money on a plant in an attempt to mentally remain in her homeland, she found she could not sustain that illusion. The story ends on a positive note to convey that Saeng now looks forward to a promising future in her new home."
1290	10157	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with that paragraph for several reasons, supported by examples from the text. One reason is to demonstrate Saeng's perseverance, as shown by her declaration, ""Then I will take the test again,"" indicating her determination to keep trying. Another reason is to suggest a future for the hibiscus, paralleling Saeng's own journey; when she notes the hibiscus is budding, it signifies the plant's potential to adapt, just as Saeng is learning to acclimate to her surroundings. A final reason is to highlight her ongoing effort, as her realization that things once strange are now almost familiar shows her growing acclimatization. These textual examples provide substantial reasons for the story's concluding paragraph."
1291	10158	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the narrative with a resolution to retake the driving test after the winter season concludes and the hibiscus begins to bud. This illustrates the parallel between the plant and the narrator, as well as the respective hardships they each endure. The winter season functions as a significant obstacle for the hibiscus, yet it is poised to survive this period and flourish in the spring. This botanical cycle provides the author with the confidence that she, too, can overcome her personal difficulties and ultimately thrive. A shared hardship for both the narrator and the hibiscus is the condition of being ""root bound,"" reflecting the author's profound longing for her native Vietnam. Nevertheless, both the individual and the plant are compelled to adapt to their new environments and are ultimately capable of doing so."
1292	10159	4	2	The author concludes the story with that specific paragraph to demonstrate how her profound homesickness adversely affected her performance on the driving test. In her home country, the climate was consistently warm, and it was filled with cherished family memories. In stark contrast, her new environment is cold and snowy, a condition to which she is completely unaccustomed. The paragraph states she will retake the test when seasonal changes occur because the ensuing warmth will more closely resemble her homeland, thereby allowing her to focus more intently on the examination itself rather than the people and places she misses.
1293	10160	4	2	"In concluding ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho utilizes the final paragraph to establish Saeng's determined character, showcasing her resolve to not only pass her driving test but also to acclimatize to her new home. The hibiscus plant serves as a potent source of motivation; its promised budding in spring symbolizes the return of happier memories and the supportive beliefs of her loved ones. This conclusion effectively signals a new beginning for Saeng with the coming spring, representing a time to start afresh, find happiness in her present circumstances, and cease dwelling on the past. This ending successfully fosters a positive atmosphere, revealing Saeng's inner strength as a person who honors her past while proactively moving forward, a universal strength the author implies is commendable for everyone."
1294	10161	4	2	"The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph to demonstrate that, despite her profound longing for the ""old country,"" the protagonist possesses the resilience to adapt and ultimately survive in her new surroundings."
1295	10162	4	2	The author likely concluded the story with this paragraph to impart a tone of hopefulness. Saeng was struggling to adapt to her new home, a situation which fostered feelings of hopelessness, and her failure of the driving test exacerbated her distress. The purchase of a hibiscus, a plant that vividly reminded her of her former home, provided her with significant comfort and aided her in navigating this difficult period. In the final paragraph, Saeng looks ahead to the spring, anticipating her second attempt at the driving test with renewed optimism. This forward-looking perspective provides a definitive feeling of hope, which is the primary reason for the author's chosen conclusion.
1296	10163	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resilience and the enduring presence of hope. This serves to impart a lesson on the importance of hope, patience, and the understanding that adaptation requires time. Although Saeng initially succumbed to the sorrow of missing her homeland, her reflection that many once-strange things had become familiar through the quiet repetition of seasons signifies her gradual adjustment. By concluding with this realization and the comparison to the returning geese, the narrative demonstrates her growing inner strength and her unwavering resolve to take the test again.
1297	10164	4	2	"From reading the story ""Winter,"" it is clear the author includes the phrase, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” because this passage directly connects to the story's title. The vow ties Saeng's personal resolve to the cyclical return of spring, thus completing the thematic arc introduced by ""Winter."""
1298	10165	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to underscore Saeng's determination. Despite her poor performance on the initial test, the conclusion affirms her intent to retake it in order to pass. This final note serves to highlight Saeng's resilience and her commitment to improving her outcome, thereby concluding the narrative on a note of persistent effort.
1299	10166	4	2	I believe the author ends the story with that paragraph because it links the hibiscus plant, which symbolizes positive attributes for the character, to her recent failure on an important test. Both the character and the plant exemplify perseverance, and I think the author aims to convey a message to the reader about never surrendering one's goals. The plant serves as an emblem of endurance by surviving the harsh winter, just as the main character refuses to abandon the test she is determined to pass. The author's ultimate message is one of steadfast persistence.
1300	10167	4	2	At the story's conclusion, the author presents Saeng's vow: “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author chooses this ending because Saeng, feeling she did not do her best after failing, resolves to retake the test upon spring's return. This conclusion frames her failure not as an end but as a prelude to a future attempt, fostering hope for her eventual success.
1301	10168	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's determination to return and attempt the scent test once more, following the snow's thaw and the geese's return.
1302	10169	4	2	The narrative centers on Saeng, a Vietnamese teenager who has recently relocated to the United States with her family. After failing her driving test, she encounters a hibiscus plant on her walk home and is captivated by its beauty. Her mother, an avid gardener, utilizes homegrown produce for their meals. The concluding paragraph, which notes the hibiscus will bud in spring, indicates Saeng's intent to retake the test, likely because she believes the sight of the beautiful plant will provide her with the fortitude to succeed.
1303	10170	4	2	In my view, the author chooses to conclude with that specific paragraph to illustrate how the protagonist is cultivating hope for her own success. The anticipated sprouting of the hibiscus serves as a source of strength, inspiring her to retake the test with renewed confidence, as the winter hibiscus evoked a powerful connection to her homeland.
1304	10171	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring, when the snow melts, geese return, and the hibiscus buds, to underscore the plant's role as her inspiration. The paragraph suggests that the hibiscus's resilience in budding after winter motivates Saeng to emulate its strength and persevere, refusing to abandon her goal.
1305	10172	4	2	"The concluding paragraph demonstrates Saeng's refusal to surrender, highlighting the theme of adaptation and finding appreciation for one's environment. Her initial struggle to articulate her failure and her longing for ""home"" reveal her insecurity and loneliness. However, her decision to try again in the spring provides a hopeful resolution, signifying her choice to embrace her new surroundings after recognizing parallels between her past and present life, ultimately deciding to grant this new place a genuine chance."
1306	10173	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's resolve to retake the test, drawing a parallel between her own determination and the resilience of the flowers. Both the character and the flowers demonstrate an ability to adapt to their respective circumstances and a shared determination to thrive in challenging environments. They each overcome significant obstacles, and the conclusion suggests the protagonist is looking toward the future. Ultimately, she expresses hope that her faith in the flowers—and by extension, in her own capacity for renewal, much like the arrival of spring—is justified.
1307	10174	4	2	I genuinely appreciate the author's concluding paragraph, as it effectively encapsulates the entire narrative in a concise manner. This summary provokes curiosity about subsequent events and the potential for a sequel. It is a compelling story that resonates with me on a personal level in several distinct ways.
1308	10175	4	2	The author concludes with this scenario to convey that the protagonist must overcome a significant personal challenge. The underlying message is a call to recognize a pivotal moment of opportunity. It urges the reader to understand that such chances for proving one's worth are fleeting and must be seized decisively when they arise, as there may not be another.
1309	10176	4	2	The author employs this concluding sentence to demonstrate the girl's self-confidence. It signifies that she has allotted herself sufficient time to prepare for her next attempt. Furthermore, she possesses the assurance that she will be ready for her challenge concurrently with the blossoming of her flower, linking her personal growth to a natural cycle.
1310	10177	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to establish a foundation for a potential sequel. By referencing a vow made silently and the anticipation of spring, the ending creates narrative anticipation. This technique allows for a continuation of the story in a future installment, picking up the plot when the characters return.
1311	10178	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's use of an impossible analogy to frame her resolve. She juxtaposes the certainty of natural cycles—the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus—with her own daunting task of retaking the test. This comparison signifies that if the things she cherishes most can overcome their seasonal obstacles, she too must persevere through her most painful challenge. Her determination suggests a willingness to attempt the test repeatedly until she succeeds. The narrative underscores her struggle to assimilate, as she relies solely on her native knowledge, concluding that greater effort is her only path to potential success.
1312	10179	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to suggest the protagonist's tears were not merely about failing a test. While she cried when telling her mother the news, her emotional distress was more profound, rooted in an intense homesickness that hindered her concentration. She used the test failure as a pretext for her tears, a safer outlet than confessing her profound longing for home to her mother. This unspoken grief is the true subtext of the concluding scene.
1313	10180	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, a season marked by the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. This resolution is presented alongside a final image of her mother, who, seemingly oblivious to the cold, continues working in the vegetable garden, digging up onions with a rusty trowel. The parallel scenes highlight a shared, quiet perseverance in the face of hardship, bringing the narrative to a close on a note of determined resilience.
1314	10181	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate how the hibiscus serves as an inspirational and comforting force for Saeng, surpassing what any person could provide. Following her failure of the driver's test, Saeng discovers a hibiscus, which prompts a visit to a florist. She takes a petal, holds it tightly, and is transported by its connection to her beloved home in Vietnam. This plant becomes a profound source of solace. By having Saeng vow to retake the test only when the hibiscus buds, the author signifies the flower's role in empowering her to overcome life's obstacles and endure personal hardships.
1315	10182	4	2	Saeng's statement at the paragraph's end signifies her intention to retake the test when the season is right for the plants she admires. Her commitment extends beyond the test itself to developing a deeper appreciation for her new environment. This involves understanding the narrative, characteristics, and history associated with the local flora, indicating a resolve to connect with her surroundings more fully.
1316	10183	4	2	She resolved not to retake the examination unless the winter hibiscus returned, her distress over the failed test palpable. Much of her day was spent observing the hibiscus, yet this provided little solace as they were not the authentic specimens from her homeland. Her mother assured her of the plant's resilience, stating it was strong enough to survive the cold season. With the arrival of spring, as the snow recedes and the geese come back, when this very hibiscus begins to bud, Saeng made a quiet vow to herself that she would then attempt the test once more.
1317	10184	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves as a potent symbol of hope for future improvement. This hopeful conclusion is drawn from the parallel between the flower's survival and the girl's own resilience; just as the plant can endure the winter, so too can she. This symbolism effectively conveys the protagonist's realization that adapting to her new country is a process that requires time, but ultimate success is attainable. The statement is particularly meaningful as it concludes an otherwise difficult day on a positive note, counteracting her feelings of displacement and longing for her native land and grandmother. Ultimately, this paragraph marks the story's turning point, where Saeng commits to persevering through her struggles until spring, recognizing that her ability to adapt will blossom in time, just as the hibiscus will.
1318	10185	4	2	The author concludes the story with this sentence to underscore a theme of future hope. It communicates to the reader that while the present is challenging, circumstances will eventually improve. Although Saeng failed her test, she refuses to abandon the prospect of passing it. She maintains the belief that she will succeed in the spring, when conditions are more favorable. Her homesickness will not be permitted to obstruct her future progress. This rationale explains the author's decision to end with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, a season of renewal marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding hibiscus.
1319	10186	4	2	The author describes the transition from winter to spring, a period of renewal where the natural world regains its beauty. This signals the end of winter and the beginning of a new season, which is the reason for planting during the colder months—to ensure growth and blossoming in the spring. The paragraph could be enhanced with more descriptive details about the process of the plants' growth to provide a clearer and more vivid picture for the reader, thereby strengthening the overall imagery of the scene.
1320	10187	4	2	The author's chosen conclusion effectively synthesizes key narrative elements and themes. The sentence integrates symbols of both her new and old homes—the geese and the hibiscus—suggesting a harmonious coexistence. Saeng's silent vow to retake the test mirrors the determined struggle of the hibiscus against the winter, highlighting a shared theme of perseverance. The final sentence conveys significant wisdom, implying that while the past remains a part of one's identity, one can confront new challenges with determination and ultimately overcome them, thus providing a resonant and unifying end to the story.
1321	10188	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination in overcoming the challenges of being new to a country. Despite her initial doubts following the test, her decision to retake it demonstrates significant resolve. Her offer, ""Here, let me help you, mother,"" signifies a turning point. With her mother's comforting assurance that it is acceptable, Saeng receives the necessary encouragement to assist her mother and concludes internally that she cannot allow a single setback to hinder her progress. Given this support system, she is well-positioned to pass the test on her next attempt."
1322	10189	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" author Minfong Ho concludes with Saeng's silent vow: ""when they come back... in the spring... then I will take that test again."" This ending underscores her determination to succeed in her new country, showing how memories of her grandmother inspire her to strive for excellence. Initially, Saeng visits a flower shop and is overwhelmed by memories, both joyful and sad, upon seeing plants from her homeland. Her disappointment is palpable when she confesses her failure to her mother, nervously shredding a leaf. The subsequent act of planting the hibiscus in their garden symbolizes her desire to honor her grandmother and her past. These memories, while bittersweet, ultimately provide the strength and motivation she needs to pursue a better future in her new home."
1323	10190	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with a quote indicating the protagonist's intent to try again. This technique is often employed by writers to create an open ending, which can foster reader curiosity about a potential sequel and engage their imagination. By revealing the character's resolve without showing the outcome, the author effectively capitalizes on the reader's inherent desire to know whether she will ultimately fail or succeed, leaving the final result to the audience's speculation.
1324	10191	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's commitment to trying again, albeit not immediately. She aspires to eventually confront the flowers that remind her of home without becoming emotionally overwhelmed. Saeng perceives her mother's understanding yet also senses a trace of disappointment, particularly upon hearing her mother's questioning response. This perceived disappointment, however slight, becomes a key motivator for Saeng's resolve to make another attempt and succeed.
1325	10192	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's determined character. The intention is to show the reader that, despite her initial failure on the test, Saeng possesses a resilient and strong-willed nature. Rather than succumbing to defeat, her decision to retake the examination underscores a fundamental perseverance and a refusal to abandon hope.
1326	10193	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to provide insight into her perspective and to foster an understanding of the circumstances of her upbringing, as illustrated by her own statements.
1327	10194	4	2	"The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to underscore a central theme of immigration. This illustrates the pressure placed upon immigrants to assimilate fully into their new country, often at the expense of their cultural identity. The ""test"" symbolizes this process of adaptation and the implicit demand to forget one's homeland. Saeng's resolution, prompted by her purchase of a plant that reminds her of home, represents a quiet rebellion against this erasure. Ultimately, the author portrays the complex experience of immigrants who were instructed to abandon their past upon arrival in their new nation."
1328	10195	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author conveys Saeng's profound sense of displacement in her new environment. The text describes her experience as ""like walking into another world,"" highlighting her feeling of complete anonymity and isolation, where she is unknown to anyone but herself."
1329	10196	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to evoke a sense of hope, symbolized by the certainty of spring's return. This seasonal change signifies that circumstances will improve for the family and that the girl will find opportunities to make friends, suggesting a brighter future lies ahead.
1330	10197	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng fails her driver's test but resolves to try again in the spring. The story concludes with this intention because the hibiscus plant she and her mother planted will then be growing and blooming, and the geese will have returned. These familiar elements will provide her with a sense of comfort and connection to her homeland, thereby giving her the confidence and stability needed to pass the test."
1331	10198	4	2	The narrative concludes with the protagonist resolving to retake the examination in the spring, coinciding with the geese's return from their winter migration. This signifies a fresh start, allowing her time to prepare anew and recover from her previous failure. Her mother, initially disbelieving upon learning of the failed test, offered consolation and affirmed the opportunity to try again in the new season, thus providing a supportive conclusion to the event.
1332	10199	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's internal reflection on future events. Saeng vowed silently to herself that when the geese return in the spring, as the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, she will take the test again, marking a personal commitment to a new beginning.
1333	10200	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to impart a sense of hope and a positive outlook. Throughout the narrative, Saeng grapples with loneliness and depression stemming from her displacement from Vietnam, but the sight of a winter hibiscus revives cherished childhood memories, offering a glimmer of hope for adapting to her new life. This flower symbolizes light and future promise. Furthermore, her decision to retake the driver's test in the spring, when the hibiscus blooms, demonstrates her perseverance despite initial failure. Ultimately, the ending provides an uplifting message that, with love and determination, one can overcome obstacles, whether related to school, tests, or home, through hard work and faith.
1334	10201	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph in which Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, to illustrate her need to acclimate to her new country. The familiar honks of the returning geese and the budding hibiscus, which reminds her of Vietnam, will provide the confidence and encouragement she requires to attempt the driver's test once more, symbolizing her growing integration.
1335	10202	4	2	Saeng made a silent vow to herself, a response to the difficulty she faced in making new friends. She found solace in gardening, perceiving plants as her companions, and felt a significant sense of accomplishment upon taking the shovel and finishing the planting task for her mother, which greatly improved her self-esteem.
1336	10203	4	2	"The author's decision to conclude ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph is to signify a new beginning for Saeng. After moving and failing her test, the winter hibiscus provides comfort through its connection to her past home. It offers her hope, as its stark winter appearance will transform with the arrival of spring, a season symbolic of renewal. Just as nature revives in spring, Saeng views retaking the test as her own personal rebirth, a chance to start afresh after a period of difficulty. Therefore, the author uses the final paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve for a new beginning."
1337	10204	4	2	"Authors often employ a concluding paragraph that references a future action to suggest impending change. In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author ends with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring. This device highlights the transformative potential of the future. Saeng's initial failure on the driving test establishes a need for change, which the spring season represents. Furthermore, the act of planting the winter hibiscus, which is dormant and will later bloom, physically embodies this theme of future growth and alteration. In conclusion, such a paragraph is used to foreshadow positive developments and character evolution."
1338	10205	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this specific paragraph to reinforce several interconnected themes. The ""budding hibiscus"" operates as a symbol of comfort for Saeng, a tangible link to her homeland that consoles her after personal setbacks like failing her driver's test. Simultaneously, the ""geese returning"" symbolize a new beginning, marking the spring as a time for renewal after a difficult period of adjustment. Finally, Saeng's resolution to ""take that test again"" embodies the theme of perseverance, demonstrating her resilience in adapting to a new country. Therefore, Ho uses the concluding paragraph to articulate themes of comfort, renewal, and unwavering determination."
1339	10206	4	2	The author includes the final paragraph to sustain reader engagement by introducing a forward-looking resolution. It also serves to underscore a central theme of resilience, communicated through the symbolic hibiscus plant which, despite the winter, is poised to bloom again. This implies a message of perseverance, suggesting that one should never surrender in the face of adversity. The paragraph thus functions to provide narrative closure while emphasizing the plant's, and by extension the character's, enduring tenacity.
1340	10207	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to demonstrate how memories of her homeland serve as a source of encouragement. Throughout the story, Saeng gradually recognizes similarities between her new environment and her native land. The spring season, in particular, evokes these familiar memories, thereby motivating her to face her challenges with renewed confidence. In conclusion, the quoted paragraph is included to show how Saeng is ultimately inspired by the comforting connections to her past.
1341	10208	4	2	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist's resolution to retake the driver's test serves as a symbol of her forward progression. This development is precipitated by a profound, almost visceral, moment of recognition when Saeng encounters a flower reminiscent of her native Vietnam at a local florist. Her maturation is further evidenced when she assists her mother with planting a seed, an act that signifies her growing responsibility. After a period of reflection where she reconciles with her past, she observes geese migrating south in a V formation, which inspires her to set a personal goal. Her vow to take the test again is thus a symbolic tool for her growth and adaptation within her new country, representing a definitive step forward."
1342	10209	4	2	The narrative illustrates that during a period of uncertainty, the protagonist will ultimately prevail. The plant within the story functions as a symbol of hope, and its presence instills this same feeling within her. Although the memories she recalls initially evoke sadness, they ultimately culminate in providing her with a sense of hope and resilience for the future.
1343	10210	4	2	It is possible the author chose to conclude the story with that specific statement to convey a particular message to the audience. Alternatively, the author may have had no deeper rationale and simply felt it was the appropriate way to end the narrative, without a specific underlying reason for the decision. The conclusion could therefore stem from either intentional messaging or a simple stylistic choice.
1344	10211	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake the driving test in the spring to symbolize her capacity to overcome sorrow and embrace resilience. This is paralleled through two key symbols: the returning geese and the budding hibiscus. Initially, after failing her test, Saeng desired only to return to her homeland, not to try again. The geese, which overcome harsh conditions by migrating and then returning, mirror her own need to wait for a more opportune and confident moment. Similarly, the hibiscus, which survives the winter to bloom in spring, symbolizes her inner strength and determination to endure her current challenges and ultimately succeed. The concluding paragraph thus affirms that she has not given up and is assured in her decision to try again."
1345	10212	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph demonstrates the narrator's perseverance, as she resolves to retake the test at a more favorable time rather than surrendering. This decision reflects her realization that life is transient and should be appreciated, reinforcing her commitment to persevere until she achieves her goal of passing the examination.
1346	10213	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding paragraph establishes that the narrator, Saeng, has not surrendered her efforts to pass the driving test."
1347	10214	4	2	"The final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves as a thematic summary, illustrating Saeng's resolve to retake her driving test and embrace a new beginning. The author employs these closing remarks to convey a sense of hope and determination. This is further emphasized through symbolic objects: the hibiscus evokes memories of her homeland, the choice of spring signifies renewal, and the returning geese mirror her own resolve to persevere and improve."
1348	10215	4	2	The author, MinFong Ho, concludes the narrative with this paragraph to instill a sense of hope in the reader. The central tenet presented is the importance of perseverance, suggesting that circumstances improve through continued effort. Despite Saeng's distress over failing her driving test and her profound homesickness, the story's conclusion reinforces the principle of never giving up, as embodied by the character's vow. This principle asserts that individuals can surmount life's difficulties regardless of their circumstances. Ultimately, the paragraph evokes hope in the reader, thereby contributing to the story's overarching theme of maintaining hope and resilience during challenging times.
1349	10216	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph provides a more resonant and satisfying ending for the story. Without this final passage, the narrative would lack impact and fail to engage the reader fully. This paragraph serves to crystallize the story's message, offering clarity and a sense of closure. For instance, a weak conclusion would diminish the reader's overall experience, making the author's decision to include a stable, well-crafted ending a crucial one. This particular ending harmonizes effectively with the preceding narrative and enhances comprehension, resulting in a conclusion that feels perfectly suited to the story.
1350	10217	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to articulate a theme of renewal and optimistic fortune. The imagery of melting snow, returning geese, and the budding hibiscus plant collectively symbolizes a fresh start. Having failed her driving test, the protagonist resolves to begin again in the spring, aligning her personal journey with the seasonal cycle. This final passage thus reinforces the idea of new beginnings following disappointment.
1351	10218	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that Saeng's renewal will parallel the arrival of spring. The narrative establishes this meaning by depicting Saeng's difficult winter, a period marked by her struggle to adjust to numerous new challenges. With the spring, however, she resolves to begin anew, just as the hibiscus plant will.
1352	10219	4	2	The author includes this concluding paragraph to structurally unify the narrative. The story begins with Saeng's failure on her driver's test and her subsequent depression, then progresses to her discovery of a hibiscus, which evokes memories of her homeland and positive experiences. The paragraph connects these elements by indicating that Saeng will only return to the testing center when the hibiscus, a source of her happiness and confidence, begins to bud, thereby linking the conclusion to the story's core from beginning to end.
1353	10220	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story in this manner to signify that the character's readiness to retake the test is intrinsically linked to the hibiscus's return. The conclusion powerfully suggests that her personal growth and the natural world's cycles are deeply connected, and her confidence will blossom alongside the flower.
1354	10221	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the theme that adjusting to life's changes is profoundly challenging. Having moved to a new location, Saeng longs for her home. The flowers in the greenhouse remind her of her homeland and her grandmother, provoking a wave of loss so intense it brings tears. Although she informs her mother of her test failure, she internally vows to pass it by spring. This final insight into Saeng's character reveals that, despite the difficulty of letting go of her past, she possesses the resilience to forge a new life.
1355	10222	4	2	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate that the protagonist's connection to nature is cyclical and enduring. It signifies that when the season returns, she will resume her cherished routines of cultivating plants, nurturing them, and ultimately utilizing them for sustenance. This cycle will persist for as long as she is able to continue.
1356	10223	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate Saeng's greater comfort with her former home. While the winter hibiscus is associated with her new environment, the arrival of new hibiscus after winter connects them to this new life. However, the hibiscus from her old home provides her with a sense of solace. The paragraph's conclusion suggests that once she re-experiences this comfort, she will find the courage to attempt the test again, ultimately highlighting her continued struggle with change and her lingering desire to return to her past.
1357	10224	4	2	"The author includes this paragraph to underscore Saeng's experience of beginning anew in a foreign country, where she deeply misses her homeland, a feeling evoked by the hibiscus. Having failed a test, Saeng draws a parallel to flowers that fade in winter but bloom again in spring. This cyclical pattern suggests that Saeng, too, will eventually ""bloom"" and retake the test. The narrative thus portrays how individuals enduring the hardship of relocation to an unfamiliar place often find solace in symbols that connect them to their original home and promise renewal."
1358	10225	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this spring, Saeng made a mistake by purchasing plants that cost over a dollar, which disappointed her mother. She resolves that when the next spring arrives, she will have another opportunity to do her best and succeed. This concluding thought reinforces her determination to improve and to avoid being a source of disappointment to her mother in the future.
1359	10226	4	2	The author ended the story with that paragraph to convey how the flower assists Saeng in coping with her move by reminding her of her hometown. It establishes that when the geese return and the flower begins to bloom, she will feel confident about passing the test. Although she is disheartened by her failure, the narrative suggests that failing does not preclude eventual success. She will likely feel more comfortable and prepared to retake the test with the arrival of spring.
1360	10227	4	2	"The author concluded the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this specific paragraph to imply that Saeng possesses a resilient spirit and will not surrender. By revealing Saeng's sadness over failing the test alongside her resolve to retake it, the text infers that she is a determined individual. The paragraph's primary function is to communicate that Saeng's determination persists in the face of adversity, providing a conclusive note on her character."
1361	10228	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, a decision prompted by the symbolic hibiscus, which embodies hope and adaptation. Saeng struggles to adjust to her new life, feeling too emotionally fragile to speak at home without crying. The hibiscus, however, provides solace by reminding her of her homeland. Its root-bound condition mirrors Saeng's own state in her new country—initially fearful and resistant. By planting the hibiscus with her mother, Saeng commits to nurturing a new life in @LOCATION1, and she resolves that when the plant is ready to blossom in the spring, she too will be ready to accept her circumstances and try again."
1362	10229	4	2	"Mingfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's personal growth and her resolve to persevere. The narrator describes Saeng watching geese fly in a ""distinctive V"" against the sky, an image that coincides with her emotional recovery and her desire to adapt and succeed despite her homesickness. This moment follows an earlier point where Saeng felt too unsteady to speak at home for fear of crying, a clear indication of the profound sadness caused by being separated from her homeland. The concluding paragraph thus serves to highlight her transition from sorrow to a determined acceptance of her new environment."
1363	10230	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey that the plant provides Saeng with a sense of comfort and hope. She feels that the hibiscus will bring her a form of luck or positive change, easing her transition into a new and unfamiliar life. This symbolic gesture represents her belief in a brighter future, facilitated by the familiar presence of the plant from her homeland. The ending therefore solidifies the theme of finding solace and encouragement through symbolic connections to one's past.
1364	10231	4	2	"I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph to emphasize the theme of cyclical renewal and persistent readiness. The phrase ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season"" suggests that while time passes and seasons change, Saeng's fundamental resolve remains constant. She positions herself to always be prepared to ""take the test"" again, symbolizing an enduring commitment to her goals despite the passage of time and the challenges she faces. This ending reinforces the idea of perpetual hope and the patient, recurring nature of personal determination."
1365	10232	4	2	The author's intention in the concluding paragraph is to show that Saeng will retake the test in the spring, a time of renewal marked by the changing seasons, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus. This specific timing connects her personal resolve to the natural world's cycles, symbolizing a new beginning and a fresh attempt at overcoming her challenges. The paragraph thus serves as a promise of future effort aligned with the hopeful energy of the spring season.
1366	10233	4	2	The author concludes that failing the test is not a catastrophic outcome. She recognizes that circumstances evolve and opportunities for redemption are ever-present, a point clarified in the final paragraph where she resolves to retake the examination once the hibiscus plant begins to bud.
1367	10234	4	2	The narrative concludes with the protagonist's resolution: in the spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she will take the test again. This statement signifies her determination not to give up abruptly.
1368	10235	4	2	"The author concludes with this specific paragraph because it conveys multiple facets of the protagonist's character succinctly. Her declaration to ""take that test again"" demonstrates a willing perseverance and a genuine affection for her goal. Furthermore, her invocation of spring's arrival—the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus—serves as a poignant reminder of the cyclical and enduring qualities she values, which is precisely why the author selected this paragraph for the conclusion."
1369	10236	4	2	This is a story about self-belief and perseverance. Although Saeng was deeply disappointed by failing her driver's test, she discovered a method to cope with her setback. The hibiscus holds significant meaning for her, serving as a connection to her homeland and a symbol of beauty during a difficult period. Adapting to a new country is challenging, and a minor failure can feel overwhelmingly disheartening, evoking feelings of isolation much like the hibiscus growing beside the highway. Saeng's vow to retake the test when the hibiscus blooms in spring powerfully symbolizes her own resilience and capacity for renewal.
1370	10237	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph for several reasons. After failing her driving test, Saeng finds solace in nature, particularly after purchasing a plant. She seems to associate the geese's departure and the hibiscus's dormant state with an unsuitable time for testing, while their return and budding bring her comfort. This implies that nature provides her with emotional support. The ending demonstrates that Saeng has moved beyond her disappointment, recognizing she will have another opportunity the following year with the return of the geese and the budding hibiscus. With the reassurance she draws from the natural world, she feels confident about passing the test next time.
1371	10238	4	2	The author employs the concluding paragraph to provide readers with a reflective point, leaving them with a resonant idea after finishing the story. For instance, it conveys the notion that the protagonist's cultivation of plants will persist beyond the winter season, suggesting continuity and future growth.
1372	10239	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph serves to underscore Saeng's resolve. She struggles with adapting to her new environment, a difficulty exemplified when she returns home with the flower, feeling too emotionally fragile to speak lest she cry. The hibiscus provides a sense of security and familiarity from her homeland. The author likely includes this final passage to illustrate that this experience will grant Saeng the confidence and comfort needed to face her test again the following year."
1373	10240	4	2	The author utilizes the final paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's unwavering perseverance. Furthermore, this conclusion serves as a broader message to readers, encouraging them to persist in their efforts and never surrender. The narrative suggests that it is acceptable to pause, to study further, or to reconsider one's strategy before continuing to pursue one's goals.
1374	10241	4	2	Upon returning home, Saeng made a silent vow to herself: when spring arrives, the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, she would take the test again. The author included this paragraph in the story to illustrate the character's commitment to improving her academic standing and her proactive plan for the future.
1375	10242	4	2	The author concludes with this sentence to imply that the character prefers to retake the test during a more aesthetically pleasing season. The intended meaning is that the protagonist associates the beauty of the environment with a more favorable frame of mind for confronting challenges. This analysis explains the reasoning behind the author's chosen conclusion.
1376	10243	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the inspirational concluding sentence, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again,"" serves a distinct literary function. It introduces a sense of hope for the future, which stands in stark contrast to the story's otherwise melancholic tone, thereby creating a more uplifting resolution. The narrative is permeated with Saeng's sorrow, stemming from her abrupt departure from her homeland, the loss of her childhood, and the memory of her beloved grandmother, poignantly captured in her reflection: “A blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone.” This profound grief is further illustrated through her tears in both the greenhouse, where she vividly recalls her grandmother, and the garden. By concluding with a hopeful resolution, the author effectively counterbalances the preceding sorrow and provides a forward-looking sense of optimism."
1377	10244	4	2	She resolves to take the test again in the spring because she fears that failing again would disappoint her mother, potentially creating a permanent distance between them. Her mother seems to believe that her test failures are connected to her lingering attachment to her past life and her difficulty adapting to her new country. Ultimately, however, the protagonist finds a measure of comfort and strength in her memories of her homeland, which helps her face the future with renewed determination to overcome these obstacles.
1378	10245	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story with this specific quote is primarily to illustrate the protagonist's enduring hope. In literary terms, hope is a vital character quality as it sustains reader engagement and often provides a story with a positive moral underpinning. By ending on this note, the author ensures the narrative concludes with a sense of forward momentum and resilience, which is precisely why this quote was selected for the final passage.
1379	10246	4	2	"The author crafted the final paragraph to provide a powerful and resonant conclusion to the story. Its central theme is the importance of perseverance and the refusal to surrender in the face of failure. This is encapsulated in the declaration, ""I will take the test again."" While Saeng initially states, ""I failed the test,"" her subsequent resolve demonstrates a crucial shift from defeat to determination. This concluding segment is essential for narrative completeness, drawing a parallel to the universal human experience of persistence, which Saeng now embodies by choosing to retake the test."
1380	10247	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to convey her resolute determination to achieve her goal. Having failed initially, she is now motivated to overcome her setback and ultimately succeed. This final statement is designed by the author to portray her not as defeated, but as a character with a strengthened will and a clear focus on future accomplishment.
1381	10248	4	2	The author's decision to conclude with that paragraph appears to serve the dual purpose of extending the narrative and providing a satisfactory resolution. However, the intended meaning of the conclusion remains ambiguous to this reader. The responsibility for clarifying the paragraph's significance therefore lies with the author, not the interpreter.
1382	10249	4	2	The plant held profound significance for Saeng as it was a tangible connection to her homeland. She resolved to retake her driving test only when the plant bloomed, indicating it served as a reminder of her origins and her identity. For Saeng, the plant represented a source of confidence. Having endured hardships, she felt a deep attachment to it precisely because it originated from her native land, providing her with solace and strength.
1383	10250	4	2	"I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph to deliberately cultivate a sense of wonder. My reasoning is that the word ""test,"" when considered in context, is open to multiple interpretations. It could, for instance, signify the test of overcoming the sadness of her circumstances, or it could represent the test of adapting to her new home with the arrival of spring. This deliberate ambiguity is precisely why I feel the author aimed to leave the reader with a feeling of thoughtful curiosity."
1384	10251	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the central theme is overcoming adversity. The story concludes with the protagonist, Saeng, stating, ""when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test."" Saeng, who faced difficulties at school, encounters flowers native to her homeland on her walk home, experiencing ""a shock of recognition so intense it was almost visceral."" The hibiscus specifically reminded her of her loss while simultaneously offering comfort. Her mother observes that the winter hibiscus, though its flowers are less pretty, is strong enough to survive outside its native environment. Inspired by this resilience, Saeng decides she too can be strong and will strive to adapt and succeed in her new surroundings, just like the plant."
1385	10252	4	2	Her statement clearly indicates that her interest in the flowers was far greater than her concern for the test.
1386	10253	4	2	The author likely concludes with this paragraph to signify the termination of one phase and the commencement of another. Following a period of distress and longing for home, the protagonist recognizes the emergence of a new reality that necessitates acceptance. Consequently, her resolve to begin anew in the spring is analogous to the blossoming of flowers, symbolizing a fresh start.
1387	10254	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to underscore the character's deliberate approach; she is not interested in expedience but is instead committed to pursuing the correct course of action, thereby rejecting shortcuts.
1388	10255	4	2	This passage underscores the hibiscus flower's profound significance to Saeng, reflecting her deep devotion to it. It further conveys her intention to patiently await the following spring for another opportunity to behold the flower's beauty.
1389	10256	4	2	The author utilizes the final paragraph to elucidate the character's internal reasoning for her actions, specifically her decision to take the test. She articulates a determination to reassess in the coming year whether this new environment has begun to feel like home.
1390	10257	4	2	The narrative's conclusion, wherein Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, illustrates her resilience in overcoming challenges, her search for solace during disappointment, and her link to past experiences. The hibiscus symbolizes the obstacles she faces, while the seasonal weather represents the passage of time necessary for growth. This also reflects finding comfort, as she anticipates the flower's return with the certainty that challenges are cyclical. Finally, it affirms her connection to her past, as she feels like an outsider in an unfamiliar world. The hibiscus mirrors her own sense of being distinct and out of place, echoing her prior struggle to adapt and survive in a new country, much as she did in her homeland.
1391	10258	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve and her current circumstances. Having recently arrived in a new country, she has not yet acclimated and initially felt profound disappointment, described metaphorically as a ""war afternoon starlight"" to convey her inner turmoil. Upon encountering a flower, she is reminded of her homeland, which she misses dearly, yet this memory also rekindles her hope. She understands the necessity of adapting to her new environment but remains emotionally fragile, culminating in a tearful release of her pent-up homesickness. The ""snows"" symbolize the challenges she currently faces, while ""spring"" represents her hope for a better future. The concluding paragraph thus serves to symbolize her determination to overcome adversity and her belief that she will ultimately succeed."
1392	10259	4	2	"The author includes the final passage to underscore the notion that Saeng, despite her failure, deserves another opportunity due to her considerable effort. Saeng's statement, ""Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it,"" reveals her deep investment in recapturing a sense of home, a sentiment her mother initially misunderstands, causing tension. Recognizing her daughter's struggle and the symbolic importance of the plant, the mother later offers the conciliatory words, ""It's a beautiful plant,"" to soothe Saeng's distress. The author's decision to conclude with this passage is ultimately justified by the cumulative hardships Saeng endures, highlighting her need for compassion and a renewed chance."
1393	10260	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's unwavering perseverance. The implication is that Saeng possesses a resolute character; she will continue striving to pass the test indefinitely, refusing to surrender. This final thought reinforces the central theme of relentless determination that is evident throughout the narrative, leaving the reader with a clear understanding of her indefatigable spirit.
1394	10261	4	2	The author's purpose in this conclusion is to draw a parallel between the cyclical return of spring, marked by melting snow and returning geese, and Saeng's recurring responsibility to nurture the plant. This act of care is presented as a significant duty, analogous to the substantial task of retaking the test. The concluding sentence thus signifies that with each new season comes a renewed obligation to persevere and meet one's challenges, which is the core meaning the author intended to communicate.
1395	10262	4	2	Gardening is her essential hobby, a vital activity for her mental clarity and creativity. Without this creative outlet, her ability to think and produce work is diminished. Therefore, the anticipation of the garden's return with the changing seasons brings her happiness and restores her capacity to function effectively in her endeavors.
1396	10263	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this specific paragraph for several distinct reasons. Firstly, it conveys the protagonist's resolve to retake the examination only after conditions have returned to a state of normalcy. Secondly, it implies that the narrative cannot proceed meaningfully until the desired circumstances are restored. An analogous situation would be halting the construction of a house due to a blizzard, with work resuming only upon the return of favorable weather. In summation, the paragraph serves as a deliberate and multifaceted conclusion to the author's account.
1397	10264	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho concludes the story to underscore the theme of new beginnings. The mother's statement, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty but it's strong enough to make it through the winter. That's what matters,"" functions as a metaphor for the family's fresh start in their new location. This location may not be as beautiful as their homeland, but their ability to survive there is paramount. Her words assuage her daughter's anxieties about starting over. Furthermore, the budding hibiscus symbolizes rebirth, as it dies and regrows with the seasons, mirroring the family's transition. Though their former identity has faded, they have not lost their heritage, a concept embodied by the flower, which, like Saeng, represents a fusion of two cultures."
1398	10265	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination to persevere through her difficulties and adapt to her new life. Relocating to a new country and culture is profoundly challenging, and while Saeng struggles, she refuses to abandon her efforts to build a new existence. Her concluding vow, to retake the test in the spring, is one of resolute hope. Throughout the story, Saeng grapples with adaptation, finding solace in memories of her homeland. This final sentence consolidates her emotional journey and highlights her inner strength. The hibiscus plant serves as a parallel to her own experience; just as the plant will survive the winter and bloom again, so too will Saeng. It will act as a companion and a reminder of her heritage, helping her to eventually thrive. This conclusion effectively imparts a sense of hope and the will to succeed, leaving the reader with a feeling of satisfaction regarding Saeng's adaptive journey.
1399	10266	4	2	The narrative follows a girl who, after failing her driving test, experiences an emotional breakdown over the loss of her original home. Upon purchasing a plant and confronting her new reality, she comes to accept that she no longer lives in Vietnam and that she failed her test. This leads to the realization that she must learn to appreciate her current situation and understand that her opportunity will arrive in time. The author chooses to conclude the story with this paragraph because it represents the story's essential resolution, the point at which the central character grasps the most important lessons.
1400	10267	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes with a silent vow made by the protagonist, Saeng, to retake her driving test. The sight of geese flying in formation and the hibiscus plant evoke powerful memories of her homeland, which she deeply misses. The author intends to show the reader that Saeng is beginning to feel a sense of belonging in her new environment. The hibiscus acts as a symbol, reassuring Saeng that everything will be acceptable; it is permissible to cherish memories of Vietnam while also embracing a new life. Consequently, Saeng will approach her next driving test in the spring with a renewed perspective and a greater likelihood of success."
1401	10268	4	2	The author employs that paragraph to construct imagery, thereby enabling the reader to visualize the narrative. Furthermore, the paragraph serves as a vehicle for the author to convey her own emotional state. This dual purpose is integral to the passage's function within the broader text.
1402	10269	4	2	The author utilizes the concluding paragraph to indicate Saeng's intention to retake the test and to foreshadow her reunion with the plant. This final section provides insight into future events, which is the primary reason for its inclusion by the author, effectively bringing the narrative to a close.
1403	10270	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, establishing a parallel between her personal renewal and the natural world's cycle. The hibiscus, a reminder of her home, becomes a source of confidence; her act of clutching its petal signifies her need for a tangible connection to her past. This flower alleviates her sense of displacement, providing motivation and a sentimental link to her old home within her new one. The familiar scent underscores the plant's emotional significance. Thus, the final paragraph illustrates this comparison and highlights the flower's crucial role in her adaptation process, demonstrating how a symbol from nature can anchor an individual in a new environment.
1404	10271	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho's concluding passage establishes a theme of hope. Saeng's decision to begin anew is synchronized with the world's rebirth in spring, a season of blossoming and renewal. The hibiscus, purchased as a memento of her homeland, also serves as a biological indicator for her to try again, its blooming mirroring her own readiness. Ho's ending thus looks forward to a new beginning. Saeng's vow to retake ""that test again"" reveals a resolute and changed attitude, marking a definitive shift toward perseverance and future attempts."
1405	10272	4	2	"The passage illustrates the character's profound sense of absence and her anticipation of a future reunion. This is evident in her statement, ""when they come back,"" and her reference to the returning geese and the budding hibiscus. These elements convey her current feelings of loneliness and contrast them with the hope she associates with their return. This anticipated return gives her the strength to continue from where she previously left off, as demonstrated by her resolution, ""Then I will take that test again,"" showing how connection fuels her determination."
1406	10273	4	2	The narrative by Minfong Ho evokes a complex emotional response, blending happiness and sadness within a consistently calm atmosphere. A sense of contentment arises from the descriptions of plants and the mother's eventual acceptance of the purchase. Initially, the expectation that the mother will reprimand the daughter for buying the plant after failing a test creates a feeling of sympathy. However, the prevailing calm mood underscores the protagonist's resilience; she does not surrender but instead chooses to proceed at her own pace.
1407	10274	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph indicating the protagonist's decision to retake the test, signaling her determination to succeed and avoid a recurrence of her previous disappointment. This future attempt is symbolically linked to the season of spring, a time of renewal marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding of the hibiscus plant, which is when she plans to make another effort.
1408	10275	4	2	"Saeng made a silent vow to herself and to her mother. She decided to confess that she had failed the test, an admission she feared would upset her mother. However, her mother then inquired about the plant Saeng was carrying. Saeng explained she had purchased it with her own money. Her sadness over failing the test was alleviated by the plant, which seemed to comfort her. The author likely concludes the story on this note to instill a sense of hope, suggesting Saeng will likely pass the test on her next attempt. Her declaration, ""then I will take that test again,"" shows her resolve, a decision perhaps inspired by the plant."
1409	10276	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's renewed determination to pass her driver's license test. This demonstrates to the reader her resolve following the winter. For instance, Saeng was initially saddened by her failure. Subsequently, her discovery of the flower provides her with solace and the confidence to try again. The initial example shows her dejection, while the conclusion uses this statement to convey that Saeng will ultimately succeed in passing the driver's license test.
1410	10277	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the story concludes with Saeng's resolution: ""when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending provides a positive closure to a narrative otherwise marked by Saeng's sadness and longing for her home in Vietnam, as seen when she laments that the hibiscus is not like the ones ""we had before."" The final message is one of resilience; despite things being different, she will persist in building a good life in the United States and not be defeated by change."
1411	10278	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey that Saeng will regain her confidence with the budding of the hibiscus and retake her driving test. This resolution prevents the story from ending on the melancholic image of the girl watching geese depart, a scene that underscores her initial dejection following her failure. By concluding on a note of renewed hope, where Saeng is reminded of home by the returning geese and the budding flower, the author provides an uplifting closure that leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and satisfaction.
1412	10279	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to illustrate the protagonist's determination to succeed in her new environment. The character's profound longing for her homeland, including its gardens and her grandparents, is evident; for instance, the scent of flowers in a shop vividly transports her back. A specific flower's aroma even evokes the memory of her grandmother's freshly washed hair. The final sentence, in which she resolves to retake her failed test when the hibiscus buds next winter, serves as a powerful affirmation of her resilience and her decision to persevere.
1413	10280	4	2	"The author selects the concluding vow, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again,"" to underscore the girl's resilience and refusal to surrender. Her distress is palpable, stemming from the artificiality of a flower compared to those from her past, which causes her to tremble with fear of her mother's disappointment. Her mother's quiet acknowledgment and observation of similar flowers blooming locally provide a moment of connection. Ultimately, the author uses this resolution to clearly demonstrate the character's intent to try again."
1414	10281	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to communicate Saeng's persistent resolve. Having moved from Vietnam, Saeng struggles to adapt and deeply misses her homeland, particularly the flowers native to it. Her observation that the winter hibiscus differs from the Vietnamese variety leads her to plant it and postpone retaking her driving test until spring. This signifies her strategy of temporarily setting aside her difficulties in a new land to revisit them under more favorable conditions. The conclusion thus emphasizes that she is not surrendering but rather choosing to delay confronting her challenges, which is the author's intended final message."
1415	10282	4	2	I believe the author uses this phrase as the conclusion because it reflects the protagonist's desire to experience caring for something deeply and to try again the following year. This intention to nurture and to engage once more with a cherished object is the reason I think the narrator selected this phrase for the story's final line.
1416	10283	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's process of adaptation. The winter hibiscus provided her with solace after failing her driving test, leading her to believe it will bring luck for her next attempt. Furthermore, the hibiscus is poised to survive, developing further as she works toward her goal. Its eventual bloom will symbolize the strength necessary for Saeng to overcome her present obstacle. Her mother's comment that the flower, while less beautiful, would survive, signifies that their new life in @LOCATION1 may not equal the splendor of Vietnam, but that Saeng, too, will endure and remain resilient.
1417	10284	4	2	The author's chosen ending demonstrates how the hibiscus provides Saeng with a profound sense of comfort, contrasting sharply with her initial state. At the story's outset, she possessed little confidence and felt emptied of the will to strive, forced to accept a strange new place as home. This changes upon encountering a familiar sight that rekindles her happiest memories. Having something personally significant constantly nearby can foster a feeling of being at home, and Saeng ultimately finds her solace in the hibiscus. Now that the plant resides in her garden, persisting through all seasons, she too will persevere, sustained by this reminder of her old home and its comforting associations, which she will now augment with new memories.
1418	10285	4	2	@PERSON1 proceeded to the summit and then descended down the opposite side of the hill.
1419	10286	4	2	"The author employs the concluding paragraph to establish the hibiscus as a potent symbol. The narration notes, ""Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,"" an action that coincides with Saeng facing adversity, with the plant's damaged state reflecting her own struggles. Later, Saeng contemplates the cyclical nature of the seasons, with the text observing, ""Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This realization foreshadows that come spring, the plant will be revitalized and in bloom, paralleling Saeng's own potential for success and personal renewal, thus completing the symbolic arc."
1420	10287	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to clearly convey Saeng's internal resolve. The ending signifies that Saeng will persistently endeavor each spring to nurture her flowers back to life, a testament to her considerable potential for achieving the personal success she has vowed to herself. This final thought solidifies the theme of enduring commitment and self-assurance.
1421	10288	4	2	The narrative's conclusion fittingly encapsulates its central themes of resilience and adaptation in the face of adversity. Throughout her struggles, Saeng finds solace in familiar elements, such as flowers and the taste of bitter melon, which provide her with the necessary fortitude to resolve to retake her driver's test in the spring. The final mention of the hibiscus is thus thematically appropriate. Furthermore, the concluding paragraph signifies Saeng's successful adaptation to her new environment. Her reference to the return of the geese, a sound she initially found foreign but now accepts as normal, demonstrates her growing acclimatization, providing a resonant and hopeful ending to her story.
1422	10289	4	2	The author's choice of conclusion is directly tied to the seasonal absence of the hibiscus. During the winter, Saeng is unable to see the plant in her garden, a familiar and beautiful presence from her past. This seasonal cycle underscores the story's final sentiment, as the narrative concludes with this period of waiting, mirroring Saeng's own temporary separation from a source of comfort and identity.
1423	10290	4	2	The story traces Saeng's ongoing effort to reconcile with her new life. The author includes this element to illustrate that Saeng has not surrendered to her difficulties. Instead, she is committed to persevering and adapting to her unfamiliar surroundings. While Saeng possesses a genuine desire to adjust, her profound longing for her former home presents a significant emotional obstacle. This internal conflict is the very reason she postpones her next attempt at integration until the spring, signaling a deferred but persistent hope.
1424	10291	4	2	The author employs this concluding line to create an open-ended resonance, allowing the reader to speculate on the future. The statement signifies Saeng's determination to honor her past and overcome her present challenges. By describing the cyclical return of spring with the melting snow and the geese, the author presents a metaphor for the change and personal growth Saeng aspires to achieve. This technique effectively illustrates her potential for transformation, a process mirrored by the budding of her plant, leaving her ultimate success to the reader's imagination.
1425	10292	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the budding of the hibiscus and the return of the geese. This parallel is drawn because Saeng's own renewal is likened to that of a flower, gaining strength to bloom again. Furthermore, the return of the geese and the plant's budding evoke a sense of seasonal cycles that remind her of home, creating a symbolic environment conducive to her resolve. This connection between her personal determination and the natural world's rebirth is the foundational reason for the story's concluding statement.
1426	10293	4	2	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the adolescent protagonist Saeng fails her driving examination and subsequently encounters a winter hibiscus, which evokes a flood of memories. The author concludes the narrative by having Saeng resolve to retake the test upon the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, thereby establishing a tone of solace and familiarity. The protagonist's realization that ""almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become"" signifies her reconnection with the authenticity of the natural world, a development that is implicitly linked to her future success. An impatient mood is cultivated for the reader, as this crucial insight arrives in winter, a season of closure when the geese have departed and the flower has wilted. The impending spring, therefore, symbolizes a period of renewal and new opportunities, which she will embrace alongside the familiar elements of her surroundings."
1427	10294	4	2	The author likely concluded with this statement to convey that while the protagonist is uncertain of passing, her resolve to retake the test remains firm, aligning it with the hibiscus's cyclical return. Her present dejection is alleviated by the plant, which serves as a comforting presence. Consequently, she associates the plant's re-emergence with a future attempt at the test, viewing it as a token of good fortune. Ultimately, the paragraph imparts a message of perseverance, encouraging one to persist through adversity and continue striving toward their goals.
1428	10295	4	2	"The author employs the concluding paragraph for several deliberate purposes. Firstly, it invites the reader to envision the narrative's potential continuation, as suggested by the line, ""then I will take that test again."" Secondly, it provides a final, resonant image intended to reshape the reader's overall impression of the story, exemplified by the evocative description of ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" These strategic choices effectively furnish the story with a sense of hopeful closure and thematic reinforcement."
1429	10296	4	2	The author's concluding strategy ties Saeng's resolution to the natural cycle. She pledges to retake her driving test coinciding with the spring thaw, the hibiscus's budding, and the geese's return. This synchronization with the seasons provides a concrete timeframe for her action, framing her personal endeavor within a broader, predictable rhythm of renewal. Her return to the test is thus metaphorically linked to the reliable return of the natural world.
1430	10297	4	2	In the story, Saeng makes a silent vow to herself: she will take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This resolution appears to be a sound and fitting decision for her character, as it connects her personal challenge to the hopeful renewal of the natural world, providing a clear and meaningful goal for her to pursue.
1431	10298	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" likely concluded the story in this manner to leave the reader with a sense of hope. This mirrors the protagonist Saeng's process of adaptation, which is analogous to the winter hibiscus's own resilience. In the penultimate paragraph, the honks of geese have become a familiar sound to Saeng, indicating her growing acclimatization. Her decision to retake the test upon the geese's return suggests a vow to utilize the intervening time for further personal growth. The anticipated budding of the hibiscus would symbolize its successful adaptation to a new environment, serving as an inspiration for Saeng that she, too, can overcome her obstacles. This concluding feeling of optimism for Saeng's future is the definitive reason for the story's ending."
1432	10299	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore a thematic parallel with the changing seasons. Just as plants do not typically flourish in winter, individuals may face periods where progress seems halted. The lesson is to accept these phases with patience and to await the next opportunity for growth, trusting that the right time will come for the lesson to be applied once more.
1433	10300	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author includes the final paragraph to reinforce the central theme of perseverance. The protagonist's declaration, ""I will take the test again,"" embodies the core idea that one must not surrender after a setback. Instead, the narrative advocates for resilience, emphasizing the importance of working hard to rise from failure and persist in one's efforts."
1434	10301	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to articulate its overarching meaning. This concluding section often functions as the story's moral, providing final points of reflection or clarifying events within the narrative that may have previously been ambiguous to the reader, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding.
1435	10302	4	2	The story possesses a melancholic tone, as the protagonist grieves for her homeland and is disheartened by her failure on a driving test. The author concludes with the girl's resolution to retake the test, illustrating her refusal to succumb to despair despite her sadness. Failing such a significant test is a deeply disappointing experience, yet the narrative demonstrates her determination to persevere until she succeeds. Furthermore, the author likely intended to conclude on a positive note rather than leaving the story in a state of unresolved sorrow. The decision to end with the character's commitment to trying again was a deliberate choice to provide a sense of forward momentum and resolution.
1436	10303	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding phrase serves to underscore Saeng's determination to achieve her objectives. Her primary goal is to adapt to her new environment, a commitment demonstrated by her declaration to retake the test in the spring, signaling her refusal to surrender. This statement also reveals her precision and resolve, as she explicitly plans to attempt the examination again when the seasons turn. Ultimately, the phrase conveys that she has discovered the courage to persevere and continue her efforts without yielding."
1437	10304	4	2	Saeng awaited the spring, the time she had designated for retaking her test. Her preoccupation with this goal was evident as she observed the geese flying in a V-formation and monitored the dormant plant, still waiting for the snow to melt. She spoke to herself about the impending challenge, determined to attempt the test again in the new season. While she hoped to pass and avoid repeated attempts, she recognized that everyone moves on to different pursuits after such an ordeal is finally over.
1438	10305	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist Saeng, an immigrant from Vietnam, returns home after failing her driver's test. She interprets this failure as an inability to adapt to her family's new life, resulting in feelings of having disappointed both her mother and herself. In an attempt at consolation, she acquires a flavor reminiscent of their life in Vietnam. As her mother plants the winter hibiscus, Saeng perceives this as an act of forgiveness. This leads to her realization that, like the flower, she too can adapt to her surroundings, motivating her pledge to retake the test in the spring. The author's decision to conclude with this promise ensures the reader's final impression is of Saeng's resilience; her vow exemplifies the courage and perseverance required to adapt on her own terms, unlike others around her."
1439	10306	4	2	The author chooses to conclude the story with that specific paragraph to emphasize the protagonist's refusal to concede defeat. It clearly communicates her resolve to take the test again, paralleling her determination with the cyclical rebirth of the plant in the spring.
1440	10307	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's ongoing process of adapting to her new country. After initially failing her test and feeling she had let her mother down, Saeng reflects on their shared struggle to adjust from life in Vietnam. The hibiscus she finds serves as a tangible link to her homeland. Her final realization is that with faith, her new environment can become a true home. She chooses spring for her next attempt because it symbolizes a period of full growth for both the hibiscus and herself, marking her continued adaptation to the United States.
1441	10308	4	2	"The author concludes with that paragraph to reinforce the central themes of perseverance and adaptation. The concluding reference to the ""test"" recalls Saeng's earlier emotional collapse upon encountering plants reminiscent of her homeland, an experience she deemed a failure. By resolving to retake this test, Saeng demonstrates a commitment to persevere, striving to overcome her sorrow and achieve a sense of belonging in her new environment, thereby embodying the narrative's core message of resilience."
1442	10309	4	2	A determined girl entered a flower identification test but did not pass. She returned home feeling sad and emotional, telling her grandmother that the flowers were not like the ones from her homeland—a place she could not name without pain. Her grandmother agreed, confirming they were not the real ones, which deepened the girl's sense of displacement and longing.
1443	10310	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes with Saeng's silent vow: in the spring, when the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, she will take the test again. Initially, Saeng lacked confidence and failed her first attempt. However, the discovery of the hibiscus flower instilled in her a newfound hope, suggesting that her next attempt will be made with greater preparedness and resilience."
1444	10311	4	2	The author likely chose this conclusion to effectively unify the story's central ideas. This is exemplified by the character's resolution, where she silently vows to retake the test in the spring after the snow melts. This final statement serves to cohesively bind the narrative's themes of resolve and cyclical renewal, providing a resonant and integrated ending.
1445	10312	4	2	The author's choice to end with that sentence likely draws a parallel to the natural cycle of seasons. In winter, plants die off, and with the arrival of spring, they must begin the process of growth anew. This cyclical pattern mirrors the protagonist's own resolve to start over, suggesting a period of renewal and a fresh attempt at overcoming her challenges.
1446	10313	4	2	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to illustrate Saeng's commitment to cultivating hibiscus, suggesting that her dedication will ultimately lead to her success, akin to passing a test. Furthermore, this ending signifies her desire to integrate her heritage into her life by nurturing the flower emblematic of her nation, thereby affirming her cultural identity.
1447	10314	4	2	"The author's choice to conclude with this specific quote underscores Saeng's determination to pass her driving test. In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" after failing, Saeng immediately shifts her focus by insisting, ""Let's plant, right now,"" using gardening as a positive distraction from her disappointment. This action demonstrates her resolve to persevere, and the concluding quote effectively encapsulates her focused and resilient character."
1448	10315	4	2	The author chose this conclusion to leave the reader with a sense of hope. Although Saeng experienced hurt and disappointment after failing her driving test, the ending reveals her resilience. It demonstrates that she will not surrender to adversity in her new country but will instead persevere, moving forward to make the best of her circumstances.
1449	10316	4	2	I believe the author ends with this paragraph to highlight the protagonist's determination to ultimately pass the test. She failed on this attempt but is resolved to succeed in the future. The author also draws a parallel between the hibiscus's resilience and Saeng's own potential for growth and eventual success, which is the central reason for this concluding focus.
1450	10317	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify Saeng's resolve to care for her next plant. Her declaration that she will retake the test is linked to her having sold the previous plant. Having seen the hibiscus in her childhood, Saeng felt a deep attachment to it, and this final statement affirms her intention to nurture and keep the next one she acquires.
1451	10318	4	2	The author concludes the final paragraph to illustrate that after a certain duration, one may return and attempt something anew. The changing seasons may yield a different outcome for Saeng. She appears to draw a parallel between herself and the plant, believing that with the arrival of spring, the flower will gain strength, and she will pass the test on her second attempt when the geese return and the hibiscus buds. This also demonstrates her appreciation for nature, as her decision to wait for spring and the melting snow is predicated on a deep connection to the natural world. The story's conclusion affirms her affinity for nature, which is evident in her focus on the hibiscus.
1452	10319	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a girl named Saeng attempts to adjust to life in a new location after moving from Vietnam. She experiences sadness and homesickness, feelings intensified by failing her driver's test. Upon recognizing a plant from her homeland in a store, she purchases it and takes it home. The plant evokes memories of home, and a shared moment with her mother provides comfort. The concluding sentence, where Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus buds, signifies that the flower has instilled in her the confidence to succeed. This highlights her enduring connection to her homeland through the flowers, enabling her to overcome sadness and move forward without abandoning her memories, only her pain."
1453	10320	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's concluding passage demonstrates how the comfort derived from the hibiscus enables Saeng to progress. The greenhouse served as a sanctuary where she could express her homesickness, as evidenced by the line, ""and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept."" Subsequently, failing the driver's test reinforced her feelings of failing to adapt. The author uses the imagery of returning geese to conclude the narrative, symbolizing Saeng's personal growth. Her silent vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus budding, indicates that through these events, she has managed to overcome her melancholic feelings regarding her new home and found the resilience to try again."
1454	10321	4	2	"The author concluded the story with this statement to signify a new beginning for the protagonist in the spring. The narrative links her decision to retake the test with the budding of the hibiscus and the departure of snow, suggesting a period of renewal. This parallels the hibiscus ""coming back to life,"" symbolizing a second chance that she also deserves. As the environment becomes brighter and more positive, her confidence about retaking the test is restored. The ending is effective, requiring the reader to interpret the deeper meaning behind her words. Essentially, she is stating that once everything is revitalized, she will feel prepared and capable of passing the test on her next attempt."
1455	10322	4	2	"There are several reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. One reason is her evident fondness for the hibiscus flower, which is apparent when she ""reached out and touched a petal gently."" Another reason is their aesthetic appeal, suggested by her description of the setting as ""like walking into another world."" A final reason is her appreciation for their presence, conveyed through her detailed observation of the ""huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns, and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes"" growing in profusion. These details substantiate the reasons for the author's chosen conclusion."
1456	10323	4	2	"The author's decision to conclude the story with Saeng's resolution to retake the driving test in the spring is a strategic one. The girl, having just failed her test, is not prepared to attempt it again immediately. The blooming hibiscus serves as a dual symbol, representing both her past life in her former home and the prospect of a new beginning. This symbolism will ultimately provide her with the confidence to pass the examination and embrace a fresh start for the year. The quoted line, ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return,"" reinforces this theme of cyclical renewal; the melting snow and returning geese parallel her own desire to return to a state of comfort and familiarity. By concluding in this manner, the author leaves the character, and the reader, with a sense of hopeful determination for the future."
1457	10324	4	2	The hibiscus, as presented by the author, functions as a poignant symbol for the protagonist, a young girl disheartened by her recent test failure. This flower acts as a source of encouragement during a difficult time, demonstrating how a simple natural element can offer solace. The character, Saeng, resolves that upon overcoming her sadness, she will prove her capability by passing the test. Her struggle is compounded by the challenge of adapting to a new country, a process that logically requires significant capacity and cannot be instantaneous. Ultimately, the author's message is one of motivation, aimed at individuals facing personal struggles, emphasizing that life requires perseverance rather than surrender. In conclusion, the principles of hard work and a refusal to give up are fundamental to navigating life's inevitable failures.
1458	10325	4	2	"The narrative concludes with Saeng's internal vow: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending is effective because it shows her acceptance of the initial failure while simultaneously affirming her resolve to try again and achieve her objective. The statement is not merely a thought but a solemn promise she makes to herself, underscoring a commitment to persevere rather than abandon her goal. This final note reinforces the theme of resilience."
1459	10326	4	2	The author's choice to conclude the story with this specific paragraph is thematically coherent. Both the paragraph and the story's resolution share a common focus on cycles of departure and return, as well as seasonal change. The sentiment reflects a reluctance to let go, coupled with the assurance that what is gone will eventually come back. This parallel between the natural cycles described and the character's emotional journey is the reason the author selected this paragraph to bring the story to its close.
1460	10327	4	2	"The author instills a sense of hope in the concluding paragraph. Despite failing her driving test and struggling to adjust to a new environment, Saeng finds solace in a hibiscus plant. The tactile description of the flower, ""it felt smooth and cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel,"" indicates that the memory of an ""old friend"" could lift her spirits after disappointment. Saeng's discomfort in her new surroundings was evident, a fact her mother perceived upon her return home, noticing ""the tear stains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes."" Although her mother had invested in a single flower, she understood her daughter's difficult adjustment. After a narrative filled with negative sentiment, the sight of migrating geese and the act of planting her ""winter"" hibiscus allow Saeng to recognize that what was once strange has become familiar. She ultimately realizes that with a tangible connection to home, her goals are attainable and stability is possible elsewhere. This illustrates the notion that success can indeed emerge from failure."
1461	10328	4	2	The author concludes the narrative by establishing that Saeng requires a quiet, solitary space in which to undertake her examination, indicating that she does not wish to be disturbed during this process.
1462	10329	4	2	She explains that the present moment is not suitable for taking the test, stating she will postpone it until spring, when the flowers are in bloom. Her preoccupation with these exotic blossoms is significant; she finds the current timing unacceptable and has thus decided to wait for a more opportune moment to proceed.
1463	10330	4	2	Saeng has decided to take the test in the spring, preferring the warmer weather. The budding hibiscus, with its pleasant fragrance, serves as a poignant reminder of her native country. Furthermore, her preference for foods like fried melon, which leaves a golden aftertaste, over a Big Mac, underscores her enduring connection to her cultural roots and personal history.
1464	10331	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story with this particular paragraph is deliberate and serves multiple narrative and thematic purposes, which collectively provide a resonant and meaningful ending to the tale.
1465	10332	4	2	The author included the concluding paragraph to highlight the hibiscus as a symbol of comfort for Saeng during her period of adjustment. Having failed her initial test due to the discomfort of being in a new environment, the budding hibiscus in spring offers a sense of familiarity and solace, reminding her of her homeland. This connection is intended to foster the confidence and comfort she needs to succeed when she retakes the test.
1466	10333	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to reflect Saeng's earlier discussion about her failed test and her desire to retake it. Saeng resolves that she will attempt the test again the following year, coinciding with the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, thereby concluding her narrative arc with a determined outlook for the future.
1467	10334	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's resolve to try again for her test, aligning her next attempt with the natural cycle of the hibiscus regrowing. This plant holds significant meaning for her, and her motivation is fueled by a desire to avoid disappointing her mother again, as evidenced by her mother's incredulous reaction. Saeng's silent vow represents a personal promise to succeed while honoring both nature and her elders, concluding her internal conflict with a firm commitment.
1468	10335	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, when the snow melts, geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This ending functions as a cliffhanger. Having recently moved from Vietnam, Saeng is disheartened by her failed driving test and feels homesick. The purchase of a familiar hibiscus plant, which reminds her of home, lifts her spirits. The conclusion confirms Saeng's determination to try again but deliberately withholds the test's outcome, creating narrative suspense and providing a definitive reason for the author's chosen ending."
1469	10336	4	2	"Saeng has endured tragic familial loss and a relocation to an entirely different environment. The concluding paragraph symbolizes a new beginning and a fresh start. The imagery of ""snows melting"" and the ""hibiscus budding"" both represent renewal and new life. This signifies that Saeng is adopting a positive outlook, accepting her circumstances to make the best of them. The author's statement that ""the winter hibiscus was in the ground now"" parallels Saeng's newly planted perspective on life. A seed of hope has been planted within her, and like the flower, she is now prepared to blossom."
1470	10337	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author expresses deep sentimentality toward the hibiscus plant, as it serves as a powerful reminder of the protagonist's homeland. The concluding statement provides the character with a definitive goal. After an initial failure to secure a job, she associates the hibiscus with good fortune and consequently sets a specific time to reattempt her pursuit. The sight of the plant evoked happy memories from her past. Ultimately, certain objects can trigger memories, and it is the positive recollections that instill a sense of hopeful anticipation for the future."
1471	10338	4	2	The author's choice of conclusion serves two primary functions. Firstly, it illustrates the protagonist's growing affinity for her new life, as she finds previously strange elements becoming almost familiar. This is evidenced by her reflection on the geese and her vow to retake the test, alongside the newfound significance of the hibiscus she has planted. Secondly, the ending is deliberately open, inviting readers to infer a future success based on her determined vow, thereby allowing them to draw their own conclusions while emphasizing her emotional transition.
1472	10339	4	2	The author concludes with the protagonist's decision to retake the driving test, framing it as a chance for a new beginning. This fresh start is symbolically linked to the plant, which is poised to bring her good fortune once the snow melts and the geese return, marking a hopeful and positive turn after her discovery.
1473	10340	4	2	The author utilizes the concluding paragraph to signify the protagonist's resolve to try again. It establishes a parallel between her previous, unsuccessful attempt to cultivate a hibiscus and her forthcoming effort, suggesting that her success in passing the test in the spring is contingent upon this renewed determination, which is the core reason for the paragraph's placement.
1474	10341	4	2	The narrative concludes with the protagonist's resolution to retake the test in the spring. This decision provides her with a subsequent opportunity to achieve success and rectify her previous outcome, thereby concluding the story on a note of hopeful determination and the possibility of redemption.
1475	10342	4	2	She is going to take the test again because she feels compelled to do so. Her statement that she will do it when the snow melts and the geese return clearly indicates her intention to make another attempt in the spring.
1476	10343	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist Saeng makes a silent vow to retake her test in the spring, a time marked by the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of her hibiscus plant. It is suggested that her recollection of home, evoked by these natural elements, provides the comfort and resolve necessary for her to attempt the examination once more. The familiar symbols of geese and plants serve as a comforting link to her homeland, thereby strengthening her determination to succeed."
1477	10344	4	2	"Just as the hibiscus flower endures the winter, Saeng aspires to demonstrate similar resilience. Her failure on a test has left her feeling unsuccessful, yet she possesses a strong desire to persevere through her current difficulties. Her halting admission, ""I—I failed the test,"" reveals her profound disappointment, an emotion that is unexpected given her fighting spirit. The author concludes the passage with Saeng's declaration to retake the exam in the spring, thereby illustrating her determination to thrive under challenging conditions, much like the hardy winter hibiscus."
1478	10345	4	2	The author positions this paragraph at the story's conclusion to signify that Saeng has found a renewed sense of purpose. She now has a symbolic anchor, the cyclical blooming of the hibiscus, which will sustain her through the coming year. This ending shows her looking forward, patiently awaiting the next winter and the flower's return, a hope that extends to many future seasons, thus providing a sense of continuity and optimism.
1479	10346	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes in this manner to illustrate that Saeng's failure is not permanent. Her resolve to try again is symbolized by the anticipated return of the geese. Saeng's sadness stems from homesickness, which is alleviated when she encounters plants that trigger memories of her homeland. Her purchase of a winter hibiscus is an act of seeking comfort, as the plant serves as a tangible reminder of home and a source of solace."
1480	10347	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the character's deep connection to her garden. This conclusion is fitting as the narrative revolves around the characters and their relationship with the garden, which becomes dormant in the cold, leaving them in anticipation of spring. The line, ""in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" indicates a desire to overcome challenges, suggesting that retaking the test is a way to prove her capability and dedication to nurturing her garden."
1481	10348	4	2	At that moment, she resolved to retake the examination, reasoning that while flowers perpetually bloom and fade, the singular opportunity to achieve academic success would not return. Her preference, however, remained with gardening over scholastic endeavors.
1482	10349	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate how the winter hibiscus instilled a sense of hope in the protagonist and to highlight the mother's supportive response to the failed test. These two factors are the central reasons for the story's concluding focus.
1483	10350	4	2	The author concludes the narrative on a note of optimism, demonstrating how the winter hibiscus became a symbol of hope for Saeng after her failure. The plant's resilience helped her feel more connected to her new environment, as shown by her growing familiarity with the seasons. By having Saeng vow to retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus buds, the author provides inspiration for a new beginning, effectively using the flower to symbolize personal renewal and adaptation.
1484	10351	4	2	In Minfong Ho's story, the character Saeng struggles to adapt to a new country, feeling overwhelmed by her failure on a driver's test and the unfamiliar surroundings. Her discovery of the Winter Hibiscus, a plant reminiscent of her former life in Vietnam, provides crucial emotional support. This connection is why the author concludes the narrative with Saeng's vow to retake the test when the hibiscus buds; the flower symbolizes a comforting link to home that fuels her perseverance. Ultimately, Ho uses this ending to convey a theme of resilience, suggesting that overcoming hardship is possible by finding a personal source of strength.
1485	10352	4	2	The author returns to that paragraph to emphasize Saeng's determination to rectify her failure by retaking the test. This resolution underscores the story's central idea about the importance of perseverance and committing to complete necessary tasks, even when they are challenging. The narrative concludes by affirming the value of seeing one's commitments through to the end.
1486	10353	4	2	The author includes this story and paragraph to maintain focus on Saeng, whose state of mind is likened to a trapped butterfly that has finally burst free. This moment of release mirrors the opening of communication between Saeng and her mother, a dynamic to which many teenage girls, including the narrator, can personally relate.
1487	10354	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph serves to illustrate that Saeng has not surrendered. Her statement, ""When they come back...then I will take that test again,"" refers to the returning hibiscus and geese—symbols of her homeland. These familiar elements provide her with the fortitude to face the test once more. This demonstrates her resilience; despite her initial failure, she possesses the determination to try again, which is the fundamental purpose of the paragraph."
1488	10355	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to convey to the reader that once the winter snow has melted, the narrator intends to cultivate more plants. The mentioned test is a measure to ensure the survival of these plants during the subsequent winter season, highlighting a cycle of preparation and renewal.
1489	10356	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author illustrates how Saeng finds solace and happiness in the presence of the hibiscus plant, as it evokes cherished childhood memories. The text notes, ""And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar too,"" indicating the comfort she derives from it. The scent of a fallen leaf, for instance, vividly reminds her of her grandmother. Ho likely drew from personal experience or universal themes of immigration, crafting a narrative that resonates with individuals who have moved from their homeland and cling to objects that trigger nostalgia. This relatable human experience of sensory memory gives the story its emotional depth and widespread relevance."
1490	10357	4	2	The author likely ends with this paragraph to depict individuals who vow silence internally, perhaps due to an inability to express themselves or a deep-seated mistrust, even of their own feelings. This state is reminiscent of a personal experience where I withdrew, preferring solitude to contemplate profound questions about life and mortality. Eventually, I realized my youth and the promising future ahead, understanding that such heavy questions could be addressed later. This realization prompted me to re-engage with the world and end my silence.
1491	10358	4	2	The author concludes the narrative to convey the protagonist's resolute determination. The central message advocates for perseverance, urging one to endure hardship and then endeavor once more. Despite the difficulty of the examination, the character's resolve remains unbroken, and she will undoubtedly overcome this challenge.
1492	10359	4	2	The author discusses gardening and her aspiration to improve her skills in the spring. She likely feels inadequate at it because her mother is exceptionally skilled, and she desires to attain a similar level of proficiency in gardening.
1493	10360	4	2	The author's intent is to allow the reader to empathize with Saeng's profound connection to gardening. She eagerly anticipates the arrival of spring so she may try again, deriving satisfaction from observing plants develop into a viable food source. This emotional resonance is the reason the story concludes with this particular paragraph.
1494	10361	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to illustrate themes of determination and hope through symbolism. The geese and the hibiscus represent Saeng's tenacity, as they consistently return regardless of circumstances. Just as the geese will return, Saeng will retake the test. The hibiscus also symbolizes her journey; having been transplanted to new environments much like Saeng, it faces an impending harsh winter. Nevertheless, it invariably finds a way to return and bloom in spring, mirroring Saeng's hope to succeed on her driver's test upon her next attempt. The author thus employs this final passage to establish a symbolic connection between Saeng, the geese, and the hibiscus.
1495	10362	4	2	The author concludes with that paragraph to suggest that events unfold for a purpose, a purpose which may be understood through the cycle of the seasons. The character believes she would perform better on her test in the spring, based on the simple premise that everything flourishes during that time of year.
1496	10363	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate the protagonist's ability to overcome obstacles despite having relocated from her homeland. Furthermore, it illustrates her increased self-assurance, which is the rationale for the author's choice of this concluding segment.
1497	10364	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, a decision that reflects her response to recent life events. This resolution is underscored by the preceding detail of Saeng carefully picking up and smelling a fallen blossom, an act which symbolizes her nurturing care for the garden and her determination to sustain life even in winter. The final paragraph thus encapsulates her commitment to persevere and try again.
1498	10365	4	2	The author employs this paragraph as a conclusion because it effectively encapsulates the narrative's core themes. The imagery of the snow melting and the geese returning creates a cyclical structure, echoing the story's beginning which detailed Saeng's initial planting efforts. This deliberate framing provides the story with a cohesive and resonant ending.
1499	10366	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph for several reasons. Primarily, the test holds significant importance for Saeng as a means of personal validation. This ending also introduces a degree of suspense for the reader regarding her future success. Finally, the paragraph serves to highlight key aspects of Saeng's character, revealing her persistence, determination, and strong will.
1500	10367	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph, featuring Saeng's vow to retake the driving test in the spring, serves as an inspirational message to persevere despite failure. After failing her test, Saeng finds solace in a hibiscus that reminds her of Vietnam, an act symbolizing resilience. Her mother's understanding reinforces this theme. Ultimately, the author intends this final passage to convey a moral lesson about the importance of persistence and continual effort in achieving one's goals."
1501	10368	4	2	The author's deliberate choice of an open-ended conclusion serves to maintain reader intrigue. It is posited that this narrative decision functions as a pledge of the protagonist's return and her preparedness to face future challenges, including the test. By creating this ambiguity, the author ensures reader engagement with the character's subsequent journey. The vow was made privately to avoid the potential of disappointing others in the event of failure, which substantiates the rationale behind the story's concluding tone.
1502	10369	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to convey the protagonist's intention to return the following year.

This conclusion underscores her profound appreciation for nature, motivating her resolve to be present for its cyclical renewal and growth in the seasons to come.
1503	10370	4	2	"The author utilizes the final paragraph to underscore the profound sentimental value the hibiscus holds for Saeng. Her resolve to retake the test is linked to the seasonal shift, aligning with the plant's inability to thrive in cold conditions and the necessity for a winter-hardy variety. The mention of it being ""Not like the kind we had before"" highlights the significance of finding a hibiscus reminiscent of her homeland. This progression from personal disappointment to a display of courage and determination in the final lines completes her character arc."
1504	10371	4	2	"The author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, a narrative choice that generates questions for the reader, reminiscent of modernist techniques where meaning is derived from inquiry rather than a stated moral. This approach creates a twist, leaving the nature of the ""test"" ambiguous—whether it is social, academic, or personal—and fosters a desire for further narrative, potentially encouraging the reader to revisit the text to uncover deeper layers of meaning."
1505	10372	4	2	"""The Winter Hibiscus"" is a story imbued with melancholy yet hope, heavily reliant on symbolism. The author crafts a concluding paragraph that provides a satisfying resolution by establishing a hopeful tone and connecting symbolic elements to the theme of spring.

1509	10376	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to express the protagonist's commitment to renewal. The statement signifies that with the return of spring, the melting snow, the geese, and the budding hibiscus, she will resume her gardening activities, thus framing the conclusion around the theme of cyclical regeneration.
1510	10377	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's resolution to ""take the test again"" in the spring, establishing a mood of acceptance toward change. This mirrors how nature adapts to new climates and locations; Saeng learns to appreciate her own circumstances and decides to frame them positively. Through the protagonist's journey, the author effectively champions the idea of perseverance in the face of difficulty."
1511	10378	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph is likely motivated by several factors. One reason is to illustrate the protagonist's resolve to attempt the endeavor once more. A second reason may be to convey her desire to earn her mother's approval. A third consideration is the expression of her profound personal disappointment. Ultimately, the paragraph serves to communicate the story's central theme: perseverance following failure is essential, as it often leads to significantly improved outcomes.
1512	10379	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring to underscore the theme of enduring hope. Saeng's initial sadness stems from her poignant memories of Vietnam, and the pain of being distanced from her homeland and its familiarity. However, the narrative introduces elements suggesting her growing acceptance of her new environment, as seen when the honking of Canada geese becomes familiar. The hibiscus symbolizes the preservation of her Laotian culture and memories, while the geese represent her increasing acclimatization. By integrating these symbols, the author demonstrates how Saeng, by holding onto her heritage while embracing her new surroundings, finds the resilience to pursue success, which is the fundamental reason for this concluding paragraph."
1513	10380	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a paragraph that, while seemingly straightforward, serves a profound purpose. The final sentence, in which Saeng vows to retake her test in the spring, directly incorporates elements from the story's title. This technique effectively ties the narrative's conclusion back to its central motifs, thereby providing a cohesive ending that resonates with the overall themes and character development, ultimately unifying the entire story."
1514	10381	4	2	The author selects this concluding paragraph to highlight the narrator's renewed readiness. After failing her initial attempt, the narrator seeks solace by purchasing a flower. A subsequent conversation with her mother provides comfort and perspective. This interaction, coupled with the symbolism of the resilient flower, fosters a sense of determination within her, solidifying her resolve to pass the driving test on her next try.
1515	10382	4	2	The author employs this concluding paragraph for its potent symbolism regarding Saeng's transformation. The melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus all represent inevitable seasonal change, mirroring Saeng's decision to try again. However, she will be a changed individual. Having gained a deeper appreciation for her Laotian heritage through the hibiscus and her memories, she understands that while external circumstances evolve, core essences remain. It is with this insight that Saeng decides to move forward, changed yet rooted.
1516	10383	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph, in which Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, serves to demonstrate her resolve and preparedness for a future success. This final segment indicates that Saeng possesses the determination to try again, confident that she will ultimately pass. The author selected this conclusion to provide narrative closure, affirming Saeng's faith in her own abilities and her desire to ultimately make her mother proud by succeeding, which is the fundamental reason for its placement at the story's end.
1517	10384	4	2	The author likely chose to conclude with this paragraph because the spring season offers a more favorable and pleasant environment, in addition to providing Saeng the entire winter to adequately prepare. Furthermore, the conclusion thematically aligns with Saeng's newfound understanding, as she directly connects her personal resolve to the natural cycle of the geese's return.
1518	10385	4	2	The author concludes the story with that specific paragraph because it represents a solemn vow that the character made to herself, solidifying her personal commitment and marking a pivotal moment of internal resolution that provides a definitive end to her character's arc.
1519	10386	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph, featuring Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, serves to illustrate how the hibiscus and other plants function as symbols for Saeng's own experience. Upon entering the plant store, Saeng is overwhelmed by memories of Vietnam, with the vegetation triggering a reconnection to her childhood. Her observation that a plant, which grew wild at home, is now confined to a pot symbolizes her own feeling of being out of place and constrained in her new environment. The hibiscus, which her mother describes as strong enough to survive the cold, becomes a direct metaphor for Saeng's resilience. She identifies with the plant, deciding that once it has endured the harsh season and begun to bud, she too will have grown through her difficulties and be ready to achieve her goals."
1520	10387	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, paralleling the hibiscus's cycle. Saeng draws strength from the plant's ability to endure difficult conditions and adapt, believing she can do the same. She realizes that moving to the United States is a significant change, but that she possesses the fortitude to survive within it. Failing her driver's test does not signify an overall incapacity; rather, it presents an opportunity to try again with a renewed perspective, much like the hibiscus which awaits a fresh start in the spring.
1521	10388	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng has not surrendered. Earlier in the narrative, Saeng visits a greenhouse and is moved to tears. Upon returning home, she confesses to her mother, ""I-I failed the test."" Despite this setback, Saeng's desire to return and attempt the test again reveals her persistent spirit, which is the central reason for the author's chosen ending."
1522	10389	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to illustrate the themes of determination and adaptation in Saeng and her family. Initially, Saeng feels bitter about her test failure. However, upon discovering a flower that reminds her of her homeland, she achieves acceptance. Just as the flower will eventually bud, she resolves to become a new person and ultimately pass her test. Her resolve is further evidenced by her efforts to make friends and her resilience when her offered food is rejected. Her emotional breakdown occurs upon finding the flower, but by the time she arrives home, she has fully embraced the change, concluding her journey toward acceptance.
1523	10390	4	2	The author includes the final paragraph to convey that Saeng will not give up and is prepared to try again. It is plausible that Saeng purchased the flower because it was native to her homeland, providing her with a sense of comfort and a connection to her past. This is supported by the instance where she begins to cry, overwhelmed by her longing for home.
1524	10391	4	2	The author likely concludes with this paragraph to suggest that, like the returning flowers, future opportunities will be improved. This implies that the next test Saeng encounters will be more favorable, reflecting an optimistic outlook for her continued efforts.
1525	10392	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to extend the theme of adapting to life's changes. Saeng, having immigrated from Vietnam to the United States, faces significant adjustment, a process mirrored by the plants in the story. The hibiscus reminds her of Vietnam, yet it is distinct; as her mother notes, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus."" This resilience directly correlates to the theme. The final paragraph, with its imagery of melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, employs natural changes to reinforce this connection, thereby deepening the story's message. Furthermore, the hopeful tone provides the reader with a positive feeling, which accentuates the overarching theme."
1526	10393	4	2	The narrative details her failure on the examination and her subsequent declaration to make another attempt the following year, coinciding with the return of the geese.
1527	10394	4	2	In my view, his intended message is that the seasons are cyclical and that the winter period will inevitably recur, which constitutes the central challenge.
1528	10395	4	2	The author concludes the story by drawing parallels between the protagonist, Saeng, and the natural symbols of the geese and hibiscus. Both the geese, which migrate to survive winter, and the hibiscus, which must endure the cold, embody the theme of adapting to a new and challenging environment. Saeng's need to overcome her own test mirrors the hibiscus's struggle against the winter, suggesting that if the plant can survive its ordeal, she too can find the strength to eventually conquer her challenges.
1529	10396	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" includes the protagonist's resolution to retake the test in the spring to illustrate her capacity for adaptation while maintaining ties to her heritage. This is evidenced by her culinary preferences, as she admits to preferring traditional foods over a Big Mac, demonstrating her ability to integrate aspects of her old culture into her new life. Ultimately, the excerpt conveys the character's successful synthesis of both cultures to achieve personal contentment."
1530	10397	4	2	The author likely concludes with this paragraph to signify Saeng's anticipation of a new beginning with the arrival of spring. The melting snow symbolizes the dissolution of past hardships, while the returning geese and budding hibiscus represent renewal and readiness for a fresh start. This ending illustrates Saeng's strategy of using the interim to prepare for her next driving test, moving beyond her initial failure. The paragraph serves to show her proactive approach to problem-solving, and its interpretation points toward the new beginning she is determined to embrace in the coming year.
1531	10398	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring, a statement which signifies her commitment to being prepared for the challenges that will return with the new season.
1532	10399	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" featuring Saeng's vow to retake the test, serves to underscore the story's central themes. One prominent theme is perseverance, illustrated by the hibiscus enduring the winter and inspiring Saeng to persist. Another is overcoming adversity, as the flower blossoms despite dangers, mirroring Saeng's determination to pass her test and conquer her own obstacles. Thus, the ending effectively reinforces these thematic elements."
1533	10400	4	2	The author selected this conclusion to provide the story with a distinct and memorable ending. By having Saeng resolve to try again when the plants and geese return, the narrative gains a focused and hopeful resolution, avoiding a meandering finish. This choice centers the ending on Saeng's personal growth and future determination, providing a satisfying conclusion for the reader.
1534	10401	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner because the girl views the plant as a symbol of strength and faith. Her decision to retake the test when the plant returns the following year demonstrates her genuine affection for it and her hope that it will bring her the luck she previously lacked.
1535	10402	4	2	"The author likely ended the story with that phrase to emphasize the protagonist's refusal to surrender, highlighting her resilience in the face of difficulty. This is evident as the girl, after initially stating ""I failed the test,"" resolves to try again, demonstrating she will not accept permanent failure. Furthermore, this concluding paragraph introduces an element of suspense, leaving the reader to ponder whether she will ultimately succeed in passing the examination."
1536	10403	4	2	The author suggests that the protagonist was not prepared, either mentally or physically, for a previous test. The resolution posits that the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus signify a future point when she will be ready to undertake the test again, indicating a belief in cyclical renewal and personal readiness.
1537	10404	4	2	The author's selection of the concluding paragraph is deliberate, as the elements within it hold significant symbolic value. The budding hibiscus represents the capacity to overcome obstacles, while the returning geese signify new beginnings and opportunities. By concluding with these symbols, the author reinforces the narrative's themes of resilience and the chance for redemption, as the character resolves to retake the test with renewed hope. The paragraph's function is to provide a symbolic resolution that underscores the character's development.
1538	10405	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate a contrast in the character's experience. During the cold, silent winter, she is isolated with her thoughts. However, the melting snow and arrival of spring symbolize a shift, prompting her to become more active and engaged in enjoyable pursuits, thus concluding the story on a note of seasonal and personal transition.
1539	10406	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight the cyclical nature of experience. The protagonist, Saeng, resolves to retake the test upon the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding, events that mark the recurring spring. This is reinforced by her reflection on how once-strange things have become familiar through the quiet repetition of the seasons, suggesting that the geese remind her of a past, similar experience and that time brings readiness for new attempts.
1540	10407	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to emphasize that defeat is not permanent and that new opportunities arise with time. The hibiscus, a plant significant to the narrator and her mother, symbolizes this renewal; its recovery and budding represent a living testament to resilience. By linking the test to the plant's revival, the paragraph frames the character's resolve as part of a natural cycle, where life continually offers fresh beginnings to achieve what was previously missed, thus underscoring the story's thematic focus on cyclical renewal.
1541	10408	4	2	She eagerly anticipates the arrival of spring, when the snow melts and the weather warms, allowing the flowers to grow. It is at this time, when the geese return and the flowers bloom, that she plans to retake the test she previously failed.
1542	10409	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph illustrates that Saeng, akin to the migrating geese and the perennial hibiscus, embodies resilience and the capacity for renewal. Having experienced depression after failing her driving test in a new country, Saeng finds the hibiscus evokes both painful memories and profound comfort. After planting it with her mother, she observes the geese and realizes that through the cyclical repetition of the seasons, the once-strange has become familiar. This parallel signifies her understanding that, just as the geese will return and the hibiscus will bloom again, she too will retake her test with renewed hope, which is the central meaning of the final paragraph in ""The Winter Hibiscus."""
1543	10410	4	2	The author concludes the story to underscore Saeng's persistent determination. This quality is metaphorically linked to the hibiscus plant she acquires. While the plant grew wild in her homeland, she finds it confined to a pot in the United States, a condition that mirrors her own experience of feeling constrained and out of place in a new environment. This parallel highlights the theme of adaptation within limitation.
1544	10411	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's resolution to retake the test, a decision that synthesizes the story's central theme and key events. The narrative explores adapting to a new environment by discovering its beauty and connections to one's past. Saeng reflects that the strange has become familiar through seasonal repetition, and plants in a greenhouse trigger memories of Vietnam. Her struggle to adjust is met with a determination to overcome difficulties, mirroring her adaptation to the new location. The conclusion, by referencing the geese, the hibiscus, and the test, demonstrates Saeng's ongoing adjustment and foreshadows her future success in assimilating into a new lifestyle, affirming her ability to conquer new challenges.
1545	10412	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify an ending that heralds a new beginning, effectively utilizing seasonal symbolism. Winter represents the current state of hardship, where Saeng fails her test, while the impending spring promises renewal. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus are concrete signs of this seasonal shift, paralleling the new life and opportunity Saeng will have to pass her test. Thus, the coming spring will provide a fresh start for all, embodying the theme of cyclical regeneration.
1546	10413	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph because it functions as a concise summary, encapsulating the narrative's core themes and events in a condensed form.
1547	10414	4	2	This concluding paragraph serves as an effective resolution for the narrative, as it directly connects to the protagonist's driving test. The narrator's declaration that she will attempt the test again in the spring provides a sense of forward-looking hope.
1548	10415	4	2	I believe the author chose this paragraph to conclude the story because it encapsulates the entire narrative's essence, which is the symbolic growth and life cycle of a flower, thereby explaining the final outcome after chronicling its development.
1549	10416	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with a paragraph that, while seemingly incomplete, provides a resonant thematic closure. The protagonist, Saeng, vows to retake her driving test in the spring. As she holds the potted plant, its leaves quivering in the wind, she shares a moment of perceived vulnerability with it. Her mother's reassurance and approval of Saeng's choice facilitate her personal growth. The mother's observation that the plant is ""root-bound"" metaphorically reflects Saeng's own clinging connection to her homeland. The mother's subsequent confidence that the plant will survive and thrive in spring parallels the anticipated resilience and strength of Saeng herself, justifying the author's chosen endpoint."
1550	10417	4	2	The author concludes the narrative by illustrating the girl's symbolic connection to the winter hibiscus, which represents her link to her homeland, and the geese. Her declaration to retake the driving test when the plant buds and shows bravery mirrors her own intended personal growth. Similarly, the geese flying south symbolize her journey, as she will attempt the test upon their return, signifying the completion of her own developmental passage.
1551	10418	4	2	The author crafted the concluding paragraph with specific intentions, primarily to conclude the narrative on an uplifting note. The story is permeated by a melancholic and nostalgic tone that evokes a longing for the past. The author emphasizes the importance of resilience, even when one may not be content with their present circumstances. Furthermore, the conclusion serves to highlight the fortitude of the protagonist, Saeng. Despite failing a test in an unfamiliar environment, she resolves to persevere, a decision that adds complexity and dynamism to her character. This story is particularly resonant for individuals experiencing homesickness, offering a narrative of encouragement to move forward.
1552	10420	4	2	The author's concluding statement functions as a metaphor for the protagonist's need for time. She requires a period of adjustment to her new surroundings, much like a hibiscus plant needs time to establish its roots in fresh soil. Her encounter with the hibiscus at the orchard triggers memories of her former home, eliciting a complex emotional response where sorrow is intertwined with a sense of comfort.
1553	10421	4	2	The author concludes the passage to illustrate the theme of patience. Saeng resolves to wait for spring, anticipating that the season may evoke feelings reminiscent of her hometown. She holds a preference for spring over winter, symbolized by the return of the geese, which depart during the colder months. This cyclical return of life and warmth is the central reason for the author's chosen conclusion.
1554	10422	4	2	"The concluding vow, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” reflects the author's own experience of displacement. Having relocated to an unfamiliar country, the protagonist is surrounded by a new and unknown environment. This ending suggests a persistent hope for adaptation. Leaving her home meant abandoning not just a physical structure, but also loved ones and a wealth of memories, leading to feelings of being out of place. The sight of the hibiscus, an exotic plant, initially transports her back to her homeland, causing her to emotionally falter and ""fail her test."" However, her final resolution demonstrates a determined willingness to survive and ultimately pass the test of adapting to her new world."
1555	10423	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring to signify her hope for success, both to fulfill her own potential and to bring happiness and support to her mother. The choice of spring is significant as it represents nature's rebirth, a time when Saeng intends to approach the test with a mind that is clear and renewed. This symbolic alignment with a season of new beginnings is the foundational reason for the paragraph's placement at the story's conclusion.
1556	10424	4	2	"The author employs the concluding paragraph for several significant reasons, primarily to provide narrative closure. Throughout the story, Saeng grapples with the emotional weight of her past. Her return home with the hibiscus and her admission, ""I-I failed the test,"" signifies her initial inability to overcome the loss of her grandmother and homeland. The concluding paragraph, however, introduces a note of resilience as Saeng resolves to ""take that test again"" with the return of spring. Thus, the author utilizes this final passage to resolve the emotional obstacles Saeng confronts, concluding her journey with a sense of hope and determination."
1557	10425	4	2	"The author concludes with this paragraph to imbue the story with a sense of hope. Having moved to the United States, Saeng experiences profound homesickness, a feeling exacerbated by her failure of the driver's test. Her inability to speak of it at home, fearing she would ""burst into tears again,"" underscores her emotional fragility. The final paragraph, which looks forward to spring, serves to illustrate her resolve to begin anew and rebuild her life in her new environment, offering a forward-looking and optimistic conclusion."
1558	10426	4	2	The author selected this paragraph to conclude the story because it conveys Saeng's resolution to attempt the test once more when circumstances are more favorable. It communicates to the reader that she is not surrendering permanently but is instead waiting for an opportune moment, when conditions improve, to make another attempt. This deliberate choice for the story's ending effectively underscores the character's enduring perseverance and her commitment to future success.
1559	10427	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist visits a greenhouse where a specific plant, a winter hibiscus, captivates her. This flower evokes powerful memories of her homeland and her grandmother, whose long, silky gray hair she would help knot into a bun, often adorned with a hibiscus bud. The author concludes with the paragraph that states, ""then I will take the test again"" to directly counter Saeng's earlier, despondent declaration, ""I-I failed the test."" This structural contrast pivots the narrative from a moment of defeat to one of future resolve and potential renewal."
1560	10428	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng fails her driver's test, lamenting, ""I-I failed the test."" She purchases a hibiscus plant, which reminds her of her home and the flowers she had there. At the end, she declares she will retake the test when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus buds. This suggests she requires time to process her thoughts and memories, perhaps to create a garden. The hibiscus serves as a parallel to Saeng herself; both have encountered a setback—Saeng with her test and the hibiscus confined to a pot—but both possess the potential for change and new growth."
1561	10429	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph conveys Saeng's newfound determination and motivation, which she discovers through purchasing a familiar plant. Despite failing her test, encountering a plant reminiscent of her home and grandmother instills in her the resolve to attempt the test once more, demonstrating her commitment to improving her life in a new country. The author includes details about geese to symbolize progression and resilience; just as the geese depart and return, Saeng too will persevere after her initial failure. The narrative notes that many elements once perceived as strange have become familiar, including the geese, indicating her gradual adaptation to her new environment. The intense, visceral recognition she experiences upon finding the hibiscus provides profound comfort, making her new surroundings feel more like home. Thus, the story's conclusion effectively illustrates Saeng's adaptive process and her constructive approach to overcoming a challenging situation."
1562	10430	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test ""when they come back... in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" This final statement signifies that Saeng aligns her personal renewal with the cyclical renewal of nature. She is asserting that the return of the geese, the melting snow, and the budding hibiscus all symbolize a new beginning. Therefore, her decision to take the test again coincides with this fresh start, marking her own resolve to begin anew with the coming spring."
1563	10431	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story by focusing on Saeng's reaction to failing her driving test. After her failure, Saeng is moved to tears upon encountering a flower that evokes memories of her past. Her subsequent purchase of dok malik seeds signifies hope and future potential. The story ends this way to emphasize that Saeng's resolve is tied to the next season, suggesting a period of growth and a new opportunity to try again, mirroring the natural cycle of renewal."
1564	10432	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's determination. Her declaration that she will take the test again clearly demonstrates her resolve. Even though Saeng failed her driver's test, she has decided not to give up, showing a resilient and persistent character.
1565	10433	4	2	The author employed that particular sentence to evoke the imagery of spring's arrival, a time of transition marked by melting snow and returning geese. The sentence further connects this natural rebirth to the budding flowers, symbolizing new beginnings. This confluence of seasonal elements is the foundational reason for the author's stylistic choice in the concluding line.
1566	10434	4	2	"The story's conclusion is effectively conveyed through Saeng's dialogue. Her statement, ""When they come back,"" refers to the flowers returning to life. The subsequent phrases, ""In the spring"" and ""When the snows melt and the geese return,"" specify the seasonal timing of this renewal. Observing that ""this Hibiscus is budding,"" she notes the specific sign of the flowers blooming again. Her declaration, ""Then I will take the test again,"" directly links this period of rebirth to her personal goal of retaking the test. This establishes that Saeng will use the winter to prepare, counting down until spring when she can study, pass her test, and ultimately work at the flower shop, which becomes her definitive objective for the coming months."
1567	10435	4	2	The author chose this conclusion to align Saeng's personal resolve with the seasonal cycle of spring, a time of blossoming. During winter, with its snow, her focus wanes, but the budding of the hibiscus signals the point at which she will be mentally prepared to retake her test. The author likely employed this symbolism because the natural world's renewal holds a significant and motivating meaning for the character.
1568	10436	4	2	"The story's conclusion effectively instills a sense of hope for the future. Despite her initial distress over failing the test, the protagonist, Saeng, demonstrates resilience. The action of her lifting her head symbolizes a refusal to quit and a commitment to persevere until she succeeds. Her statement, ""when the snow melts and the geese return,"" creates a parallel between her own journey and the arduous migration of the geese, suggesting a shared determination. Furthermore, her mention of the ""hibiscus budding"" indicates she will attempt the test when nature is at its peak, correlating with her own potential for peak confidence. Ultimately, the author concludes on this note to affirm that hope persists and that Saeng, though upset, is undoubtedly preparing to pass the test in the spring."
1569	10437	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story with this particular paragraph serves several distinct narrative purposes, which collectively provide a resonant and meaningful ending to the character's journey.
1570	10438	4	2	Saeng is convinced that a considerable amount of time will pass before she needs to concern herself with schoolwork again. This belief is the primary reason the author chooses to conclude the narrative with this particular paragraph, as it encapsulates her current state of mind and her anticipated timeline.
1571	10439	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to underscore the protagonist's lack of total dissatisfaction with departing from her homeland. This deliberate structural choice serves to illuminate the potential for her to cultivate an affection for her new environment, thereby concluding on a note of optimism.
1572	10440	4	2	The author concludes with this sentence to signify that Saeng requires a period of respite before she reattempts the examination. The significance lies in her act of comparing two disparate entities—flowers and a test—which is the very reason the narrative concludes on this particular note.
1573	10441	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate a parallel between the girl and the hibiscus plant. The narrative suggests that the girl, upon the flower's next bloom, will be prepared to retake and successfully pass her test. This inclusion of the hibiscus serves as a metaphor for the girl's resilience and determination, symbolizing that her own personal blossoming will coincide with that of the plant, culminating in her eventual success.
1574	10442	4	2	I believe the author chose to conclude the story with that sentence because Saeng finds solace in the spring season and feels she can focus more effectively when near a flower she personally connects to her own life experiences.
1575	10443	4	2	"The author concludes the story in this manner to reinforce the central theme of perseverance. This theme is exemplified by the ""winter hibiscus"" and the protagonist's determined pledge to pass the test, which justifies the author's chosen ending."
1576	10444	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph mirrors the story's opening, establishing a cyclical structure. The narrative commences with Saeng failing her driver's test and encountering a familiar plant. The central portion details her struggles to adapt to a new environment. The conclusion, therefore, returns to the test, with Saeng resolving to retake it upon the budding of flowers and the return of geese. These natural elements, which evoke memories of her homeland, provide her with the comfort and fortitude necessary to overcome her challenges.
1577	10445	4	2	Authors employ various literary techniques to enhance their narratives, which would otherwise seem bland and unengaging. In this instance, author Minfong Ho conveys Saeng's intent to retake her driving test not by a simple declaration, but by having her make a vow upon the geese. This method of concluding the story powerfully illustrates the depth of her determination regarding the test.
1578	10446	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to forge a symbolic connection between the hibiscus and Saeng's personal trials and triumphs. Just as Saeng must persevere and retake her test, the winter hibiscus endures the harsh season to re-emerge. The hibiscus functions as a symbol of hope for Saeng, offering comfort through its association with her homeland. This inclusion resonates universally, as many individuals find hope in symbolic objects. For Saeng, the hibiscus's annual return under difficult conditions provides reassurance that she, too, will ultimately thrive in her new surroundings.
1579	10447	4	2	The author concludes with that paragraph to signify a new beginning, paralleling the return of the geese and the blooming hibiscus with Saeng's decision to retake her test. Initially, Saeng was despondent over leaving her native country and grandmother, experiencing a profound sense of loss. Her final statement demonstrates that she has found solace and self-assurance through the hibiscus. Memories of her past have guided her forward, providing the confidence she needs to attempt the driver's test again.
1580	10448	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate how Saeng draws comfort from the natural world. The narrative centers on her finding solace in plants, and she chooses to wait for the season to change and the geese to return before retaking her test. This delay suggests she wishes to feel more at ease within her environment, thereby clearing her mind to perform her best when the time comes.
1581	10449	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resolve to retake the test, contingent upon the return of positive natural symbols like the budding plant and the geese. This is substantiated by Saeng's own statement: ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This declaration signifies her maturity and emotional well-being, as she chooses to undertake a difficult and potentially unpleasant task only when her environment reflects happiness and renewal. Her initial arrival was marked by sadness, but with the cyclical return of the geese and the plant, she seeks to participate in this renewal, fostering a collective sense of joy for all."
1582	10450	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the conclusion features the protagonist, Saeng, vowing to retake her failed driver's test upon the spring return of geese and the budding of a winter hibiscus. The author employs significant imagery and symbolism; the hibiscus discovered in a floral shop symbolizes Saeng's connection to her homeland, while the bitter melon, which she loves but others find unpalatable, represents her struggle to assimilate. For Saeng, the budding flower and migrating geese are not merely seasonal events but symbols of new beginnings, representing her renewed opportunity to pass the test and better adapt to her new life."
1583	10451	4	2	The author uses the concluding paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's perseverance and the fortifying power of nature. Saeng's decision to retake the test she previously failed is direct evidence of her resilient character. Furthermore, her timing—waiting for the geese to return, the hibiscus to bud, and the snow to melt—shows that nature provides her with strength and confidence. These natural elements empower her because they evoke memories of her former home and her grandmother. Ultimately, the paragraph serves to affirm that Saeng possesses a determined spirit and draws profound inner strength from the natural world.
1584	10452	4	2	"The protagonist, Saeng, grapples with both internal and external conflicts, having failed her driver's test and still longing for Vietnam. The story's conclusion is an excellent choice, as it utilizes potent symbols to represent her transformation. The flock of Canadian geese mirrors her own journey; initially, she felt awkward and out of place, but she comes to realize her life holds promise. Similarly, the planting of the ""winter hibiscus"" signifies her intent to begin anew and pursue happiness, effectively ""planting a new seed."" This ending successfully foreshadows a positive future for Saeng, greatly contributing to the story's inspiring effect."
1585	10453	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to highlight how Saeng draws a parallel between the hibiscus's resilience and her own capacity to overcome challenges. Saeng identifies with the plant; if the hibiscus can adapt to its environment, then she can as well. Its survival through the winter signifies that she, too, can persevere and will therefore retake the test she initially failed. This connection is reinforced by her observation of the geese, which were once strange but have now become familiar. Seeing them fly in a V formation, adapting by migrating to a warmer climate, serves as a final affirmation that she is also capable of adaptation.
1586	10454	4	2	The author concludes the story with that sentence to convey her anticipation for the return of spring, a season that will allow her to resume planting and to observe the subsequent blooming and revitalization of her garden.
1587	10455	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's resilient character. After failing her driver's test, Saeng discovers a hibiscus, a flower that evokes memories of her homeland. This discovery leads her to a greenhouse where she purchases the plant, and upon returning home, she plants it. This hibiscus becomes a symbol of her perseverance, and its budding signifies her renewed determination to retake the test.
1588	10456	4	2	"The author selected this concluding paragraph to signify the moment when conditions become ideal for Saeng to rectify her earlier failure. Her emotional outburst, ""I-I failed the test!"" indicates her disappointment in a skill she believed she possessed. By stating, ""Here let me help mother,"" and taking the shovel, Saeng commits to improving her gardening abilities. This dedication to honing her skills demonstrates her resolve to pass the test on her next attempt and to validate her self-worth as a competent gardener like her mother."
1589	10457	4	2	The author utilizes the final paragraph to create a sense of narrative anticipation, compelling the reader to wonder about the outcome of Saeng's next test. Having previously failed, her personal growth and increased self-assurance now fuel her determination to retake it, as she believes she is more capable than before.
1590	10458	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph because its elements are deeply interconnected with the story's central themes. It effectively illustrates how Saeng learns to adapt to her new environment, a process mirrored by the plant's own struggle and eventual acclimation to its surroundings. This parallel underscores the story's message of resilience and integration.
1591	10459	4	2	The author likely concluded the narrative with this paragraph to ensure thematic consistency and provide the reader with a definitive illustration of the text's central message, thereby fostering a clear and comprehensive understanding of the work in its entirety.
1592	10460	4	2	The story is paired with the paragraph because they share a common theme, specifically illustrating the positive dynamic between the mother and daughter and their ability to collaborate. This connection is further emphasized by their shared plan to travel to Canada together, which is detailed within the narrative itself.
1593	10461	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the narrative with this paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's regained fortitude and self-assurance. Her declaration to retake the test in the spring signifies both her confidence and her anticipation of a new beginning. This concluding segment is pivotal, as it follows a period where Saeng's failure had diminished her self-esteem; the understanding she received from her mother subsequently empowered her to persevere until she ultimately succeeds.
1594	10462	4	2	It is probable that she will retake the test in the spring with the determination to pass. Although she wished to avoid displaying her distress in front of her mother, she is resolved to redeem herself by ultimately passing the examination.
1595	10463	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate the protagonist's resilience; though she faced a setback, she is prepared to rise and attempt the test once more. This resolution effectively underscores her unwavering determination to pass and her refusal to surrender, thereby providing a fitting and impactful end to the narrative.
1596	10464	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate the protagonist's resilient determination, demonstrating that she will not surrender but will instead act when she feels personally prepared. This interpretation is supported by her decision to undertake the test on her own terms, at a moment of self-assured comfort. These factors substantiate the reasoning behind the author's choice of this concluding paragraph.
1597	10465	4	2	"The author concludes the story in this manner to exemplify the theme of perseverance. Saeng's reflection on the ""quiet repetition of season upon season"" signifies her gradual adaptation to change. Her declaration that she will retake the test when the snow melts and the hibiscus buds aligns with the cyclical return inherent in nature, symbolizing her own promised return to the challenge. This final paragraph thus serves to affirm that perseverance, given time, leads to eventual success."
1598	10466	4	2	"This concluding statement reveals the author's perspective on the story's central theme: the imperative to try again after failure. The protagonist, having failed her tasks, resolves to reattempt them with the return of spring and the blooming hibiscus. This resolution underscores the principle of never giving up, a sentiment contrasted with the initial despair evident in her saddened admission of failing the test. Ultimately, the paragraph encapsulates the author's concluding message about resilience in ""Winter Hibiscus."""
1599	10467	4	2	"The author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake her test in the spring, paralleling the hibiscus's resilience, which her mother noted was ""strong enough to make it through."" This symbolizes Saeng's own determination to succeed. The mention of geese, whose call now sounds familiar, signifies her growing adaptation to her new environment. By integrating the hibiscus, representing her homeland, with the geese, symbolizing her new home, the conclusion shows Saeng accepting her new life without letting her past hinder her future progress, promising her own return."
1600	10468	4	2	The author included this paragraph to convey a specific message to the reader. The intended meaning is that if a plant can endure a harsh winter and survive, then the protagonist can similarly persevere and pass her driving test. This symbolic parallel is the fundamental reason for the paragraph's inclusion in the story's conclusion.
1601	10469	4	2	The author concludes the narrative in this manner to reflect the protagonist's appreciation for the geese, her affection for the spring season, and her determined aspiration to take and pass the examination for which she is currently preparing.
1602	10470	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph suggests that Saeng's possession of the hibiscus, a plant imbued with unique qualities and memories of her former home prior to moving to @ORGANIZATION1, will be instrumental in her passing the test, especially given her initial sense of displacement and uncertainty.
1603	10471	4	2	The author demonstrates creativity by concluding with the hibiscus's burgeoning growth and Saeng's resolve to retake the test, believing she will perform better after the snow melts. This ending is apt because the comfort derived from the hibiscus helps Saeng overcome the distress of her initial failure, providing a necessary resolution following the story's climactic test failure.
1604	10472	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way because the test served as the central focus of the narrative.
1605	10473	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the conclusion depicts the narrator's resolve to pass the driver's test she previously failed, vowing silently to succeed. This serves as a crucial final message, illustrating the protagonist's determination to overcome future obstacles. While the story primarily explores the narrator's sadness and longing for her Vietnamese homeland, including her grandmother and its flora, which she recalls after purchasing a hibiscus, and her initial struggles in @LOCATION2, the ending provides a contrasting note of hope and resilience for her future."
1606	10474	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate the protagonist's significant personal development. Saeng has realized that if a delicate organism such as the hibiscus can endure harsh conditions, she possesses a similar capacity for resilience. The natural world's struggle for existence mirrors her own challenges in an unfamiliar environment. She comprehends that adaptation to one's surroundings occurs progressively, eventually leading to a sense of belonging. This principle of adaptation, evident in both botanical and human contexts, is central to the narrative. Consequently, the author would affirm that the story's denouement effectively portrays Saeng's biological and psychological maturation.
1607	10475	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng, newly arrived in America, grapples with homesickness. Her discovery of a hibiscus in a shop provides a tangible link to her former life in Vietnam. After purchasing the plant and nurturing it in her yard, she resolves to retake her driver's test when the hibiscus buds in spring. This narrative choice creates a powerful parallel between Saeng and the flower. Just as the hibiscus must survive a cold winter, Saeng must endure her difficult transition. Passing the test will symbolize her ability to overcome adversity. The overarching theme suggests that time facilitates improvement; Saeng will adapt to America, the hibiscus will bloom, and she will ultimately succeed."
1608	10476	4	2	The story concludes as it does to underscore the protagonist's unwavering determination. She has resolved not to surrender but to persist in her efforts to pass the examination. This perseverance will lead to a more hopeful outlook and eventual success on the test. Achieving this goal will also prevent her from disappointing her mother, finally allowing her to lift this particular burden from her shoulders and move forward with her life.
1609	10477	4	2	The author employs the final paragraph to help the reader envision a new beginning for the protagonist. It is a time for her to retake the test, observed by the fresh blossoms and the returning geese, which are symbolic of her own journey to a new home. The imagery of melting snow and budding flowers signifies a bright, unclaimed future that lies ahead. This concluding section serves to elaborate on forthcoming events, enhance the narrative's visual richness, and captivate the audience. It ultimately reveals the girl's resilient spirit, showing that, much like a flower struggling to root itself, she will find a new season in which to continue and flourish.
1610	10478	4	2	I believe the author included that paragraph because it represents a significant tradition or a token of good fortune, making its presence in the story very important. Furthermore, it seems intended to convey a specific meaning, suggesting that she will only attempt the test again in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus beginning to bud, which frames it as a pivotal, symbolic moment.
1611	10479	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph serves to articulate Saeng's profound longing for her homeland while simultaneously demonstrating her burgeoning resilience. Her difficulty in directly mentioning her home, evident in her stumbling speech, underscores the deep emotional pain associated with it. Furthermore, her purchase of a fake hibiscus plant, which she explicitly distinguishes from a ""real one,"" connects symbolically to her failed driving test; both represent painful failures and reminders of her displacement. However, the budding flower ultimately becomes a symbol of hope, leading to her vow to retake the test. This final promise signifies her emotional growth and determination to overcome adversity, illustrating that the challenges she faces will ultimately fortify her spirit."
1612	10480	4	2	The author suggests that once Saeng's immediate trial is over and she finds herself with nothing left to observe, she will enter a period of personal growth and development.
1613	10481	4	2	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to highlight the protagonist's failure on her driving test. The inclusion of extensive natural details serves to emphasize the character's deep, reflective connection to the natural world, which forms a central theme of the narrative.
1614	10482	4	2	The author likely includes this paragraph to convey to the reader that with the eventual return of beauty and vitality, the protagonist will find the strength to attempt adapting to her new circumstances once more.
1615	10483	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to evoke a sense of renewal and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus acts as a poignant reminder of her homeland, providing her with strength and continuity. She draws a parallel to the migrating geese, recognizing that familiarity is often cultivated through quiet, seasonal repetition. Just as the hibiscus lies dormant in winter, coinciding with Saeng's failure on her driving test, the paragraph foreshadows a fresh start for her in the spring, when the hibiscus will thrive and the geese return, symbolizing a cyclical and hopeful new chapter."
1616	10484	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in order to underscore her resolute determination. For instance, when Saeng informs her mother of her failure, her mother recognizes the difficulty of the situation. The ensuing silence prompts the mother's realization that admonishing her daughter about the plant was inappropriate. Saeng appears to draw a parallel between herself and the resilient plant, reasoning that if it can endure the winter and continue to grow, then she too can persevere and ultimately pass the test. This thematic parallel provides the most plausible explanation for the author's chosen conclusion.
1617	10485	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's newfound hope and determination. The author holds the hibiscus in high esteem, as evidenced by the mother's statement, ""But it’s strong enough to make it through winter."" Saeng aspires to confront hardships with the same fortitude as the hibiscus. Her declaration, ""Then I will take the test again,"" is a direct manifestation of this renewed resolve, solidifying the paragraph's role in concluding her character arc."
1618	10486	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the entire narrative progression logically culminates in this moment. Without this concluding resolution, the story would lack a definitive point and feel incomplete. The paragraph serves as the necessary capstone, providing a sense of closure and fulfilling the thematic promises established earlier in the text, thereby giving the narrative its ultimate meaning.
1619	10487	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's impending adaptation to her new environment. The hibiscus, a plant native to warm climates, is contrasted with the winter-hardy variety that survives in colder conditions. This plant serves as a symbol for Saeng herself, who cherished her life in Vietnam but struggles to adjust to the United States. The resilient hibiscus, which adapts magnificently to the cold, provides a model for her own adjustment. Furthermore, the return of the geese signals a new beginning, inspiring her to give the driving test another chance, just as the geese give the area another seasonal chance. This symbolic convergence justifies the author's concluding choice.
1620	10488	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it describes the snow melting and the return of greenery, symbolizing a theme of rebirth. This natural renewal serves as a simile for the protagonist's refreshed motivation to attempt the test again. The imagery effectively illustrates the character's profound connection to nature and the significant influence this exposure has exerted on him over time, culminating in this moment of personal resolve.
1621	10489	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to maintain the consistently sweet tone and beautiful imagery established throughout the narrative. The final line, in which Saeng vows to retake the test upon the hibiscus's budding in spring, provides a powerfully beautiful and hopeful resolution, perfectly encapsulating the story's uplifting spirit.
1622	10490	4	2	The author's choice for the final sentence signifies that the characters anticipate a different reaction to the same circumstances with the coming spring. Having now experienced the season, they possess the knowledge and preparedness to face it anew, suggesting a cycle of growth and adaptation.
1623	10491	4	2	The concluding line is used to signify Saeng's resolve to seize a second chance at passing her test. The hibiscus plant serves as a potent symbol of this renewal, as plants perpetually return and bud again. This ending is effective as it presents the plant as a contemporary source of inspiration, a focal point for aspiration, and perhaps even a medium for non-verbal communication between Saeng and her mother.
1624	10492	4	2	"In ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes with that particular paragraph because it represents Saeng's growing acclimatization to her new country. The final vow illustrates her commitment to adapting and embracing new beginnings, which is the central reason for the paragraph's placement at the story's end."
1625	10493	4	2	The hibiscus flowers provide significant comfort to Saeng, as they vividly remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of the plant and the arrival of spring collectively symbolize new life and fresh starts. Saeng views the coming spring as an opportunity for her own new beginning, a time to improve and pass her test. Ultimately, even if she were to fail again, the blossomed flowers would remain as a source of solace and reassurance.
1626	10494	4	2	The author concludes by drawing a parallel between herself and the flowers. She has adapted to her environment in a manner similar to a flower's growth. Having failed her test, she resolves to emulate the cyclical nature of a flower's life, which dies and then returns, by making another attempt to pass the examination.
1627	10495	4	2	The author uses the concluding paragraph to illustrate a connection between the seasonal absence of hibiscus in winter and her own failure. Just as the hibiscus returns in the spring, she intends to retake the test at that time, aiming for a successful outcome.
1628	10496	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph for two primary reasons. Firstly, the flower serves as a metaphor for her own state; it is not currently in bloom, but when the snow melts and it blossoms, she too will endeavor to flourish by passing her test. Secondly, the plant reminds her of her home, and because her mother valued it enough to purchase it, they are both motivated to nurture it carefully.
1629	10497	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho concludes with Saeng vowing to retake and pass her driver's test in the spring, paralleling the return of geese and the rebudding of plants. This final paragraph signifies Saeng's resolve to begin anew. After failing her test and visiting a greenhouse where she misses Vietnam, Saeng purchases a hibiscus, a symbol of her memories. The plant, currently blossomed, will rebud in the spring, growing stronger—a process that mirrors Saeng overcoming her sadness and homesickness to build better memories and become more resilient. Similarly, the geese flying south for shelter will return in spring to start over, just as Saeng plans to do by passing her test to feel more accepted in her new home. Thus, Ho ends the story to signify the character's commitment to starting over and rebuilding positive memories."
1630	10498	4	2	"The final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" was included to demonstrate the protagonist's initial disappointment over failing her test and sensing her mother's disapproval. However, as she observes the hibiscus and the geese in flight, she realizes she still has an opportunity to succeed. This instills a determination to retake the test, which she resolves to do the following year, firmly believing she will pass it."
1631	10499	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey the girl's feelings. She believes that with the arrival of spring, she will have the opportunity to perform better than she did previously.
1632	10500	4	2	This signifies her desire for a fresh start. The girl finds comfort in this cyclical pattern, which is her established method for coping with distress. This is the fundamental meaning conveyed by both the story and its concluding phase.
1633	10501	4	2	By concluding with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, the author communicates themes of perseverance and the importance of familial support. The final line, praising the beauty of the hibiscus, underscores that resilience is bolstered by the affirming presence of one's family and surroundings.
1634	10502	4	2	In my view, the author uses the concluding paragraph to illustrate the character's profound appreciation for nature. Her decision to wait for spring before retaking the test demonstrates that she draws strength and inspiration from the natural world's beauty and cyclical renewal.
1635	10503	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's vow to signify the hibiscus's role not as a mere good luck charm, but as a symbol of restored order and confidence. Its return in spring signifies an impending positive shift, providing the character with the hope and self-belief necessary to ultimately succeed in her endeavors.
1636	10504	4	2	"The author's conclusion serves the theme of overcoming adversity. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's perseverance, and the final paragraph provides resolution to the established conflict. The observation that the plant is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here... that is what matters"" directly links the hibiscus's resilience to the protagonist's own. This symbolism is ultimately integrated with narrative closure through Saeng's decision to wait until spring to retake the test, thereby completing the thematic arc."
1637	10505	4	2	Saeng's statement indicates her intent to retake the test when the opportunity arises. The author concludes the narrative in this manner to create anticipation regarding the outcome of her next attempt. This technique also underscores the theme of persistence; just as the flower endures the winter, Saeng resolves to endure her academic challenge. The author further suggests that circumstances evolve with the seasons. Initially disheartened by her failure, Saeng draws confidence from witnessing the plant's survival through harsh conditions. Moreover, she cherishes the hibiscus because its budding represents a hopeful future and commemorates the quality time she shared with her mother, for whom the plant holds significance.
1638	10506	4	2	Saeng discusses her academic responsibilities in parallel with her gardening duties. She consistently draws a connection between the two, acknowledging her need to study while the garden develops. She expresses a desire to tend to the flowers but recognizes that when spring arrives, her focus will necessarily shift away from the garden as she prepares to take her test, marking a transition in her priorities.
1639	10507	4	2	The author concluded the story in this manner to illustrate Saeng's resilience and determination to accomplish her objective. The intention is for the reader to comprehend Saeng's profound sadness and her desire to overcome her homesickness. A parallel is drawn between Saeng and the hibiscus plant, highlighting qualities of delicacy and beauty. Saeng's declaration that she will retake her test when the hibiscus buds suggests a synchronous development, as if she is evolving in tandem with the plant itself.
1640	10508	4	2	"The author concluded the story with this paragraph to demonstrate the universal capacity for enduring and overcoming difficult periods. It functions as a final, uplifting message for the reader. The statement, ""when they come back... I will take that test again,"" reveals that Saeng identifies with the returning geese and the budding hibiscus. She perceives her test as a personal ""winter"" and understands that when she is prepared, she will succeed. The hibiscus's budding symbolizes her readiness. Although she currently faces hardship, she will persevere and try again. This concluding section synthesizes the symbolic purpose of the hibiscus; without it, readers might misinterpret its role as merely a link to Saeng's past. Ultimately, this affirmative paragraph was included to convey that recovery from adversity is achievable for all."
1641	10509	4	2	One interpretation is that she can only retake the test in the spring. This is also because her environment during that season is more calming. When she was disappointed and upset about failing her driving test, the relaxed surroundings provided her with a sense of ease.
1642	10510	4	2	The author concludes the story this way to underscore the hibiscus's profound significance to Saeng. She drew a parallel between her test and the plant, resolving to retake the exam when the hibiscus buds again. The hibiscus represents her good luck and is central to her world. Without it, her focus remained solely on her failure, as seen when she answered her mother's questions. To change her life, she purchased the plant, deciding that its spring blossoming would symbolize the start of her new life and her renewed attempt to pass the test.
1643	10511	4	2	The author's conclusion suggests that unpredictable events can occur within the narrative. Saeng purchased a winter hibiscus, which provoked her mother's anger due to the unnecessary expense of buying a full plant instead of cultivating a cheaper one. However, when Saeng began to cry in response to her mother's disbelief, her mother relented and forgave her. This sequence of events effectively illustrates that outcomes are not always foreseeable.
1644	10512	4	2	The author likely ends the story with that paragraph to convey that one must not remain fixed after a failure. Although Saeng did not pass her driving test, she plans to try again in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus plant's budding phase. She interprets the plant's renewal as an auspicious sign foretelling her own future success on the examination.
1645	10513	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to illustrate her parallel growth with the hibiscus plant and her resolve to retake—and pass—her test. The plant serves as a symbol of hope for Saeng, vividly reminding her of her cherished homeland. As the hibiscus begins to bud and blossom, so too will Saeng, ultimately achieving her goal of obtaining a driver's license.
1646	10514	4	2	The passage suggests that the sum is intended because it references the spring, a time of renewal marked by melting snow, the sun's action, returning geese, hunting season, and budding hibiscus. The speaker's declaration to retake the test is therefore linked to this seasonal cycle of new beginnings, with the spring sun serving as the catalyst for this planned action.
1647	10515	4	2	"The author utilizes the concluding paragraph to convey Saeng's state of peace and acceptance regarding her life in the United States. The budding hibiscus plant serves as a poignant reminder of her native country, while her resolve to ""take this test again"" represents a personal vow to persevere once she feels more at home. Through this, Saeng demonstrates an acceptance of her new circumstances, understanding that she can honor her past while building a future, finding comfort in familiar symbols like the hibiscus within her new environment."
1648	10517	4	2	The author's decision to conclude with this paragraph serves a strategic narrative purpose. It creates a sense of cyclical renewal, suggesting that as nature revives in the spring, so too will Saeng recommit to her goals. This open-ended resolution generates suspense and invites speculation about Saeng's future, potentially setting the stage for a sequel that explores the next chapter of her life. By leaving the reader in a state of anticipation, the author effectively ensures the story's impact lingers beyond the final sentence.
1649	10518	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's resolve to overcome obstacles and adapt. The hibiscus symbolizes her newfound hope and determination to succeed in the United States, as its intense, visceral recognition connects her past in Vietnam with her future. This botanical link provides immense inspiration, with the blossoming flower representing an impending new beginning. The final lines confirm that Saeng has discovered a stable, helpful element in her new world, signaling her eventual success through this symbolic anchor.
1650	10519	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to illustrate that despite the hardship of leaving her home, Saeng can forge a good life with new beginnings. The winter symbolizes past difficulties, while the spring represents an optimistic future. Finding a hibiscus, a semblance of her old home, helps her reconcile her loss. Her realization that the once-strange has become familiar shows her acceptance, and her vow to retake the test when familiar things return demonstrates her growing strength to accomplish good things in her new home."
1651	10520	4	2	The author concludes the story with this statement to convey the themes of resilience and the possibility of new beginnings. The protagonist, having failed her driving test despite diligent effort, draws a parallel with the plant that will bloom again in spring, recognizing that one can always alter aspects of life that are unsatisfactory. I strongly concur with this perspective, as the absence of second chances would be detrimental; since all people err, the opportunity for self-improvement is a universal and essential right. This belief in redemption is the foundational reason for the author's concluding message.
1652	10521	4	2	The story concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's belief that the budding of her new hibiscus in spring will bring the fortune required to pass her driving test. This ending is effective because the hibiscus, previously absent from her life, now symbolizes a connection to her heritage, her capacity to surmount challenges, and a source of solace following disappointment. Saeng feels this symbolic link will ultimately contribute to her success on the next attempt.
1653	10522	4	2	The author likely concluded the story with this paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's character development. Initially, Saeng is portrayed as disheartened after failing her test, but the final passage reveals her overcoming this discouragement. Her journey mirrors that of the migrating geese, which feel strange moving yet return annually, and the flower that must adapt to its environment. Saeng recognizes that, like the returning geese and the budding flower, she must persevere and try again later, demonstrating her adaptation to new surroundings and her resilient spirit.
1654	10523	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author employs the concluding paragraph to underscore Saeng's resolve to both pass her driving test and assimilate into her new environment. The word ""vowed"" imparts a positive connotation of commitment. A preceding line notes Saeng's reluctant realization that formerly strange elements had become familiar, indicating her ongoing adaptation. The final paragraph thus serves to signify that, while progress has been made, she simply requires more time to fully adjust and succeed."
1655	10524	4	2	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng pledges not to fail the test again. Her purchase of the flowers represents a desire to maintain a connection to her past and homeland. Her vow to retake the test ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,"" signifies her decision to move forward and actively acclimate to her new home, using the seasonal renewal as a catalyst for her own new beginning."
1656	10525	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph to synthesize the narrative's central themes and illustrate Saeng's readiness for the future. The act of pressing the flower signifies a resolution regarding its symbolic importance, which mirrors the protagonist's fluctuating emotions. Her vow to retake the test demonstrates a determined acceptance of what lies ahead, coupled with an open-mindedness that will allow her to appreciate her personal growth. Consequently, the author utilizes this final passage to provide thematic closure while simultaneously introducing an element of mystery regarding subsequent events.
1657	10526	4	2	The author concludes the narrative at this point because the current winter signifies the absence of flowers, yet the period of planting coincided with the protagonist's maturation. As indicated in the text, elements she once found strange are now becoming familiar, and she is acclimating to her new circumstances. This progression demonstrates that through continued learning and experience, she will be adequately prepared for the test awaiting her the following spring.
1658	10527	4	2	The author employs this paragraph as the story's conclusion to signify that the protagonist will face the test of life once more when the same season arrives in the subsequent year, thereby completing the narrative's cyclical structure.
1659	10528	4	2	"A story's conclusion is instrumental in defining its ultimate meaning, serving as the final point of closure that often remains with the reader. In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with a paragraph that fosters encouragement. This is achieved by stating Saeng's intention to retake her test when the hibiscus blooms again, illustrating her persistent drive. This inspirational ending effectively recapitulates the story's core meaning; despite repeated disappointments concerning the flower, her mother, and her homeland, Saeng is ultimately encouraged to persevere. The chosen ending was therefore profoundly meaningful and successfully conveyed the author's central message."
1660	10529	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist experiences distress after moving away from her homeland, finding the new culture, customs, and food to be unfamiliar and difficult to adapt to. The author's concluding statement serves to demonstrate her unwavering determination to achieve her goal. It reveals her resolve to retake the test, anticipating that with time, her circumstances and perspective will have evolved. While the story is deeply emotional and conveys significant sorrow, this resolution ultimately portrays her overcoming these challenges."
1661	10530	4	2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about geese to illustrate Saeng's resolve to overcome her challenges. After experiencing disappointment from failing a test, she sought solace in memories of her homeland. The purchase of a hibiscus, a flower prevalent in her past, provided her with comfort and a sense of affection. This plant also symbolized her capacity to surmount obstacles. While planting the hibiscus and observing the geese in flight, Saeng recognized the necessity of persevering and making another attempt.
1662	10531	4	2	The author's intent is to convey the character's decision to cultivate a new garden independently. Her previous gardening endeavor was not entirely successful, as indicated by the textual evidence stating she required her mother's assistance. This suggests a transition towards self-reliance in her new undertaking.
1663	10532	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph at the moment Saeng comprehends that while she can mourn her former home, she must also adapt to her new environment. Saeng is overwhelmed by profound loss, which brings tears to her eyes. However, she begins to recognize that not everything is different; some elements remain familiar, such as the distinct call of Canada geese flying overhead. This realization that certain constants persist grants Saeng the fortitude to proceed with building her life in a new country.
1664	10533	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph because it provides an effective resolution to the narrative. The conclusion discusses Saeng's plan to return after the snow melts and to retake the examination, thereby leaving the reader with a clear sense of her future intentions and determination.
1665	10534	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to demonstrate Saeng's enduring hope for success and adaptation in her new country. Initially, she suffered from intense homesickness, missing her grandmother and childhood mementos, a feeling poignantly captured when she is too emotional to speak about the hibiscus at home. Her attitude, however, shifts from despair to hope. Despite failing her driver's test, Saeng's silent vow to retake it in the spring, symbolized by the returning geese and the budding hibiscus, signifies a profound internal change and a resilient commitment to her new life.
1666	10537	4	2	The author posits that the paragraph was included to convey a message about seasonal renewal as a metaphor for personal opportunity. The melting snow signifies letting go of an initial failure, the returning geese represent a second chance, and the budding hibiscus symbolizes moving past a previous endeavor. This cyclical progression from winter to spring illustrates a path from setback to renewed effort and eventual progress.
1667	10538	4	2	The author likely concludes with this paragraph because the preceding conversation between the characters concerned the cold weather and the @CAPS1. The paragraph's reference to melting snow directly continues this thematic thread of discussing the weather or the @CAPS1, thereby providing a coherent and thematically consistent ending to the narrative.
1668	10539	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph demonstrates the protagonist's development in response to the story's events. Initially, the character fails her driving test and makes an extravagant purchase of a single plant, which astonishes her mother. Contrary to expectations of despondency, her connection to her grandmother and homeland fosters an unexpected optimism; she resolves to retake the test when the flower re-blooms. This final connection between the character and the plant effectively anthropomorphizes the hibiscus, concluding the character's arc of resilience.
1669	10540	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph to crystallize the story's central theme of perseverance in the face of adversity. As an immigrant, Saeng encounters numerous challenges in her new environment, both in her garden and in her personal life. Her declaration that she will retake the test in the spring, aligned with the natural cycles of snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding, serves as a powerful testament to her determination and her refusal to be defeated by the obstacles she confronts. This final statement perfectly encapsulates her resilient character.
1670	10541	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to highlight the protagonist's forward-looking perspective. Rather than dwelling on her present disappointments, she chooses to focus on future possibilities. This orientation allows her to release past failures and concentrate on improving her efforts when the next opportunity arises, thus concluding the narrative on a note of hopeful anticipation.
1671	10542	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with the image of a flock of Canada geese flying overhead, their faint honks clearly audible. This moment signifies that while the geese pass with their heads held high, Saeng's own head is bowed in her current disappointment. Her subsequent resolution to retake the test the following spring, when the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, symbolizes her intention to no longer dwell in sadness but to embrace her new home with gratitude and resilience over time. The hibiscus will serve as a fond memory of her past, not a source of sorrow, as she moves forward with renewed determination.
1672	10543	4	2	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph for two primary reasons. Firstly, it highlights Saeng's quiet act of acquiring a Winter Hibiscus following her failure to pass the driving test. Secondly, the paragraph establishes her resolve to attempt the test again, with the goal of achieving success and the independence that comes with driving. These narrative choices, while central to the conclusion, present motivations that are somewhat ambiguous and require interpretation to fully decipher the author's intended meaning.
1673	10544	4	2	The author's decision to conclude with this paragraph is likely intended to illustrate the sense of solitude Saeng experiences, which is poignantly mirrored by the lone geese flying overhead. This parallel emphasizes her internal state of isolation and longing, using the natural imagery to underscore her emotional landscape at the story's close.
1674	10545	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" is deliberately crafted to reinforce the story's central themes of resilience and adaptation. The hibiscus plant, described by Saeng's mother as not being the prettiest but strong enough to survive the winter, serves as a direct metaphor for Saeng herself. Her vow to retake the driving test in the spring is a declaration that she, too, possesses the strength to endure her current hardships. This is further supported by her growing familiarity with her new environment, indicating that while she deeply misses her homeland, she is gradually adjusting. The ending makes it evident that Saeng's subconscious is affirming her ability to persevere, with time being the essential element for her eventual triumph."
1675	10546	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng's declaration that she will retake the test in the spring is linked to her desire to walk home and see the hibiscus flower she discovered. This flower holds significance as it recalls a similar one from her childhood in her home country, connecting her past to her present. Her initial failure was a source of disappointment, compounded by the substantial financial cost of the test, which led to a moment of tension with her mother. However, after her mother offered sympathy, Saeng's distress transformed into a firm resolve. This newfound determination propels her decision to attempt the test again, demonstrating her commitment to overcoming this obstacle."
1676	10547	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes her narrative ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng contemplating the arrival of spring to imbue the character's future with a sense of hope. Throughout the story, Saeng is portrayed as despondent, frequently reminiscing about her past life in Vietnam. The sight of hibiscus and jasmine flowers causes her to break down in tears, with the jasmine's scent triggering a specific memory of her grandmother fixing her hair. Her profound sense of displacement is compounded by the failure of her driving test, a significant disappointment for any teenager. At this juncture, Saeng's situation appears bleak, as she is isolated from her familiar world, accompanied only by memories and a winter hibiscus that differs from the variety in her homeland. However, the final line marks a pivotal shift in her outlook, as she becomes hopeful for the future, anticipating the time ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."""
1677	10548	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" establishes a hopeful outlook for the protagonist, Saeng. After failing her test and experiencing profound sadness, a sequence of events ultimately lifts her spirits, culminating in the determined statement, ""Then I will take that test again."" This final sentence underscores Saeng's resilience. Though she was disheartened by leaving her home and by her initial failure, encountering a flower serves to restore her confidence. The narrative's tone is largely melancholic until this final paragraph, which functions as a light at the end of a tunnel. The author suggests that even during difficult and seemingly impossible times, something can appear to uplift one's mood, indicating that a positive aspect can be found within a negative situation if one seeks it out."
1678	10549	4	2	The phrase likely refers to the inherent difficulty of cultivating a garden during the winter or early spring, suggesting it represents a particular horticultural challenge. This interpretation posits that the text is alluding to the specific efforts required to make a garden thrive at that time of year. The underlying meaning thus centers on the struggle and perseverance needed to achieve growth under adverse seasonal conditions, which serves as the central point of the statement.
1679	10550	4	2	The author includes that sentence at the story's conclusion to reinforce the theme of courage that has been developed throughout the narrative. It serves as a definitive illustration of the character's emotional recovery and resilience. The declaration demonstrates her determination to return and attempt the test again, refusing to be discouraged by her initial failure. This final statement effectively encapsulates her courageous resolve to persevere.
1680	10551	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph can be attributed to several reasons, primarily its symbolism of a new beginning. For instance, the cyclical departure and return of the geese signifies the changing seasons. This natural cycle of change and renewal parallels the character's opportunity to retake the test, representing a chance to start over and a future opportunity for success. The conclusion thus uses seasonal transformation as a metaphor for personal renewal and a second chance.
1681	10552	4	2	It is believed that the action will result in favorable outcomes for them.
1682	10553	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the theme of perseverance. After failing her initial test, Saeng purchases a plant that evokes memories of her homeland. She plants it in the cold, hard ground, and in doing so, recognizes that the once-unfamiliar elements of her new life have become integrated into her daily existence. This realization fuels her decision to retake the test. Saeng understands that an initial failure does not preclude future success if one remains committed to a goal. She also comes to terms with her past, acknowledging that she can cherish her memories of home while still moving forward with her life. Ultimately, she learns that positive outcomes can emerge from difficult situations, as symbolized by the flower she bought after her failure. The concluding paragraph therefore serves as a perfect summary of the story's central message.
1683	10554	4	2	The author includes the excerpt at the end to imbue the hibiscus with profound symbolic meaning for Saeng. The flower represents her home, her past, and her sense of comfort. Saeng draws a parallel between the plant's ability to bloom and her own capacity to adapt and flourish in her new environment, which will empower her to retake the test. Furthermore, the hibiscus embodies hope; its survival through winter and subsequent blossoming in spring mirrors Saeng's own potential for resilience and renewal. The author employs this symbolism to create a tangible connection between Saeng's internal emotions and the observable, cyclical nature of the flowering plant.
1684	10555	4	2	The author concludes with this statement to draw a parallel between the migratory patterns of geese and Saeng's own situation. The geese depart south for the winter and return north in the spring; similarly, Saeng fails her test during the winter but resolves to retake it with the arrival of spring. Her discovery of a familiar plant signifies her intention to return, just as the geese are compelled to return when the season changes. Thus, both the geese and Saeng are driven by a cyclical purpose—to come back north or to retake the test. The author's final statement underscores that the geese's instinctual actions are a direct reflection of Saeng's determined resolve.
1685	10556	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underscore Saeng's determination not to surrender. Throughout the narrative, she experiences profound discouragement, stemming from her test failure and her longing for Vietnam. Numerous aspects of her and her mother's new life serve as poignant reminders of her homeland. A particularly emotional moment occurs when she closes her eyes, breathes deeply, and is almost able to feel the strands of her grandmother's hair, a powerful sensory memory. The author chose this ending to demonstrate the cumulative impact of these experiences on Saeng, solidifying her resolve to persevere despite her emotional turmoil.
1686	10557	4	2	The author's choice of conclusion is intended to evoke a sense of resolve. Saeng acquires the plant as a memento of her homeland and a source of solace. She perceives the plant's eventual blooming as symbolic of her own potential to flourish, thereby preparing her to face the test with renewed determination.
1687	10558	4	2	The author concludes the passage with a potent declaration: “When the geese come back… in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” This statement embodies themes of renewal and persistence. It can be argued that this was included because, upon recognizing the plant's cyclical resilience against harsh conditions, the protagonist internalized a similar capacity for endurance. She resolves to ready herself for a fresh start when the season turns. This parallels the plant's own hardiness; it does not perish but returns each year. By vowing to retake the test, the girl demonstrates a parallel persistence, aspiring to embody the flower's indomitable, renewing, and beautiful nature, traits that persist regardless of its environment.
1688	10559	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to communicate Saeng's refusal to surrender after an initial failure. Her motivation is to achieve success, thereby earning her mother's pride and proving her own commitment to making an effort. The narrative states Saeng will retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the melting snow, the geese's return, and the hibiscus's budding. The hibiscus was not merely a plot device but a pivotal element in Saeng's life, helping her accept change and understand that growth involves adapting to new circumstances. While her mother was disappointed, she likely comprehended the plant's comforting significance for her daughter. Saeng, facing the challenges of a new environment and having missed the test, must learn to adjust and adapt to her situation, a process mirrored by the plant's own development.
1689	10560	4	2	The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph to underscore that Saeng's failure is not terminal. The narrative indicates that she will have another opportunity to pass the test when that season returns. This interpretation is supported by the text's emphasis on the plant's cost, which exceeded that of all the vegetable seeds in the garden, highlighting its significant value to her and foreshadowing its role in her future resolve.
1690	10561	4	2	When the next planting season arrives, she will be prepared and intends to perform significantly better.
1691	10562	4	2	"The author's inclusion of these details serves to establish the winter setting, emphasizing the seasonal context in which the hibiscus blooms and the geese migrate due to the cold. This is directly connected to the story's title, ""The Winter Hibiscus,"" which inherently suggests a narrative focused on a flower that blossoms during winter, thereby justifying the author's descriptive choices."
1692	10563	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's resolution to retake her driver's test upon the spring blooming of her hibiscus. This ending creates a contemplative suspense, prompting the reader to consider the symbolic link between the plant's survival and Saeng's own determination. Ultimately, the author likely employed this technique to leave a lingering, thought-provoking impression regarding the character's future resolve."
1693	10564	4	2	"The concluding line signifies that Saeng derives fortitude from the hibiscus, which will empower her to pass the test upon her next attempt. Her personal growth will parallel the plant's development, preparing her for the challenge. As the text indicates, the plants, particularly the hibiscus, reconnect her to a childhood filled with love and support, from which she can draw strength. These recollections are bittersweet, involving a profound ""wave of loss,"" yet confronting this sadness ultimately contributes to her resilience. Furthermore, sensory experiences, such as the flower's texture, evoke distant memories that further solidify her resolve, ensuring she will not fail again."
1694	10565	4	2	The author chooses this concluding paragraph to signify that Saeng will attempt the test again in the spring, a season of renewal that follows the winter's departure, symbolizing a fresh start and renewed opportunity for the character.
1695	10566	4	2	The provided quote illustrates that Saeng is content with her return. Furthermore, she expresses a readiness to undertake the experience again if necessary, demonstrating her resilience and positive disposition.
1696	10567	4	2	"The author's decision to conclude the story in this manner is attributed to the cold external conditions. The author appears to convey that the protagonist composed the letter during cold weather and postponed the test until warmer conditions returned, as indicated by the statement: ""In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again."" This establishes a direct link between the protagonist's actions and the seasonal environment."
1697	10568	4	2	"The author includes Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring because she has sacrificed everything to come to a new country and cannot afford to fail. The hibiscus hedge, a tangible remnant of her former home alongside her mother, holds profound significance. The phrase ""when the hibiscus is budding"" symbolizes a new beginning, as the plant starts to grow leaves, paralleling Saeng's own process of growth and moving forward with her life in this new environment."
1698	10569	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate the potential for a more successful outcome upon a subsequent attempt, as the individual now possesses prior experience. Furthermore, a successful retry could lead to a profitable venture through sales, thereby establishing a sustainable activity for the foreseeable future. This ending effectively frames the initial effort as a learning experience with promising future prospects.
1699	10570	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" features Saeng's resolution to demonstrate her perseverance and determination. The symbolism of spring blossoms represents her commitment to enduring hardships, metaphorically depicted as winter. Similar to the hibiscus, which must adapt to a new environment, Saeng struggles to acclimate to a new country. The final paragraph resolves her internal conflict by affirming her intent to succeed in retaking the test, thereby illustrating her resilient character."
1700	10571	4	2	The concluding paragraph reveals Saeng's future actions and her stance on schooling. She postpones returning to school until the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds, showing a preference for gardening, which reminds her of her homeland. This connection is reinforced when she digs a hole to plant the winter hibiscus, an act of care for the garden that serves as a poignant link to her past and cultural identity.
1701	10572	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's internal vow to retake the examination in the spring, a time she associates with the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus. This inclusion serves to underscore the profound value Saeng places on nature and the specific plant. The text establishes that Saeng believes the hibiscus will aid her in passing the test, as illustrated by her earlier action of rubbing its leaves to overcome distress. Consequently, the author effectively conveys the central idea that the plant serves as a crucial support for Saeng in navigating obstacles.
1702	10573	4	2	At the story's conclusion, the character Saeng makes a vow to herself that she will take the driver's test the following year. One reason for this vow is to prove her capability to pass. Furthermore, the flower she purchased and planted, coupled with her memories of Vietnam, gave her the confidence she needed to pursue her goals.
1703	10574	4	2	The author incorporates this paragraph to employ sarcasm, signaling the near impossibility of Saeng retaking the test. The statement is not a genuine commitment but a sarcastic refusal, similar to saying one will do something only when a highly unlikely event occurs. This device is used to communicate that the probability of her attempting the test again is exceedingly low.
1704	10575	4	2	The author includes this paragraph to provide narrative closure while demonstrating that Saeng has not surrendered. The intention is to illustrate how the plant and the geese symbolize the continuation of Saeng's life in the United States. Just as the geese will return and the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will retake her driving test. Thus, the paragraph functions not merely as an ending, but as a new beginning for the natural elements and for Saeng herself.
1705	10576	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's resilience and determination. She resolves to retake the test when she feels more prepared and self-assured. This internal vow helps sustain her until she can drive, marking a personal timeline for adaptation: by spring, she will be accustomed to her new home and ready to succeed. The passage ultimately conveys that achievement requires patience and persistent effort.
1706	10577	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's emotional state following her unsuccessful driving test. Disheartened by the failure, she finds solace upon encountering the flowers, which prompt a realization that her relocation to America had caused her to neglect memories of her hometown. This reconnection with a natural element leads her to postpone retaking the test until spring, thereby choosing a deliberate pace over haste.
1707	10578	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's enduring hope for finding happiness and a sense of home. The hibiscus plant functions as a potent symbol of her origins and cherished memories associated with her grandmother. Its eventual budding promises to restore her feeling of being at home, which is the condition she sets for retaking her driving test. Furthermore, the paragraph underscores her gradual acclimatization to her new environment, as evidenced by her growing familiarity with the migratory geese. Through these elements, the narrator effectively conveys Saeng's ongoing assimilation and acceptance of her new circumstances.
1708	10579	4	2	"The author utilizes the final paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's resilience and refusal to surrender after failing her driving test. Her explicit statement, ""I will take the test again,"" confirms her determination to ultimately pass. The narrative establishes that she plans to wait for spring, a time of thaw and renewal, before making another attempt. This conclusion effectively circles back to the story's opening, which introduced the test, thereby framing the narrative with her initial failure and her subsequent resolve to try once more."
1709	10580	4	2	"In the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho employs the final paragraph to illuminate the hopeful prospects in Saeng's future. After the disappointment of failing her driver's test, this segment suggests an impending positive shift in her fortune. It implies her intent to retake and pass the examination, while also reflecting her determined character in overcoming obstacles, including her forced relocation to the United States. Her successful adaptation is highlighted by her realization that formerly strange elements have become familiar, solidifying the portrayal of Saeng as a resilient individual who perseveres."
1710	10581	4	2	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to encapsulate its central theme of a girl longing for her homeland. This concluding section suggests that the character will have adapted to her new country by the following year. It ultimately serves to highlight the girl's inner strength and her capacity to overcome profound challenges, which is the fundamental reason for the story's ending on this particular note.
1711	10582	4	2	The author conveys that the protagonist intends to repeat her gardening activities the following year, once the snow has melted, the geese have returned, and the weather is sufficiently warm for the hibiscus to bloom. This concluding sentiment illustrates that this cyclical, nurturing life is the one she has deliberately chosen, and she will persist in her horticultural pursuits with the arrival of the next spring.
1712	10584	4	2	Saeng concludes her story with that paragraph to signify her recent experiences and her belief in her capacity to endure them again. Should she face failure, such as on a future driving test, she knows she can rely on the plants to help her overcome adversity. Having passed the test this time, the unique plants serve as a testament to her inner strength, a quality she is now more aware of, and they provide comfort by reconnecting her with cherished childhood memories.
1713	10585	4	2	She holds a deep affection for her grandmother and cherishes the activities they share, such as gardening. Her mother, while caring, demonstrates her concern through a strict and demanding approach to parenting.
1714	10586	4	2	The author concludes the story in a manner that enlightens the reader. It demonstrates that regardless of what transpires, no matter how dire circumstances appear or how hopeless one feels, a path to improvement always exists. Saeng, despite failing her test, being in a new country, and having lost her grandmother, still resolved to try again. Much like waves persistently returning to reshape the shore, Saeng's willingness to persevere serves as an example for us all.
1715	10587	4	2	The author concluded the story with that paragraph to signify the end of one seasonal cycle and the imminent beginning of another, marking a transition in the narrative.
1716	10588	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's internal vow to retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus. This resolution signifies that the flower serves as a source of motivation and determination for her. The plant embodies a symbolic force that provides the necessary courage and will for her to succeed upon her next attempt. This element functions as a narrative device, indicating the character's future trajectory and reinforcing the idea that personal catalysts are essential for perseverance. The story thus concludes by affirming the power of symbolic objects in driving human resolve and action.
1717	10589	4	2	"Saeng's disappointment extends beyond failing her driver's test to encompass a profound homesickness for Vietnam. Her discovery and purchase of a winter hibiscus, or saebba, provides a tangible connection to her past. The story's conclusion merges these two distinct worlds of her experience. Her statement, ""when they come back,"" refers to the geese, which symbolize her evolving life in her new country. The hibiscus itself is a potent symbol of her past in Vietnam, evoking memories and serving as a piece of her homeland. Her decision to retake the test only when the hibiscus buds signifies that her readiness is tied to this connection; when her link to home strengthens and she finds stability within her new culture without losing her own, she will be prepared to try again."
1718	10590	4	2	The author's choice of this concluding paragraph effectively illustrates that Saeng is not a quitter. Her anticipation for the hibiscus's return is directly linked to her resolve. She is determined to retake the test once the plant blooms again, viewing this natural cycle as the right moment to demonstrate her capability, both to herself and to her mother. This ending solidifies the theme of perseverance, showing that Saeng's spirit remains unbroken and that she is merely awaiting a symbolic marker to renew her efforts with confirmed confidence.
1719	10591	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph to show Saeng's readiness to seek out new beginnings. The sight of the geese signals to her that with spring's arrival, she will be prepared to discover different flowers, much like those from her homeland. She reminisces about flowers growing from the ground in her native country and now hopes to see similar blossoms in the city, which she misses dearly. She personifies the flowers as friends and recalls specific species, such as the Madagascar periwinkle, growing wild in unexpected places. Ultimately, the paragraph signifies that Saeng is now open to actively searching for other familiar plants from her past, using them to reconnect with her heritage in her new environment.
1720	10592	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" employs the concluding paragraph to illustrate Saeng's character development. Initially dejected by her failure and struggling to adapt to life in a new country, Saeng finds solace in a winter hibiscus, a native flower of Vietnam. The mention of the budding hibiscus at the end symbolizes Saeng's changed attitude and her growing acceptance of her new surroundings. She now believes that, like the plant re-emerging after winter, she can return and pass her driver's test. Furthermore, her reference to the geese returning signifies her adaptation to the local fauna, marking a significant shift from her initial difficulty in embracing a new culture. This paragraph, therefore, serves to summarize the profound personal change and adaptation Saeng undergoes throughout the narrative."
1721	10593	4	2	The narrative concludes by establishing a thematic parallel between the end of winter and the arrival of spring, suggesting a cyclical return to beauty and renewal. This seasonal shift symbolizes a period of rejuvenation, mirroring the potential for positive change within the story's context. The author utilizes this natural transition to convey a sense of hope and the promise of a more favorable future, thereby providing a complete and resonant ending to the account.
1722	10594	4	2	The author concludes the story by depicting Saeng's internal vow to retake the test in the spring, a time marked by the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus. This decision is supported by her earlier realization that many things once considered strange had become familiar through the quiet repetition of the seasons. This progression suggests that, given time, she will become more accustomed to driving, which will enable her to pass the test upon her next attempt, thereby concluding her character's arc of gradual adaptation.
1723	10595	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph in ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves to integrate the theme of new beginnings. Saeng, a newcomer struggling with displacement and a failed driving test, finds symbolic resonance in a hibiscus plant. The narrative posits that the plant's ability to endure winter and bloom in spring inspires Saeng's own resolve for renewal. Her declaration to retake the test in spring aligns with the season's traditional symbolism of rebirth, as seen in the return of geese and blooming flowers. Ultimately, the conclusion effectively demonstrates how the hibiscus catalyzes Saeng's realization and thematically unifies the story around the concept of a fresh start."
1724	10596	4	2	The concluding paragraph underscores Saeng's profound desire to pass her driving test, a sentiment initially revealed by her emotional breakdown within the greenhouse. Upon arriving home with the plant, her distress is evident to her mother. However, the pivotal moment occurs when Saeng actively takes the shovel to plant the hibiscus herself. This physical act symbolizes her internal shift from despair to agency, culminating in the realization that she possesses the determination to attempt the test again, thus providing a complete arc for her emotional journey.
1725	10597	4	2	The author selects this concluding paragraph to establish a symbolic parallel. The budding of the hibiscus in spring signifies an imminent bloom, which corresponds to Saeng's own readiness to retake her test at that time.

Furthermore, seeking assistance or dedicating time to study from relevant materials can significantly improve one's chances, as thorough preparation facilitates easier achievement. This interpretation captures the fundamental meaning of the author's statement regarding resilience and repeated effort.
1736	10608	4	2	The author selected this concluding paragraph to signify the cyclical nature of time, wherein each year commences and concludes in a similar fashion, thereby framing the narrative within this perpetual rhythm.

The hibiscus, therefore, embodies the essential elements—hope, comfort, and belief—that Saeng requires to gather the strength necessary for her future attempt."
1741	10613	4	2	After failing her driving test, Saeng finds solace in the discovery of a hibiscus flower, which evokes cherished memories of her homeland due to its resemblance to the flora near her former residence.

This realization marks a pivotal moment for Saeng, and the conclusion powerfully illustrates her capacity for change."
1743	10615	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng develops a profound emotional connection to the memories evoked by the hibiscus.

1744	10616	4	2	As winter approaches, the geese migrate south and the trees shed their leaves. In this context, Saeng resolves to retake her test. The eventual return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus appear destined to restore her hope and confidence. The hibiscus is particularly significant, as it vividly reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother; its initial sight and touch moved her to tears. Its resurgence the following year will thus serve to rejuvenate her spirit entirely.

The hibiscus serves as a source of motivation for her, as it evokes powerful memories of her cherished homeland, functioning as a tangible memento of her origins.
1747	10619	4	2	The author draws a parallel between natural cycles and Saeng's personal journey: just as geese return when ready and a flower blooms in its own time, so too must Saeng be prepared for her test. This comparison highlights her need for time to develop, akin to the natural world. Ultimately, Saeng is symbolically united with both the geese and the hibiscus, as all require a period of readiness to fulfill their potential.
1748	10620	4	2	I believe the author chose this concluding sentence for its symbolic representation of the girl's perspective.

1751	10623	4	2	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng resolves to retake her failed driver's test during the spring season. This decision is motivated by the comfort she finds in the temperate spring weather, which evokes powerful memories of her homeland, to which she remains deeply connected. This theme of attachment to one's past home resonates personally, as I also recall various places I have lived and hold a particular fondness for one.

Her steadfast connection to her origins provides a sense of shared experience, making the feeling of missing an old home seem less isolating."
1752	10624	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story with this specific paragraph serves to underscore Saeng's resolve to begin anew and improve upon her previous attempt.

This concluding segment effectively encapsulates her commitment to a second chance, thereby providing a fitting end to the narrative that highlights her determination.
1753	10625	4	2	The author likely chose this conclusion to symbolize a new beginning. The arrival of spring traditionally represents a period of rebirth, where flora regrows, fauna reappears, and sunlight intensifies. This cyclical renewal is paralleled in Saeng's own life, offering her a fresh opportunity to succeed. Furthermore, given Saeng's appreciation for nature, its resurgence likely instills in her the hope and self-assurance needed to pass her driving examination, making the ending thematically coherent.
1754	10626	4	2	"The story's final paragraph reads: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion appears designed to illustrate Saeng's process of adaptation and her gradual acceptance of change. Earlier narrative elements, such as her breakdown in the greenhouse, depict her initial distress and difficulty with transition. In contrast, the final paragraph's optimistic imagery of blooming flowers and returning geese signals a shift in her perspective. Therefore, the author utilizes this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's movement toward acceptance and an optimistic outlook for the future."

1756	10628	4	2	The author concludes that she will retake the driver's test upon the return of the geese in the spring, believing she will be better prepared by then. She anticipates that the spring season will afford her more time for study and a greater ability to concentrate, as her mind will be less preoccupied with thoughts of home. Her previous failure left her feeling she had disappointed her mother, a sentiment captured by her action of staring at a hibiscus out of shame, unable to meet her mother's gaze. Her ultimate goal for the upcoming attempt is to succeed and thereby bring her mother happiness.
1757	10629	4	2	The author selected this paragraph for its symbolic meaning, which connects the melting snow and the returning geese to a specific flower that was central to her test.
1758	10630	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph serves to communicate a message of perseverance.

The line, ""Slowly fading into the distance,"" suggests an acceptance of the past and a resolve to continue striving toward one's goals. Furthermore, the narrative implies that during difficult times, one can rely on the support of friends and family. Finally, the phrase ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season"" indicates that establishing a consistent routine was the key to her eventual success, reinforcing the central idea of persistent effort."
1759	10631	4	2	The author concludes with this sentence to establish a parallel between the perennial nature of flowers and her own repeated attempts to pass the test. This final thought illustrates her commitment to trying again with each passing season, much like the geese that return every year. This persistence demonstrates that she has not given up and will continue her efforts annually. The paragraph also reveals the girl's determined character and suggests that she will persevere until she succeeds. Ultimately, this concluding section encapsulates the story's overarching theme and provides a resonant emotional tone for the entire narrative.

1761	10633	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to provide a hopeful resolution, illustrating the protagonist's resilience in deciding to retake the examination. This decision is motivated by her desire to avoid disappointing her mother and to ultimately bring her happiness, demonstrating a commitment to persevere and seize a second opportunity.
1762	10634	4	2	The author employs this concluding statement to signify the character's readiness to embrace a new spring in her adopted country, having found solace in the hibiscus. She perceives her initial failure to adapt as a test, believing she faltered by needing comfort from native flora. However, she is confident that with each seasonal cycle, her cultural assimilation will deepen, and she will ultimately succeed. Her declaration to retake the test upon the snow's melting, the geese's return, and the hibiscus's budding reflects how these natural signs help her accept the passage of time and new beginnings.
1763	10635	4	2	Saeng came to understand the transient and ever-changing nature of the world around her, a cycle over which she held no authority. Adapting to life in a new country presented significant difficulties, requiring her to acclimate to unfamiliar foods, sounds, and sights. Failing her driver's test was a particularly challenging setback, compounded by the struggle of navigating an unknown language and environment. Recognizing that her surroundings were irrevocably different, she knew that personal change and increased determination were essential to achieving her goals.
1764	10636	4	2	The author chose this concluding paragraph to unequivocally demonstrate the protagonist's refusal to surrender. Throughout the story, she grappled with moments of potential defeat, yet memories of her homeland provided crucial comfort during these low points. The final paragraph definitively confirms her resolve to continue striving forward.
1765	10637	4	2	I believe the author ended the story this way because the flowers were beautiful and brought her good fortune, as she had not noticed them the first time she attempted the test.
1766	10638	4	2	"It appears the speaker was experiencing significant hardship, feeling as if they were being tested, or perhaps had been left by a loved one, as suggested by the phrase ""when they come back."" The assertion ""I will take the test again"" further supports the interpretation that the individual felt subjected to a trial, reinforcing this central idea of personal struggle and resilience."
1767	10639	4	2	The author's conclusion demonstrates the protagonist's persistent discomfort, as exemplified by her breakdown in the flower shop. This incident illustrates that while certain reminders of home exist, they are not equivalent to being there, underscoring the necessity of acclimating to a new environment. The ending ultimately suggests that, given sufficient time to adjust, she believes she will eventually succeed in her new circumstances.
1768	10640	4	2	"The author employs this particular conclusion to generate a cliffhanger, thereby sustaining reader engagement. The statement, ""I will take that test again,"" prompts the audience to question whether Saeng will pass on her next attempt and to ponder the symbolic nature of ""the test"" itself, ensuring a lingering curiosity about the character's future."
1769	10641	4	2	The author likely concludes with this paragraph to convey Saeng's desire for the snow to remain, thereby preventing the geese's return and symbolizing a resistance to change. Furthermore, its purpose is to provide the reader with direct insight into Saeng's internal thoughts, clarifying her emotional state and perspective at the story's end.
1770	10642	4	2	The author chose this concluding quote to highlight how the plant instilled a new sense of determination in Saeng. After initially reacting with distress and tearing the plant apart, she recognized its resilience in budding against the odds. This observation inspired her own resolve to overcome adversity, leading to her decision to retake the test she had previously failed.
